63,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 02:21PM ET</span>",Lockheed Martin profit rises 22% on higher F-35 deliveries,"By Divya R and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) said on Tuesday it was working to establish alternate supply sources for F-35 parts in the United States after the Pentagon decided last week to remove Turkey from the fighter jet program.
On a post-earnings call, Lockheed's chief executive officer said the company would be able to remove Turkey from its manufacturing supply chain by March 2020.
""We've been working to wind down the Turkish industry involvement and so we have a timeline that we're working towards ... it's out through March of 2020 that we think it will all be resolved,"" CEO Marillyn Hewson said.
The Pentagon pulled off Turkey from the F-35 program on security concerns after its decision to go ahead with purchase of a Russian missile defense system.
Turkey had been a part of the manufacturing process for the advanced F-35 fighter jets, supplying hundreds of items including parts for cockpit display systems and landing gear. 
The country has said it plans to buy a total of 100 aircraft over the years, but following President Donald Trump's sanctions, Turkey will not be able to buy the jets. Hewson said several other countries such as Poland have expressed interest to become an alternative buyer.
Lockheed, which on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit beat and raised its full-year forecast, said it was on track to deliver 131 F-35 jets in 2019. The stealth F-35 fighter jet is Lockheed's biggest growth driver and accounts for about a third of the company's total revenue.
Lockheed expects its full-year profit to range between $20.85 and $21.15 per share and raised sales estimates to a range of $58.25 billion to $59.75 billion.
The outlook does not include potential impact from the change in the supply chain for the F-35.
In the second quarter, total sales grew 8% to $14.43 billion, above analysts' expectation of $14.21 billion.
Lockheed's missiles and fire control unit, which makes missile defenses like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), was one of its best-performing units where sales grew 15.6% to $2.41 billion during the quarter.
Sales from its aeronautics business, its biggest, rose 4.3% to $5.55 billion, powered by higher F-35 jets production.
The company delivered 29 F-35 combat aircrafts in the quarter, compared with 25 a year ago.
The Bethesda, Maryland-based company's net earnings rose 22% to $1.42 billion, or $5 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, beating Wall Street expectation of $4.77, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 02:18PM ET</span>",Harley-Davidson cuts 2019 shipments forecast after sales slump,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) on Tuesday reported stronger sales in China and other Asian markets and said U.S. sales should improve in the second half of the year, positive news that offset a cut to its full-year motorcycle forecast and sent shares up 5.3 percent.
""There's a general sense of relief that the company's earnings are expected to hold up fairly well despite lower motorcycle sales volume and operating margin guidance,"" said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA.
Harley's challenges in the United States, which accounts for more than half of the company's sales, are well documented - core customers are growing older and outreach efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results.
In a reflection of the demographic headwind, the heavyweight motorcycle maker's stock price has declined by 46% in the past five years. In comparison, the S&P 500 has gained 50%.
To offset weak demand at home, Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich is trying to make deeper inroads into some of the fastest growing two-wheeler markets in Asia through lightweight motorcycles. The push is part of a strategy to get half of the company's revenue from overseas by 2027.
The latest results show those efforts are bearing fruit.
While retail motorcycle sales were down in the developed markets, they were up in emerging markets on the back of a double-digit growth in China and ASEAN markets.
Levatich credited the performance to the company's decision to set up a plant in Thailand to serve the Southeast Asian market as well as China. The decision had drawn flak from both U.S. President Donald Trump as well as Harley's labor unions. 
The move, however, has allowed the American icon to circumvent the region's tariff barriers and price its bikes more competitively, resulting in a 77% jump in sales in Southeast Asia during the June quarter. 
In the United States, sales fell again. But in a silver lining for the company, sales in the age group of 18-34 year-olds were up 2.7 percentage points.
Harley has been aggressively wooing the next generation of riders to turn around its fortunes. Its first electric motorcycle, LiveWire, scheduled to go on sale in September, is targeted at younger people who don't prefer big motorcycles.
U.S. sales are forecast to be down in the second half of the year. The pace of decline, however, is expected to moderate.
The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company now expects to ship about 212,000 to 217,000 bikes in 2019, 5,000 units fewer than projected earlier. 
The estimate of operating margin as a percent of motorcycle revenue for 2019 has also been revised down by 2 percentage points.
""We expected 2019 to be a difficult year and it is unfolding as such, especially in our developed international markets,"" Chief Financial Officer John Olin told analysts on an earnings call.
Adding to the company's troubles is Trump's trade war. In retaliation for the tariffs the White House placed on imported steel and aluminum, the European Union increased import duties on U.S.-manufactured Harley bikes to 31% from 6% last June.
To mitigate the EU tariffs, Harley will begin shipping bikes from its Thailand facility. However, a delay in regulatory approval from the trading bloc means the benefits of lower tariffs would not reflect in earnings before the second quarter of 2020.

In the June quarter, Harley's profits declined to $1.23 per share from $1.45 per share a year ago.

The company also decided to eliminate the COO position, which was held by Eugene Castagna. The layoffs include vice presidents, directors and managers at its headquarters in Union, New Jersey, and at other select locations, the company said. 
The job cuts follow long-time Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares' departure in May, following pressure from activist investors, who cited the retailer's inability to grow sales and margins. 
The company said the workforce reduction is expected to generate net savings of $18.9 million for the rest of fiscal 2019, but will lead to a restructuring charge of about $12 million related to severence and other costs.

Shares of the company were down nearly 1% at $9.27 in mid-day trading.

SNC said on Monday it would not bid for any fixed-price contracts, calling it the ""root cause of the company's performance issues.""
While analysts broadly agree that SNC's decisions to move away from fixed price contracts is a step in the right direction, several questioned the lack of clarity related to the plan.
""Changes to operational disclosures, impairment charges and lack of clarity on the extent of problems within the resources segment have contributed toward the stock price decline,"" said Nauman Satti, an analyst at Laurentian Bank Securities.
In the first major restructuring under interim Chief Executive Officer Ian Edwards, the company said it would split into two reporting units - one focused on growth areas and the other housing its underperforming resources and infrastructure construction businesses.
The Canadian company also said it would explore options, including a sale of its resources unit, and warned on profit for the third time this year, citing higher project costs.
""Incoming CEO Ian Edwards faces the daunting task of righting the SNC ship at a time when legal uncertainty prevails, political posturing is still hurting the business, project execution risks remain high and employee morale is anything but,"" Raymond James analyst Frederic Bastien said.
SNC has been facing a trial in Canada over fraud and corruption charges. The company's unsuccessful attempts to reach a settlement led to a political scandal engulfing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
SNC's shares, which have halved this year, were down 9.5% at C$21.54.
AltaCorp Capital analysts expect stable and more predictable earnings from exiting fixed price contracts to likely only begin to materialize in 2020 and beyond."

BALPA says that BA should share more of its profits with its pilots, and on Tuesday the High Court found that the union had issued its ballot correctly and therefore the result could stand.
British Airways said it would take the case to the Court of Appeal and that BALPA had said they would not schedule any strike action until it was heard. A source said that the appeal was expected to be heard at the end of this week or early next week.
""We are very disappointed with today's decision,"" the airline said in a statement. ""We will continue to pursue every avenue to protect the holidays of thousands of our customers this summer. Our proposed pay offer of 11.5% over three years is fair."""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said on Tuesday he would seek to protect  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) assets in the country if the United States does not renew a license allowing the company to operate despite sanctions on the OPEC nation's oil sector.
The Trump administration slapped sanctions on state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] in January as part of a bid to cut off cash flow to socialist President Nicolas Maduro and pressure him to leave power. A license allowing Chevron to keep operating its four joint ventures with PDVSA expires on July 27.
Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate.
In a decree published by his office, he said a possible decision not to extend the license ""constitutes an event of force majeure"" that could nonetheless ""allow the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro to take control of or expropriate the company's assets.""
Once the sanctions are lifted, an event that presumably would not happen unless Maduro left power, ""we will adopt all the measures that will allow Chevron Corporation and its affiliates in Venezuela to restart activities,"" the decree said.
Guaido has been recognized as the rightful leader by most Western countries including the United States, but he would have no ability to enforce the decree while Maduro remains in power.
The move comes as industry observers have speculated that Maduro could transfer control of Chevron's assets, which include the Petropiar joint venture and crude upgrader in the extra-heavy Orinoco oil belt, to state-owned companies from Russia or China, which have continued to recognize Maduro.
Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's oil or information ministries immediately responded to a request for comment. In a statement, Chevron declined to comment and said it was focused on ensuring its employees' safety and ""to conduct business in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.""
Venezuelan authorities have not commented directly on what they would do if Chevron's license is not extended. But in April, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza praised Russia's presence in the Orinoco belt and said that ""companies that leave the oil belt will be substituted by companies of equal quality from Venezuela's allies.""
Earlier this month, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a possible renewal of the license was ""under discussion.""
Chevron's minority stakes in the Petropiar and Petroindependencia joint ventures in the Orinoco belt, as well as the Petroboscan and Petroindependiente joint ventures in western Venezuela, yielded net crude production of 44,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) for the company in 2018.
Venezuela produced 734,000 bpd in June, according to OPEC secondary sources, down from an average of 1.4 million bpd in 2018."

(Reuters) - United Technologies (N:UTX) on Tuesday raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts, aided by an increase in demand for its aircraft maintenance parts and services as airlines grapple with overworked planes due to the grounding of Boeing's MAX jets.
Shares of UTC, which makes the Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and is on track to spin off its Otis elevator and Carrier air conditioner units, rose as much as 2.7% in morning trade.
UTC is among the first aero parts supplier to signal gains from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) groundings, which has otherwise rattled the aerospace sector as more than 300 737 MAX passenger planes have been taken out of service, leaving several airlines to deal with thousands of flight cancellations and reschedules.
""There is impetuous on the airlines and the (maintenance and repair) shops to ensure that the existing fleet is in a ready to fly state,"" UTC Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri told Reuters, talking about the MAX grounding.
""In that environment, the (repair) shops and the airlines are ensuring that they have the parts supply available and that is definitely helping (UTC).""
UTC said sales in its Collins aerospace unit, which makes engine components, landing gear, wheels and brakes, and interior and exterior aircraft lighting, surged about 66% percent to $6.58 billion in the second quarter.
The unit is UTC's biggest and is also benefiting from the acquisition of aero parts maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL).
Johri added that growth in the unit will slow in the second half compared with the first, as stocking of spare parts by airlines and shops eases with the possibility of MAX returning to the sky.
UTC said it expects its acquisition of Rockwell to add an extra $150 million sales and 15 cents per share to its profit in 2019.
That helped the company raise its current-year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $7.90 to $8.05, from $7.80 to $8.00.
UTC now expects full-year adjusted sales to rise between 4% and 5%, up from 3% and 5% forecast previously.
""The guide was tweaked up more than we had been expecting,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note.
UTC reported earnings per share of $2.20 for the quarter ended June 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.05, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

The company's net sales rose 17.5% to $19.63 billion, above Wall Street expectation of $19.55 billion.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 11:16AM ET</span>","Coca-Cola raises 2019 forecast on coffee, zero sugar soda boost","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) beat second-quarter earnings expectations and raised its organic revenue forecast for the full year thanks to higher sales of its zero-sugar sodas, soft drinks with new flavors and ready-to-drink coffees. 
Shares in the Atlanta-based company rose nearly 6% in morning trading to hit $54.1, a record high.
The world's biggest beverage makers, Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo (O:PEP), have been responding to changing consumer tastes by moving beyond traditional sodas and offering drinks that are lower in sugar or come in new flavors and in ready-to go packages.
""Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for no sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the a smaller packages for less sugar,"" Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts. 
PepsiCo's results also beat analysts' estimates earlier this month, boosted by demand for smaller packages of its traditional sodas.
""The small packages are definitely a trend going forward... it's a good thing when the category is strong, when there are innovations across all parties,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.
As part of his plan to create a ""total beverage company"", Quincey has been looking beyond soda and last year clinched a deal to buy Britain-based Costa Coffee for $5 billion.
The company is now betting on its coffee innovations, express vending machines, beans and machines for food service customers to grow sales. 
It recently rolled out ready-to-drink Costa Coffee in three varieties and Coke coffee, a beverage that blends coffee and its trademark soda, in several markets.
Quincey said almost 25% of the company's revenue is now from new or reformulated products, up from 15% two years ago.
Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of double-digit volume growth, helped by smaller packaging and new flavors, the company said. 
It now expects organic revenues to grow 5% in the whole of 2019, up from its previous projection of an increase of about 4%.
In the second quarter, a 4% volume growth in traditional Coca-Cola and its zero-sugar version helped net revenue rise 6.1% to $10 billion, a touch above analysts' estimates. 
Organic revenue, a keenly watched metric that gives sales growth excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, rose 6%.
Excluding one-time items, Coca Cola earned 63 cents per share, 2 cents above Wall Street's estimates, according IBES data from Refinitiv.
Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said the combination of global reach and a willingness to back new products were the key to the company's success.
""With market share improving again today, Coca-Cola's still got plenty of fizz,"" Hyett said.

The European STOXX 600 benchmark rose over 1%, helped by a 6% surge in automakers and growing certainties of policy easing from the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.20% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.31%.
The dollar hit a two-week high against a basket of world currencies, on the heels of a congressional deal to extend the U.S. debt limit for two years, easing fears of a government default.
""The budget deal is also a minor worry that's been pushed aside for a while,"" said Tuz.
But the British pound slid after Brexit advocate Johnson won the Conservative Party leadership race and will replace Theresa May as the country's prime minister.
With Johnson at the helm, credit ratings agency Moody's and investment Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) both warned the risk of a no-deal Brexit was now higher.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Power traders tackle renewables puzzle in Danish 'Silicon Valley',"By Nina Chestney and Susanna Twidale
AARHUS, Denmark (Reuters) - Far from the sprawling financial hubs of London or Frankfurt, high-tech traders in the Danish university city of Aarhus are driving rapid change in European power markets, easing the shift to renewables with technology that also carries some risks.
The red-brick buildings, pavement cafes and streets full of cyclists in the coastal city on the Jutland peninsula belie the sophisticated computer-driven trade in electricity and gas across Europe taking place inside some 10 firms based here.
But the wind turbines filling fields nearby flag the origins of a future-focused business. Leading global wind turbine manufacturers Vestas (CO:VWS) and Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) have roots in Denmark, which now covers around 30 percent of its energy needs with renewables.
The rapid diversification brought by renewables, coupled with growing competition and digitalization in traditional European power and gas, has lowered margins, shortened contracts and brought an explosion of data for traders to consider.
Algorithms can examine live data about the output of wind turbines or solar panels, changeable weather patterns, demand and fuel price data much faster, more accurately and at a lower cost than a human trader.
A Dane called Henrik Lind spotted an opportunity in Aarhus, where Vestas is based, and set up Danske Commodities in 2004. It and other firms established since - some by former Danske Commodities employees - now use algorithms and artificial intelligence to reap rewards from real-time fluctuations in supply and demand.
""A knowledge industry has been created here of power, gas, renewables, Big Data, artificial intelligence - a combination of the traditional markets and the Silicon Valley tech,"" said Jesper Johanson, chief executive and co-founder of InCommodities, one of four Aarhus-based firms Reuters spoke to.
Energy companies and banks have their own trading desks experimenting with automation and utility companies are also dipping their toes into the business, but some say that with customers to satisfy, the stakes are much higher if they get it wrong.
In an ideal world, the technology helps energy producers to sell their output at the best price, utilities to keep their costs and supplies steady and bankers and brokers to make money with trades that smooth over sharp changes in supply or demand.
Balancing those interests and ensuring transparency and predictability is a challenge, however, and market experts expect regulation to evolve as it has for financial markets as power trading develops.
DATA IS GOLD
Specialist firms are already growing fast as the shift away from fossil fuels introduces a raft of new variables.
""I consider InCommodities just as much an IT company as a commodity trader,"" said Johanson, one of four founders of a two-year-old company which now employs 35 people trading short-term power and gas in ten different European markets. All four founders have previously worked at Danske Commodities.
InCommodities' earnings before tax jumped 529% last year to 7.9 million euros ($8.9 million) and it plans to expand into UK gas next year, emissions markets and, potentially, liquefied natural gas in future.
Danske Commodities was bought by Norwegian oil and gas major Equinor (OL:EQNR) last year: its 50 dedicated energy traders are now doing more than 3,750 trades a day; 24 hours a day; 7 days a week and across 38 power markets.
InCommodities and Danske Commodities both trade on their own account and the latter also buys and sells on behalf of clients, which may be power companies or renewable energy producers.
Danske Commodities' earnings before interest and tax rose by 28 percent last year to 72 million euros.
""We treat data as gold. We believe in automation. AI and algorithms are important to be able to leverage the trend of digitalization and develop a competitive edge in these power markets,"" said Andreas Schwartz Knudsen, the company's head of commercial business development.
Leading European power exchange EPEX SPOT said automatic trading began on its platform in 2012 and by last year accounted for around a third of record intraday and day-ahead volumes of 567 terawatt hours (TWh).
Six senior company officials from Danish-based companies involved in the trade interviewed by Reuters all saw European power trading becoming so complex that only computer modeling, coupled with human traders, could tackle it.
Investment in automation technology can cost from 100,000 euros to several millions but the most successful has a payback of between one and two years, according to Philippe Vie, group leader of energy, utilities and chemicals at business consultancy Capgemini.
Even so, some people are cautious.
Swedish power company Vattenfall's (VATN.UL) CEO Magnus Hall said the company did trade automatically, but ""under great surveillance"".
""If it goes wrong it can go severely wrong,"" he said by telephone. ""Some others do it more frequently but we think there is a need for more safety and security work.""
FAIR MARKET
Market players in Aarhus see themselves as a force for good in a market much more unpredictable than it was in the pre-1990s era of state monopolies dealing with fossil-fuel based regional supply and relatively steady demand.
""The transition towards a higher share of renewable production increases market volatility,"" said Sebastian Lund, managing partner of Aarhus-based Nordic Energy House, founded by four former Danske Commodities employees and focused on British and Irish intraday power markets.
""Traders provide market liquidity and play a vital role in establishing dynamic and fair market prices,"" he said.
The increasing electrification of power to homes and businesses and the prospect of millions of electric vehicles supplied via a web of renewables and traditional suppliers gives a picture of the complexity ahead.
Algorithmic trading is at a relatively early stage compared with financial markets, but as it develops, it will become harder for the traders overseeing it to gauge the factors behind market moves.
Potential risks have already caught the attention of the body overseeing European energy market transparency regulation, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators.
""The two main examined risks are its potential use as a tool for the manipulation of the market and the possibility that algorithms themselves can in certain circumstances be susceptible to manipulation,"" it said.
Existing legislation already applied, it said, while adding: ""Provisions from the financial legislation and experience from financial market authorities could prove useful.""
REWARDS
The rewards for successful power trading are growing.
Volumes in Europe's main wholesale markets were broadly stable at 9,270 terrawatt hours (TWh) last year, but a rise in prices pushed its notional value up 25% to a 7-year high of 459 billion euros, research firm Prospex said. Total European gas trading value rose 35% last year to exceed one trillion euros for the first time.
""As technology and trading gets more sophisticated, the imperfections and the profits shrink,....but the companies playing the market the best, with the most sophisticated technology, are claiming larger profit share,"" said Antti Belt, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group.
Germany has the continent's most liquid power market and very short term trades are increasing, while German power producers and grid operators are concerned about the possibility of outages as the country shifts to renewables. 
(For a graphic on 'EPEX Spot German intra-day power trade volumes (MWh) https://tmsnrt.rs/32rmXS8
In-country and cross-border capacity is an issue, and with a population exceeding 83 million, Germany has around 14 times as many people to worry about than its northern neighbor Denmark.
There, so far, the experience has been good. 
""Denmark ... is now widely recognized as a global leader in integrating variable renewable energy while at the same time maintaining a highly reliable and secure electrical power grid,"" the International Energy Agency said.
At Danske Commodities, the average age of the 300 employees is 33 and 73% have a master's degree or higher - some even in cosmology and nanophysics. A talent pool for it and other firms lies on the doorstep.

Buyers in the market for the safest American assets aren’t exactly spoiled for choice. Bets on extensive Federal Reserve policy easing have made short-dated Treasuries more expensive, and perhaps painfully so if global risks disperse. If trade tensions subside and inflation data pick up, a couple of Fed interest-rate cuts may be sufficient to keep the U.S. economy humming along, and allow short-dated yields to rise.
That’s Jerome Schneider’s expectation. The head of Pacific Investment Management Co.’s short-term portfolios reckons disappointment can’t be too far off for traders who are backing close to a full percentage point of easing over the next 12 months. Against this backdrop, he sees a rare moment for assets that typically don’t do well when interest rates are falling: floating-rate notes.
“Quite honestly, very few people would suggest owning floating-rate notes in a declining rate environment, so this is a unique situation,” Schneider said.
Beaten Down
FRNs tend to be more popular when market yields climb, as their coupon adjusts in line with shifts in market-driven benchmarks such as the London interbank offered rate or Treasury bills. As a result, floaters tend to go down in price as overall market yields fall. For Pimco’s Schneider, high-quality notes at the short end of government and corporate debt markets have been beaten down to attractive levels, given what he sees as outsized expectations for Fed cuts.
His is a contrarian call, if recent activity in FRN exchange-traded funds is any guide. Trading volume spiked last week in the iShares Floating Rate Bond ETF -- the largest in this asset class -- suggesting a possible $200 million outflow. That move came as comments from two senior Fed officials spurred the market to price in a larger-than-usual interest-rate cut this month, though traders have since trimmed these positions. Schneider also oversees an actively managed ETF for Pimco that invests in short-maturity debt.
Easing Bets ‘Overdone’
Even with that slight retreat, current market pricing “seems a little bit overdone unless you get into the framework that we are truly headed for a recessionary environment,” said Schneider, noting that his firm puts odds of that at no more than 25% for the coming year.
A back-of-the-envelope comparison across high-quality, short-dated securities suggests that FRNs have trailed other notes this year, but not by much. Securities to be repaid in one to three years within a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of U.S. floating-rate debt have returned around 2.4% so far in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 2.7% on similar-maturity notes across a broader aggregate index of U.S. debt.
In the months to come, investors in the front end of the curve who are focused on capital preservation and income “might not necessarily be wanting to take as much interest-rate exposure as the market is suggesting,” Schneider said.
Still, investors looking for ways to push back on the market’s biggest doves are understandably wary of simply putting money on a reversal in short-dated rates. Setbacks in the Treasury market’s rally this year have met with fresh bursts of buying. That demand has pushed the benchmark two-year Treasury yield down to around 1.83%, almost 80 basis points lower than its January high and more than half a percentage point below the current fed funds rate.
Aside from FRNs, Schneider also favors some trades that are more widely embraced in the market, such as backing a yield steeper curve and favoring Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.
“Unless you believe the Fed is going to be unsuccessful -- wildly unsuccessful -- the focus will be on inflationary pressures gradually building over the next year,” he said."

LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's exemption from U.S. tariffs on imports of aluminum metal has boosted earnings at the Canadian operations of companies such as  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA), but has not cut costs for U.S. consumers.
In May, the United States lifted the Section 232 tariff of 10% imposed on Canadian imports of aluminum, a vital ingredient for auto makers, drinks firms and military equipment companies.
Aluminum costs for U.S. consumers are the benchmark price on the London Metal Exchange at around $1,810 a tonne plus the physical market premium, around $400 a tonne. 
Analysts say $192 of the premium is the tariff non-exempt producers pay.
""About 70% of U.S. aluminum demand can be met without paying import duties, yet 100% is pegged to the duty payable,"" said Citi analyst Oliver Nugent, adding the bank's estimate for U.S. aluminum demand this year was 5.57 million tonnes. 
""Canadian producers are making good margins on physical premiums. It's a negotiated market and up to consumers to push the premiums down. The surprising thing is that there isn't a two-tier structure. One tier for producers that pay duties and another for those that don't.""
Aluminum is used to make cans and extrusions, which are solid, semi-hollow and hollow shapes for home appliances and auto makers. Higher costs are either passed through the supply chain or absorbed by end consumers.
""It was disappointing that premiums didn't come down,"" a source at an aluminum consumer in the United States said.
""Problem is, if you try to differentiate on where your aluminum comes from, it creates winners and losers, we should just lose the tariffs.""
HIGHEST COST SUPPLIER
Rio Tinto and Alcoa are the two largest producers in Canada. Rio produced 1.884 million tonnes of aluminum in Canada last year, while Alcoa's North American operations have capacity to produce 1.674 million tonnes.
""Now that Canada is exempted from the 232 tariffs, we would anticipate an annual benefit of approximately $200 million from the 232 tariffs,"" said Alcoa chief financial officer William Oplinger at a briefing on July 17.
Rio Tinto declined to comment.
Other exempt countries include Argentina, Australia and Mexico which are estimated to account for nearly 10% of aluminum going to the United States.
Global aluminum demand is estimated at 67 million tonnes this year.
""The U.S. needs metal from Russia, the Middle East and India to satisfy local demand, the price is determined by the highest cost supplier,"" said CRU Group analyst Eoin Dinsmore.
Highest cost suppliers are those who have to pay the tariff.
Costs of exporting aluminum to the United States include insurance, shipping and trucking from port to manufacturing hubs in the Midwest.
""U.S. Midwest premiums will always be higher than Rotterdam port, there is a big chunk of inland freight. It costs about $75 (a tonne) to get it to the Midwest, the place it's priced for,"" CRU's Dinsmore said.
Physical market premiums in Europe at $95 a tonne are up nearly 60% since the start of January, due to aluminum tied up in financing deals and collateral for loans. 

Financing deals involve buying aluminum now and selling it forward for a higher price and profit after storage and interest costs have been deducted.

Genoa-based Carige, weakened by decades of mismanagement, risks collapse as a result of bad loans accumulated during Italy's recession that followed the global financial crisis a decade ago.
The bonds will be converted into shares worth the same amount, the fund's managing director Giuseppe Boccuzzi said, adding that the rescue plan envisaged a 700 million euro rights issue by Carige and a new convertible bond for 200 million euros.
Along with the fund, which is financed by Italian banks, the rights issue will be supported by cooperative lender Cassa Centrale Banca for around 70 million euros and Carige's current shareholders for an amount of up to 150 million euros.
The fund, known as FITD, will step in to subscribe to any part of the rights issue which Carige's shareholders do not take up, Boccuzzi said.
The remaining part of the right issue, around 160 million euros, will also be covered by FITD.
The convertible bond is expected to be sold to state-controlled banks Mediocredito Centrale and Credito Sportivo.
After at least two bailout plans fell through, the Europe Central Bank has given Carige until July 25 to come up with a solution. But source familiar with the situation said the deadline could be extended by a few days as the rescue plan was now being put in place."

The United States has put Huawei on an export blacklist citing national security issues, barring U.S. suppliers from selling to the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No.2 maker of smartphones, without special approval.
Huawei's revenue growth of 30% in the first half is a slowdown from 39% in first three months of 2019, but is up sharply from 2018, Bloomberg said.
Huawei has so far managed to boost revenue by aggressively securing contracts for fifth-generation networking equipment, Bloomberg said.
The company is said to have rewarded a number of employees for helping it accelerate revenue despite U.S. ban, Bloomberg added.
Huawei declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.
Huawei last month cut revenue expectations for the year, with its founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei saying the company had taken a harder-than-expected hit from the U.S. ban.

“I’d be very, very careful about growing further the balance sheet of central banks,’’ Sergio Ermotti said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy decision this week. “We are at a risk of creating an asset bubble.""
Europe needs to focus on political and economic reforms in order to spur growth, while the ECB “can only help in a transition, it’s not a solution to the problems,"" Ermotti said.
Subdued inflation expectations mean money markets are pricing in a 40% chance of a 10-basis-point rate cut at Thursday’s meeting. Investors also reckon the monetary authority is poised to restart its asset-purchase program this year -- intensifying the hunt for yield across risky assets.
Global central banks have been forced to turn tail after paring a decade of stimulus into their economies via quantitative easing. Net bond purchases by the Federal Reserve, ECB and Bank of Japan will swing back above zero from September, according to an analysis of their balance sheets by Bloomberg Economics.
For investors, the about-face has fueled an “everything rally” lifting both risk-on and risk-off assets. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 13% in the first half of the year, the best returns in the six-month period since 1998. Bonds have also soared on the intense thirst for yield spurred by dovish monetary bets and a growing pile of negative-yielding debt.
“Asset prices went up but it’s not really correlated with investor sentiment, which is in my point of view, of course, a very dangerous development,” said Ermotti.
For money managers with $489 billion between them, fears of monetary-policy impotence are now second only to tariff negotiations on their list of biggest tail risks, according to Bank of America’s July survey.
Many traders have remained on the sidelines of this year’s rebound in risk assets as they fear the U.S.-China trade spat could curb profits and stall global growth. Ermotti said client cash balances remain “very high.”
“What they say is that they’re willing to step into the market if there’s a major correction,” he said."

(Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog has fined  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Assurance Ltd (SLAL), part of insurer Phoenix Group (L:PHNX), 30.8 million pounds ($38 million) for failures related to the sale of annuities.
SLAL said some 80,000 clients were potentially sold the retirement product, which provides a regular income either for life or a set period, without financial advice.
SLAL failed to put in place adequate controls to monitor the quality of the calls between its call handlers and customers who selected the annuity, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. 
The FCA also said SLAL offered its front-line staff large financial incentives to sell the annuities, which encouraged them to place their own financial interests ahead of those of their customers. 
Call handlers could receive significant bonuses and rewards if they met or exceeded sales targets. During the period of misconduct, nearly 22% of call handlers received more than 100% of their basic salary in bonus payments, the FCA said. 
""This gave rise to a significant risk that SLAL's call handlers would fail to provide customers with the information they needed to choose an annuity appropriate to their circumstances,"" it added.
As part of the sales process for non-advised annuities, firms are required to explain to customers that they may get a better rate if they shop around on the open market.
The fine follows the launch of an FCA review into the sale of some annuities in 2016, after which its enforcement division began investigating firms to see if further action was needed.
Phoenix in a separate statement on Tuesday said the non-advised telephony practices were a ""known issue"" at the time of its deal with Standard Life, and that an agreement had been put in place to cover the costs of the enforcement action.
""While this is an historic issue and one we were aware of when we acquired Standard Life Assurance Limited, we would like to apologize to affected customers, all of whom we have already been in contact with as part of the program of customer redress,"" SLAL Chief Executive Susan McInnes said.
Phoenix said it has already dealt with more than 80% of the affected clients, with provisions made for redress. 
Shares in Phoenix were up 0.4% at 0954 GMT, broadly in line with the wider market. Shares in Standard Life Aberdeen were up 1.8%.

Revised guidelines posted on Tuesday by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) on its website require unlisted commercial banks to register their stakeholders with qualified custodians by end-June 2020, and all commercial banks to identify their shareholders by the end of 2021.
Before the new guidelines, which are binding, only banks listed in the main stock market and over-the-counter market needed to register their stakeholders with custodian institutions such as regional equity exchanges, according to the banking and insurance regulator.
""In recent years, some banks have seen chaotic issues on ownership due to weak corporate governance,"" the CBIRC said in a separate statement elaborating on the guidelines.
""Therefore, from the perspective of prudential supervision, CBIRC now requires unlisted commercial banks to register with legally established custodians as well.""
The banking regulator is stepping up a campaign of fighting financial risk following the state takeover in May of small-sized Baoshang Bank amid concerns about how its major shareholder had used bank funds.

The takeover was triggered by the improper and illegal use of significant bank funds by Tomorrow Holdings, which held 89% of Baoshang's shares, leading to a serious credit crisis at the bank, according to a previous statement of the central bank.

Jungheinrich (DE:JUNG_p) also lowered its outlook citing a downturn in the forklift truck sector.
It marked a fourth profit warning from Continental in 16 months, while French rival  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) on Tuesday stuck to its guidance.
""The main reason is the continued decline in the global production of passenger cars and light vehicles,"" Continental said, adding that car production will likely drop by 5% rather than remain flat.

Investing.com -- Who needs Andrea Orcel? 
Not  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), apparently. Spain’s largest bank, which is facing a 100 million euro/dollar lawsuit from the man who nearly became its chief executive last year, reported what it said was the best underlying quarterly result in eight years Tuesday.
Profit before one-off charges rose 5% to 2.1 billion euros ($2.35 billion). The net result was 1.4 billion euros, still around 7% higher than expectations.
In large part, that was due to the bank’s strategy of regional diversification paying off, with its units in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil all posting solid gains. Its European operations fared less well.
Santander's Spanish business has had to absorb some 600 million euros of charges in the first half related to the integration of Banco Popular, which it bought for a token sum in 2017 when regulators declared it “failing or likely to fail”. It’s also had to absorb a further 172 million euros in charges that were taken in the U.K. in respect of mis-sold payment protection insurance, the problem that never seems to go away for U.K. banks.
The solid earnings helped Santander, one of Europe’s largest bank by assets, to a healthier core tier one capital ratio of 11.3%. That measure of financial strength is up from a thin-looking 10.8% a year ago. 
The bank’s shares were up 2.7% by mid-morning in Madrid, one of the best-performing in the sector in Europe. But they’re still down 11% since April, when the European Central Bank re-adopted an easing bias that has put fresh pressure on its lending margins. And the shares will face a fresh test on Thursday when the ECB's policy-making governing council meets, amid expectations that it will cut its interest rates still further into negative territory.
The Spanish IBEX 35 index was up 0.7%, slightly ahead of the Stoxx 600 benchmark. Germany’s Dax led the way in Europe with a 1.2% gain as the euro’s decline against the dollar boosted the outlook for its battered exporters.
Orcel’s absence was arguably more felt at his old employer, UBS Group (SIX:UBSG). While the Swiss bank, too, managed to post decent group results, the investment bank that Orcel headed until his departure was unable to escape the negative trends already evidenced by its Wall Street rivals.
Adjusted profit before tax at UBS’s investment bank fell 23% from a year earlier, while the unit’s adjusted cost-income ratio, a measure of profitability, rose to 78.7%, some 20 points higher than rivals like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Equities trading revenue fell 9% and fixed income trading fell 7%."

The world’s largest social media site spent more than $4.1 million on lobbying, the most among big internet platforms, an increase from its previous high in the same period a year earlier.
Facebook disclosed lobbying around blockchain, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies. The company has been trying to win support for its Libra cryptocurrency, which drew skepticism from President Donald Trump, congressional Democrats and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and took a beating from lawmakers in both houses of Congress during two days of hearings last week.
The company was also in the final stages of settling an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into privacy violations in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The FTC has voted to fine the company $5 billion and is expected to announce the final details of the settlement within days.

Amazon spent more than $4 million on lobbying, topping a quarterly record in the first three months of the year, according to disclosures filed with Congress before Monday’s midnight deadline. Amazon, which runs a broad lobbying operation on a diverse range of issues, is closing in on a $10 billion cloud services contract that the Pentagon is poised to award to a single bidder next month.
Last week, Trump criticized Amazon as the perceived front-runner for the contract, saying companies such as  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). had complained that the process was unfair. Oracle has led a sustained lobbying campaign against the department’s plans to award the project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, to a single bidder.
In June, Amazon hired Jeff Miller, who bundled $1 million for Trump’s 2016 campaign, to lobby for its cloud computing division on issues related to “cyber security and technology services,” the filings show.
On July 18, Trump said he would look “very seriously” at the bid.
Oracle spent almost $1.7 million during the quarter, when it said it lobbied on issues including cloud and government IT procurement. It also lobbied the White House and the office of Vice President Mike Pence, the disclosures show. Microsoft Corp., which is the last remaining cloud provider that’s vying with Amazon for the contract, spent $2.7 million in the quarter, while International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp., which was eliminated as a competitor along with Oracle in April, spent $1.6 million, including lobbying on JEDI, the filings show.
Antitrust Scrutiny
The big internet companies are coming under growing antitrust pressure as the U.S. moves toward investigating whether their conduct squelches competition. The Justice Department and the FTC, which share antitrust jurisdiction, have carved up responsibility for oversight, with the FTC taking responsibility for Facebook and Amazon and the department’s antitrust division claiming Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Facebook and Amazon also underwent a series of hearings by a House committee conducting a broad antitrust investigation of technology companies, drawing ire from lawmakers during the latest hearing earlier this month.
Google ended its relationships with at least 17 lobbyists at six outside lobbying firms as global policy chief, Karan Bhatia, reorganizes the search engine’s approach. Google’s second-quarter spending dipped to $3.1 million, a decrease of about half what it spent in the same period a year earlier, the filings showed.
Among the top-level exits were Robert Raben of the Raben Group, who served as assistant attorney general of the Justice Department under former President Bill Clinton. It also ended its relationship with Tom Ingram, a former staff director of the Senate Republican Conference. Susan Molinari, the company’s longtime Washington director and a former Republican member of Congress, moved to an advisory position at the end of 2018.
Apple, which is grappling with stepped-up antitrust scrutiny as well as concerns about trade, disclosed spending of $1.8 million in the second quarter, up slightly from $1.7 million a year earlier.
Trade Lobbying
Trump’s threats to impose additional tariffs on imports from China and Mexico during the quarter, as well as a push to ratify a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, contributed to an increase in trade lobbying by some associations.
The Consumer Technology Association, whose members include Apple, Amazon and Facebook, reported spending almost $1.8 million during the second quarter -- up from almost $1.5 million a year earlier and from $1.4 million in the first quarter -- in part because of the tariff threats, spokeswoman Bronwyn Flores said.
The group reported lobbying Congress, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Commerce Department and the White House on matters including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the China tariffs and duties Trump imposed last year on imports of steel and aluminum.
“Over the past year, anti-tariff lobbying has become an increasing focus for our government affairs practice,” Michael Petricone, the group’s senior vice president for government and regulatory affairs, said in a statement. “In addition, this quarter CTA’s marketing and communications team executed a comprehensive media campaign to complement our efforts.”
The National Retail Federation, which is helping lead a coalition of trade groups opposed to Trump’s tariffs, showed almost almost $2 million in lobbying spending in the second quarter, up from $1.5 million in the first three months. Trade represented a significant portion of the increase besides health care, taxes and other issues, the group said.
Trump threatened tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports in May in response to what he said was Beijing reneging on agreed provisions in a sweeping trade deal the two nations are negotiating. The U.S. has already slapped duties on $250 billion in Chinese goods.
Trump put the new tariffs on hold after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June in Japan -- but not until after executives at hundreds of U.S. companies and trade groups testified at public hearings in Washington, most opposing the duties.
The president also threatened duties on imports from Mexico if that country didn’t do more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S., prompting an outcry from businesses and trade groups. Trump ultimately relented.
Proponents of ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to replace Nafta had hoped to have Congress approve the deal by its August recess, but discussions continue between the administration and congressional Democrats on concerns about provisions regarding pharmaceuticals, the environment, labor and overall enforcement of the pact."

The latest round of corporate results from Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG),  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier AMS (S:AMS) were positive, and the pan-European stocks benchmark STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.4% by 0824 GMT.
Auto stocks (SXAP) led gains among major sectors, up 3%, led by French supplier Faurecia's (PA:EPED) 7.6% jump after it maintained first-half profitability.
Car parts supplier Continental (DE:CONG) rose 4.8%, and lifted peer Hella (DE:HLE), despite issuing yet another warning.
""Conti has warned the market at several occasions in the past 12 months to the extent that expectations have been reset and most of the negatives were already baked in,"" says Stephane Ekolo, a strategist at Tradition in London.
German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) rose on news that China's Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd (BAIC) has bought a 5% stake in the company.
Auto-heavy German stocks (GDAXI) rose 0.8%, the most in Europe.
AMS (S:AMS) surged 8.7% to top the STOXX 600 after it forecast a strong third quarter. This lifted the tech index (SX8P), as other European chipmakers such as Infineon (DE:IFXGn), ASML (AS:ASML) and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) rose between 1.7% and 3%.
London's internationally-focused FTSE index (FTSE) took heart from another nudge lower in the pound ahead of the results of a Conservative leadership race which should see Boris Johnson anointed as the next prime minister.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is all but expected to cut rates by a quarter percentage point next week.
""At the moment there is an assumption that the central banks have got everybody's back and that is probably the major reason why the markets are quite bouncy at the moment or seem optimistic,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell in London.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The biggest shareholders in China's new Nasdaq-style STAR Market lost a combined $1 billion in the second day of trade on Tuesday, a day after the board's roaring debut created three new billionaires.
All but four companies of the 25 stocks listed on the market fell as investors took profits from opening day gains, erasing about 9% of the total market capitalization.
The new board roared out of the gates on Monday, with some shares surging as much as 520%. Frenzied buying more than doubled the board's total capitalization from 225 billion yuan to 529 billion by the end of the day.
While the size of the moves on day two paled in comparison, the declines were sharp enough for STAR's five biggest individual shareholders, including Monday's newly minted billionaires, to lose a combined 6.94 billion yuan on paper, according to Reuters calculations, though none lost claims to three-comma fortunes. 
Falls were led by China Railway Signal & Communication Corp (SS:688009), which sank 18.4%, the sharpest drop of the day.
But even after that drop, its shares were 71% higher than their initial public offer price.
Espressif Systems (Shanghai) Co. (SS:688018), a maker of wireless communication chips, led the day's gain, rising 14.2%. 
Yuan Yuwei, fund manager at Olympus Hedge Fund Investments Co, said that STAR Market valuations could remain frothy in the short term, but that he expected to see more declines over the next two to four weeks. 
""This is a serious bubble,"" he said. ""Valuations don't support fundamentals. Frothy valuations benefit big shareholders but retail investors will be burnt.""
Yuan said he hoped regulators would not overly interfere with trading and let market forces play their role. The board is operated by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Created to echo the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the STAR Market is intended to be both a driver of capital market reforms, including a U.S.-style IPO system, and a way to promote home-grown technology companies amid a damaging trade war with the United States.
To give market forces a greater role in setting prices, trading rules are looser than other Chinese markets. There are no daily price limits in the first five days of trade in new stocks. (For more details on the STAR Market see Factbox)
But some major investors have advised caution, especially in the early going.
""Although the STAR Market serves as strategic deployment for national financial reform, it will still experience rounds of market volatility and irrationality in the early stages,"" Lynda Zhou, China equities chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Fidelity International said in an emailed note.
""Even institutional investors need to remain calm and return to the fundamentals of investment,"" she said.
The market's debut, which saw stocks post average gains of 140%, exceeded even the expectations of veteran traders who are used to wild swings in the country's biggest stock markets.
Data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange showed margin loans turbocharged trading on Monday, with investors borrowing a total of 1.51 billion yuan ($219.38 million) to boost their buying power.
Margin lending data for Tuesday was not yet available.
There is no index at present for tracking the STAR Market, but the Shanghai Stock Exchange said it will launch one on the board's 11th trading day, following the debut of its 30th company.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  LG Display  Co Ltd (KS:034220) said it is looking to diversify its supplier base as it prepares for expanded trading curbs from Japan on some display-making materials which threaten to impact the broader tech industry.
Japan recently tightened curbs on exports of three chipmaking materials to South Korea, home to some of the world's largest chipmakers and well-known consumer electronics brands.
LG Display, which on Tuesday posted a bigger-than-expected second-quarter operating loss, said it had no significant concerns regarding Japan's export controls yet, but that it was hard to predict if and when the country would tighten curbs further.
LG Display, a supplier to Apple Inc (O:AAPL), is struggling with a global supply glut in liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) used in television sets, which has pushed down prices. Like many other global tech firms, it is also dealing with uncertainties caused by a long-running trade dispute between the United States and China.
Prices for LG Display's main product, 50-inch LCDs for TVs, slid as much as 7.5% in the quarter versus the same period last year, showed data from WitsView, part of research provider TrendForce.
Analysts said TV makers have stockpiled panels for fear of changes in import tariffs brought about by Sino-U.S. trade tension, creating rising inventories and growing supply glut in the display market.
""Set makers have been stocking up on panels in advance due to fears of a 25% tariff to be placed into effect in the third quarter, leading their panel inventories to pile up and resulting in conservative purchasing,"" said analyst Iris Hu at TrendForce.
Earlier on Tuesday, LG Display announced a $2.6 billion investment in its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels production line in South Korea.
For April-June, the company's operating loss widened to 369 billion won ($313.02 million) from 228 billion won a year earlier. That compared with analysts' forecast loss of 268 billion won, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Revenue fell 5% to 5.4 trillion won.
Japan has tightened curbs on exports of three chipmaking materials - fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays; photoresists, used to transfer circuit patterns on to semiconductor wafers; and hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas when making chips and screens.

South Korea sourced 94% of fluorinated polyimides, 92% of photoresists and about 44% of hydrogen fluoride from Japan in the first five months of this year, Korean industry data showed.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 03:44AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Some Australian BHP investors push for external candidate for CEO,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - At least three institutional investors in Australia are pushing for global miner BHP Group (AX:BHP) (L:BHPB) to consider external candidates to replace Andrew Mackenzie as new CEO, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The move highlights nascent investor pressure on the world's biggest miner to consider drastic changes in management to tackle challenges like cutting costs, an eventual return to lower iron ore prices, and rebuilding its reputation after a Brazil dam disaster.
""We are quite firmly of the view that it needs to be an external candidate ... We just don't see anybody internally that could make a material improvement to the status quo,"" one of the three institutional investor sources said.
""They pretty much miss every operational target they set, both in terms of costs and volumes, so it's very hard to take new project proposals at face value,"" the person said. The topic has gained traction in talks in Perth and Sydney in the past few weeks, two other investors said.
Refinitiv data showed the three investors together hold less than a combined 1% stake in BHP, however funds' positions are often held by different entities, so do not always show up in the data, one fund manager said. They all declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.
Mackenzie has been in the job for almost seven years. BHP hired its last external CEO in 1998 when it brought in Paul Anderson to reform the company, which he did by instigating its takeover of Anglo-South African Billiton.
It is not immediately clear whether top BHP investors also share the view that it needs substantial cultural change at the top management to give the miner the reform it needs. 
Investors in both BHP and Rio (L:RIO) have been showered with around $15 billion in buybacks and special dividends by each miner since the start of 2018, according to one estimate, largely as a result of asset sales and buoyant iron ore prices. 
""The company appears to have momentum on a one to two year view, and during the tenure of the current leadership team. It doesn't look to add up to a pressing need to replace in the short term,"" a top shareholder said. 
Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, a major shareholder in BHP Billiton, declined to comment. Activist shareholder Elliott Capital and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) also declined to comment. A BHP spokesman said it did not comment on speculation.
To be sure, BHP's performance has improved in the past 12 months on the back of a change in chairman and the tailwind from rising iron ore prices that may mean Mackenzie could extend his run. BHP shares are up by a quarter this year and closed up 0.6% on the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday.
But it flagged $1 billion in productivity losses for fiscal 2019 in its quarterly production report last week flowing from disruptions to operations across its commodities. 
""It is ... felt by investors that there is substantial cultural change that can be effected in order to achieve this and in time it will require a change of management to make this happen,"" said a second institutional investor source.
They pointed to Nev Power who was instrumental in turning  Fortescue Metals  (AX:FMG) into the world's fourth-largest - and lowest-cost - iron ore producer in under a decade, or Newcrest's (AX:NCM) Sandeep Biswas as possible candidates. 

""Nev is held in high regard for having achieved this through his career,"" the second source said.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 03:24AM ET</span>",Australian financial watchdog proposes tighter terms for executive pay,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prudential regulator said it intends to prescribe stricter terms on executive pay policies of the country's large banks, retirement funds and insurers as it seeks to enhance accountability in the financial sector.
In the aftermath of a public enquiry that last year blamed flawed incentives for widespread wrongdoing in the industry, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) wants to introduce new remuneration rules from 2021.
The regulator plans to impose a minimum seven-year deferral period for variable long-term bonuses, and to limit the importance of financial performance in defining variable pay to increase focus on risks related to culture and governance.
The reforms underline a push for more scrutiny - particularly of the Big Four banks, CBA, ANZ, NAB and Westpac - in the wake of the Royal Commission inquiry last year that found serious flaws in the management of compliance and risk.
""Remuneration design and implementation that does not properly consider the incentives it creates, including an over-emphasis on short-term financial performance, can drive poor customer and beneficiary outcomes and jeopardize financial soundness,"" APRA said in a statement on Tuesday.
APRA's announcement comes amidst criticism of Macquarie Group Ltd's move to shorten the time before deferred equity - worth about A$88 million - is awarded to previous Chief Executive Nicholas Moore to two years from seven.
That, proxy advisory firms said, increases Macquarie's already heavy focus on short-term performance to determine pay, and undermines the bank's policies regarding wrongdoing.
Those policies allow its board to scrap promised profit-share awards for senior employees who act dishonestly or ""in a way that contributed to a breach of a significant legal"" requirement.
Representatives of Macquarie, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) did not return requests for comment on APRA's proposed new rules.
CGI Glass Lewis said the ""elevation"" in importance of non-financial measures for executive remuneration was ""admirable"" in theory but difficult to execute effectively in practice. 
""Boards will need to demonstrate that such measures are challenging and that they can appropriately exercise discretion when determining outcomes,"" said Daniel Smith, head of the advisory firm's Australian operations.
APRA said minimum deferral periods for variable pay of up to seven years for senior executives in larger, more complex entities would ensure they have ""skin in the game"" for longer.
The regulator will conduct a three-month consultation period and expects to finalize its new policies by year-end.
Westpac Banking Corp said it will review the proposal and participate in the consultation process. 

A National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) spokeswoman said the bank had been expecting the regulator's new rules and would ""participate in the consultation process, to ensure we meet APRA's final requirements"".

IQE, which makes semiconductor wafers for chips used in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products among others, had warned last month that 2019 revenue would miss forecasts, blaming a bigger-than-expected hit on the industry's supply chain from U.S. restrictions on China's Huawei.
The United States restricted Huawei from buying U.S. goods in May, saying the firm's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The move ratcheted up trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.
IQE said on Tuesday global supply chains were being redeveloped across the globe as a fall out of the long-running trade war.
""This has had an impact on sales volumes for IQE's products, as global customers adjust to these new supply chain situations and IQE becomes qualified in these new supply chains,"" the company said. 
IQE, which has also been hit by a global slowdown in demand, said it had got orders from a major customer in Asia for new Asia-centric supply chains, for a type of transistor.
The company also won additional orders from a second Asian customer, specifically addressing increased demand from original equipment manufacturers, while its Singapore operation won a new Asian customer for transistors used in wireless devices and networks.

127,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",Scandal May Delay $10 Billion Share Sale in Japan,"(Bloomberg) -- The government’s plan to sell over $10 billion worth of shares in Japan Post Holdings Co. has been clouded by a scandal at its insurance unit.
The subsidiary, Japan Post Insurance Co., is voluntarily refraining from active product sales amid allegations of inappropriate sales practices. Both stocks have tumbled and concerns have grown over demand for the 1.06 billion shares Japan is looking to sell as early as September.
“The JPH sale may need to be delayed because of this scandal,” said Travis Lundy, a special-situations analyst who publishes on Smartkarma. “Given how the market has fallen, the high dividend is much less attractive.”
Japan Post’s privatization into three separate companies in 2015 was one of the country’s largest-ever initial public offerings. Some 80% of the shares were offered to retail investors, who turned out in droves, attracted by the stocks’ low prices and high payouts.
The sale of the third and final tranche of Japan Post Holdings shares would lower the government’s stake to a legally required minimum of around one-third. The holding company meanwhile is gradually selling down its stakes in Japan Post Insurance and Japan Post Bank Co.
Finance Minister Taro Aso said the timing of the share sale will be reviewed based on stock market trends and the state of the company’s business. A spokesperson for Japan Post Holdings declined to comment on the matter. Japan Post Insurance reiterated its apology for causing “disadvantages for customers” and that it is working to restore confidence.
Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the insurer’s shares on July 10 to neutral from overweight, saying that the process of rectifying sales activities may take at least one year. The shares have tumbled 35% from an April high.
Japan Post Holdings is down 19% since February. Some investors consider the shares more attractive following the decline. The stock is trading at 10 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with over 12 times for the benchmark Topix index. Its indicated dividend yield is 4.6% versus an average of 2.8% for Nikkei 225 stocks.
It’s also worth noting that when the government sold its second tranche of shares in 2017, Japan Post Holdings announced a buyback that supported the stock price.
“It’s a good enough time to buy the stock,” said Mitsushige Akino, executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. “There were various problems but it’s all out there now. And things are headed for improvement from here.”
The government’s sale will be lacking a major marketer following the omission of Nomura Holdings Inc. from the list of managers in the wake of its own problems. And it remains to be seen how big an impact the Japan Post Insurance scandal will have on demand for its parent’s shares.
“We’re not seeing a resolution for the insurance unit’s problem yet and it’s possible that this will take time,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, an analyst at Matsui Securities in Tokyo. “This will cool retail investors’ sentiment.”

The latest data compiled by Tokyo Shoko Research, a private firm, shows that average wages in the construction industry are now 16% higher than the salaries of banking and insurance staff, with the gulf widening as bankers’ pay falls.
The average wage at 102 listed Japanese banks and insurance firms has edged down by 1.4% since 2016, when the BOJ introduced negative rates, making the industry the worst performer among 10 surveyed in a report released Monday. Pay at all companies in the survey grew 2.9% over the same period.
The figures are another indication that pressure on bank profits partly attributable to the BOJ’s negative interest rate policy is forcing financial institutions to keep a tight lid on costs. Putting more pressure on bank profitability is one reason why the central bank is reluctant to add to its already massive easing program unless absolutely necessary.
Profits at all sizes of banks from credit unions to the megabanks fell in the fiscal year ended in March, according to a BOJ report last week. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to carefully monitor the side effects of easing on banks as he continues with stimulus to achieve a 2% inflation target.
While Kuroda has acknowledged that ultra-low rates are hurting profitability at commercial banks he has also flagged the impact of Japan’s aging and shrinking population and a decreasing number of regionally based companies on the profits of local banks in particular.
Average pay in the construction sector has increased 8.7% to 7.49 million yen ($69,461) since 2015 amid buoyant construction demand thanks to the Olympic games next year and rising number of foreign tourists, the report showed.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 09:40PM ET</span>","Trump is expected to drop in on White House tech meeting with Broadcom, Intel CEOs: sources","By Alexandra Alper and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump agreed at a meeting with the heads of top technology companies like Google on Monday to make ""timely"" decisions on requests by U.S. companies to sell to blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the White House said.
But even as the CEOs of the companies ""requested timely licensing decisions from the Department of Commerce,"" the White House said in a statement that the executives expressed ""strong support"" for national security restrictions on U.S. telecom equipment purchases and sales to Huawei. 
The meeting, previously reported by Reuters, was with the CEOs of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) ,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc , Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google.
The meeting comes at a time of lingering uncertainty over the future of U.S. companies' ties to Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker. It was placed on a U.S. blacklist in May, with the government citing national security concerns. 
U.S. companies were banned from selling most U.S. parts and components to Huawei without special licenses. But Trump said last month that sales could resume as he sought to restart trade talks with Beijing.
Clarity on what the new policy toward Huawei will be has been slow to emerge.
On Monday, executives expressed displeasure at Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross, who also attended the meeting, for not providing clear guidelines on policy toward sales to the Chinese company, according to a person briefed on the meeting. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were also at the meeting, the person said.
Among the attendees was Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra. In a statement, Micron confirmed he attended the meeting and said ""policies that ensure open and fair trade on a level playing field are essential to ongoing U.S. technology leadership as well as economic growth throughout the world."" Huawei is Micron's single largest customer and the company last month resumed shipments of some products to the Chinese firm. 
Ross has said licenses would be issued where there is no threat to national security. Reuters reported last week that the United States could approve licenses for companies to restart sales in a matter of weeks.
However, the Washington Post reported on Monday that Huawei secretly helped North Korea build and maintain its commercial wireless network.
That may bolster China hawks in the U.S. government who see Huawei as a real national security risk, over those who seek a more lenient policy to appease Beijing amid ongoing trade talks between the world's two biggest economies. 
The United States accuses Huawei of violating Iran sanctions and stealing American intellectual property, accusations Huawei denies. Washington has also lobbied allied governments to keep Huawei out of their 5G networks, arguing that the company's equipment could be used to spy for the Chinese government. 

The White House said unfair international trade practices and 5G technology were also discussed at the event on Monday.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 09:39PM ET</span>",FTC to announce $5 billion settlement with Facebook as early as this week: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is expected to announce a roughly $5 billion settlement with Facebook Inc as early as this week of its investigation into the social media company’s handling of user data, two sources briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The FTC, Justice Department and Facebook declined to comment. The FTC has been investigating allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Reuters and other outlets reported July 12 that the FTC had voted to approve the settlement but was awaiting the concurrence of the Justice Department.
The settlement is expected to include government restrictions and oversight on how Facebook treats user privacy. It would mark the largest civil penalty ever paid to the FTC.
Some in Congress have criticized the reported $5 billion penalty, noting Facebook in 2018 had $55.8 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in net income. Senator Marsha Blackburn said last week the fine should be ""$50 billion.""
While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies. Facebook is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.
The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.
But the company's core business has proven resilient, as Facebook blew past earnings estimates in the past two quarters. Facebook is set to report earnings on Wednesday."

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (Reuters) - Futurewei Technologies Inc, the U.S. research arm of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, began laying off workers on Monday, according to employees including one who spoke to Reuters as he left the company's Silicon Valley campus.
At least half a dozen staff with boxes were seen leaving the office before noon. The layoffs come about two months after the Trump administration put Huawei on a trade blacklist, making it illegal for its U.S. subsidiary to transfer sensitive technologies to its parent. The blacklist also restricts Huawei from purchasing products from U.S. technology companies.
One employee, who declined to give his name, told Reuters he had been laid off. Putting a bag full of personal belongings into his car, he said he had been told the official announcement would come on Tuesday.
Huawei declined to comment.
Another Huawei employee told Reuters by telephone last week that the layoff target was to remove 70% of the 850 Futurewei workers in the United States. That employee said a layoff list had been sent from Huawei's headquarters in China, and aimed to eliminate any open source projects, projects related to near-term Huawei products, and any research and development in critical technology. 
Futurewei was set up in part to work closely with U.S. universities and researchers.
Huawei is among the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers. The U.S. Commerce Department in May placed the firm on its “entity list"" of organizations that pose security risks. The Justice Department earlier filed charges against the firm alleging theft of trade secrets and other crimes.
Futurewei has offices in Silicon Valley and the greater Seattle, Chicago and Dallas areas. Futurewei has filed more than 2,100 patents in such areas as telecommunications, 5G cellular networks, and video and camera technologies, according to data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
A Futurewei employee not affected by the layoffs said work had come to a standstill since Huawei was blacklisted.

""On the 17th of May, Huawei asked everyone at Futurewei to upload everything to the Huawei cloud, right before the ban took effect,"" that employee said. ""After that basically Futurewei has stopped doing any work - almost stopped everything.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc (N:AN), the largest U.S. auto dealership chain, on Monday named a new chief executive four months after picking someone else for the position, while posting a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.
Cheryl Miller, who was AutoNation's chief financial officer, immediately replaces Carl Liebert, who will remain for 30 days to assist with the transition.
Liebert assumed the CEO position on March 11, a month after his hiring was announced from financial services company USAA, where he had been chief operating officer.
""We always that it would be a challenge for someone to get the auto retail business around their head and I think the conclusion was mutual that this was not the right fit,"" AutoNation Executive Chairman Mike Jackson said in a telephone interview.
Jackson added he was excited to announce Miller's promotion, citing her almost 20 years of experience with automotive retail. She had been CFO since 2014 and joined the company in 2009.
""I'm also am thrilled that for the first time in history we have a woman who is a CEO of a publicly traded auto retailer,"" he said.
AutoNation said Miller had led several strategic initiatives, including the building of the company's partnership with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo and helping AutoNation achieve investment-grade status.
AutoNation also said on Monday that its second-quarter earnings rose to $100.8 million, or $1.12 a share, from $97.6 million, or $1.07 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue was essentially flat at $5.34 billion.
The second quarter this year included a noncash franchise rights impairment charge of 8 cents a share.
Analysts were expecting $1.06 a share on revenue of $5.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
AutoNation's profits have been under pressure as U.S. new vehicle sales have weakened after a long bull run since the end of the financial crisis of 2008.
Same-store new vehicle gross profit per vehicle sold in the quarter was $1,764, up 10% compared to the year-ago period. Same-store used vehicle gross profit was relatively flat at $1,459 per vehicle. Same-store customer financial services gross profit rose 7% to an all-time high of $1,926 per vehicle.
Jim Bender was promoted to chief operating officer from executive vice president of sales, and chief accounting officer Christopher Cade was named interim CFO during the search for a permanent replacement, AutoNation said."

(Reuters) - Fitch Ratings and Moody's lowered their outlooks for  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to ""negative"" from ""stable"" on Monday, citing delays in its 737 MAX jets' return to service.
The revision, which comes on the heels of Boeing's nearly $5 billion charge related to the grounding, could potentially increase borrowing costs for the world's largest planemaker. 
Both the ratings agencies, however, retained their investment grade credit rating on Boeing debt, given the company's liquidity, financial flexibility and dominant position in the market. Fitch has an 'A'/'F1' rating on Boeing debt, while Moody's has an 'A2' rating. (https:// Boeing is facing one of the worst crises in its history as its fastest-selling jetliner has been grounded since March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed a total of 346 people. Fitch said https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/10083377 MAX will remain a concern for the aviation sector in 2020, and expects a lingering impact on Boeing's operating margin for several years after the jet returns to service.  The outlook revision was also based on the challenge of returning parked planes to service, delivering stored post-production aircraft and the financing needed to build up working capital, Fitch said. The outlook indicates the direction in which Fitch's rating is likely to move over a year or two. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. Moody's said the grounding of the company's 737 MAX aircraft will run longer than expected, which will compound its operational disruption, costs and the size of the investment in working capital. ""The negative outlook also contemplates the execution risk in returning the narrow-body franchise to normalcy following the grounding's end, which remains uncertain, and the timeframe for repaying the debt incurred to fund the grounding and restore confidence in the all-important MAX program, and in Boeing, more broadly,"" Moody's said. As of March 31, Boeing had total debt of $14.7 billion according to Refinitiv data, and Fitch said it estimated that consolidated debt for the company would rise by almost $10 billion to nearly $24 billion in 2019. ""The MAX situation also presents significant public relations challenges, and the impact on Boeing's reputation and brand will be a watch item for the next year or more,"" Fitch said. Fitch in April had warned that 2019 would be stressful for Boeing, expecting most credit metrics to deteriorate. On Monday, it flagged the risk of higher concessions to airlines, especially if the MAX grounding extends into the end-of-year holiday season. It said the MAX situation was largely a temporary issue of timing unless substantial orders were canceled. 
Shares of the planemaker closed down nearly 1% at $373.42.

After retooling, the new production line will later this year start partially assembling hybrid versions of the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle and the luxury Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring SUV.
It will also partially assemble the Police Interceptor SUV.
On Friday, Ford said it would lay off about 200 workers in September at a Canadian manufacturing plant in Oakville, Ontario, with more layoffs possible in January, because of slowing sales of the sedans that the plant manufactures.
Overall, U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to fall this year, although pickup trucks and SUVs remain more popular than traditional passenger cars.
Last week, Ford also kicked off talks on a new four-year contract with the United Auto Workers union, with job security, healthcare costs and the use of temporary workers expected to be major sticking points."

1. Welcome to Earnings Town
There’s no doubt this week is about anything but earnings, with the sheer amount of market-moving names enough to set the tone for any market day.
Ahead of trading tomorrow, there will be three Dow components weighing in.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is expected by analysts to post a profit of 62 cents per share on sales of about $9.8 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Analysts are looking for Travelers (NYSE:TRV) to report earnings of $2.29 per share, with revenue at about $7.4 billion. And United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is forecast to earn $2.05 per share, with revenue coming in around $19.5 billion.
Also issues numbers before the bell will be notable stocks like  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) and Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG).
After the bell, Visa (NYSE:V) rounds out the Dow members on the slate, with analysts predicting a profit of $1.32 a share on revenue of $5.7 billion.
Semiconductor stalwart Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) also reports after the bell. The consensus is for TI to report earnings of $1.22 per share and revenue of about $3.6 billion.
Numbers are also expected from Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which recently hit an all-time high.
2. Existing Home Sales Seen Edging Up
On the economic calendar, housing will garner the most attention.
The National Association of Realtors will issue its monthly measure of existing home sales at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that sales of existing homes in July ticked up to an annual rate of 5.35 million from 5.34 million in June, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last month saw a stronger-than-expected rise as the drop in benchmark bond rates pushed mortgage rates lower and boosted demand.
3. Oil Market Has One Eye of Inventories, One on Iran
The oil market is expected to see continued volatility this week as uncertainty about what action the U.K. will take, if any, over Iran seizing its tanker increased as the U.S. demurred on providing any direct support.
But fundamentals will still be closely watched.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its measure of U.S. crude stockpiles after the bell tomorrow, which is seen as a gauge for the official government data that comes out Wednesday.
The API saw a weekly drop of about 1.4 million barrels, compared to the Energy Information Administration’s measure of a drawdown of 3.1 million barrels last week."
141,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Equifax to pay up to $700 million in U.S. data breach settlement,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Credit-reporting company  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX) will pay up to $700 million to settle claims it broke the law during a massive 2017 data breach and to repay harmed consumers, in a landmark settlement that was nonetheless criticized by consumer advocates and some lawmakers who called for stricter regulation. 
While it was the largest-ever settlement for a data breach, they said the amount was still too small for the millions of Americans affected, and worried it could prove difficult for consumers to be repaid. The agreement also spurred multiple lawmakers to renew calls for legislation giving consumers more control over their personal information.
""This settlement is just a drop in the bucket of what Equifax’s disregard for privacy could cost American families,"" Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown said in a statement.
The settlement concludes multiple probes into Equifax by the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and nearly all state attorneys general. It also resolves pending class-action lawsuits against the company.
Shares in Equifax, which is one of three major credit reporting companies, closed up 0.4 percent at $137.84 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. 
Roughly 147 million people had information, including Social Security numbers and driver's license data, compromised by the breach. The hackers have never been identified.
While Equifax said on Monday it saw no evidence the stolen information had been used in identity thefts, regulators said the company failed to protect the data and misled consumers as to how secure it was. They ordered Equifax to set aside funds to repay consumers who spent time or money protecting themselves after the breach.
The company will establish a $300 million restitution fund which could climb to $425 million depending on how many people file claims. Only consumers who can show they suffered direct costs following the breach, either from identity theft or by purchasing credit-monitoring services, will be eligible for restitution, capped at $20,000 per person. 
Equifax Chief Executive Mark Begor told reporters Monday he expected that the initial amount, which will also cover the costs of a decade of free credit monitoring for affected consumers, would be sufficient. In an interview on Monday afternoon with CNBC, Begor said the fund could be operational by year's end. 
In addition, the company will pay a $175 million fine to the states and $100 million to the CFPB. 
Consumer advocates said the settlement was modest given the huge number of people affected.
""It's a parking ticket, not a penalty,"" Ed Mierzwinski of the Washington-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group said in an email. He added that consumers should not have to jump through hoops to receive compensation.
Others questioned whether the fund would be sufficient given the long-term risks of having a Social Security number exposed. 
""The settlement provides some compensation right now, but the risk of identity theft is forever,"" said Chi Chi Wu, attorney for the National Consumer Law Center.
Speaking to reporters, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joe Simons said the agency also wanted to impose a monetary penalty, but the law does not allow it to fine companies for their first offense, an issue he has called on Congress to fix.
A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney general, who along with Indiana, is not participating in the settlement, said its litigation against the company was ongoing. ""Equifax must pay a penalty commensurate with the worst data breach in American history,"" she added.
POTENTIAL LEGISLATION 
Equifax disclosed in 2017 that a data breach had compromised the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 147 million people.
The scandal sent the company into turmoil, leading to the exit of its then-CEO, Richard Smith, and multiple congressional hearings as the company's slowness to disclose the breach and security practices were challenged by lawmakers. 
Policymakers and consumer groups have questioned how private companies could amass so much personal data, sparking efforts to bolster consumers' ability to control their information. Both the Senate Banking and House of Representatives Financial Services Committees are considering legislation that would require companies to better protect consumer data. 
""We need structural reforms and increased oversight of credit reporting agencies in order to make sure that this never happens again,"" Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Begor told reporters on Monday the company was overhauling its processes to put consumers first, and was committing $1.25 billion to bolster its data security.

Equifax has also agreed as part of the settlement to several new measures, including reviews of its security policies by a government-appointed third party. Equifax's board also must certify annually that the company has complied with the settlement terms, and could be fined if not.

The joint venture is the largest deal in Brazil's bioenergy sector since Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) joined forces with Cosan (SA:CSAN3) to form industry leader Raízen in 2011. 
Together, Bunge and BP will manage 11 cane processing plants in Brazil with capacity to crush 32 million tonnes of cane per year, putting them behind just Raízen and Biosev, which is controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus. 
The deal gives BP a role in Brazil's booming ethanol market ahead of a new federal policy next year aimed at boosting use of biofuels, which are used interchangeably with gasoline in Brazilian passenger cars.
""Brazil is the Saudi Arabia of biofuel,"" BP's head of Alternative Energy, Dev Sanyal, told Reuters. He added that the new venture was cash-flow positive.
Bunge said it will receive cash proceeds of $775 million as part of the agreement, which it expects to use to cut debt.
But the company said in a U.S. filing that it is planning a third-quarter impairment charge ""in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion"" related to the ""cumulative currency translation effects"" of its business in Brazil.
Bunge shares opened up more than 3% higher in New York before reducing gains to 1.4%. BP rose 0.3% in London.
The U.S.-based company has tried to sell its sugar operation in Brazil in the past with no success. It then tried listing shares of the unit in Sao Paulo last year, but canceled the plan, citing adverse market conditions.
Bunge sold its sugar trading business to Wilmar International Ltd last year. Its bioenergy unit posted losses in five of the past six quarters and the company forecast results for the unit would be roughly break-even in 2019.
""This partnership with BP represents a major portfolio optimization milestone for Bunge which allows us to reduce our current exposure to sugar milling,"" Bunge CEO Gregory Heckman said in a statement. 
ETHANOL VS SUGAR
Market conditions have improved for ethanol in Brazil, with strong demand and better prices, but the global sugar market remains challenging. (SBc1)
""I think the companies together will be able to have large synergies, there will be great optimization of resources and cost reductions,"" said Arnaldo Corrêa, a sugar and ethanol consultant in Brazil. 
""It is great news for the sector, because the deal creates a much stronger player. All those worries about the future of Bunge's assets disappeared,"" he added.
The joint venture, named BP Bunge Bioenergia, will operate on a standalone basis, headquartered in Sao Paulo. Besides sugar and ethanol, the company has capacity to produce electricity fueled by waste biomass from sugarcane.
""The new company will certainly focus on fuel and electricity, which will have a growing importance as Brazil's economy recovers,"" said Plinio Nastari, chief analyst at Brazilian consultancy Datagro.
""Brazil has a deficit of fuel production,"" said Mario Lindenhayn, head of biofuels at BP and future chairman of the new JV, adding that the company has its eye on new Asian ethanol markets. 
The deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, includes exit rights after 18 months including a private sale. Bunge has an option to launch a share offering after two years.

""We have a strong, committed partner in BP, as well as flexibility in the medium- and long-term for further monetization, with full exit potential via an IPO or other strategic route,"" said Bunge's Heckman.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were among the big winners, along with oil-services giant Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), a reaction from an 8.4% drubbing it received last week as volatility roiled oil prices.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow was up 0.07%, but the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%, with the Nasdaq 100 index even stronger, up 0.9%. The Nasdaq 100 includes the biggest tech stocks.
There wasn't much to trade on. The Middle East was quiet. Federal Reserve officials went into quiet mode a week ahead of the big July 30-31 FOMC meeting when the central bank is expected to cut its key federal funds rate.
There could be some volatility if reports on existing-home sales and new-home sales fail to meet Wall Street expectations. The former report is due Tuesday. The Commerce Department reports on new-home sales on Wednesday. In addition, Friday brings the first big read of second-quarter growth before the bell.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), up 2% on the day, issues second-quarter results Wednesday, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), up 1.1%, weighs in after Thursday's close. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also moved up ahead of its Thursday earnings report. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed 2.3% ahead of its July 30 earnings report for its fiscal-third quarter.
Apple, Intel and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were the leaders among the 30 Dow stocks. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was 1% lower. It reports second-quarter results before Wednesday's open and already has said it expects to take a $5 billion charge related to the problems with its 737 Max jetliner. The shares are up 2.6% this month and nearly 16% this year.
Crude oil futures in New York moved up 56 cents to $56.22 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, added 79 cents to $63.26 a barrel.
Interest rates moved slightly lower overall. The 10-Year yield finished unchanged at 2.05%.

Hopes of an interest rate cut have helped Wall Street's main indexes hit record levels this month, recovering from a slump in May caused by a sudden escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions.
About 30% of S&P 500 companies are set to report second-quarter results this week, with overall profits now estimated to rise about 1%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The Treasury awarded investment managers $8.968 billion out of the $16 billion in 30-year government bonds it offered on July 11. This was the smallest allotment of this bond maturity to this group of investors since the $8.946 billion last September.
At the prior 30-year sale in June, fund managers were allotted $10.920 billion.
This most recent 30-year bond auction fetched a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.13, the weakest reading for this measure of overall auction demand since November.
The yield on the latest 30-year supply cleared at 2.644%, which was more than 2 basis points higher than what traders had expected.
Earlier that day, longer-dated Treasury yields were already climbing in reaction to a Labor Department report that showed underlying consumer prices posted their biggest gain in 1-1/2 years in June.
The weak 30-year bond auction ratcheted up the bond market sell-off. It propelled 30-year yields on the open market nearly 7 basis points higher on July 11 to 2.639%, which was their highest level in six weeks.
While fund managers purchased less 30-year bond supply, overseas accounts picked up their purchases to $1.369 billion, their highest since March, from $960 million the month before.
The Treasury awarded bond dealers $5.615 billion in 30-year bond supply, up from $4.052 billion in June."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond fund managers Kathleen Gaffney and Henry Peabody left  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp at the end of June and have been replaced by existing members of the firm's fixed-income team, a spokeswoman told Reuters. 
Among other duties, the pair managed the $364 million Eaton Vance Multisector Income fund, whose 6.1% annualized return over the last 3 years puts it in the top 8th percentile among the 296 funds in its Morningstar category. Over the last year, however, the fund has returned 3.2%, dropping it into the 97th percentile among its peers over that time period.
Peabody told Reuters he has since joined MFS Investment Management, while Gaffney said separately that she is still in the process of determining to which firm she will move.
Eaton Vance said the two left to pursue ""other opportunities"" and Gaffney and Peabody would not say why they left. 
The management shakeup does not affect the fund's rating, Morningstar wrote in a report. The fund currently has a negative process pillar rating due to its concentrated risks. 
""While it is possible that there will be changes to the approach under its new management team, there is not enough information to revisit the Process rating at this point,"" the report said. 

Gaffney joined Eaton Vance in 2012 after co-managing the then-$22 billion Loomis Sayles Bond Fund with investor Dan Fuss.

NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Philadelphia Energy Solutions filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the company said on Monday, its second such filing in less than two years, after a fire last month prompted it to close the largest refinery on the U.S. East Coast.
Following the June 21 explosions and blaze, PES started shutting down the 335,000 barrel-per-day Philadelphia plant without a planned restart. Some 1,000 workers are being laid off.
The company's lenders agreed to provide up to $100 million in new financing to PES to usher it through the bankruptcy, it said. 
The agreement allows PES to “safely wind down our refining operations and, with the support of our insurers and stakeholders, best position the company for a successful reorganization, the rebuilding of our damaged infrastructure, and a restart of our refining operations,"" Mark Smith, chief executive officer of PES Energy, said in a statement. 
""The success of our plan is critical to energy supply and security for the region, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia,"" Smith said. 
PES could receive payouts of $1.25 billion in insurance claims connected to the fire and business closure, according to two sources briefed on the company's policies. 
The potential payouts include $1 billion for property damage and $250 million for loss of business, the sources said. 
The insurance payouts were expected to be used as collateral for the new bankruptcy financing, the sources said. 
PES has multiple owners, including investment bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and investment firm Bardin Hill, and has both assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion, court filings show.
PES also asked to continue making insurance payments. Its premiums cost about $1.4 million each month on 39 policies, according to filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. 
The refinery has struggled financially for years, slashing worker benefits and scaling back capital projects to save cash. PES filed for bankruptcy in January 2018 to reduce debt, but cash on hand dwindled even after the company emerged from the process later in the year. 
It was not clear whether re-entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which allows the company to restructure as opposed to liquidate its assets, would alter the interest of prospective buyers. 
The company began selling its oil supplies and some equipment since announcing it would seek to shut the plant, triggering employee concerns PES no longer aimed to find a buyer willing to restart the refinery as it had initially said. 
More than 600 union refinery workers will be laid off on Aug. 25. Others were let go shortly after the fire. 
Hundreds of contractors that do business with the refinery are also expected to be affected by the shutdown.
Ryan O'Callaghan, head of the refinery union, said he was not surprised by the latest Chapter 11 filing. 

""We went through it before and came out of it,"" O'Callaghan said. ""And the refinery kept going.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The so-called FANG stocks take center stage on Wall Street this week, with Amazon (O:AMZN), Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) set to report as the S&P 500 approaches a record high.
The group of high-growth stocks that supercharged the S&P 500's decade-long rally in recent years has had mixed results in 2019, with Facebook and Amazon dramatically outperforming the broader market, while Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet have lagged.
Facebook reports on Wednesday after the bell, with Amazon and Alphabet on Thursday, all together accounting for 9% of the S&P 500's stock market value. Overall, companies reporting this week account for about 30% of the S&P 500's value.
Investors' reactions to those reports could affect broader market sentiment as the S&P 500 trades about 1% below its July 12 record high close, with investors widely expecting the Fed to cut interest rates later this month. The benchmark index was up 0.3% on Monday.
""I’m more concerned about how the reports from the likes of Alphabet and Facebook will affect my other tech stocks, because they suck the oxygen out of the room every time something happens to them,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which owns shares of Amazon and Alphabet.
Also reporting this week are chipmakers Intel (O:INTC), Texas Instruments (O:TXN) and Xilinx (O:XLNX), which will likely give investors fresh information about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, the pace of 5G growth, and when a downturn in global semiconductor demand may end.
Netflix has tumbled 14% since Wednesday, when it reported weaker-than-expected subscriber growth. Facing an approaching wave of competition, the video streaming service is up 18% year to date, just below the S&P 500's 19% gain. Alphabet is up just 8% in 2019, while Amazon has surged 31%.
When Facebook reports, investors will focus on how the leading social network is responding to regulatory scrutiny of its handling of users' personal data, and how planned measures including a ""Clear History"" option may hurt advertising revenue.
Reflecting improved expectations, Facebook has surged 51% in 2019 and is 7% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline.
Facebook’s June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.5 billion, with net income up 5% to $5.4 billion, equivalent to $1.87 per share, according to Refinitiv.
Analysts expect Alphabet’s quarterly revenue to climb 17% to $38.2 billion, with net income falling 4% to $7.9 billion. Analysts expect Amazon’s quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.5 billion, with net income growing 11% to $2.82 billion."

MILAN (Reuters) -  Mediaset  (MI:MS) rejected a request by investor  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) to reconvene an extraordinary shareholder meeting as the French group tries to scrap a loyalty share scheme allowing the Berlusconi family to keep its grip on the Italian broadcaster.
The move marks another twist in an escalating row between Mediaset and Vivendi that could derail the broadcaster's plan to put the group and its separately-listed Spanish unit (MC:TL5) under a new Dutch holding company.
Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, introduced a loyalty share scheme in April aimed at strengthening its grip on the company by rewarding longer-term investors with additional votes.
The plan is opposed by Vivendi, which was prevented from voting at the shareholder meeting that approved the move. The French group wanted Mediaset to call a new meeting and let it vote, in the hope it could sink the scheme.
Still, the Italian broadcaster said it had accepted Vivendi's request to allow the 9.6% stake it directly holds to qualify for Mediaset's loyalty voting scheme, though it would wait for a ruling from an Italian court on that.
A hearing on the case is scheduled for Nov. 26.
A Vivendi spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
LEGAL BATTLE
Mediaset and Vivendi are embroiled in a prolonged legal battle stemming from the failed sale in 2016 of Mediaset's pay-TV unit to the French media conglomerate controlled by Vincent Bollore.
After it backtracked on the deal, Vivendi built a 28.8% stake in Mediaset but was forced to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns and has been prevented from voting at shareholder meetings.
The row threatens to disrupt Mediaset's planned corporate overhaul under which the company and its Spanish subsidiary plan to merge into a new Amsterdam-based holding.
Vivendi could potentially scupper the corporate overhaul if it exercises its right of withdrawal as Mediaset has set a ceiling of 180 million euros on the cash outlay for the option, well below the Vivendi stake.
On Monday Mediaset shares closed 3.6% below the price the company set for the withdrawal right at 2.77 euros per share amid low volumes as investors fear the plan could be shelved due to the increasing tensions between the group and Vivendi.
Vivendi has criticized the planned reorganization - that will be put before shareholders on Sept. 4 - accusing Mediaset of damaging the interests of minority investors."
157,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",San Juan streets packed with protesters demanding Puerto Rico's governor resign,"By Marco Bello
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people filled San Juan streets on Monday to demand that Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló resign over offensive chat messages, the latest scandal to hit a bankrupt island struggling to recover from deadly 2017 hurricanes.
Rosselló's announcement on Sunday that he would not seek re-election next year and would step down as head of the New Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party seemed to have little effect on the crowds, who called for him to immediately surrender the governorship. The island's largest newspaper on Monday called on the first-term governor to leave office.
Crowds of people, many dressed in black T-shirts and waving the U.S. island territory's flag, filled a major highway in San Juan in the latest in a series of more than a week of sometimes violent protests in the capital and elsewhere. 
""They can't deny it: The power is in the street,"" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz wrote in a Twitter message on Monday. 
""These governments are corrupt governments,"" said Martin Gonzalez, who joined Monday's march. ""The people must make themselves be respected. And we take to the streets to be respected.""
Rosselló, 40, asked for forgiveness and said he respected the wishes of Puerto Ricans in a message broadcast online on Sunday.
""I know that apologizing is not enough,"" Rosselló said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""A significant sector of the population has been protesting for days. I'm aware of the dissatisfaction and discomfort they feel. Only my work will help restore the trust of these sectors.""
The publication on July 13 of sexist and homophobic chat messages between Rosselló and top aides unleashed simmering resentment over his handling of devastating hurricanes in 2017, alleged corruption in his administration, and the island's bankruptcy process.
The protests were also sparked by U.S. authorities' announcement of a federal indictment involving six people, including two former high-ranking Puerto Rico government officials, charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal Medicaid and education funds.
Puerto Rico's largest newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, called on Rosselló to resign in an editorial published on Monday.
""Puerto Rico has spoken up, not only as a strong, broad and united voice but as the right voice,"" the editorial said. ""With a gesture of nobility and humility, Governor, it is time to listen to the people. You have to resign.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, who feuded with Rosselló in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, blasted the governor at the White House on Monday.
""He's a terrible governor,"" Trump said. ""You have totally grossly incompetent leadership at the top of Puerto Rico.""
'POWER OF THE PEOPLE'
Puerto Rico's non voting representative to the U.S. Congress as well as Democratic presidential candidates and lawmakers have called for the governor to step aside after nine days of sometimes violent protests.
Puerto Rico House Speaker Carlos Mendez, part of Rosselló's New Progressive Party, appointed an independent panel on Friday to investigate whether the chats warranted impeachment.
The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the island's bankruptcy process as it tries to restructure some $120 billion in debt and pension obligations.
It has also raised concerns among U.S. lawmakers who are weighing the island's requests for billions of federal dollars for healthcare and work to recover from Hurricane Maria, which led to nearly 3,000 deaths.
Puerto Rican celebrities including pop singer Ricky Martin, a target of the governor's chats, meringue singer Olga Tañón and rapper Bad Bunny joined the protest crowds.

""I want to feel the power of the people,"" Martin, 47, said in a Facebook video, urging legislative leaders to start an impeachment process.

The Chinese telecommunications giant partnered with a state-owned Chinese firm, Panda International Information Technology Co Ltd., on a number of projects in North Korea over at least eight years, the Post reported.
Sources briefed on the matter confirmed the Commerce Department has been investigating Huawei since 2016 and is reviewing whether the company violated export control rules in relation to sanctions on North Korea.
Such a move would raise questions of whether Huawei, which has used U.S. technology in its components, violated American export controls to furnish North Korea with equipment.
Senators Chris Van Hollen and Tom Cotton said a statement the ""revelation underscores (Huawei's) ties to North Korea and its serial violations of U.S. law.""
They noted that a defense reauthorization bill under consideration in Congress contains new ""provisions to better enforce sanctions on Pyongyang by making it clear that any company that does business with North Korea – like Huawei reportedly did – will face American sanctions."" 
The United States put Huawei on a blacklist in May, citing national security concerns. The move banned U.S. companies from selling most U.S. parts and components to Huawei without special licenses but President Donald Trump said last month American firms could resume sales in a bid to restart trade talks with Beijing.
Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said in a statement to the Washington Post it had ""no business presence"" in North Korea. It was not immediately possible to reach the Panda Group.

Huawei and Panda vacated their Pyongyang office in the first half of 2016, the newspaper reported.

Icahn, who owns 4.4% stake in the Houston-based oil and gas producer, launched a proxy fight last week, arguing that the company overpaid for Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC) and failed to give shareholders a say in the proposed $38 billion deal.
The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes.
""None"" of Icahn's nominees ""possess skills, experience or expertise that are additive or superior to our existing directors,"" wrote Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub and Chairman Eugene Batchelder in a letter to shareholders. 
Icahn Enterprises responded by circulating a draft letter to Occidental holders that hit the lack of a vote on the proposed acquisition, which it called a ""massive and risky Anadarko bet that gambles the Company's future ...."" 
The hedge fund further described the two directors' pay as excessive and called the Anadarko purchase a ""de facto poison pill to ensure Oxy remains a stand-alone company, thus ensuring Hollub and Batchelder keep their jobs, power, and lucrative compensation.""
Icahn's nominees are John Hofmeister, former president of Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co; Alan LeFevre, former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp; and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, executives with Icahn's investment company.
Occidental also called on shareholders to reject the consent solicitation put forward by Icahn to get a vote on his nominees.
If Icahn gets enough signatures to go ahead with a solicitation, holders of a majority of outstanding shares would still have to approve the removal and replacement of each director, an Occidental spokesman said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) agreed on Monday to pay about $25.3 million, including a criminal fine, to settle U.S. charges it made improper payments that were used to bribe government officials in Hungary and other countries.
The U.S. Department of Justice said Microsoft Hungary will pay the $8.75 million criminal fine, as part of a three-year non-prosecution agreement in which it ""admits, accepts and acknowledges"" responsibility for employees' misconduct.
Microsoft also agreed to pay nearly $16.6 million to settle related civil charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its activities in Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey, without admitting wrongdoing.
Both settlements resolved charges that Microsoft violated the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after the Redmond, Washington-based company failed to properly account for the improper payments in its records.
In an email to employees, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the settlements ""involved employee misconduct that was completely unacceptable,"" and said the ""small number"" of employees involved in Hungary were no longer with the company.
""There is no room for compromise when it comes to ethical business practices,"" Smith said in the email's subject line.
Prosecutors said the Hungarian scheme generated at least $14.6 million of improper profit for Microsoft between 2013 and 2015, in connection with the sale of software licenses to Hungarian government agencies.
Executives and employees at Microsoft Hungary, which is based in Budapest, were accused of falsely telling Microsoft that steep discounts were needed to complete the transactions.
Prosecutors said the savings should have gone to customers, but were instead used by intermediary resellers in part to pay bribes to government officials, with Microsoft recording the discounts as legitimate business expenses.
The SEC accord also resolved charges over improper travel and gifts to officials in Saudi Arabia and Thailand through ""slush funds"" maintained by third parties, and an unexplained discount on a transaction involving Microsoft's Turkish unit.

""We will hold subsidiaries and, where appropriate, the parent corporations accountable wherever FCPA violations occur,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Commission-free stock trading startup Robinhood said on Monday it has raised $323 million in a new round of funding that values the company at $7.6 billion.
The round was led by DST Global, with participation from investors including Ribbit Capital, Sequoia, Thrive Capital and NEA, Robinhood said. 
The company said it will use the funding to expand the business.
Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood is one of several young companies that aim to compete with traditional financial institutions by offering cheaper and more user friendly digital services.
Financial technology startups will usually have lower costs because they have no legacy infrastructure to maintain and have automated a lot of their processes.
Robinhood, which has gained popularity among young consumers for its commission-free stock trading app, has been looking to expand the types of financial services it offers.
In December the company announced that it would soon be launching a ""checking and savings"" service, whose customer deposits would be insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corp for up to $250,000.
A day after the announcement, the chief executive of SIPC told reporters he did not believe the fund would actually insure Robinhood's accounts. In response Robinhood suspended the launch.

171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Microsoft Pays $25 Million to End U.S. Probe Into Bribery Overseas,"(Bloomberg) --  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). agreed to pay $25 million to settle U.S. government investigations into alleged bribery by former employees in Hungary.
The software maker’s Hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and a cease-and-desist order with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Microsoft said in an email to employees from Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith that was posted Monday on the company’s web site. The case concerned violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to an SEC filing 
The Justice Department concluded that between 2013 and June 2015 “a senior executive and some other employees at Microsoft Hungary participated in a scheme to inflate margins in the Microsoft sales channel, which were used to fund improper payments under the FCPA,” Smith wrote in the email.
Microsoft sold software to partners at a discount and the partners then resold the products to the Hungarian government at a higher price. The difference went to fund kickbacks to government officials, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2018. The company fired the employees involved, Smith noted. 
“We were deeply disappointed and embarrassed when we first learned about these events several years ago, and we hope that all of the steps we’ve since taken, including today’s settlement, send a strong message,” Smith wrote. “As a company, we do not tolerate employees and partners who willfully break policies that go to fundamental issues of business integrity.” The SEC noted that some Microsoft employees violated the law by engaging in unscrupulous sales practices in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Thailand.
To find and prevent such illegal activities, Microsoft now requires discounts it provides to sales partners to be passed directly to government customers. The company makes customers aware of any discounts to ensure they are receiving them and that funds are not diverted for other purposes like bribes. The company also is using machine-learning software to track contracts and flag discounts or other practices that appear unusual.
The U.S. uses the FCPA to police bribe-paying around the world, in what officials have said is an effort to even the playing field. Since 2005, the government has collected billions of dollars in fines from foreign companies and U.S. firms found to be in violation of the law."
172,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>",France's Hulot calls on parliament to vote against EU-Canada trade deal,"PARIS (Reuters) - Popular former environment minister Nicolas Hulot on Monday urged the French parliament to vote against the EU-Canada trade deal in a last-minute bid to block the agreement.
The EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) provisionally took effect from September 2017, but still needs to be approved by all 28 EU member states.
Opponents of CETA say it will bring unfair competition to French farmers as Canada's environmental legislation is less strict than in France.
Hulot resigned in August 2018 in protest at the pace of President Emmanuel Macron's environmental reforms.
But with an approval rating of more than 70 percent in the Paris Match magazine weekly poll, the former nature program presenter remains by far the most popular political figure in France.
He said that when France bans certain pesticides to protect people's health, it goes against the interests of the chemicals giants.
""When all these lobbies are already trying to break down the door, why give them a battering ram with CETA?"" Hulot wrote in an open letter to MPs published on the Franceinfo radio website.
""Have the courage to say 'no' tomorrow,"" He said.
If parliament ratifies the agreement - which is likely, as Macron's centrist LREM party has a comfortable majority - France will become the 14th EU state to do so.
However, any abstentions or votes against the treaty by some LREM members would be a blow to Macron, already under fire from some quarters for not making the environment a bigger priority.
The French government reiterated that the treaty was beneficial for the country.
""With CETA, we are sure that we will not import the kind of agriculture that we do not want,"" Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume said on France 2 television.
The CETA agreement can theoretically be scuppered altogether if an EU member country formally notifies Brussels that it has permanently rejected it. A year ago, Italy said it would not ratify it.
France's Senate, held by the conservative opposition, will vote on CETA this autumn but does not have the power to block it."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Trading on China's new Nasdaq-style board for homegrown tech firms hit fever pitch on Monday, with shares up as much as 520% in a wild debut that more than doubled the board's combined market capitalization and beat veteran investors' expectations.
Sixteen of the first batch of 25 companies - ranging from chip-makers to health care firms - increased their already frothy initial public offering (IPO) prices by 136% on the STAR Market, operated by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
The raucous first day of trade tripped the exchange's circuit breakers that are designed to calm frenzied activity. The weakest performer leapt 84.22%. In total, the day saw the creation of around 305 billion yuan ($44.3 billion) in new market capitalization on top of an initial market cap of around 225 billion yuan, according to Reuters' calculations.
""The price gains are crazier than we expected,"" said Stephen Huang, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. ""These are good companies, but valuations are too high. Buying them now makes no sense.""
Modelled after Nasdaq, and complete with a U.S-style IPO system, STAR may be China's boldest attempt at capital market reforms yet. It is also seen driven by Beijing's ambition to become technologically self-reliant as a prolonged trade war with Washington catches Chinese tech firms in the cross-fire.
Trading in Anji Microelectronics Technology (Shanghai) Co Ltd, a semiconductor firm, was briefly halted twice as the company's shares hit two circuit breakers - first after rising 30%, then after climbing 60% from the market open.
The mechanisms did little to keep Anji shares in check as they soared as much as 520% from their IPO price in the morning session. Anji shares ended the day up 400.2% from their IPO price, the day's biggest gain, giving the company a valuation of nearly 242 times 2018 earnings.
Suzhou Harmontronics Automation Technology Co Ltd, in contrast, triggered its circuit breaker in the opposite direction, falling 30% from the market open in early trade before rebounding. But by the market close, the company's shares were still 94.61% higher than their IPO price.
Wild share price swings, partly the result of loose trading rules, had been widely expected. IPOs had been oversubscribed by an average of about 1,700 times among retail investors.
The STAR Market sets no limits on share prices during the first five days of a company's trading. That compares with a cap of 44% on debut on other boards in China.
In subsequent trading sessions, stocks on the new tech board will be allowed to rise or fall a maximum 20% in a day, double the 10% daily limit on other boards.
Regulators last week cautioned individual investors against ""blindly"" buying STAR Market stocks, but said big fluctuations were normal.
Looser trading rules were aimed at ""giving market players adequate freedom in the game, accelerating the formation of equilibrium prices, and boosting price-setting efficiency,"" the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) said in a statement on Friday.
The SSE added that it was normal to see big swings in newly listed tech shares, as such companies typically have uncertain prospects, and are difficult to evaluate.
The exchange cited big fluctuations in IPOs shares on Nasdaq and the Hong Kong stock exchange, in particular singling out recently listed electric car firm Nio Inc and Chinese start-up Luckin Coffee.
SSE said that an index tracking the STAR Market would be launched on the 11th trading day following the debut of the 30th company on the board.

MAIN BOARD DRAG
Investor focus on the STAR Market in the short term could weigh on the main board in terms of liquidity and attention, said Zhu Junchun, chief analyst with Lianxun Securities.
That effect was clear on Monday, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index falling 1.27%, and the blue-chip CSI300 index ending 0.69% lower.
Dual-listed China Railway Signal & Communications Corp Ltd clearly illustrated the gap in investor enthusiasm. Its STAR Market shares more than doubled from their IPO price, even as its Hong Kong shares dropped 11.7% following worse-than-expected preliminary results.
Huang at Shanghai See Truth suggested rational investors wait on the sidelines and observe the market for a month, before making purchasing decisions.
Some investors, nevertheless, hailed the debut of the board that Beijing hopes will propel investment in the sector and help the country innovate and compete globally.
Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of Tongheng Investment, a hedge fund house in Fujian province, said he viewed 80% of listed companies as ""cannon fodder"", but the chance of the remaining 20% producing China's next Tencent or Huawei [HWT.UL] made the market turmoil worth it.
""The STAR Market opens a new chapter for China's stock market. Toast to the Chinese dream in our capital markets!"" he said.
(In first paragraph, makes clear that the capital of the Nasdaq-style STAR Market has more than doubled, not that of entire exchange)"
174,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Uber Profit Path Seen Slowed by Riders Taking Cheaper Rides,"(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.’s path to profit is likely to be slowed by growing competition as a significant number of customers are willing to wait around for a cheaper ride, according to analysts at HSBC.
The company, which went public in May, will need to fend off “tough and persistent” rivals that cater to price-conscious consumers, Masha Kahn and Henning Cosman wrote as they initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating.  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). often prices 20-25% below Uber in New York and Daimler AG-backed Bolt is now doing the same in London, they said.
Uber shares have recovered much of the 18% decline seen in the first few days that followed the company’s Wall Street listing, but have still trailed the broader U.S. tech sector. HSBC gave the stock its 11th hold rating, while it has 23 buys and zero sells among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Uber will also need to navigate tougher employment regulations and potentially higher taxes that could be imposed on the ride-hailing sector, the bank said.
In food delivery, “the big disadvantage is that Uber Eats does not have first-mover advantage in many markets,” meaning in some geographies it trails in terms of restaurant selection versus other applications.
“We struggle to make an argument that the risk-reward is skewed to the upside in the near term,” Kahn and Cosman wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks lingered on Monday, hamstrung by dialled-down expectations for a larger U.S. rate cut this month, while escalating tensions in the Middle East boosted oil prices and rising fears for a no-deal Brexit haunted the pound.

Meanwhile, investors were shunning real estate stocks (SX86P) that would benefit from lower interest rates and defensive sectors such as utilities (SX6P) and telecoms (SXKP) ahead of a big week for earnings. 
""Sentiment about company earnings potential appears to be mixed at best, with some evidence that we might be seeing a bit of a pickup in economic data, after a slow first half of the year,"" said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets.
""The pickup in U.S. economic data last week, as well as contradictory commentary from Fed officials, appears to be muddying the waters for investors about the possible reaction function of the U.S. Federal Reserve at the end of this month and whether we can expect to see a 25 basis point or 50 basis point rate cut.""
Momentum looked better for Wall Street. U.S. futures (ESc1) (NQc1) pointed to a 0.3% to 0.5% higher open. 
Global stocks rose towards the end of last week after dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) boosted expectations the world's top central bank would lower rates by 50 basis points at its July 30-31 meeting.
They gave back those gains and Wall Street shares fell after the New York Fed walked back Williams' comments by saying his speech was not about upcoming policy action. 
Hopes for a larger cut were curtailed even more after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was likely to cut rates by 25 bps this month, and may trim further in the future given global growth and trade uncertainties.
The dollar inched higher and U.S. Treasury yields held steady on the greater likelihood of a shallower rate cut. The dollar index (DXY) gained to 97.193 against a basket of six major currencies after rising 0.4% on Friday.
The euro (EUR=) was little changed at $1.1219 after shedding 0.5% on Friday. The dollar edged up 0.16% to 107.86 yen . The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) lingered at 2.0429%. Still, the pressure on equity markets limited the rise in safe-haven Treasury yields.
""Market direction will be driven increasingly by macro economic data; central bank policy responses are in the prices already and earnings are unable to lift the equity markets so the dynamics will be economic data and the concerns about geo-political risks and trade,"" said Larry Hatheway, head of GAM Investment Solutions & Chief Economist in Zurich. 
""The market will struggle to find direction until autumn and we may have another pullback in capital markets.""

Luckin, which raised $561 million in May in a U.S. initial public offering, said on Monday that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a joint venture with Kuwait's Americana Group to launch the business in the Greater Middle East and India regions, without providing further details.
""This collaboration represents Luckin Coffee's first step toward bringing its leading products from China to the world,"" Luckin Coffee's Founder and CEO, Jenny Qian Zhiya, said in a statement.

Luckin has been locked in a supercharged expansion plan to unseat Starbucks as the No.1 coffee chain in the world's second-largest economy and aims to open 2,500 stores in China this year.
It has spent cash to offer lower prices, discounts, speedy delivery and promotions on social media, which in turn pushed Starbucks to form a tie-up with Chinese tech giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) to deliver coffee to customers.

Luckin has also expanded outside coffee, offering customers other beverages such as grapefruit cheese jasmine tea and food items, including Sichuan cold noodles with pulled chicken via its app.

The Italian lender is weighing as many as 10,000 cuts, though final numbers are still under review and may be much lower, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The dismissals will involve staff in Italy -- where the company has the largest number of employees -- as well as in other countries, they said. UniCredit may also reduce other operating expenses by as much as 10% in the plan, the people said.
Chief Executive officer Jean Pierre Mustier is preparing his next set of targets after exceeding cost-cutting and asset quality goals in the previous three-year plan. Mustier, who spent the first part of his tenure cleaning up bad loans, reducing jobs and strengthening the balance sheet, has already said that he expects to accelerate the run down of non-essential business, adjust its holdings of Italian sovereign debt and improve its capital buffer.
UniCredit joins other large European banks slashing costs and reducing job numbers as they seek to adapt to low interest rates that make it harder for lenders to increase revenue.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) plans to cut 18,000 positions in a sweeping overhaul, while  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA in April announced plans to cut 1,600 jobs globally and exit capital-intensive businesses.
UniCredit Shares
UniCredit rose 0.3% to 11.25 euros as of 12:20 p.m. in Milan trading, giving the bank a market value of 25 billion euros ($28 billion). The shares have gained 14% this year compared with a 2% increase of the 47-member STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index.
A UniCredit spokesman declined to comment.
The bank has already taken steps to put itself in a stronger financial position ahead of the plan’s presentation. Earlier this year it raised about 2.1 billion euros by selling its holding in Banca Fineco SpA. UniCredit’s new business plan will be based on organic growth and will try to simplify the way the bank does business to enhance efficiency, Mustier told newspaper Milano Finanza in an interview last week.
Among the options UniCredit is reviewing to reduce its cost of funding is the creation of a separate holding company in Germany for its foreign businesses, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 06:53AM ET</span>",Bayer could benefit from home advantage in St. Louis Roundup cancer trial: experts,"By Tina Bellon
ST. LOUIS (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), facing an upcoming trial in St. Louis over allegations that its Roundup weed killer causes cancer, has recruited Missouri-based expert witnesses to make its case in a place where it has century-old roots but where juries often hit companies with huge damages.
Four expert witnesses Bayer is seeking to admit hail from Missouri universities, and some legal experts said the company is trying to clinch its first favorable Roundup verdict by emphasizing its reputation as a major local employer. 
Bayer on Tuesday announced it would create an additional 500 ""high-paying"" jobs in the St. Louis area. The Bayer unit that makes the glyphosate-based herbicide, the former  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co, was founded in St. Louis in 1901. Monsanto employed 5,400 full-time employees in the St. Louis area as of May 2018, according to company statements.
The trial in St. Louis County Circuit Court, expected to begin on Aug. 19, was brought by Illinois resident Sharlean Gordon, who says she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after using Roundup for around 14 years at her home. It is the fourth trial over Roundup and the first one outside of California, where three juries hit Bayer with verdicts as large as $2 billion. Bayer is appealing those verdicts. 
Bayer denies glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer, saying decades of studies have shown glyphosate to be safe. The company said it looked forward to presenting the scientific evidence to juries. It said the experts in the upcoming St. Louis trial are at the top of their field and were selected for their expertise, not their Missouri ties.
The Germany-based company has lost nearly 40 billion euros ($33.75 billion) in market valuation since the first Roundup jury verdict in August 2018. Bayer last month announced it had set up a committee to help resolve the litigation, saying it would ""constructively engage"" in court-mandated mediation talks.
NEW WITNESSES
Bayer has said in court papers and hearings that juries in California's traditionally liberal Bay Area, where the first three trials took place, were unfairly influenced by news coverage of the trials and harbored negative attitudes toward Monsanto in part because of its development of genetically modified seeds.
The company's experts in those cases came mostly from states other than California. In the St. Louis trial, Bayer is so far seeking to admit a total of 14 scientific expert witnesses. None previously testified in the Roundup litigation. 
Of the more than 13,400 Roundup claims nationwide that have yet to go to trial, about 75% have been filed in St. Louis city or county courts, according to plaintiffs' lawyers. Those courts have a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and have often been criticized by business groups for issuing favorable plaintiffs rulings. 
By suing in the county where Bayer's crop science business is headquartered, plaintiffs can also take advantage of procedural rules allowing them to compel live testimony from executives who work locally. In the California trials, jurors only saw video depositions of Monsanto executives. 
David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Bayer appeared to be hiring local experts to appeal to St. Louis jurors. ""(They) are not seen as hired guns, flying in from afar, but ... can explain the case in a way local jurors understand,"" Noll said.
But Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said Bayer could simply be using new experts that the company thinks would have a better rapport with the jury and ""not necessarily because the experts are local."" 
Counting on a more favorable jury pool in a company's backyard is not a new tactic. 
New Jersey-based Merck & Co (N:MRK), which in the early 2000s faced thousands of lawsuits by patients over its Vioxx painkiller, won several trials in New Jersey, which plaintiffs lawyers at the time attributed to the company's strong ties to the state.
Merck in 2013 settled some 27,000 Vioxx claims for $4.85 billion.

Investing.com -- The benefits of breaking up a conglomerate and focusing on what you do best, where the opportunities are greatest, have seldom been clearer.
Dutch blue-chip Koninklijke Philips (AS:PHG) has now completed on an eight-year journey in which it has offloaded a range of underperforming or structurally challenged businesses – from domestic appliances such as TVs to light bulbs and sensors for the car industry. It’s now focused totally on its medical devices and services business – and the strategy is paying off.
The company’s shares hit an 18-year high on Monday after it announced a solid second quarter and upheld its guidance for the year in the teeth of a global slowdown in manufacturing. Comparable sales rose 6% - stronger than the 4.5% expected - and order intake rose 8%. That's no mean achievement at a time when manufacturers’ purchasing indexes and business surveys are flashing red in both developed and emerging markets.
Sales in China, notably, grew by more than 10%.
CEO Frans van Houten said he expected performance to improve in the second half and reiterated the company’s goal of improving its core operating margin (EBITA) by an average of 100 basis points in the period from 2017-2020.
Phillips shares were up 4.3% by mid-morning in Amsterdam, leading both the local market and the Euro Stoxx 50. The broader Stoxx 600 benchmark was up 0.2% on a generally lacklustre day, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.4% and the German Dax up 0.3%.
But Philips isn’t immune to the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war. Indeed, its home market of Europe accounts for less than a quarter of sales.
Its fastest-growing market is China, and any broad slowdown in the economy there may jeopardize the government’s aim of rolling out improved health care services. Moreover, it’s also at risk from the next planned round of U.S. tariffs against China, given that the devices it makes in China for the U.S. market would be covered by them. Van Houten told Reuters that the planned tariffs would slice another 20 million euros ($23 million) off core earnings, in addition to the 45 million euros already lost to previous tariffs - if they come into force."

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Rising healthcare spending by the Chinese government helped Dutch health technology company Philips (AS:PHG) post better-than-expected sales growth for the second quarter, putting its shares among the top performers in Europe on Monday.
Philips, which sells products ranging from toothbrushes to medical imaging systems, said comparable sales had improved 6% in the second quarter. Analysts had on average only penciled in a 4.5% improvement.
Philips shares rose 4% in the first hours of trading in Amsterdam, making them one of the top performers in the Stoxx600.
Growth was helped by a ""double digit"" sales increase in China, Philips said, as the Chinese government ramps up healthcare spending, expanding hospitals and investing in more advanced technologies.
""Healthcare in China is still not sufficient to meet the demands of an ageing society,"" Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters in a phone interview.
""The government has said it would expand capacity, and that is exactly what is happening. This trend for us is more important than fluctuations in GDP (gross domestic product) growth, and we expect it to continue in the coming years.""
Demand and orders for hospital equipment, medical systems and personal care devices also increased in the United States and Europe, keeping Philips optimistic about the months to come.
""We saw growth in all our segments in the second quarter and we expect that to continue"", Van Houten told reporters. 
""We had strong traction in emerging markets and that is set to continue. Also, we expect mature markets to come in stronger in the second half of the year.""
TARIFF CLOUDS
Although sales in the U.S. and China remained strong, Philips said the trade disputes between the two countries remained its main worry, as both its end products and components are hit by new tariffs.
""The main cloud hanging over us is the possible fourth batch of tariffs,"" Van Houten said. ""If that would happen, it would increase the amount by which our earnings are hit by 20 million euros this year, but nobody knows whether it will happen.""
Philips currently expects tariffs to shave 45 million euros ($51 million) off its 2019 core earnings.
Once a sprawling conglomerate, Philips is now purely focused on healthcare after spinning off its lighting and consumer electronics divisions in recent years.
The company reaffirmed its target for total comparable sales growth of 4% to 6% per year until 2020, and said its profit margin would move up from 13.1 to around 14% this year.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) jumped 14% to 549 million euros in the second quarter, while the margin climbed 60 basis points to 11.8%, roughly meeting expectations.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 06:53AM ET</span>",Bayer could benefit from home advantage in St. Louis Roundup cancer trial: experts,"By Tina Bellon
ST. LOUIS (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), facing an upcoming trial in St. Louis over allegations that its Roundup weed killer causes cancer, has recruited Missouri-based expert witnesses to make its case in a place where it has century-old roots but where juries often hit companies with huge damages.
Four expert witnesses Bayer is seeking to admit hail from Missouri universities, and some legal experts said the company is trying to clinch its first favorable Roundup verdict by emphasizing its reputation as a major local employer. 
Bayer on Tuesday announced it would create an additional 500 ""high-paying"" jobs in the St. Louis area. The Bayer unit that makes the glyphosate-based herbicide, the former  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co, was founded in St. Louis in 1901. Monsanto employed 5,400 full-time employees in the St. Louis area as of May 2018, according to company statements.
The trial in St. Louis County Circuit Court, expected to begin on Aug. 19, was brought by Illinois resident Sharlean Gordon, who says she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after using Roundup for around 14 years at her home. It is the fourth trial over Roundup and the first one outside of California, where three juries hit Bayer with verdicts as large as $2 billion. Bayer is appealing those verdicts. 
Bayer denies glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer, saying decades of studies have shown glyphosate to be safe. The company said it looked forward to presenting the scientific evidence to juries. It said the experts in the upcoming St. Louis trial are at the top of their field and were selected for their expertise, not their Missouri ties.
The Germany-based company has lost nearly 40 billion euros ($33.75 billion) in market valuation since the first Roundup jury verdict in August 2018. Bayer last month announced it had set up a committee to help resolve the litigation, saying it would ""constructively engage"" in court-mandated mediation talks.
NEW WITNESSES
Bayer has said in court papers and hearings that juries in California's traditionally liberal Bay Area, where the first three trials took place, were unfairly influenced by news coverage of the trials and harbored negative attitudes toward Monsanto in part because of its development of genetically modified seeds.
The company's experts in those cases came mostly from states other than California. In the St. Louis trial, Bayer is so far seeking to admit a total of 14 scientific expert witnesses. None previously testified in the Roundup litigation. 
Of the more than 13,400 Roundup claims nationwide that have yet to go to trial, about 75% have been filed in St. Louis city or county courts, according to plaintiffs' lawyers. Those courts have a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and have often been criticized by business groups for issuing favorable plaintiffs rulings. 
By suing in the county where Bayer's crop science business is headquartered, plaintiffs can also take advantage of procedural rules allowing them to compel live testimony from executives who work locally. In the California trials, jurors only saw video depositions of Monsanto executives. 
David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Bayer appeared to be hiring local experts to appeal to St. Louis jurors. ""(They) are not seen as hired guns, flying in from afar, but ... can explain the case in a way local jurors understand,"" Noll said.
But Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said Bayer could simply be using new experts that the company thinks would have a better rapport with the jury and ""not necessarily because the experts are local."" 
Counting on a more favorable jury pool in a company's backyard is not a new tactic. 
New Jersey-based Merck & Co (N:MRK), which in the early 2000s faced thousands of lawsuits by patients over its Vioxx painkiller, won several trials in New Jersey, which plaintiffs lawyers at the time attributed to the company's strong ties to the state.
Merck in 2013 settled some 27,000 Vioxx claims for $4.85 billion.

ConEd’s website Sunday night showed customers without power at various times included more than 37,000 in Brooklyn and 13,600 in Queens areas. Cuomo’s office said it directed the State Department of Public Service to expand its investigation into ConEd outages, which was opened after a failure last weekend left 72,000 customers in Manhattan’s West Side without power.
""We have been through this situation with ConEd time and again, and they should have been better prepared,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""This was not a natural disaster; there is no excuse for what has happened in Brooklyn.”
The company didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment on the governor’s statement. It said in a release that it preemptively took customers in southeast Brooklyn out of service in order to protect equipment and to help restore power as soon as possible.
The affected Brooklyn neighborhoods in Sunday’s outage include Canarsie, Flatlands, Mill Basin, Old Mill Basin, Bergen Beach and Georgetown. The company reported on its website 20,922 customers without power across its service area as of 4:39 a.m. local time Monday.
Relief Expected
Sunday’s outage comes as relief is expected from dangerous heat baking a swath of the U.S. Lower temperatures are forecast after heat advisories and excessive heat warnings stretched from Oklahoma to Ohio and along the East Coast from Maine to South Carolina.
ConEd had earlier in the day asked customers in southeast Brooklyn and parts of Queens, as well as some Bronx neighborhoods, to conserve energy while crews work to repair equipment.
Separately on Long Island, Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) Inc. reported Sunday night that power had been restored to most of the more than 27,000 customers affected by equipment failures.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 04:53AM ET</span>","Hyundai Motor second-quarter net profit rises 31.2%, new models boost domestic sales","By Ju-min Park and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) laid out its U.S. sales turnaround plan on Monday with an expanded line-up of sport-utility vehicles (SUV), after posting its biggest quarterly profit jump in seven years.
The automaker forecast its U.S. market share to begin rising again from this year, targeting a year-end share of 4.2% versus 3.9% last year, with sales of its upgraded Palisade SUV starting from the second half. It aims for a U.S. share of 5.2% by 2023.
Solid performance at home and in the United States in the three months through June helped offset a sales slump in China, where a slowing economy, trade war with the United States and a lack of competitive models prompted the automaker to suspend production at its oldest factory earlier this year.
To maintain momentum in the United States - its biggest overseas market - Hyundai said it plans to boost the proportion of SUVs in its U.S. line-up to 67% in 2023 from 51% in 2019, as it works to catch up with a shift in consumer preference.
""It was a surprise when Hyundai revealed an aggressive U.S. turnaround plan, but I don't see any problem in it meeting its annual sales target there,"" said analyst Kim Joon-sung at Meritz Securities.
Hyundai's revival is being led by heir-apparent Euisun Chung following six years of profit decline. The executive vice chairman is widely considered to be seeking investor support to revisit an ownership restructuring plan as he prepares to take over from his 81-year-old father and chairman.
A previous proposal was scrapped last year following shareholder opposition, notably from U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.
Since last year, Chung has brought in a flurry of foreign executives in a sweeping reshuffle at a firm dominated by Koreans. Most recently, in April, it appointed an ex-ally of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn as global chief operating officer and Americas chief.
In the April-June period, U.S. sales gained 3% while a weak Korean won against the U.S. dollar raised the value repatriated income. At home, new models such as the Palisade SUV and Sonata sedan helped sales jump 8.1%.
Overall, net profit for the quarter rose 31.2% to 919.3 billion won ($780.44 million), just short of market estimates but still Hyundai's biggest quarterly percentage gain since the first quarter of 2012.
Operating profit rose 30.2% on a 9.1% increase in revenue, the automaker said in a stock exchange filing.
Even so, the earnings recovery could weaken as Hyundai braces for a potential strike by its domestic labor union that could disrupt supplies of models such as the Palisade both at home and overseas, analysts said.
The union will vote next Monday whether to approve strike action after walking out of annual wage talks on Friday.
A prolonged dispute could have a greater impact on sales and earnings this year because, unlike in the past three or four years of slow growth, sales of its new models have been brisk, Samsung (KS:005930) Securities analyst Esther Yim said in a recent report.

Hyundai stock closed down 1.1% after the earnings announcement, versus the broader market's (KS11) 0.1% fall.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 03:06AM ET</span>",Australia's Macquarie bank faces shareholder backlash over pay,"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's biggest retail shareholder group has asked investors to reject the executive pay plans of investment bank  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG), accusing it of withholding pertinent information and setting overly achievable performance targets.
The Australian Shareholders Association (ASA) said the bank's remuneration report gives incomplete and confusing information about its ""uncommon remuneration structure"".
The ASA called on shareholders to reject the pay proposals at Macquarie's annual meeting on Thursday, and urged the bank to release the findings of an internal investigation into its governance and culture.
""The reason we are voting against it is the lack of transparency,"" ASA monitor Alan Goldin said by telephone.
Macquarie executives had met every performance hurdle for each of the previous five years, and ""if you keep making a hurdle, it's not really a hurdle,"" Goldin added.
Under Australian law, if more than a quarter of a company's shareholders vote against its remuneration report for two years running, shareholders can call for a subsequent vote on whether to sack the entire board.
Australian banks are facing a new trend of heightened shareholder scrutiny after a public inquiry into the financial sector last year found widespread wrongdoing and serious flaws in the management of compliance and risk.
But until now Macquarie, which has posted record profits every year since 2013, has been spared the kind of pressure for greater transparency that shareholders have applied to Australia's four big retail banks.
A bone of contention for some advisers is the bank's decision to accelerate from 7 to 2 years the vesting period of deferred equity - worth about A$88 million ($61.9 million) - awarded to previous CEO Nicholas Moore.
Australia's biggest wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), and its biggest lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) - have had their remuneration reports voted down in recent years.
The ASA's hundreds of Macquarie shareholders represent less than a quarter of the bank's share register, limiting its chances of getting a successful ""no"" vote.
Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholders Services Inc, Glass Lewis and Co, and Ownership Matters, which vote on behalf of institutional investors at AGMs, said they had concerns about Macquarie's remuneration but would vote to approve them at the meeting.
Macquarie was among 32 major financial institutions told by the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority, the financial sector watchdog, last year to provide self-assessments of their risk-management strategies. It was one of just two major banks which declined to make the reports public.
The bank would not publish the governance report because it contained commercially sensitive information, a Macquarie spokeswoman said. She declined to comment on criticism about the bank's remuneration practices."

205,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2019 12:21AM ET</span>",India Monitoring For ‘Signs of Fragility’ Among 50 Shadow Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- India is attempting to prevent any repeat of last year’s shadow banking crisis after detecting “signs of fragility” in some of the 50 housing finance and other non-bank lenders it is monitoring, according to central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das.
The Reserve Bank of India is working closely with the country’s lenders to prevent the collapse of another large systemically important non-bank finance company, Das said in one of his first media interviews since becoming governor in December. “It is our endeavor that there is no contagion,” Das said.
A year after a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. forced the government to intervene and exposed weaknesses in the sector, the problems of India’s NBFCs are entering a new phase. Some lenders such as Dewan Housing Finance Corp. and tycoon Anil Ambani’s Reliance Capital Ltd. are struggling, putting the loans they received from regulated banks at risk.
“We are constantly in touch with the large lenders” about the NBFCs and housing finance companies “where we see some signs of fragility,” Das said in the interview, which took place at his office in the RBI building overlooking the Mumbai skyline and the Arabian sea.
“Our effort is to see that there is no repeat instances of systemically important large NBFC collapsing,” the governor said.
Just as they emerge from the worst bad-loan problem in two decades, India’s banks are staring at another potential surge in soured debt as a result of their exposure to troubled non-bank finance companies. In its latest Financial Stability Report, the Reserve Bank of India warned that any failure among the largest of the NBFCs or housing finance firms could cause losses comparable to a major bank collapse.
The central bank selected the non-banks to monitor based on the size of their balance sheet, the scale of their operations, as well as governance practices and credit behavior, he said.
There have been some instances of governance lapses and “we are dealing with it,” Das said, without naming any company. “But there are a large number of others who have encountered business failures and certain external factors which impacted their business model.”
Das said lenders which haven’t been diligent in their lending practices “will have to pay” the price for it.
Read about the RBI’s concerns on potential shadow bank losses
The Indian government earlier this month threw a lifeline to the better-rated NBFCs by agreeing to backstop some of the assets that banks purchase from them, thereby improving their liquidity. The RBI, which is now a regulator of the housing finance companies, also eased liquidity ratio rules for banks to encourage refinancing for shadow lenders.
However, the Reserve Bank has resisted calls to provide a separate liquidity window for the struggling shadow banks, and Das reiterated his opposition, saying in the interview that a NBFC “refinance window is a misnomer.”
“Not a day has passed over the last several months when internally we have not had a review or some discussion on the NBFCs, either on the sector, or on the individual NBFCs,” Das said in his office adorned with two replicas of Lord Jagannath, a form of the Hindu god Vishnu, revered in his native Odisha state. “There have been improvements but challenges still remain.”
India’s cash-strapped NBFCs are closely interconnected with the banks, either through loans or purchases of the non-banks’ bonds. That poses a new challenge to the RBI’s efforts to clean up from an earlier bad-loan crisis -- mostly due to excessive lending to large energy, steel and other industrial companies -- and to encourage more lending to boost the economy.
Dewan Housing dropped 2% at 9:36 a.m. in Mumbai, while Bajaj Finance Ltd., which has gained 21.4% this year, fell 3.3%
Read how the shadow banks risk an Indian bad-loan redux
Mortgage lenders had outstanding loans of about 9.3 trillion rupees ($135 billion) as of March 31, 2018, according to RBI data. Repayment of some of the loans may be at risk as the cash crunch among non-banks has raised questions about the solvency of real estate companies, and threatens to push 70% of them out of business in the next two years,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts said in a note earlier this month.
Resolving the issues will involve losses for the owners of some of the non-bank companies, Das said.
“In the process, the promoters will have to make certain sacrifice,” Das said, referring to the founders of non-banks. The promoters will “have to accept certain hair cut and the banks will also have to deal with it appropriately.”

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said it had suspended operations of all GippsAero GA8 planes in Australia and all Australian-registered GA8 planes flying overseas from July 20 through Aug. 3.
The GA8 single-engine aircraft, built in Australia by GippsAero, is typically used for skydiving, tourism, air patrols, medical evacuations and humanitarian missions in remote locations, according to Mahindra Aerospace's website.
There are 228 GA8 planes worldwide, 63 of which are registered in Australia, CASA said.
Mahindra Aerospace, a unit of India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (NS:MAHM), said CASA's move was precautionary during the preliminary investigation in Sweden, with which GippsAero was cooperating.
""The preliminary investigation has not identified the root cause of the incident,"" GippsAero Chief Executive Keith Douglas said in an emailed statement.
Nine Swedes were killed when a GA8, dubbed the Airvan 8, crashed during a skydiving trip near Umea in northern Sweden on July 14.

CASA said it has been working closely with Swedish authorities and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which has also issued an emergency directive to European GA8 aircraft owners and operators to suspend operations except for ferry flights.

207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",Taiwan Stocks Offer Hefty Yield But Investors Still Selling,"(Bloomberg) -- The cash reward for owning Taiwan stocks is larger than almost anywhere else in Asia. Global investors are ditching them anyway.
Even with the benchmark Taiex gauge near a record high, managers have pulled about $680 million from Taiwan stock funds this month, more than any other market in the region. The withdrawals come even as corporate dividends top U.S. yields and just as a record amount of debt globally yields less than zero.
Investors who leaped into Taiwan stocks earlier this year aren’t eager to do it again: the economy’s firms are so entwined with the global technology supply chain that they’ve been particularly vulnerable to the trade war and a slowdown in the smartphone market.
""High dividend yields make Taiwan stocks attractive to global investors in a low interest rate environment, but it’s only one of the elements to consider,"" said Agnes Lin, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management Taiwan Ltd. The island’s weak economic fundamentals, partly the result of the U.S.-China trade clash, are also turning investors off the equities, she said.
The Taiex measure rose 0.5% as of 9:08 a.m. Monday in Taipei.
Some $13 trillion of bonds globally trade with negative yields, which is destroying potential returns. That has investors looking elsewhere. While U.S. stocks have surged to record levels, Taiwan hasn’t provided the answer -- at least for now as it struggles to reclaim last year’s highs.
The main problem has been the trade friction between the world’s two largest economies. Taiwan’s export orders have dropped for the seven months through May. Tech stocks, which account for nearly half of the Taiex gauge, have been whipsawed as the U.S. banned companies from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co.
Still, Taiwan’s listed companies plan to hand out NT$1.5 trillion ($48 billion) of cash dividends this year, 5% more than in 2018, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield for stocks on the Taiex gauge is 4.14%, according to Bloomberg-compiled data, more than double the S&P 500 Index’s 1.9%. To be sure, some of Europe’s stock gauges top Taiwan’s, with the FTSE 100 Index figure of 4.79%.
Prashant Bhayani, chief investment officer for Asia at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Wealth Management, said one of the reasons dividend yields in Taiwan are relatively high is it has ""mature companies that have excess cash flow beyond their investment needs.""
That description fits Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which is expected to pay a total of NT$10 a share in 2019, in line for a record. On top of that, on Thursday it projected third-quarter revenue that topped estimates. Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said the world’s largest contract chipmaker sees ""very, very strong demand"" in the second half of the year.
That could be a signal the worst has passed for Taiwan’s technology companies, spurring foreign investors to return to its equities -- and those dividend yields.
""There is a global search for yield presently with the rally we have seen in bond markets year-to-date,"" said Bhayani. ""Taiwan has had relatively higher downward earnings revisions over the past three months, relative to the most other countries in Asia. We look for pull backs in selected companies as an opportunity.""

In the letter written on Thursday and made public on Monday, Committee Chairman Frank Field asked why the remuneration committee put forward a proposal where the existing directors would receive 40% of base salary (20% of total salary) as the pension contribution whereas the contribution of new executive directors is limited to 10% of total salary.
The letter also questioned whether the remuneration committee supported the Investment Association's guideline that pension contribution rates for executive directors should be aligned with that of their workforce and inquired if the remuneration committee planned to revisit the executive pay policy next year.
Some 36% of StanChart's shareholders voted against the bank's 2019 directors' remuneration report at its annual shareholder meeting in London, which set out plans to increase Chief Executive Bill Winters' pension allowance among other measures.
Investors were also frustrated as the bank failed to cap pension contributions as a percentage of base salary, instead calculating against a bigger total salary base.
The letter from Field closed by asking whether the remuneration committee shared the views of Winters, as reported in the Financial Times https://on.ft.com/2y0P0tS, where the chief executive called investors ""immature"" for voting against his pay package.
Winters and remuneration committee Chair Christine Hodgson said earlier they believed the pension allowances paid to executives were in line with British corporate governance codes, even though the bank's definition of basic salary includes fixed-pay allowances paid in shares as well as cash salary."

When asked for more details about why flights had been suspended and what security arrangements the airline was reviewing, a spokeswoman responded: ""We never discuss matters of security.""
Three Egyptian airport security sources told Reuters that British staff had been checking security at Cairo airport on Wednesday and Thursday. They gave no further details.
The British Foreign Office updated its travel advisory on Saturday to add a reference to the British Airways' suspension, advising travelers affected to contact the airline.
Egypt's Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement late on Saturday that it had contacted the British Embassy in Cairo which had confirmed that the decision to suspend the flights was not issued by Britain's transport or foreign ministries.
The Egyptian ministry added that it will add more flights from Cairo to London starting on Sunday ""to facilitate transporting passengers during this period.""
The British government has long advised against all but essential travel by air to and from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where a Russian passenger jet was bombed in 2015, but has not issued similar warnings against air travel to and from Cairo.
""There's a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK,"" the British advisory says. 
Tourism, a key source of foreign revenue for Egypt, has been recovering after tourist numbers dropped in the wake of a 2011 uprising and the 2015 bombing of the Russian jet, which killed all 224 people on board shortly after takeoff.

That attack, which was claimed by Islamic State, prompted Russia to halt all flights to Egypt for several years and a number of countries including Britain to cease flights to Sharm el Sheikh, which have yet to resume.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>","Rating agencies knew of stress at India's IL&FS, but gave good ratings: audit","By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies for years assigned high ratings to India's Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its group companies despite its deteriorating finances, according to a special audit.
Audit firm Grant Thornton was appointed by IL&FS' new board to conduct the review following the government's decision to take charge of the group after its defaults on debt obligations sparked fears of financial contagion. 
Grant Thornton reviewed the role of five credit rating agencies -- Fitch group's India Ratings and Research, the Indian affiliate of Moody's, ICRA, Standard & Poor's local unit Crisil, CARE Ratings and Brickwork Ratings India -- which assigned 429 ratings to various IL&FS financial instruments in recent years.
In a 105-page report, reviewed by Reuters on Saturday, Grant Thornton said the agencies raised multiple concerns on IL&FS group's financial stress and liquidity position between June 2012 and June 2018, but continued to assign ""consistently high"" ratings which were only downgraded or reversed last year.
""Various strategies deployed by the then key officials of IL&FS group and certain favors/gifts provided to rating agency officials suggest the possible reasons for consistent good ratings provided to IL&FS group,"" said Grant Thornton in its report that detailed gifts or favors such as smartwatches and tickets to overseas sporting events. 
IL&FS declined to comment. India Ratings said the Grant Thornton report is based on ""partial and selective source material"", adding ""our ratings were based on robust and transparent analysis of relevant information"".
Brickwork said it did not assign the highest ratings to IL&FS ""because it follows robust, transparent and consistent rating methodology"" and its actions were not influenced by any commercial pressures or rating withdrawal requests.
ICRA said it will determine an appropriate course of action and was examining the report, which it said ignores the ""alleged fraud perpetrated by former IL&FS management"".
Crisil and CARE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The IL&FS crisis that started last year has sparked a series of federal probes into the firm's operations, but Grant Thornton's report raises questions on whether rating agencies misled investors about the stress levels at other companies in India's shadow banking sector, where new fractures are emerging.
 Dewan Housing Finance  Corp (NS:DWNH), another top firm in the sector, last week warned its financial situation was dire, raising more worries about the sector's health and signaling the crisis was far from over.
""These instances show a glimpse into the incestuous financial services industry where quid pro quo has become the norm. The rot ... is deep and needs more cleansing,"" said Shriram Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at proxy advisory firm InGovern. 
FOOTBALL TICKETS, SMART WATCHES
Grant Thornton's review of communication between former IL&FS employees and ratings agencies found the company at times ""used to potentially pressurize"" rating firms to withdraw their assessment if the company did not receive a favorable rating.
It also found instances where credit rating agencies would meet with IL&FS employees and then decide not to downgrade the ratings they had initially decided on, the report said.
""It appears that various potential strategies noted above were applied to ensure favorable ratings or to avoid the rating downgrade,"" Grant Thornton said.
Highlighting ""potential favors/gifts"", Grant Thornton said various key officials at rating agencies received gifts such as smartwatches, shirts and coasters.
E-mail communication showed a former IL&FS employee had facilitated the purchase of a villa at a steep discount for the wife of a senior Fitch executive, while another had arranged football tickets for a Brickwork Ratings executive to a Real Madrid game, the report added. 
Brickwork said it had shared ""a detailed response"" on this specific allegation with IL&FS' new management. Fitch in a statement said the employee involved had violated the agency's code of conduct and was no longer employed.

India's market regulator has toughened regulations for credit rating agencies over the past three years to boost monitoring and bring clarity for investors. Following the IL&FS crisis, the regulator last month ordered enhanced disclosure norms for such agencies.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2019 10:36AM ET</span>",Ryanair Irish pilot union to decide on strike ballot next week,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Members of Ryanair's Irish pilot union are to decide next week whether to join British colleagues in holding a ballot on strike action, according to a memo distributed to members.
Ryanair pilots in Britain, the Irish airline's largest market, last week announced a ballot that could lead to strike action in late August, citing disagreements over pay and conditions.
Ryanair pilots who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA) will meet in Dublin on Tuesday to decide whether to hold a ballot for ""industrial action up to and including strike action"", with voting to begin on or before Thursday, July 25, the memo said.
It did not say when possible strike action would take place.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, suffered a series of damaging strikes last year after the carrier bowed to pressure in late 2017 to recognize unions for the first time.
Management say significant progress has been made since, with collective labor agreements concluded with a number of pilot unions throughout Europe.
But IALPA said in the memo that management had failed to agree pay, terms and conditions for directly employed pilots. The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) last week said issues included pensions, maternity benefits and a fair, transparent pay structure.
Ryanair, which says it offers better conditions than low-cost rivals for Boeing pilots, declined to comment on the union action.
On Tuesday, Ryanair said it had been forced to halve its growth plans for 2020 due to delays in the delivery of Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX jet and planned to start talks with airports and unions about downsizing or closing some operations from November 2019."

CBS television stations in over a dozen U.S. cities, including New York and Los Angeles, went dark for DirecTV customers effective 0200 ET (0600 GMT), CBS said in a statement on Saturday.
""While we continue to negotiate in good faith and hope that AT&T agrees to fair terms soon, this loss of CBS programming could last a long time,"" CBS added, as the companies blamed one another for the deal's collapse. 
CBS, the network with hit shows like ""NCIS"" and ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" is directing customers to a website called ""KeepCBS.com"", where they are urged to mail, call or post messages onto DirecTV's social media pages.
In a separate statement AT&T said that they ""were willing to continue to negotiate and also offered to pay CBS an unprecedented rate increase."" 
In March, AT&T renewed its contract with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) avoiding a blackout of MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central for users of the telecom carrier's pay TV service DirecTV. 

CBS had informed its users on Tuesday that they should be prepared for a blackout from June 19, unless an agreement was reached with AT&T.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2019 04:16AM ET</span>",Carlos Ghosn sues Nissan-Mitsubishi in the Netherlands: paper,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn has launched a court case in the Netherlands against Japanese carmakers Nissan Motor (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211), who ousted him as chairman of their alliance last year on charges of embezzlement, Dutch newspaper NRC reported on Saturday.
Ghosn is seeking 15 million euros ($16.8 million) in damages from the carmakers, as grave mistakes were made when he was sacked, NRC reported, citing his lawyer.
""In the Netherlands, if you want to fire an executive you have to first tell him what he's being accused of, and you have to provide him with the evidence for the accusations. Neither of those things has happened,"" lawyer Laurens de Graaf told NRC.
Ghosn fell from grace late last year when he was arrested in Japan and sacked by Nissan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies. He has also been fired as the CEO and chairman of French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA).
Ghosn was freed in April from jail in Japan on a $4.5 million bail.
Among other charges of fraud and misconduct, Nissan and Mitsubishi have said Ghosn improperly received $9 million in compensation from their joint venture.
Suspect expenses Ghosn made when he chaired Renault and Nissan amounted to about 11 million euros, Renault's board said in June.
Ghosn holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, but opted for the fiscally more friendly Netherlands as his tax domicile in 2012. The holding company for the Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is also incorporated in the Netherlands.
The district court in Amsterdam is reviewing the case but has not set a trial date yet, NRC said."
216,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2019 03:44AM ET</span>",Puerto Rico governor faces calls for impeachment over chats,"By Andrew Hay
(Reuters) - Several U.S. Democratic presidential candidates and lawmakers on Friday demanded Puerto Rico's governor step down over offensive chat messages, as thousands on the Caribbean island staged a seventh day of protests to seek his resignation.
Banging pots and pans and chanting ""Ricky Resign!,"" Puerto Ricans streamed into San Juan's old city on Friday night and called on Ricardo Rossello to quit over the misogynistic and homophobic messages.
The chats, from a Telegram message group and referring mainly to politicians and officials, were published on Saturday.
The leak, running to 889 pages, added to Rossello's woes after two former officials were arrested by the FBI last week as part of a federal corruption probe in the U.S. territory.
The protests have also tapped into simmering resentment over Rossello's handling of devastating hurricanes in 2017 and alleged corruption as Puerto Rico's fragile economy struggles to recover from the island's bankruptcy.
U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard joined the protests in San Juan, saying she wanted to ""stand up to corruption,"" as other Democratic presidential candidates including Julian Castro and Elizabeth Warren also called for Rossello to quit.
""We must stand with la isla. Rossello must resign,"" tweeted U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, whose mother was born in Puerto Rico.
The island's nonvoting representative in the U.S. Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez, earlier called for his resignation, while Rossello's press secretary Dennise Perez resigned, saying she could no longer hold the position after she was called corrupt in front of her son.
""It’s your turn, Ricky,"" protesters chanted on the street after word spread that Perez had stepped aside. 
Rossello, who is affiliated with the U.S. Democratic Party, has refused to step down but said he would hold an emergency meeting with leaders of Puerto Rico's New Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, which he leads.
Puerto Rico House Speaker Carlos Mendez on Friday announced the creation of an independent committee to determine whether the center-right politician engaged in illegal activity in the chats. The group has ten days to deliver its findings.
The island's bar association published a report citing clear grounds to impeach the 40-year-old former scientist, based on the ""depravity"" of his messages.
The chats, revealed by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism, showed how Rossello and allies exchanged vulgar memes and comments as well as privileged information.
While opposition legislators back impeachment, the process has yet to gain critical support from lawmakers in Rossello's ruling party. 
But politicians like Gonzalez are increasingly concerned about Puerto Rico's ""anarchic"" image after clashes in San Juan this week and allegations the two administration officials arrested by the FBI stole government funds.
The violence and political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the U.S. territory's bankruptcy process. It has also raised concerns with U.S. lawmakers who are weighing the island's requests for billions of federal dollars for healthcare and hurricane recovery efforts.
""The island cannot afford to lose already approved federal resources, nor the ones we are working to obtain,"" Gonzalez said in her letter to Rossello urging him to step aside.

217,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2019 03:01AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Stock Market Setting Itself up for Disappointment?
With just 11 days to go until the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting, fears are running high that the central bank may not deliver the half-percentage-point rate cut that many deem necessary to keep the market rally alive.
And for good reason.
The U.S. consumer, the engine of the economy, remains solid, showing little willingness to rein in spending thanks to record low unemployment.
Manufacturing, an area of economy that has been upended by the U.S.-China trade war, sprung a surprise result as the Philly Fed, a gauge of manufacturing activity, hit its highest level in a year.
The pace of inflation, which has eluded the Fed’s 2% target, showed some signs of life, as long-term inflation expectations rebounded in June, University of Michigan data showed Friday.
Against this seemingly solid economic backdrop, many fear that the market could be setting itself up for disappointment if the Fed fails to engage in aggressive easing.
Goldman Sachs recently estimated that if the Fed does not deliver the four rate cuts expected by the market, financial conditions could tighten and that could cost the stock market a 7% drop.
Expectations for an aggressive rate cut were dealt a further blow late in the week as St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said that a quarter-percentage-point cut, rather than a half-percentage-point cut, would be appropriate this month.
A glimpse of what may come should the Fed fail to deliver played out in markets this week. Stocks fell late Friday on a Wall Street Journal report that a cut of 25 basis points is now what the FOMC is signalling.
2. Newly Public Player Helps Pet Care ETF PAWZ
Pet supplies delivery company  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) reported its first quarterly results since its initial public offering this week.
While the company is still losing money, investors were encouraged as revenue came in about in line with forecasts at $1.1 billion and its net loss narrowed to $29.6 million from $59.8 million in the year-ago period.
There was also an ancillary benefit for some investors as Chewy helped the ProShares Pet Care ETF (NYSE:PAWZ), which is sitting just a little below its 52-week high.
Chewy is the fourth-largest holding in the ETF, ranked by market value. Other significant names in the fund include Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX),  Covetrus  (NASDAQ:CVET) and Pets at Home Group (LON:PETSP). A little more than 59% of the fund’s holding are based in the U.S., with the U.K. second at about 19%.
The fund began trading in November 2018. Year to date it’s up 17.6% based on net asset value and up 18.1% based on market price.
ProShares notes that trends in pet ownership look beneficial to the sector in the years to come.
“Baby boomers the largest generation in history, are entering a new phase of life as empty nesters and retirees,” ProShares said.
Ten years ago 34% of those over 70 had pets, but as baby boomers retired that percentage rose to 40%, it said.
Millennials are also embracing pet ownership until, or in some cases instead of, having children, ProShares added.
“And for those who don’t have a pet, 43% say they want one in the future.”
3. Value Making a Comeback?
Value stocks have been underperforming growth stocks, but a rotation in leadership looks to be on the cards for the second half of the year, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase.
Global value stocks look “extremely cheap” compared to global growth stocks, analysts said in a note this week.
“For the sustained reversal of value underperformance one needs to see bottoming out in bond yields and in PMIs, in our view,” JPMorgan said. “It is encouraging that U.S. 10-year bond yield is holding above 2% and that US labor market dataflow is resilient, especially the jobless claims.”
“The falling bond yields have weighed on the performance of value, however we note that a sizeable gap has opened up between the level of yields and the relative performance of value in the past two years,” it added.
Analysts are predicting equities to rose 15% in the second half of the year."

The Guangdong Hengjian Investment Holding Corporation, the Guangzhou Urban Construction Investment Group and the Shenzhen Penghang Equity Investment Fund will each inject 10 billion yuan into the airline, as part of the country's efforts to diversify ownership structures among state-owned firms.
The move will significantly improve the company's debt-to-asset ratio, generate funds for its growth and help modernize its decision-making mechanisms, the announcement said.
It will also use the funds to serve its main air transportation business, pay for construction related to China's Belt and Road Initiative and support aviation development in cities in the southern province of Guangdong.
China Southern is one of 96 enterprises owned and administered directly by the central government. Its profits slumped nearly 50% last year as a result of rising fuel costs and a weak yuan currency."
219,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2019 01:56AM ET</span>",U.S. to grant final approval to American Airlines-Qantas joint venture: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) on Friday granted American Airlines Group Inc and Qantas Airways Ltd final approval to operate a joint venture after a prior effort was rejected in 2016.
The department last month had issued an order tentatively approving the agreement and granting antitrust immunity to the airlines covering international service. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced the approval on Friday afternoon, noting it was the first completed review of an airline joint venture proposal during the Trump administration.
Reuters was the first to report on the planned announcement earlier on Friday.
An application for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was rejected in November 2016 by former President Barack Obama's DOT. It tentatively concluded after a 17-month review that the venture ""would reduce competition and consumer choice.""
The deal will allow the airlines to coordinate planning, pricing, sales and frequent flyer programs, with new options and customer service improvements. The two OneWorld alliance carriers are planning up to three new routes within the first two years as well as increased capacity on existing routes, the department has said.
American Airlines did not immediately comment on Friday, but Chief Executive Doug Parker said last month the joint venture would also create new jobs in the airlines and industries.
In June, JetBlue Airways Corp told the DOT that it took no position on the alliance, but said it would ""substantially reduce competition in relevant markets and concentrate a huge level of market share and power in the hands of immunized alliances.""
It also said the three major global airline alliances - OneWorld, SkyTeam and StarAlliance - will control 86% of the U.S.-Australia market.
U.S. regulators in 2001 approved similar joint venture agreements for United Airlines and Air New Zealand Ltd, and in 2011 for Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Virgin Australia.
The U.S. DOT is, however, requiring American and Qantas to perform a self-assessment of the venture's impact on competition seven years after it takes effect and report their findings to the government.
Regulators in Australia and New Zealand approved the first application for the joint venture before it was initially rejected by the U.S. DOT.
American and Qantas in February 2018 made a second attempt to gain U.S. regulatory permission under President Donald Trump's administration for a venture that would let them coordinate prices and schedules. They threatened to cancel services if it was rejected and argued it could ""unlock"" up to $310 million annually in consumer benefits.
The revised application made significant changes, including removing a provision that would have barred either carrier from code-sharing with other carriers. Code-sharing allows two or more carriers to publish and advertise a single flight under their own flight number.
The airlines argued in their 2018 application that the venture would lead to lower fares and higher capacity as a ""more viable third competitor,"" and drive other carriers to improve quality, schedules and prices.
Qantas said last year the joint venture would allow the two airlines to ""significantly improve service"" and ""stimulate demand.""

The airlines said the agreement could generate up to 180,000 new trips between the United States and Australia and New Zealand annually.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 09:14PM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Prospect of Fed cut pushing dividend investors into tech, energy","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month is pushing yield-oriented U.S. fund managers further afield in search of income at attractive prices.
While nearly half of the companies in the S&P 500 have a higher dividend yield than the roughly 2.04% yield that benchmark 10-year Treasuries now offer, value-conscious fund managers say they are hesitant to buy shares of companies in dividend-rich utilities or the real estate sector because their valuations are well above historical norms. Instead, fund managers say, they are picking up yield in sectors ranging from energy to technology.
""You can't just throw a dart because some of these typical safe-havens are trading at much higher market multiples than they typically do,"" said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager of the $25 million Hodges Blue Chip Equity Income fund. ""It's hard for me to buy a utility company when I could buy a company like  Home Depot ,"" which increased its dividend by 32% in March and will likely benefit from a pick-up in the housing market, he said.
Shares of Home Depot Inc (N:HD) yield 2.52% and are up nearly 25% year-to-date, as of Thursday's market close, compared with a roughly 18% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. The S&P 500 as a whole yields 2.38%. 
With negative bond yields in Japan and Europe, the Fed will likely keep U.S. interest rates low for a ""very long time,"" Bradshaw said, putting a premium on companies that can grow their dividends and maintain their yields. 
Other fund managers are rotating out of the bond market in search of income from equities, which they say appear to offer more sustainable sources of yield. 
""Obviously, equities are yielding more than bonds here and that's the game that everybody has to play,"" said David Clott, a co-portfolio manager of the $1.3 billion Westwood Income Opportunity fund. ""The low yields in the fixed-income market are making you take risk elsewhere."" 
As a result, Clott has been reducing his exposure to Treasuries and adding shares of companies like AT&T Inc (N:T), which yields 6.13% and has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 12.9. Shares of the company, which plans to launch a streaming service next year to compete with Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), are up 16% for the year-to-date. 
Robert Leininger, portfolio manager of the $2.4 billion Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust closed-end fund, said he has been adding to his stake in companies such as alcoholic beverage company  Molson Coors  Brewing Co (N:TAP) and energy giant Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) whose share prices have underperformed this year. Molson Coors, for instance, is down 3.8% for the year-to-date and offers a dividend yield of 3.02%, while Schlumberger is up 5.5% over the same time and yields 5.18%. 
""It's been a market that has been focused on growth investing for close to a decade now,"" Leininger said, unduly punishing otherwise-strong companies that may hit temporary road bumps. 
Michael Barclay, a portfolio manager of the $15.1 billion Columbia Dividend Income fund, said he is focusing on picking up income in the technology sector because its strong growth rates will allow companies to increase their dividend payments over time.
While Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) are among his fund's largest holdings, Barclay has also been looking more recently to semi-conductor companies, which are insulated by high barriers to entry and have high free cash flows at a time when other high-dividend sectors like consumer staples have been increasing their leverage. 

""At this point in the cycle, it's really important to focus on the balance sheet and have as much confidence that you can that a dividend is not going to be cut,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Friday following a report that the Federal Reserve plans to cut interest rates by only a quarter-percentage point at the end of the month.
The benchmark S&P 500 erased earlier marginal gains after a Wall Street Journal report on the Fed's plans. According to the report, while the U.S. central bank is not prepared to make a bigger 50-basis-point cut, it may make further rate cuts in the future given concerns about a decline in global economic growth and uncertainty about trade.
On Thursday, stocks had risen as comments from New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) increased hopes of a bigger rate cut. Later that day, however, a New York Fed representative said Williams' comments were not intended to telegraph any hints about upcoming Fed policy actions.
""It appears that the Fed has communicated its message,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""They're basically trying to clarify their policy.""
Futures market odds of a 50-basis-point cut at the Fed's July meeting soared to 71% late Thursday immediately after Williams' speech but fell to 22.5% on Friday, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.
The expiration of options on Friday likely amplified the market reaction to the report, said Dennis Dick, head of markets structure at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.
""It's been one of those days where you get a lot of chop,"" he said. ""This is often on the third Friday of the month. The traders are expecting this.""

For the week, the Dow lost 0.64%, the S&P fell 1.23% and the Nasdaq shed 1.19%.
Earlier on Friday, U.S. stocks had edged higher as strong results from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) momentarily buoyed technology stocks. Microsoft shares ended marginally higher, up 0.1%, but the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) fell 0.55%.
Second-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies are now estimated to rise 1%, according to Refinitiv IBES data, in a reversal from earlier expectations of a small drop.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares gained 4.5%, despite the planemaker's disclosure that it would take a $4.9 billion after-tax hit from the grounding of its 737 MAX, indicating that investors had expected more severe repercussions.
Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) shares rose 4.6% after the railroad operator posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Its shares helped the Dow Jones Transport index (DJT) gain 0.6%.
Shares of  American Express  Co (N:AXP) slipped 2.8% after the credit card issuer warned of higher operating costs this year as it spends heavily on rewards programs to attract customers. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

""There is this problem, the U.S. unilaterally imposed these sanctions on Iran.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 04:01PM ET</span>",Airbus mimics nature with 'Bird of Prey' concept plane,"RAF FAIRFORD, England (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Friday unveiled a concept aircraft with splayed wingtips and a fanned tail inspired by the feathers of an eagle as it experiments with “biomimicry” technology that could eventually lead to quieter landings and less pollution.
The European planemaker's UK subsidiary sought to capture the imagination of future engineers by showing off a model of the raptor-like airliner at a military air show in England.
The propeller-driven aircraft would have individually controlled ""feathers"" on the wingtips to provide what Airbus calls ""active flight control"" used by an eagle or a falcon.
Also evident is the absence of a traditional vertical tail, relying instead on a split, wedge-shaped tail to reduce drag.
The regional aircraft would carry as many as 80 passengers up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) and burn 30% to 50% less fuel than today's equivalent planes, Airbus said.
Inaugurating the display to curious military chiefs and visitors to the Royal International Air Tattoo, Britain's Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it highlighted Britain's technical capability and its attractiveness as a place to invest.
Airbus said its concept plane would have a geodesic or curved fuselage in a throwback to the contours of the Wellington bomber designed by British aircraft designer Barnes Wallis.

(Reuters) - Oilfield firm Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) on Friday named Chief Operating Officer Olivier Le Peuch as chief executive as the company looks to shore up its world-leading position in oil and gas technology services.
The oilfield services provider also posted higher-than-expected second-quarter revenue and a year-over-year profit increase, as demand in international markets countered weakness in North America.
Its earnings of 35 cents a share were in line with analysts' expectations, but shares fell as much as 3% in early trading amid forecasts for continued soft demand for oilfield services in North America. 
""North America remains a challenging environment,"" Le Peuch told investors on Friday during a conference call, pointing to softer pricing and an overcapacity of equipment, particularly in hydraulic fracturing.
Le Peuch, 55, said Wall Street estimates of a 42 cent-per-share third-quarter profit were achievable, but added there was ""no visible upside."" The company earned 46 cents a share a year earlier.
Byron Pope, an oilfield analyst at investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said Le Peuch, who takes over Aug. 1, did not say how his strategy would deviate from that of outgoing CEO Paal Kibsgaard, adding that disappointing drilling margins initially could have sent shares lower. 
Mark Papa, an investor who built EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) into one of the most profitable U.S. shale companies, will become non-executive chairman, replacing Kibsgaard, 52, the company said. Kibsgaard signaled that finance chief Simon Ayat will retire, without setting a date. 
Schlumberger will pay Kibsgaard $2 million annually for the next three years to provide transition consulting services, the company said. 
Le Peuch will receive a $1.4 million salary increase on his base pay of $1 million, according to a regulatory filing. He will be eligible for a bonus of 150% of his base salary, and share grants valued at roughly $10.5 million.
In 2018, Kibsgaard's total compensation was $16.2 million, down from $20.8 million the year prior, according to a February proxy statement.
Schlumberger has benefited from a modest uptick in international markets since 2018 after a prolonged slump in oil prices. But its earnings have been hampered by heavy investments and softer demand for some services.
International revenue rose 8% year-over-year to $5.46 billion in the quarter, but revenue in North America fell 11%, to $2.8 billion.
Under Le Peuch, the company will continue to move away from capital intensive projects, such as its Schlumberger Production Management (SPM) unit. It also aims to sell some of its SPM investments in Canada and Argentina, executives said. Ayat said the company is in the process of divesting three businesses that could generate proceeds of around $1 billion. 
Net income rose about 14% to $492 million in the second quarter. Excluding items, the company earned 35 cents per share, in line with Wall Street estimates. 
The Houston-based company reported revenue of $8.27 billion, beating estimates of $8.11 billion.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>",Trump tells France's Macron U.S. concerned with proposed digital services tax,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday and expressed concerns about the country's proposed digital services tax, the White House said.
The two leaders also discussed ongoing efforts to ensure Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.
Trump ordered an investigation on Wednesday into France's planned tax on technology companies, a move that could lead the United States to impose new tariffs or other trade restrictions. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement the administration was concerned the tax would unfairly target American companies.
The so-called Section 301 investigation gives Lighthizer up to a year to investigate whether the tax would hurt U.S. technology companies and whether it amounts to an unfair trade practice. Similar probes in the past have dealt with Chinese trade practices and European Union subsidies on large commercial aircraft.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in March that a 3% tax on the French revenue of large internet companies could yield 500 million euros ($563 million) a year.

USTR said in a statement the ""services covered are ones where U.S. firms are global leaders. The structure of the proposed new tax as well as statements by officials suggest that France is unfairly targeting the tax at certain U.S.-based technology companies.""

228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",Venezuela Political Chaos Deepens With Third Claim to Presidency,"(Bloomberg) -- If Venezuelan politics weren’t convoluted enough, they just got a bit more complicated this week.
The opposition-aligned Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Advance party hired Ari Ben-Menashe, a Montreal-based lobbyist, to “pursue Henri Falcon’s election as President of Venezuela,” according to a contract filed with the U.S. Justice Department.
Days after the public filing, Falcon and his advisers are walking back the purpose of the $200,000 contract. An amended document, obtained by Bloomberg News, said their main aim is “to pursue a peaceful solution to Venezuela’s economic, humanitarian and political crisis.” Progressive Advance said in a press release that it was “absurd” to consider a presidential candidacy for Falcon.
The former Lara state governor didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Falcon lost to President Nicolas Maduro in a widely criticized election last May. That led the U.S. and more than 50 governments to recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaido as the nation’s rightful leader this January, when Maduro’s second-term began.
The lobbying effort underscores an ongoing rift within Venezuela’s opposition, even as roughly four-fifths of Venezuelans share a negative view of Maduro’s government. Last year, the nation’s main opposition bloc boycotted what it called a sham vote pitting Maduro against Falcon and televangelist Javier Bertucci.
In the contract, Progressive Advance said it’s working with Ben-Menashe’s firm to establish contact with Washington and Moscow to seek a solution to the country’s crisis. The party has proposed an oil-for-food program in which Venezuela could export oil to the U.S. and the profits would be used exclusively to buy food for the nation. At the moment, hyperinflation makes it almost impossible for most Venezuelans to buy the food they need.
Maduro’s government and opposition officials representing Guaido started negotiations in May, sponsored by Norway, seeking to find a solution to Venezuela’s political and economic crisis. The most recent talks ended Wednesday in Barbados with no deal. Guaido’s representatives pushed for early presidential elections, according to two lawmakers with direct knowledge of the matter."

(Reuters) -  American Express  Co (N:AXP) warned of higher operating costs this year as the credit card issuer spends heavily on rewards programs to attract customers in an increasingly crowded market, sending its shares down 2.5% on Friday.
AmEx cards, for long the preferred choice of affluent Americans, is now battling competition from JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) Sapphire Reserve and  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) Prestige Card.
AmEx has been ramping up its reward programs on its cards and striking partnership deals with a number of companies in a move to attract and retain customers. The company in 2018 renewed a partnership with Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) that rewards customers with air miles.
Card reward expenses jumped 9% in the second quarter to $2.65 billion, compared with a 4% rise in the first quarter.
Total expenses rose 9.2% in the quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, while total revenue rose 8.4% to $10.84 billion.
""Customer engagement cost has been and, I expect, will continue to grow a little faster than our revenues, and so that creates a little bit of margin compression,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
AmEx said its loan portfolio increased 10% to $83.2 billion in the quarter, while loan loss provisions grew by about 7%. The company said it now expects provisions to rise 20% this year, down from its earlier forecast of mid-20% range. 
The company beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit, helped by stronger credit card spending, which rose 7% in the United States - the company's biggest market - and 5% globally in the quarter.
The growth in card spending was helped by an economy that is growing steadily, but at a modest pace compared with last year, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said.
Net income rose 8.5% to $1.76 billion, or $2.07 per share. (https://reut.rs/32ys3vT)

Analysts had expected a profit of $2.04 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) has approached  Coface  SA (PA:COFA), the credit insurance company partly owned by French bank  Natixis  SA (PA:CNAT), with an acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The potential deal would allow Natixis, owned by French cooperative lender BPCE, to cash out on its remaining 42 percent stake in Coface following an initial public offering of the company in 2014.
The deal talks between Apollo and Coface are at an early stage, and there is no certainty they will result in an agreement, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Details of the price negotiations could not be learned.
Coface did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apollo declined to comment. 
Coface shares jumped 8.4 percent on the news to 10.70 euros, giving the company a market capitalization of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion). 
Coface provides credit insurance to protect companies against potential nonpayment by their customers. It also offers debt collection, factoring and market research services to its clients.
Natixis was one of the French banks hardest hit by the crisis in 2007, when the collapse of bonds backed by poor quality mortgages - dubbed subprime - spread through financial markets. Natixis eventually had to be rescued by its parent bank, BPCE.
Natixis, France's fourth largest listed bank, has sold businesses related to retail banking such as consumer lending and factoring to BCPE for 2.7 billion euros, in order to focus on investment banking, asset management and insurance.
Apollo Global is a New York-based investor in private equity and corporate credit assets with assets under management of $303.3 billion as of the end of March.

Volkswagen announced in May that it is exploring a sale or partnership for its MAN Energy Solutions as part of a restructuring of the German cars, trucks and bus empire.
VW has held talks with Cummins, and received an offer from the U.S. company for MAN Energy Solutions, the sources said.
A Cummins spokesman said, ""We do not comment on rumors or speculation in the marketplace.""
VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess has vowed to simplify the group which has 12 brands, trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars and electric bicycles as part of its business.
MAN Energy makes large diesel engines used in ships and power stations.
A Volkswagen spokesman on Friday reiterated that VW is reviewing all options for the asset, but declined to comment further on Cummins.
Although VW has not yet appointed advisory banks for the sale, it has approached several companies to gauge their appetite for the asset, which is expected to fetch about 3 billion euros, the sources said.
To maximize price, Volkswagen has also engaged in talks with Advent-owned engine maker Jenbacher, a former  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) business, as well as at least one Asian peer, they added. Advent decline to comment.
Peers Mitsubishi Heavy (T:7011) and Wartsila (HE:WRT1V) have been named as possible bidders in the past.
""Volkswagen originally wanted to strike a sweetheart deal with Cummins, but is now opening up holding talks with some other strategic players,"" one of the people said, adding that the carmaker is hoping to sign a deal before year-end.
The VW unit, formerly known as MAN Diesel & Turbo, which also makes turbochargers used in the oil & gas industry, in 2018 reported operating earnings of 133 million euros on sales of 3.1 billion euros.
Volkswagen has struggled to slim down in the past after the company's works council, which has veto power over major restructuring moves, blocked efforts to sell motorbike brand Ducati and transmissions maker Renk.
MAN Energy Solutions was originally a part of VW's trucks brand MAN, but some of MAN's assets were transferred to Volkswagen last year as part of efforts to streamline Traton ahead of its listing."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Lenders to Jet Airways (NS:JET) agreed on Friday to provide some interim financing to the bankrupt airline to help it cover legal and other costs, as resolution experts look to find a potential buyer.
In a regulatory filing, bankruptcy resolution firm Grant Thornton said Jet's lenders had also approved the eligibility criteria for potential buyers.
The filing did not say how much interim funding had been approved, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters the lenders had agreed to provide $10 million.
The committee of creditors (CoC), via an electronic voting process, also agreed to appoint SBI Caps to help with the whole resolution process.
SBI Caps, the investment banking arm of  State Bank of India  (SBI) (NS:SBI), previously led an unsuccessful sale process for the airline before it was dragged to bankruptcy court.
The source said Grant Thornton planned to open bidding for the airline on Saturday. The only criterion for bidders will be having a net worth of 10 billion Indian rupees ($145 million), added the source.
This is similar to the parameter used when lenders initially tried to sell the airline. Bidding is likely to be open for 15 days and may be extended if there are no suitors, said the source.
Last month, Jet's creditors, led by SBI, took the airline to bankruptcy court after failing to agree on a revival plan.
Financial creditors, who have the first right to proceeds recovered from a bankruptcy resolution, have submitted claims worth 102 billion rupees out of which 85 billion have been admitted. Apart from this, about 2,400 operational creditors have made claims worth some 123.72 billion rupees, according to reports."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, took in less cash last quarter as investors moved into lower-cost bond funds, and it made less money lending out stocks.
The company, manager of $6.8 trillion in assets, missed analysts' estimates for quarterly sales and profits on Friday, despite attracting $151 billion in new money, as much of that cash moved into lower-fee fixed income funds and accounts used to store cash.
The company's revenue for the three months through June 30 fell 2.2% to $3.52 billion from a year earlier, affected also by some fee cuts the company has made and lower fees for attaining performance targets.
""While lower fee rates is a headwind that will likely continue, we believe BlackRock is happy to accept modest pricing declines in order to take large amounts of market share,"" said Kyle Sanders, analyst at Edward Jones, which maintains its buy rating on BlackRock shares. 
Lower demand to borrow stocks also hurt fees. The borrowers are typically hedge funds that want to ""short"" those shares, selling the stocks and hoping to buy them back later at a lower cost.
""I can't control that; that’s more environmental,"" said BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in an interview.
Shortseller Andrew Left of Citron Capital said in a recent investment letter that, because of the market rally, ""it has been an extraordinarily challenging environment to be a short seller."" The benchmark S&P 500 overcame an escalation in the U.S.-China trade fight to close the first six months of this year up 17%, the best first-half performance for the index since 1997. 
Investors did pour more money into BlackRock's actively managed funds aimed at beating the market over the low-fee passive-investment products. The company also reported 20% growth in its business unit that licenses software and other technology to other financial companies.
""The trend going into the second half is very positive,"" Fink said. ""Things we can control ... were exceptional. It was probably one of our finest quarters in years of flows, in terms of engagement, and more importantly, when I talk about BlackRock, no organization has a combination of passive, active and technology.""
Meanwhile, BlackRock said its iShares-branded ETFs took in $36.10 billion of new money, up from $30.69 billion in the preceding quarter.
Net income attributable to New York-based BlackRock fell to $1 billion, or $6.41 per share, from $1.07 billion, or $6.62 per share, a year earlier.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 09:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Tsingshan roils nickel market with buying spree,"By Pratima Desai and Tom Daly
LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese firm Tsingshan Holding Group has been buying large quantities of stainless steel ingredient nickel on the London Metal Exchange (LME) to supplement its own output, two sources familiar with the matter said.
They could not specify the amounts Tsingshan has bought.
Nickel prices slid to their lowest for the year in the second quarter as investment funds sold on the expectation of slowing demand from Chinese stainless steel mills as economic activity came under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war.
But as unexpectedly higher demand numbers started to trickle out, the same funds rushed to cut their bets on lower prices.
In the middle of that, sources said, Tsingshan bought heavily and the market started to worry about top producer Indonesia banning shipments of ore from 2022.
""Tsingshan has been buying on the LME, they are short of nickel because stainless steel production didn't fall as people thought it would,"" one nickel trading source said.
Tsingshan did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment, via phone and email.
Sources said Tsingshan plans to produce 10 million tonnes of stainless steel this year. Analysts say it will need more than 400,000 tonnes of nickel in 2019 compared with the 250,000 tonnes plus it has access to.
""Its 300 series stainless output in China in the first half is up 25 percent year-on-year,"" a nickel industry source said.
The 300 series typically uses 8.0-8.5% nickel compared with 200 series stainless steel with only 1-2.5% nickel and 400 series which contains no nickel.
Nearly 70% of global nickel consumption, estimated at 2.4 million tonnes this year, is accounted for by stainless steel mills, a majority of which are in China.
Wood Mackenzie analyst Sean Mulshaw estimates China's stainless steel output in the first half of this year at 14 million tonnes, up 11% from the first six months of last year.
Mulshaw expects China's output to climb 8-9% this year to 28-29 million tonnes out of a global total of 52-53 million tonnes, a 4% gain from 2018.
Higher stainless steel output and stronger than expected demand for nickel have pushed benchmark prices on the LME to above $15,000 a tonne, their highest since late June last year and a gain of more than 25% since early last month.
Nickel prices are up about 40% so far this year.
""Prices fell due to the forecast of large amounts of nickel pig iron coming from Indonesia and from the Chinese domestic market, and forecasts that the stainless steel market was weak,"" said Antaike's chief nickel analyst Xu Aidong.
""But now we know (China's) stainless steel output in the first half of 2019 increased 10%.""
Indonesia relaxed a ban to export ore in 2017. A senior government official pledged this week that authorities would enforce a ban on raw ore exports by 2022 to make miners process minerals in the country.
""A few weeks ago as stainless production numbers started to filter out, we had a short covering rally. The idea of the Indonesian ban surfaced and Tsingshan and others started buying nickel,"" another trading source said.
""The rally started in Shanghai and created an 'arb', so they bought on the LME as well.""
""Arb"" is a reference to price differences between nickel contracts on the LME and Shanghai Futures Exchange after factoring in shipping costs and taxes.
Lower prices on one exchange attract buyers, as seen in the changes in inventory at warehouses registered by the LME and those monitored by the ShFE.
Analysts say nickel prices need to be higher to incentivize new projects around the world to meet growing demand from the fast-growing electric vehicle sector, which uses rechargeable batteries containing nickel."
245,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 08:36AM ET</span>","Netflix sinks on subscriber losses, analysts still see growth","By Akanksha Rana, Supantha Mukherjee and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages stuck to a positive outlook on Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) on Thursday, betting that a strong content slate for the rest of 2019 would reverse shock second-quarter losses in U.S. subscribers that sank its stock price.
Netflix shares fell about 11% on worries about its earnings report on Wednesday that showed lower-than-expected global growth and signs of trouble in its U.S. base ahead of Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) much-awaited launch of a rival service later this year.
Netflix, whose price-to-earnings ratio is by far the largest of the five big U.S. tech companies making up the so-called FAANG group, has quadrupled in value since 2015 but at $321 per share is down $100 from 2018 peaks. The other FAANG companies are  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
The April-to-June period tends to be seasonally weak for Netflix in the United States, where warmer weather and longer days keep viewers outdoors.
Brokers Cowen & Co said Netflix had missed expectations for second-quarter subscriber numbers three times in the last four years. This year, however, the Los Gatos, California-based company set a series of aggressive price hikes, and lost U.S. subscribers for the first time in eight years.
""They raised prices in the U.S. by an average of $2 per month, and most subscribers learned about their increase during Q2,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
""I think that was a much bigger driver of churn than a dearth of content.""
STILL A BUY
Ten Wall Street brokerages cut their share price targets to reflect Thursday's fall, but did not downgrade the stock, still seen by a majority of Wall Street firms as a high-potential growth business and a clear ""buy"".
The relatively small price drop in the company's $12.6 billion of junk bonds affirmed the view that the second-quarter results are a blip. While all Netflix debt weakened on Thursday, the biggest price moves were just 2.5%, like on the 6.375% bond coming due in May 2029 worth $800 million, according to Refinitiv data.
""We're not concerned. We're still keeping to our forecast,"" said Neil Begley, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.
The credit market's faith in Netflix has allowed it to borrow at very cheap rates to fund content creation and acquisition. That is unlikely to change based on the disappointing second-quarter results, said Begley.
Netflix bond prices did not fall enough to attract bargain hunters. ""I'd be looking for a 300 basis point spread or so in a new 10-year deal as fair value,"" said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. The spread on the 6.375% bond due in 2029 is around 275, he noted, ""so I'd want a 325 basis point spread to get interested.""
While competition is set to heat up with the upcoming launches of Apple TV and Disney+, several analysts said Netflix's global reach is likely to give it an edge.
Netflix added just 2.83 million international paid streaming subscribers, compared with Street expectations of 4.8 million, but it now has 151.6 million worldwide, dwarfing its nearest rivals Amazon Prime and HBO.
""By 2025, based on Disney projections, it looks like Netflix will be spending at least five times as much on content as Disney+,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak.
""I also think Disney+ is likely to help accelerate consumers away from traditional Pay TV toward OTT (content over an internet connection) which should benefit Netflix.""
The company raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe in the quarter, testing the waters in some of its wealthiest markets at a time when it is still spending massively more than it earns to win the content battle.
Netflix began the third quarter with the release of its 1980s-set smash-hit ""Stranger Things"" and will follow with new seasons of ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""The Crown,"" as well as the eagerly awaited Martin Scorsese movie ""The Irishman.""
""We would note Netflix misses have been followed by strong quarters, and, along those lines, we expect Netflix's very strong 2H slate will lead to a rebound in sub growth,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a client note."

247,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 08:21AM ET</span>","AB InBev sells Australian brewer to Asahi, keeps Asia IPO on radar","By Philip Blenkinsop and Pamela Barbaglia
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), the world's largest brewer, is selling its Australian operations to Japan's Asahi (T:2502) for $11 billion and could revive the stalled flotation of its Asian business as it looks to cut debt.
The Belgium-based brewer, weighed down with debt after its 2016 acquisition of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB), said on Friday it had agreed to sell Australian subsidiary Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) at an enterprise value of A$16 billion ($11.3 billion).
For Asahi, the deal is its biggest ever and, according to a source close to the negotiations, will turn the Japanese firm into the world's third biggest brewer after AB InBev and  Heineken  (AS:HEIN).
The transaction comes only a week after AB InBev shelved an initial public offering (IPO) to sell a 15% stake in its Asian operations, including Australia, citing factors including unfavorable market conditions.
The source said Asahi had expressed interest in buying the Australian unit earlier this year but discussions only took off after the IPO plan collapsed.
""AB InBev was quick in re-engaging with Asahi as they could raise pretty much the same amount of cash they were aiming for with the IPO,"" the source said, adding talks took place in Hong Kong and London.
What would have been the world's largest flotation this year, raising up to $9.8 billion for AB InBev, ended up being the third-largest ever to be withdrawn. Sources close to the matter said investors had baulked at the price.
AB InBev said on Friday it still believed in the rationale of offering a minority stake of Asian business Budweiser APAC, now excluding Australia, provided it could be completed at ""the right valuation"".
The brewer, which had billed the IPO as a means to drive regional consolidation, said the Australia sale would help it to accelerate expansion into other fast-growing markets in the region and globally.
Without Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev's Asia-Pacific operations would be more skewed towards faster-growth markets such as China, where AB InBev sells more Budweiser than in the United States.
With the inclusion of Vietnam and India, too, the IPO could prove more attractive than before.
Bernstein Securities analyst Trevor Stirling said the Australia business was a profitable cash cow, but an IPO without it could yield a higher valuation.
However, a question mark would remain over AB InBev's more mature South Korean business, given that it had bought it back from private equity group KKR in 2014.
DEBT REDUCTION
The bulk of the proceeds from the Australia deal will be used to reduce debt, AB InBev said, with the deal expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
AB InBev shares were up 4.6% at 1140 GMT, among the strongest performers on the FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) as the stock more than recovered ground lost last week.
The brewer's net debt totaled $102.5 billion at the end of 2018 and its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio was at 4.6 times. It has pledged to reduce that to less than four times EBITDA by the end of 2020 and has a long-term target of two times EBITDA.
Asahi, which previously paid 9.85 billion euros ($11.1 billion) to buy AB InBev's eastern Europe business as well as the Grolsch and Peroni brands, already sells its Asahi Super Dry lager in Australia along with Schweppes.
It will also gain leading Australian beer Victoria Bitter (VB), placing Asahi in more direct competition there with Japanese rival Kirin s (T:2503), which produces the XXXX Gold brand through its Lion subsidiary.
Asahi said the deal would be debt-free and it would issue up to 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) of shares to fund it.
Rothschild and Nomura advised Asahi along with law firm Allen & Overy. Lazard and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer worked with AB InBev.
The Japanese brewer, which has been seeking overseas deals to compensate for slow growth, said net debt would temporarily exceed four times EBITDA, with its debt to equity and capitalization ratios also expected to worsen.
AB InBev said the enterprise value of the deal represented a multiple of 14.9 times EBITDA. The pricing of its shelved IPO had applied a multiple of 16-18 times for the Asian business.
Jefferies analysts said the Australia multiple was attractive for AB InBev and would cut its net debt this year to $87 billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.9, achieving its target a year early."

Basel-based Syngenta was bought in 2017 by state-owned ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] for $43 billion, which aims to capitalise on the group's agricultural technology.
Syngenta's first-half sales fell 7% to $6.8 billion, while net income tumbled 34% to $798 million, in part due to the bad weather and global issues.
Chief financial officer Mark Patrick, when asked whether Syngenta faced any legal action relating to week-killing agent glyphosate, said the company had not been named in litigation involving glyphosate.
""To date, Syngenta has not been named in any of the glyphosate suits,"" Mark Patrick said on a call.
Syngenta sells products based on glyphosate in some markets, but Patrick said U.S. sales have been scaled back.
""Latin America is a big user of glyphosate, and Syngenta sells that there,"" he said. ""We do not sell glyphosate solo in the United States anymore. We sell it in mixtures, but we have not sold glyphosate solo for many years."" 
Syngenta has sold glyphosate herbicide under the brand name Touchdown.
German rival Bayer (DE:BAYGn), which bought  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion last year, has faced multibillion lawsuits linked to glyphosate. More than 13,400 plaintiffs alleged the company's glyphosate weedkiller caused cancer - a claim Bayer contests.
TRADE HEADWINDS
Syngenta's first-half was hit by flooding in the United States, drought in Australia and political headwinds.
Syngenta said it was taking charges to shutter a plant in Houston, Texas, after a chemical it produces, chlorothalonil, was banned by the European Union this year on concern over risks to bees, waterways, fish, and humans. [https:// Global trade spats also took their toll.  In the United States, soybean growers this year were left sitting on record volumes of beans after China halted purchases, while the U.S. has imposed tariffs on imports of products including Mexican tomatoes. ""It's across vegetables, obviously tomatoes are a big component of that,"" Patrick said. ""Just the economics now with these tariffs has meant it's had impacts on Mexican farmers. It goes to resolution of current trade disputes that are ongoing between the United States and a number of geographies."" Patrick reiterated ChemChina's previously announced aim of floating at least part of the company by 2022, though he said the impact of volatile weather on Syngenta's financial fortunes would play a role in a final IPO decision. 
""Mother Nature is wonderful thing, she has a great tendency to stay one or two steps in front of all of us,"" he said.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 07:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: J.C. Penney taps debt restructuring advisers - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) has hired advisers to explore debt restructuring options that would buy more time for the money-losing U.S. retailer to forge a turnaround, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The 117-year-old department store chain's move represents a high-stakes attempt to get its financial house in order before its cash coffers dwindle and its debt, totaling roughly $4 billion, comes due in the next few years. 
The Plano, Texas-based company faces fierce competition from discount retailers such as the TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains, and J.C. Penney has struggled to boost the profile of its e-commerce business to rival established players such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
While J.C. Penney has more than $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit line, investors have continued to sell off the retailer's shares in response to financial losses. Its credit rating is deep in junk territory, increasing its borrowing costs.
J.C. Penney has in recent weeks held discussions with lawyers and investment bankers who specialize in advising troubled companies on debt restructurings and other financial workouts, some of the sources said. 
The retailer, which employs 95,000 people and operates more than 860 stores, is exploring options that could include raising additional cash or negotiating with creditors to push out debt maturities, these sources said.
J.C. Penney's restructuring plans are at an early stage, one of the sources cautioned. The discussions with restructuring specialists reflect J.C. Penney's resolve to take steps in coming months to increase its financial breathing room and avoid confronting a potential bankruptcy filing down the road, the source added. 
The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. 
The deteriorating retail landscape has forced longstanding brick-and-mortar chains, including Toys “R” Us Inc and Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ), to seek bankruptcy protection in the last two years. Some retailers had to liquidate. Others, such as Neiman Marcus Ltd and J. Crew Group Inc, have managed to avoid such a reckoning by reaching agreements with creditors to restructure their debts.
GRAPPLING WITH LOSSES 
Founded in Kemmerer, Wyoming, in 1902 by James Cash Penney, the eponymous company sells mid-priced apparel, home goods, jewelry, towels and other merchandise. 
J.C. Penney is grappling with financial losses that have collectively surpassed $1.7 billion between 2014 and the first three months of this year.
The company's stock, down more than 50% over the past year despite rising U.S. consumer spending, trades just above $1, giving it a market capitalization of $342 million. Its debt trades at distressed levels
The department store chain hired a new chief executive in late 2018 who moved to stop selling appliances and limit its furniture offerings. The decisions were aimed at refocusing J.C Penney on its roots selling mid-priced apparel and other merchandise targeted at U.S. families, though analysts have questioned whether the strategy will result in a successful turnaround at a retailer that has suffered declining foot traffic at stores for years.

In May, the retailer said sales at stores open for at least a year fell more than expected during the first quarter and that its net loss nearly doubled to $154 million. Despite closing stores over the years and revamping remaining locations, analysts have expressed concern that J.C. Penney will run out of time and money to reverse its declining fortunes.

253,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Netflix’s Tight-Lipped Culture Makes It Hard to Avoid Surprises,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).’s biggest earnings surprise in years sent the shares plummeting on Thursday. It also left analysts and investors wondering why they were caught so off guard.
When some companies know that their quarterly results are going to fall short of forecasts, they put out a pre-announcement or update their guidance. But not Netflix.
Instead, the company dropped a bombshell with no warning: Its customer growth was roughly half what it projected, and Netflix actually lost U.S. subscribers during the period. That hasn’t happened since 2011, when the company made a disastrous attempt to split up its streaming and DVD-by-mail operations.
The fallout on Thursday included the worst stock rout in three years, with the shares declining 10%. The plunge wiped out about $16 billion in market value.
“You would think Netflix would want to update guidance or give a pre-annoucement, as I’m sure they definitely knew about this for a while,” said Nick Licouris, an investment adviser at Gerber Kawasaki. “But they probably didn’t want to do it because they were going to take a hit at that time or during earnings -- especially since subscriber numbers are the No. 1 thing analysts look at -- and in earnings you can spin it better than a stand-alone announcement.”
Not Necessary?
Another reason not to issue a warning: The company met most of Wall Street’s financial estimates, such as sales and profit. It was only the subscriber numbers that really came up short.
“Revenue was very close to guidance and profits were actually above, so I’d guess they didn’t think it was necessary to pre-announce a weak sub number when other financial metrics were fine,” said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
There’s also been a broader shift away from giving earnings warnings, said Huber Research Partners founder Craig Huber.
“I have noticed companies in media and internet that I follow do not seem to pre-announce pending negative results with the same regularity as years ago,” he said.
Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, didn’t have an immediate comment.
The streaming giant’s tight-lipped culture extends beyond earnings. Unlike traditional media companies, it’s very selective about the viewer information it provides. Third parties try to fill the gaps by providing their own data on Netflix’s audience, but that can be unreliable.
Third-Party Services
Those kinds of data services failed to predict the latest shortfall, Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker said in a note.
“For several days,” she said, “investors told us ‘such-and-such data service suggests domestic adds will come in line; while international might be somewhat soft.’ Wrong. I mean -- right in the sense that international was soft but totally wrong on the domestic subs part.”
Netflix also delivers its earnings in an idiosyncratic way. Instead of doing a traditional Q&A conference call, the company releases an “earnings interview” on YouTube with a single analyst. It also issues its reports on its website, not through the paid services that many companies use to disseminate information.
Though this week’s stock rout was especially severe, it’s common for Netflix’s earnings to spark a huge share move. The average change on the day after quarterly reports is almost 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Compare that with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., where it’s 4.4%. Or  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., where it’s 4.1%.
There’s another explanation for the huge swings in Netflix’s stock: overreaction. That was the message from Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings this week. It’s easy to “overinterpret” subscriber figures, he said.
“Sometimes we are forecast high, sometimes we forecast low,” he said. “We’re just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can.”

254,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 06:41AM ET</span>",Wall Street Trading Costs to Surge as New Rules Hit Derivatives,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s heavyweights are prepping their clients for bad news: Some trades are about to get a lot more expensive.
Firms including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are warning customers to get ready for new rules that require more collateral for certain trades. The regulations take effect for some clients in September, but the snare gets even tighter in 2020, when more than 1,000 hedge funds, asset managers and insurers will get caught for the first time.
The so-called uncleared-margin rules require banks and their clients to “exchange margin” for derivatives traded directly between participants instead of being cleared through an exchange. Citigroup is sounding one of the loudest alarms about potential fallout, saying in a recent report that, for one model it tested, fees at its foreign-exchange prime brokerage got 31 times more expensive if it passed along higher costs.
“It’s going to be really tough,” said Audrey Blater, a senior analyst at researcher Aite Group. “People are dragging their feet and kicking and screaming that they actually have to do something. Up until now, a lot of buy-side firms weren’t touched by the regulation to the degree that a bank is, so they’re not used to doing stuff like this.”
The regulations will hit the currency market particularly hard, because some foreign-exchange products are rarely, if ever, cleared through an exchange.
In response to the regulations, Citigroup is proposing new fees for its prime-brokerage unit -- ones that would hit not only clients but also the brokers or banks they trade with, counterparties that until now had escaped such charges.
“All participants should share in these new costs,” Citigroup said in its report. Executing brokers “should pay their fair share.”
That idea has drawn mixed reviews. Some of Citigroup’s competitors say they won’t need to raise prices. Others, such as  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA’s John O’Hara, say there’s no system in place to begin charging the executing banks, and those firms would pass the fee onto clients anyway.
“As far as charging the executing dealers, I don’t think that will get any traction,” O’Hara, head of prime brokerage and clearing in the Americas at Societe Generale, said in a telephone interview. Still, he acknowledged, “the costs of FXPB services are going to increase significantly.”
Cost Estimates
Just 20% of buy-side firms have begun to examine the impact the new rules will have on their trading costs, according to a June report from Greenwich Associates. Less than 40% of the firms would consider listed options for their currency trades when their firm becomes subject to the new margin rules, the study found.
“The only thing it can do is cause the cost of prime brokerage to me to go up,” said Michael O’Brien, director of global trading at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp. “I strongly believe that clearing is the primary solution for the uncleared margin rules when it comes to asset managers. There are a lot of complicated things to address, but I think you want to minimize the impact on the portfolio by minimizing the number of trades it impacts.”
Transaction fees and operational challenges were among the biggest obstacles to moving to a cleared model, based on responses to the Greenwich Associates study.
“Our analysis suggests these hurdles are diminishing quickly and, in some cases, may be more perceived than real,” David  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK), a principal at Greenwich Associates, said in the June report, which also noted that shifting to listed foreign-exchange options could reduce costs by as much as 70% per trade.
September 2020 is the deadline for the fifth and final phase of the new regulations, requiring firms with more than $8 billion in exposure to derivatives to begin socking away more margin, a threshold that will vastly increase the number of hedge funds and asset managers that would have to comply with the rules.
While big banks have long had large special units dedicated to managing their margin, many hedge funds and asset managers have little experience in this area. Smaller buy-side firms had at least one win this month: The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled that firms below the $50 million margin threshold don’t have to undergo the legal-documentation process.
“Phase 5 will have a big impact on the market because more of the buy-side will come into scope then,” said Ilene Froom, a partner in the financial-industry group at law firm Reed Smith LLP. “The documentation relief from the CFTC will be a big help.”"

256,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 08:21AM ET</span>","AB InBev sells Australian brewer to Asahi, keeps Asia IPO on radar","By Philip Blenkinsop and Pamela Barbaglia
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), the world's largest brewer, is selling its Australian operations to Japan's Asahi (T:2502) for $11 billion and could revive the stalled flotation of its Asian business as it looks to cut debt.
The Belgium-based brewer, weighed down with debt after its 2016 acquisition of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB), said on Friday it had agreed to sell Australian subsidiary Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) at an enterprise value of A$16 billion ($11.3 billion).
For Asahi, the deal is its biggest ever and, according to a source close to the negotiations, will turn the Japanese firm into the world's third biggest brewer after AB InBev and  Heineken  (AS:HEIN).
The transaction comes only a week after AB InBev shelved an initial public offering (IPO) to sell a 15% stake in its Asian operations, including Australia, citing factors including unfavorable market conditions.
The source said Asahi had expressed interest in buying the Australian unit earlier this year but discussions only took off after the IPO plan collapsed.
""AB InBev was quick in re-engaging with Asahi as they could raise pretty much the same amount of cash they were aiming for with the IPO,"" the source said, adding talks took place in Hong Kong and London.
What would have been the world's largest flotation this year, raising up to $9.8 billion for AB InBev, ended up being the third-largest ever to be withdrawn. Sources close to the matter said investors had baulked at the price.
AB InBev said on Friday it still believed in the rationale of offering a minority stake of Asian business Budweiser APAC, now excluding Australia, provided it could be completed at ""the right valuation"".
The brewer, which had billed the IPO as a means to drive regional consolidation, said the Australia sale would help it to accelerate expansion into other fast-growing markets in the region and globally.
Without Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev's Asia-Pacific operations would be more skewed towards faster-growth markets such as China, where AB InBev sells more Budweiser than in the United States.
With the inclusion of Vietnam and India, too, the IPO could prove more attractive than before.
Bernstein Securities analyst Trevor Stirling said the Australia business was a profitable cash cow, but an IPO without it could yield a higher valuation.
However, a question mark would remain over AB InBev's more mature South Korean business, given that it had bought it back from private equity group KKR in 2014.
DEBT REDUCTION
The bulk of the proceeds from the Australia deal will be used to reduce debt, AB InBev said, with the deal expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.
AB InBev shares were up 4.6% at 1140 GMT, among the strongest performers on the FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) as the stock more than recovered ground lost last week.
The brewer's net debt totaled $102.5 billion at the end of 2018 and its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio was at 4.6 times. It has pledged to reduce that to less than four times EBITDA by the end of 2020 and has a long-term target of two times EBITDA.
Asahi, which previously paid 9.85 billion euros ($11.1 billion) to buy AB InBev's eastern Europe business as well as the Grolsch and Peroni brands, already sells its Asahi Super Dry lager in Australia along with Schweppes.
It will also gain leading Australian beer Victoria Bitter (VB), placing Asahi in more direct competition there with Japanese rival Kirin s (T:2503), which produces the XXXX Gold brand through its Lion subsidiary.
Asahi said the deal would be debt-free and it would issue up to 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) of shares to fund it.
Rothschild and Nomura advised Asahi along with law firm Allen & Overy. Lazard and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer worked with AB InBev.
The Japanese brewer, which has been seeking overseas deals to compensate for slow growth, said net debt would temporarily exceed four times EBITDA, with its debt to equity and capitalization ratios also expected to worsen.
AB InBev said the enterprise value of the deal represented a multiple of 14.9 times EBITDA. The pricing of its shelved IPO had applied a multiple of 16-18 times for the Asian business.
Jefferies analysts said the Australia multiple was attractive for AB InBev and would cut its net debt this year to $87 billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.9, achieving its target a year early."

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",Syngenta CFO says it faces no glyphosate lawsuits,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Agricultural chemical maker Syngenta on Friday reported a 34% fall in first-half net income, showing the impact of U.S. trade disputes with China and Mexico as well as bad weather in some of its markets.
Basel-based Syngenta was bought in 2017 by state-owned ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] for $43 billion, which aims to capitalise on the group's agricultural technology.
Syngenta's first-half sales fell 7% to $6.8 billion, while net income tumbled 34% to $798 million, in part due to the bad weather and global issues.
Chief financial officer Mark Patrick, when asked whether Syngenta faced any legal action relating to week-killing agent glyphosate, said the company had not been named in litigation involving glyphosate.
""To date, Syngenta has not been named in any of the glyphosate suits,"" Mark Patrick said on a call.
Syngenta sells products based on glyphosate in some markets, but Patrick said U.S. sales have been scaled back.
""Latin America is a big user of glyphosate, and Syngenta sells that there,"" he said. ""We do not sell glyphosate solo in the United States anymore. We sell it in mixtures, but we have not sold glyphosate solo for many years."" 
Syngenta has sold glyphosate herbicide under the brand name Touchdown.
German rival Bayer (DE:BAYGn), which bought  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion last year, has faced multibillion lawsuits linked to glyphosate. More than 13,400 plaintiffs alleged the company's glyphosate weedkiller caused cancer - a claim Bayer contests.
TRADE HEADWINDS
Syngenta's first-half was hit by flooding in the United States, drought in Australia and political headwinds.
Syngenta said it was taking charges to shutter a plant in Houston, Texas, after a chemical it produces, chlorothalonil, was banned by the European Union this year on concern over risks to bees, waterways, fish, and humans. [https:// Global trade spats also took their toll.  In the United States, soybean growers this year were left sitting on record volumes of beans after China halted purchases, while the U.S. has imposed tariffs on imports of products including Mexican tomatoes. ""It's across vegetables, obviously tomatoes are a big component of that,"" Patrick said. ""Just the economics now with these tariffs has meant it's had impacts on Mexican farmers. It goes to resolution of current trade disputes that are ongoing between the United States and a number of geographies."" Patrick reiterated ChemChina's previously announced aim of floating at least part of the company by 2022, though he said the impact of volatile weather on Syngenta's financial fortunes would play a role in a final IPO decision. 
""Mother Nature is wonderful thing, she has a great tendency to stay one or two steps in front of all of us,"" he said.

(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) has hired advisers to explore debt restructuring options that would buy more time for the money-losing U.S. retailer to forge a turnaround, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The 117-year-old department store chain's move represents a high-stakes attempt to get its financial house in order before its cash coffers dwindle and its debt, totaling roughly $4 billion, comes due in the next few years. 
The Plano, Texas-based company faces fierce competition from discount retailers such as the TJX Cos Inc's (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains, and J.C. Penney has struggled to boost the profile of its e-commerce business to rival established players such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
While J.C. Penney has more than $1.5 billion available under a revolving credit line, investors have continued to sell off the retailer's shares in response to financial losses. Its credit rating is deep in junk territory, increasing its borrowing costs.
J.C. Penney has in recent weeks held discussions with lawyers and investment bankers who specialize in advising troubled companies on debt restructurings and other financial workouts, some of the sources said. 
The retailer, which employs 95,000 people and operates more than 860 stores, is exploring options that could include raising additional cash or negotiating with creditors to push out debt maturities, these sources said.
J.C. Penney's restructuring plans are at an early stage, one of the sources cautioned. The discussions with restructuring specialists reflect J.C. Penney's resolve to take steps in coming months to increase its financial breathing room and avoid confronting a potential bankruptcy filing down the road, the source added. 
The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. 
The deteriorating retail landscape has forced longstanding brick-and-mortar chains, including Toys “R” Us Inc and Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ), to seek bankruptcy protection in the last two years. Some retailers had to liquidate. Others, such as Neiman Marcus Ltd and J. Crew Group Inc, have managed to avoid such a reckoning by reaching agreements with creditors to restructure their debts.
GRAPPLING WITH LOSSES 
Founded in Kemmerer, Wyoming, in 1902 by James Cash Penney, the eponymous company sells mid-priced apparel, home goods, jewelry, towels and other merchandise. 
J.C. Penney is grappling with financial losses that have collectively surpassed $1.7 billion between 2014 and the first three months of this year.
The company's stock, down more than 50% over the past year despite rising U.S. consumer spending, trades just above $1, giving it a market capitalization of $342 million. Its debt trades at distressed levels
The department store chain hired a new chief executive in late 2018 who moved to stop selling appliances and limit its furniture offerings. The decisions were aimed at refocusing J.C Penney on its roots selling mid-priced apparel and other merchandise targeted at U.S. families, though analysts have questioned whether the strategy will result in a successful turnaround at a retailer that has suffered declining foot traffic at stores for years.

In May, the retailer said sales at stores open for at least a year fell more than expected during the first quarter and that its net loss nearly doubled to $154 million. Despite closing stores over the years and revamping remaining locations, analysts have expressed concern that J.C. Penney will run out of time and money to reverse its declining fortunes.

262,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Netflix’s Tight-Lipped Culture Makes It Hard to Avoid Surprises,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).’s biggest earnings surprise in years sent the shares plummeting on Thursday. It also left analysts and investors wondering why they were caught so off guard.
When some companies know that their quarterly results are going to fall short of forecasts, they put out a pre-announcement or update their guidance. But not Netflix.
Instead, the company dropped a bombshell with no warning: Its customer growth was roughly half what it projected, and Netflix actually lost U.S. subscribers during the period. That hasn’t happened since 2011, when the company made a disastrous attempt to split up its streaming and DVD-by-mail operations.
The fallout on Thursday included the worst stock rout in three years, with the shares declining 10%. The plunge wiped out about $16 billion in market value.
“You would think Netflix would want to update guidance or give a pre-annoucement, as I’m sure they definitely knew about this for a while,” said Nick Licouris, an investment adviser at Gerber Kawasaki. “But they probably didn’t want to do it because they were going to take a hit at that time or during earnings -- especially since subscriber numbers are the No. 1 thing analysts look at -- and in earnings you can spin it better than a stand-alone announcement.”
Not Necessary?
Another reason not to issue a warning: The company met most of Wall Street’s financial estimates, such as sales and profit. It was only the subscriber numbers that really came up short.
“Revenue was very close to guidance and profits were actually above, so I’d guess they didn’t think it was necessary to pre-announce a weak sub number when other financial metrics were fine,” said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
There’s also been a broader shift away from giving earnings warnings, said Huber Research Partners founder Craig Huber.
“I have noticed companies in media and internet that I follow do not seem to pre-announce pending negative results with the same regularity as years ago,” he said.
Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, didn’t have an immediate comment.
The streaming giant’s tight-lipped culture extends beyond earnings. Unlike traditional media companies, it’s very selective about the viewer information it provides. Third parties try to fill the gaps by providing their own data on Netflix’s audience, but that can be unreliable.
Third-Party Services
Those kinds of data services failed to predict the latest shortfall, Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker said in a note.
“For several days,” she said, “investors told us ‘such-and-such data service suggests domestic adds will come in line; while international might be somewhat soft.’ Wrong. I mean -- right in the sense that international was soft but totally wrong on the domestic subs part.”
Netflix also delivers its earnings in an idiosyncratic way. Instead of doing a traditional Q&A conference call, the company releases an “earnings interview” on YouTube with a single analyst. It also issues its reports on its website, not through the paid services that many companies use to disseminate information.
Though this week’s stock rout was especially severe, it’s common for Netflix’s earnings to spark a huge share move. The average change on the day after quarterly reports is almost 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Compare that with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., where it’s 4.4%. Or  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., where it’s 4.1%.
There’s another explanation for the huge swings in Netflix’s stock: overreaction. That was the message from Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings this week. It’s easy to “overinterpret” subscriber figures, he said.
“Sometimes we are forecast high, sometimes we forecast low,” he said. “We’re just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can.”

263,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 06:41AM ET</span>",Wall Street Trading Costs to Surge as New Rules Hit Derivatives,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s heavyweights are prepping their clients for bad news: Some trades are about to get a lot more expensive.
Firms including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are warning customers to get ready for new rules that require more collateral for certain trades. The regulations take effect for some clients in September, but the snare gets even tighter in 2020, when more than 1,000 hedge funds, asset managers and insurers will get caught for the first time.
The so-called uncleared-margin rules require banks and their clients to “exchange margin” for derivatives traded directly between participants instead of being cleared through an exchange. Citigroup is sounding one of the loudest alarms about potential fallout, saying in a recent report that, for one model it tested, fees at its foreign-exchange prime brokerage got 31 times more expensive if it passed along higher costs.
“It’s going to be really tough,” said Audrey Blater, a senior analyst at researcher Aite Group. “People are dragging their feet and kicking and screaming that they actually have to do something. Up until now, a lot of buy-side firms weren’t touched by the regulation to the degree that a bank is, so they’re not used to doing stuff like this.”
The regulations will hit the currency market particularly hard, because some foreign-exchange products are rarely, if ever, cleared through an exchange.
In response to the regulations, Citigroup is proposing new fees for its prime-brokerage unit -- ones that would hit not only clients but also the brokers or banks they trade with, counterparties that until now had escaped such charges.
“All participants should share in these new costs,” Citigroup said in its report. Executing brokers “should pay their fair share.”
That idea has drawn mixed reviews. Some of Citigroup’s competitors say they won’t need to raise prices. Others, such as  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA’s John O’Hara, say there’s no system in place to begin charging the executing banks, and those firms would pass the fee onto clients anyway.
“As far as charging the executing dealers, I don’t think that will get any traction,” O’Hara, head of prime brokerage and clearing in the Americas at Societe Generale, said in a telephone interview. Still, he acknowledged, “the costs of FXPB services are going to increase significantly.”
Cost Estimates
Just 20% of buy-side firms have begun to examine the impact the new rules will have on their trading costs, according to a June report from Greenwich Associates. Less than 40% of the firms would consider listed options for their currency trades when their firm becomes subject to the new margin rules, the study found.
“The only thing it can do is cause the cost of prime brokerage to me to go up,” said Michael O’Brien, director of global trading at  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp. “I strongly believe that clearing is the primary solution for the uncleared margin rules when it comes to asset managers. There are a lot of complicated things to address, but I think you want to minimize the impact on the portfolio by minimizing the number of trades it impacts.”
Transaction fees and operational challenges were among the biggest obstacles to moving to a cleared model, based on responses to the Greenwich Associates study.
“Our analysis suggests these hurdles are diminishing quickly and, in some cases, may be more perceived than real,” David  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK), a principal at Greenwich Associates, said in the June report, which also noted that shifting to listed foreign-exchange options could reduce costs by as much as 70% per trade.
September 2020 is the deadline for the fifth and final phase of the new regulations, requiring firms with more than $8 billion in exposure to derivatives to begin socking away more margin, a threshold that will vastly increase the number of hedge funds and asset managers that would have to comply with the rules.
While big banks have long had large special units dedicated to managing their margin, many hedge funds and asset managers have little experience in this area. Smaller buy-side firms had at least one win this month: The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled that firms below the $50 million margin threshold don’t have to undergo the legal-documentation process.
“Phase 5 will have a big impact on the market because more of the buy-side will come into scope then,” said Ilene Froom, a partner in the financial-industry group at law firm Reed Smith LLP. “The documentation relief from the CFTC will be a big help.”"

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - PepsiCo (O:PEP) has struck a deal to buy South Africa's Pioneer Food Group (J:PFGJ) for $1.7 billion, the companies said on Friday, lifting Pioneer's shares and boosting a sector that has been hit by drought and tough trading conditions.
The U.S. drinks and snack group said on Friday that Pioneer's product portfolio was complementary to its own and would help PepsiCo to expand in sub-Saharan Africa by adding manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
""Pioneer Foods forms an important part of our strategy to not only expand in South Africa, but further into sub-Saharan Africa as well,"" PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.
PepsiCo has offered 110 rand ($7.94) per Pioneer ordinary share in what would be its second largest deal since 2010, the companies said, with the news lifting the South African company's shares by 29.32% to more than 100 rand.
Shares in agribusiness investment company  Zeder  Investments (J:ZEDJ), which holds Pioneer as part of its portfolio, also rose more than 22%.
""It's a vote of confidence in South Africa at a time when we really need it,"" Pioneer CEO Tertius Carstens told Reuters. 
Food producers have struggled amid a slump in retail sales as consumers cut back and dry weather hit maize and other produce. 
Pioneer, which uses maize in many of its products, reported a decline in half-year earnings in May, weighed down by shortages in the staple food. 
""It's almost a signal to other overseas companies that we are open for business. If PepsiCo is willing to put money down it may lift sentiment of other foreign investors that might come looking at South Africa for bargains,"" said Greg Davies, equities trader at Cratos Capital.
Pioneer, whose brands include Weet-Bix cereal, Liqui Fruit juice and Sasko bread, is the latest consumer goods firm to be the target of a buyout after South Africa's  Clover  Industries (J:CLRJ), which processes products including yogurt, beverages, and olive oil, began takeover talks with a consortium of companies called Milco SA last year.
Pioneer was in talks over a potential deal with ""a multinational organization"" in 2017, but that fell apart after South Africa's credit rating was cut to junk status. 
Pioneer and PepsiCo declined to comment whether those talks referred to them. 
Pioneer exports to more than 80 countries. Its deal with PepsiCo is conditional on regulatory approvals.

Investing.com -- It’s not been a great week for advertising companies. Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) fell nearly 2% after reporting falling revenue in the first half, but that pales in comparison with the drop in Publicis shares on Friday morning after the French-based group cut its outlook for the year.
Publicis (PA:PUBP) said after the European close on Thursday that it no longer expects organic sales to grow this year, due to “continued attrition” in traditional advertising in its biggest market, North America. The shares fell 8.4% to their lowest in nearly seven years on the news, dragging down U.K.-based rival WPP (LON:WPP) by over 3% to a three-month low in the process.
By contrast, Europe’s major bourses were broadly higher, following Wall Street and Asia after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams re-ignited hopes of a half-point cut in the Fed’s key Fed funds rate at the end of the month. The consensus forecast is still for a 25 basis point cut.
The Stoxx 600 was up 0.5% at 388.80 by 5 AM ET (0900) GMT, on course to end the week marginally higher. The FTSE 100 was up 0.7% and the German Dax up 0.8%.
“On the one hand, our clients are suffering from various pressures leading to budget cuts and fee reductions in sectors where we have a disproportionate share of market,” Publicis CEO and chairman Arthur Sadoun said a statement. “On the other hand, the profound transformation we have been engaged in has penalized us in the short term.”
Traditional advertising companies are rushing to reinvent their business models under pressure from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which control nearly 90% of the online ad business. That’s forcing Publicis into some expensive investments in digital-based businesses, such as the $4 billion acquisition of data marketing company Epsilon back in April. Sadoun said Publicis has 25 different teams working on the integration of that business, an illustration of how badly it needs to squeeze the benefits out of that deal.
Despite the squeeze on revenue, Sadoun upheld the company’s guidance of a 30 to 50 basis point improvement in operating margin and a rise of 5% to 10 % in full-year earnings at constant currencies. "
267,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 05:38AM ET</span>","Netflix sinks on subscriber losses, analysts still see growth","By Akanksha Rana, Supantha Mukherjee and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages stuck to a positive outlook on Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) on Thursday, betting that a strong content slate for the rest of 2019 would reverse shock second-quarter losses in U.S. subscribers that sank its stock price.
Netflix shares fell about 11% on worries about its earnings report on Wednesday that showed lower-than-expected global growth and signs of trouble in its U.S. base ahead of Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) much-awaited launch of a rival service later this year.
Netflix, whose price-to-earnings ratio is by far the largest of the five big U.S. tech companies making up the so-called FAANG group, has quadrupled in value since 2015 but at $321 per share is down $100 from 2018 peaks. The other FAANG companies are  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
The April-to-June period tends to be seasonally weak for Netflix in the United States, where warmer weather and longer days keep viewers outdoors.
Brokers Cowen & Co said Netflix had missed expectations for second-quarter subscriber numbers three times in the last four years. This year, however, the Los Gatos, California-based company set a series of aggressive price hikes, and lost U.S. subscribers for the first time in eight years.
""They raised prices in the U.S. by an average of $2 per month, and most subscribers learned about their increase during Q2,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
""I think that was a much bigger driver of churn than a dearth of content.""
STILL A BUY
Ten Wall Street brokerages cut their share price targets to reflect Thursday's fall, but did not downgrade the stock, still seen by a majority of Wall Street firms as a high-potential growth business and a clear ""buy"". 
The relatively small price drop in the company's $12.6 billion of junk bonds affirmed the view that the second-quarter results are a blip. While all Netflix debt weakened on Thursday, the biggest price moves were just 2.5%, like on the 6.375% bond coming due in May 2029 worth $800 million, according to Refinitiv data. 
""We're not concerned. We're still keeping to our forecast,"" said Neil Begley, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.
The credit market's faith in Netflix has allowed it to borrow at very cheap rates to fund content creation and acquisition. That is unlikely to change based on the disappointing second-quarter results, said Begley.
Netflix bond prices did not fall enough to attract bargain hunters. ""I'd be looking for a 300 basis point spread or so in a new 10-year deal as fair value,"" said John McClain, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. The spread on the 6.375% bond due in 2029 is around 275, he noted, ""so I'd want a 325 basis point spread to get interested.""
While competition is set to heat up with the upcoming launches of Apple TV and Disney+, several analysts said Netflix's global reach is likely to give it an edge.
Netflix added just 2.83 million international paid streaming subscribers, compared with Street expectations of 4.8 million, but it now has 151.6 million worldwide, dwarfing its nearest rivals Amazon Prime and HBO.
""By 2025, based on Disney projections, it looks like Netflix will be spending at least five times as much on content as Disney+,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak.
""I also think Disney+ is likely to help accelerate consumers away from traditional Pay TV toward OTT (content over an internet connection) which should benefit Netflix.""
The company raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe in the quarter, testing the waters in some of its wealthiest markets at a time when it is still spending massively more than it earns to win the content battle.
Netflix began the third quarter with the release of its 1980s-set smash-hit ""Stranger Things"" and will follow with new seasons of ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""The Crown,"" as well as the eagerly awaited Martin Scorsese movie ""The Irishman.""

""We would note Netflix misses have been followed by strong quarters, and, along those lines, we expect Netflix's very strong 2H slate will lead to a rebound in sub growth,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a client note.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday as investors firmed up bets on a U.S. interest rate cut at the end of July after a speech by a top Federal Reserve official further cemented expectations for one, fuelling appetite for risky assets and capping the dollar.
European shares opened higher across the board, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index gaining 0.7% in early trade. Britain's FTSE 100 index gained 0.6% and Germany's DAX rose 0.75%.
In oil markets, crude surged after the United States said its navy had destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz, a major chokepoint for global crude flows, raising concerns about supply disruptions out of the region.
Iran said all its drones had returned safely to base, and there was no sign of a major escalation in the Gulf.
Comments by New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Thursday made it virtually certain, in the markets' view, that the Fed would cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points at its July 30-31 policy meeting and also revived expectations of an even deeper 50 bps reduction.
Financial markets reacted quickly, with Fed fund rate futures at one point pricing in an almost 70% chance of a 50 basis point cut. The odds eased to around 40% after the New York Fed said William's speech had not been about immediate policy direction.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was having its best day in over two weeks, up nearly half a percent on the day. It was, however, still on track to break a six-week streak of weekly gains.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were 0.3% higher, indicating a higher opening on Wall Street later in the day.
""Despite a rather lackluster earnings season so far, investors are focusing on the prospect of a considerably easier monetary policy, which is why we see stocks ready to open higher this morning,"" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.
WILL RATE CUT SUFFICE?
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1%, bouncing back from the previous day's losses, while Japan's Nikkei advanced 2%.
Elsewhere in Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8%, Australian stocks added 0.75% and South Korea's KOSPI gained 1.4%.
For the week, the MSCI ex-Japan index climbed a modest 1%, as riskier assets were partly capped by U.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration of his threat to impose further duties on Chinese imports.
The two sides resumed talks recently to seek an end to a year-long trade war that has rattled financial markets and slowed global growth. But most analysts do not expect an agreement any time soon, with some predicting a strong risk of further tariff escalation.
""Although central banks around the world have embarked on policy-easing in a bid to support their respective economies, investors are left to ponder whether the stimulus will be enough to offset the effects from heightened U.S.-China trade tensions,"" said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood about 0.1% higher at 96.875 after losing roughly 0.5% overnight to a two-week low of 96.671 in the wake of the comments from the Fed's Williams.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",Bayer welcomes judge's call for new trial in $2 billion glyphosate case,"By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) welcomed on Friday a call by a U.S. judge to cut a $2 billion damages award to a Californian couple by a jury which found that its glyphosate-based weed killer had caused their cancer.
The company had in June asked Judge Winifred Y. Smith, of California's Alameda County Superior Court, to overrule the jury verdict that its Roundup weed killer caused Alva and Alberta Pilliod's non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), arguing it was not supported by the evidence.
Judge Smith, in a 15-page opinion, said the punitive damages that make up most of the award should be reduced. A hearing was due to be held on Friday on reduced damages and if the parties fail to agree, the case would go to a retrial.
""The court's tentative order proposes changes in the damage awards, which would be a step in the right direction,"" Bayer said in a statement. ""Bayer will wait for a final order on the post-trial motions before commenting in further detail.""
Shares in Bayer were up 1.9% at 0714 GMT.
The Oakland jury on May 13 awarded more than $2 billion to the Pilliods, finding their NHL to have been caused by using Monsanto's Roundup weed killer on their property between 1975 and 2011. 
Bayer acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion last year, with the ensuing blowup of Roundup litigation hammering its value and leaving the German company with a stock market capitalization less than it paid in the takeover.
The jury awarded $18 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to Alva Pilliod, and $37 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to his wife.
PUNITIVE VS COMPENSATORY
Judge Smith's ruling said that the compensatory damages awarded by the jury for past non-economic loss were ""not supportable by the evidence"".
She also questioned the basis for the jury's larger damages award, saying she was inclined to find that punitive damages should be two to four times combined economic and non-economic compensatory damages.
Even assuming that compensatory damages are upheld, applying Judge Smith's thinking would result in maximum punitive damages of $220 million, according to a Reuters calculation - a fraction of the original jury award.
A Bayer spokesman declined to speculate on whether, and by how much, the damages award could be reduced pending Friday's hearing.
In a separate case last week, a U.S. federal judge slashed a damages award Bayer owed a California man who blamed Roundup weed killer for his cancer, to $25 million from $80 million, while rejecting the company's bid for a new trial.
The German drugmaker and chemicals company had said in court filings that the massive verdict in the Pilliod case was based on ""inflammatory, fabricated and irrelevant evidence"" from the couple's lawyers.
Judge Smith, however, denied Bayer's motion alleging misconduct on the part of the plaintiffs' lawyers.

Bayer faces Roundup cancer lawsuits from more than 13,400 plaintiffs across the United States. It denies the allegations, saying the weed killer and its active ingredient glyphosate is safe for human use.

Rising hopes of interest cuts have attracted investors to take risky bets with equities getting $6.2 billion inflows in the week to July 17. U.S. equity inflows were at $5.3 billion, while other regions saw outflows.
Some $12.1 billion flowed into bonds, the 28th straight week of additions, taking the total for the year so to $455 billion as investors pile into safe-haven assets due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, which has started to dent the global economy.
That year to date total compares with $1.7 trillion inflows over the past ten years, the bank said.
With the first-half equity redemptions standing at $151 billion, BAML said ""hemorrhaging"" at equity funds has stopped recently with $11 billion flowing into the asset class in the past six weeks.

Strategies that profit from short-term volatility are near the cheapest in more than a year, according to Macro Risk Advisors. Likewise,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) notes that average single-stock volatility for the biggest 100 names in the S&P 500 Index is lower than it was at the start of the last five earnings seasons.
Those shops, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., UBS Group AG and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). are all recommending that investors seize the opportunity provided by the complacency reflected in the options market.
What all these strategists see is an opportunity to scoop up contracts on the cheap that could pay off handsomely if the market consensus is wrong. And there’s good reason to think it may be. The second-quarter earnings reports will reflect the impact of heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China, economic data showing a mixed picture on the outlook for growth and the fading effect of domestic tax cuts on corporate profits.
“The options market is essentially pricing the next few weeks to be a snooze,” Mandy Xu, the chief equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note. “That is a mistake, especially as Q2 earnings will give us the first glimpse into how companies are navigating recent trade and macro headwinds.”
Options markets are currently pricing in an average move of 4% for companies announcing earnings, the lowest expected volatility since the second quarter of 2018, according to UBS. In part, that’s because low single-stock realized volatility is suffocating expectations for future swings, Vinay Viswanathan, a derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, wrote in an email.
JPMorgan says the sanguine outlook is off base.
“We would be generally biased towards being long single-name volatility into earnings,” JPMorgan strategists including Bram Kaplan wrote. The bank’s favored trades for this reporting period include the purchases of calls on Beyond Meat Inc. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). in anticipation of better than expected results and guidance.
UBS strategist Francois Trahan has warned that a large enough decline in forward earnings growth for members of the S&P 500 Index could spell doom for the equity rally -- something that will become evident as corporate America reports results over the next several weeks.
“We expect more implied move beats than last quarter” as a result, UBS strategists wrote in a July 14 note.
Investors saw an example of that Thursday, when shares of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). dropped as much as 12% after a disappointing earnings report, far exceeding the post-earnings move of less than 8% that options traders had priced in.
Low index and single-stock volatility is even prompting some to advocate ditching stocks altogether and loading up on cheap call options ahead of earnings. Credit Suisse’s Xu recommends so-called stock replacement strategies to preserve 2019 portfolio gains without closing the door on further upside.
Bank of America strikes a similar chord, pointing to high-quality stocks like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). that have become more volatile than the broader market.
“We think a more prudent approach is to rent rather than own upside on select high-quality names, given high-quality stocks have become riskier,” strategists at the bank wrote.
The weapon of choice at Macro Risk Advisors is an options straddle expiring shortly after earnings are announced, a trade that involves simultaneously buying bullish call options and bearish puts. That renders the strategy indifferent to market direction but highly dependent on volatility. If swings are dramatic enough -- regardless of which way -- the strategy will make money.
A so-called “gamma rental” of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). is among MRA’s preferred ideas, a wager that profits if results from competitors  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). also fuel swings in the micro-blogging social media company’s shares.

New York Fed President John Williams said on Thursday policymakers could not wait for economic disaster to hit before adding stimulus, reviving expectations of a deeper rate cut in July and sparking a rally in shares worldwide
Markets have fully priced in a 25 basis point cut by the Fed this month, but a batch of strong U.S. data recently had dimmed hopes of an aggressive cut and weakened the positive global mood that has driven stock markets higher since May.
The pan-European stocks benchmark (STOXX), which hit a 3-week low on Thursday, rose 0.7% by 0819 GMT.
""The question is not that will a rate cut happen, but will the size of the cut itself will be 0.50 bps instead of 0.25 bps, because there is uncertainty over the size of what the interest rate cut will be at the upcoming Fed meeting,"" Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.
""Markets haven't had a great week so any sign of extra dovishness will be taken as a positive.""
Poor earnings over the last two sessions had threatened to take the index lower on the week, but if Friday's gains hold, the STOXX will end the week higher for the sixth time in seven weeks.
Much of the rally, from what were the sharpest monthly declines in more than two years in May, has been spurred by signals from major central banks that they would take a more accommodative stance to offset the impact of a prolonged and bruising trade war between the United States and China.
Belgium-based Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev (BR:ABI) jumped 5.2% after the debt-heavy brewer said it had agreed to sell its Australian operations to Japan's Asahi (T:2502) and was still interested in reviving the stalled flotation of its Asian business.
The oil and gas sector (SXEP) rose 0.8% as crude prices gained on the back of the latest signs of tension between the United and States and Iran.
Trade sensitive stocks also got a lift after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested in-person talks between U.S. and Chinese officials could follow after telephone conversations on Thursday.
Auto stocks (SXAP) surged more than 1% with BMW (DE:BMWG) shares up 1.3% after it named insider Oliver Zipse as the new chief executive. That reflected hopes the ""decisive"" company lifer would help BMW regain its edge in electric cars and win back the premium market lead lost to Mercedes-Benz.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 03:55AM ET</span>",Boeing takes $4.9 billion charge related to 737 MAX,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Thursday it would take an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion in the second quarter on estimated disruptions from the prolonged grounding of its lucrative 737 MAX passenger jets after two deadly crashes.
The charge is from ""potential concessions and other considerations to customers,"" and the impact of continued lower production, the world's largest planemaker said in a statement, as airlines that use the planes extend flight cancellations until November.
The charge will result in a $5.6 billion reduction in revenue and pre-tax earnings in the second quarter, Boeing said. 
Boeing shares rose 2 percent in after-hours trading, which  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said was a sign that investors were comfortable with the size of the charge and Boeing's production plans, disclosed less than a week before the company plans to release quarterly financial results on July 24.
""The company showed a degree of confidence in a return to service before year-end and getting up to 57 per month on 737 production in about 12 months, which investors were increasingly skeptical of,"" Lalwani said.
Boeing is facing one of the worst crises in its history as its fastest-selling jetliner has been grounded since March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that together killed 346 people in a span of five months. 
The Chicago-based planemaker is now reckoning with a blow to its reputation as well as the financial cost of getting its planes back in the air.
""We are taking appropriate steps to manage our liquidity and increase our balance sheet flexibility the best way possible as we are working through these challenges,"" Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said in a statement.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a tweet that the company remains focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service. 
""The MAX grounding presents significant challenges for our customers, company and supply chain,"" he tweeted.
The grounding of the 737 MAX has sent shockwaves through the industry and pushed back the launch of a new Boeing aircraft - a twin-aisle jet for the middle of the market known as NMA.
Boeing's board is unlikely to give the project a green light until it has a full picture of the financial exposure caused by the 737 crisis, industry sources say.
Boeing also said estimated costs to produce its flagship single-aisle aircraft increased by $1.7 billion in the second quarter, driven primarily by higher costs from a longer-than-expected reduction in its aircraft production rate. 
PRODUCTION HIT
Boeing reduced the number of single-aisle aircraft it produces monthly in the Seattle area from 52 to 42 following the second crash in Ethiopia while suspending deliveries of the aircraft to airlines, which cuts off fresh cash infusions and hits margins.
The lower rate means Boeing has to pay more for parts, which are priced according to the volume Boeing buys. Boeing said it was working toward building 57 of the 737s a month in 2020.
When it reported first-quarter results in April, Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production because the grounding had cost it at least $1 billion so far.
But the fuller picture of how much the grounding will cost Boeing, and how it plans to repair its image with the flying public, was not expected until the end of the second quarter since 737 production cuts did not begin until mid-April. 
Boeing also said it assumes the 737 MAX return to service in the United States and other countries beginning early in the fourth quarter, though the company cautioned the exact timeline could shift as it has in recent weeks.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) joined U.S. rivals on Thursday in canceling more flights until early November, which has also prompted the low-cost carrier to freeze new pilot hiring.
United Airlines, with 14 MAX jets, posted quarterly earnings on Tuesday that showed a boost in unit revenues thanks to reduced seat capacity in the sector, though costs are seen spiking over the year due to the grounding. 

Boeing is facing a slew of probes by regulators across the world as well as U.S. lawmakers and the Department of Justice.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 03:36AM ET</span>","As defaults rise, China bond markets are pricing risks better","By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - July 15 proved a rough day for Chinese bondholders, bringing defaults by five issuers including Jinggong Group, an industrial conglomerate whose interests span steel, finance and rice wine.
But analysts and market players say there might be a silver lining for investors, as the growing number of defaults and the regulatory seizure of a struggling regional bank may help foster a shift in how China's onshore bond market prices risk.
""We are seeing more accurate risk pricing and I think it's a long-term change,"" said Yun Xiong, a portfolio manager at Green Harmony Capital in Hong Kong who focuses primarily on fixed income.
The default by Jinggong Group, rated AA+ by two domestic agencies, was part of a record stream of missed interest and principal payments against a backdrop of persistent funding challenges for corporate issuers and slowing growth. That is despite official assurances that China will ""control"" bond defaults through legal and market means.
This year, 35 Chinese onshore corporate issuers have defaulted on interest or principal payments on 58 bonds with a total principal value of 54.31 billion yuan ($7.90 billion), according to data compiled by Reuters.
That is 60% more than the value of defaulted bonds in the first seven months of 2018, and more than half of the total for all of 2018, the highest on record.
GRAPHIC: More Chinese defaults in 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2O1x4K9
WEAKER CREDIT OUTLOOK
And ratings agency S&P Global says it expects the number of Chinese corporate defaults to rise in the second half as a slowing economy and the Sino-U.S. trade war contribute to a weaker credit outlook.
Coming along with defaults has been a sharp increase in the premium investors demand to hold riskier debt. The spread of 1-year AA rated corporate debt over its AAA rated equivalent has more than doubled since late May, from 23 to 59 basis points.
The effect is even starker in some shorter tenors. AA rated 3-month commercial paper yielded 3.585% on July 19, according to Refinitiv data, a nearly 90 basis point premium over AAA rated paper. On May 21, the gap was 5 basis points.
Spurring the jump and putting extra pressure on weak issuers was the May 24 takeover of Inner Mongolia's Baoshang Bank by Chinese regulators, prompted by what they called serious credit risks.
The seizure and revelations that larger Baoshang creditors would face haircuts jolted the interbank market, hitting funding for smaller players, especially those providing lower-quality collateral for loans.
Concerted efforts by the central bank to supply the banking system with ample funds have helped ease worries and keep interbank lending rates low. But investors continue to demand elevated premiums for lower-rated negotiable certificates of deposit, a popular short-term interbank debt instrument.
DEEPER CREDIT 'DIFFERENTIATION'
In a recent report, HSBC fixed income analyst Helen Huang said defaults are not just increasing, but are affecting larger companies in more sectors, including ""new economy"" ones such as pharmaceuticals and high tech.
Previous jumps in defaults have led to a temporary spike in corporate yield spreads, while ""credit differentiation in primary market issuance has been deeper and more persistent since the second half of 2018,"" Huang said.
She added that though AAA rated issuers are issuing bonds at historically high rates, gross issuance for AA rated issuers has risen little since 2017.
Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said it is difficult to predict how long the widening of credit spreads will last, but he expects to see clearer ""tiering"" in onshore bonds, with stronger companies securing funding through bond issuance but weaker ones finding this increasingly difficult.
Xiong at Green Harmony says he believes the changes are here to stay.
""Maybe the spread can narrow a bit if the market condition improves, but investors understand the credit risk better now,"" he said.

The two companies had been debating the value of Acacia since Barrick’s informal offer in May to buy the roughly 36% stake in the company it doesn’t already own. Acacia has been locked in a public battle with Tanzania since 2017 and the agreement with Barrick follows days after the government ordered Acacia to stop using a tailings facility at a core gold mine.
Acacia’s shares rallied as much as 18% on the news and traded at 219.4 pence at 9:09 a.m. in London. The stock had gained 1.8% this year through Thursday.
Today’s news suggests Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow was forced to shift his position that he wouldn’t raise the bid. In an interview with Bloomberg News in June, Bristow said he had no intention of raising the offer. But the CEO faced shareholder pressure in recent months, with Odey Asset Management opposing the valuation.
Still, the new bid gives Acacia shareholders a significant premium. Since mid-2017, Acacia shares have traded below Barrick’s current offer for all but a handful of days.
Acacia is fully satisfied with the final terms, said acting Chief Executive Officer Peter Geleta.
“Given all the circumstances this is possibly the best outcome,” he said by phone.
A successful deal would close the nearly decade-long chapter of Acacia’s life as a public miner, after the unit was spun out in 2010 as  African Barrick Gold . Since then it’s fended off challenges spanning an infiltration by criminal gangs, to invasion by hundreds of intruders armed with machetes and hammers and mining-tax changes.
Two years ago, Tanzania imposed an export ban on Acacia and handed the miner a $190 billion tax bill. Since then, the company’s position in the country has deteriorated further, with the government saying in May it would no longer allow Acacia to manage its mines in the country and will only work with Barrick.
The dispute with Tanzania has had a crippling effect of Acacia’s business -- forcing the company to stockpile output and curb production -- and its shares dropped 50% since the start of 2017 before Thursday’s announcement.
Barrick has led discussions with the government in an effort to solve the impasse, while Acacia moved ahead separately with arbitration proceedings.
In a 2017 meeting between President John Magufuli and Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton, it was tentatively agreed that Acacia would pay $300 million to the government to settle tax claims and would split future returns from operations with the country. At the time, Acacia criticized the move and blamed Barrick for its worsening relationship with Tanzania after Thornton took over negotiations."

The firm,  Dongfang Modern Agriculture Holding  Group Ltd (AX:DFM), gave no explanation when the resignations occurred last month but attributed them to the rumors in a letter to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) late on Thursday. The letter added that the rumors were false.
In the letter, Dongfang's lawyers said the company believed two directors quit after hearing rumors that officials in the southeast China city of Ganzhou interviewed staff and were investigating ""criminal connections"".
""These rumors were not true,"" said the letter, which was published by the ASX.
""Because the independent directors could not investigate this rumor for themselves by visiting the plantations they tendered their resignation due to the seriousness of the rumors even though the rumors were false.""
Those resignations prompted two more directors to quit and then the CEO, Chiu So, ""resigned also because he was seeking another career development"", the letter said. The company secretary then also quit.
Shares in Dongfang, which listed at A$1.06 in 2015, were suspended in June after the resignations left them without a sufficient number of directors. They last traded at A$0.83, giving the firm a market capitalization just below A$350 million ($250 million).
Dongfang did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Former CEO So said by phone the rumors were wrong, without elaborating.
""I have already resigned. Please contact the company to ask for more information,"" he said. ""I have nothing more to say.""
Dongfang is among dozens of small Chinese firms to list in Australia in recent years, lured by the prospect of a simpler public offering process and less volatility than markets at home.
It was among more than 40 Chinese firms that the ASX wrote to in 2017 asking whether China's crackdown on capital outflows presents them any difficulties.
Dongfang said it was actively looking for replacement directors.
The company said in March that it had sold more than 280,000 tonnes of fruit, including oranges and tangerines, in 2018, for a net profit of A$84.4 and an operating margin better than 45%."
282,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 12:40AM ET</span>",China Vows Bad ‘Social Credit’ Scores Won’t Hurt People’s Rights,"(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese official pushed back against concerns that the nation’s plan to grade individuals on their behavior would violate its citizens’ legal rights and limit access to basic public services.
The so-called social credit system can be combined with various incentives to encourage people to be better citizens, but can’t be used to punish them, Lian Weiliang, vice chairman of China’s top economic planner, said at a briefing on Thursday.
China’s ambitious plan to develop a nationwide system that tracks and scores individuals’ behavior, though nascent, has stirred concerns that people could be unduly punished for violations they either didn’t commit, or have tried to rectify. The system has also been criticized by the U.S., with Vice President Mike Pence calling it an Orwellian model for authoritarian regimes around the globe.
“Low social credit scores cannot be used to restrict a person’s access to basic public services and legal rights,” said Lian, a deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission. “The media is very concerned about this issue. There have been some inappropriate instances in the past, but these have been standardized and corrected.”
China does maintain a blacklist of individuals who have violated court rulings. The supreme court manages the list, and those on it can’t do things like play golf, travel first-class on the bullet train, stay in hotels with a 4-star or above rating, or send their children to expensive private schools.
However, there are multiple “social credit” systems across the nation, and there is a lack of clarity both inside and outside China as how they work and what they can or cannot do.
An anti-rumor website affiliated with the Cyberspace Administration of China last month denied online rumors about a student who was rejected by the nation’s most prestigious universities despite high scores on the national college entrance exam, allegedly because her parents were classified as “dishonest.” According to the post, the story has circulated for a long time with different names, but no such punishment actually exists.
The NDRC on Thursday also released new guidelines for regulating companies based on a separate credit system currently in place, promising more severe penalties for the worst offenders including a permanent ban from the market.
Multiple government agencies are working to fine tune the system so that firms with bad records face more scrutiny while those with good histories don’t face overly onerous inspections, Lian said.
Officials working on the nationwide social-credit scoring system have the mammoth task of integrating huge amounts of data spread across multiple provinces and departments. The government is still working on a national system for scoring companies and also figuring out how companies can restore their credit by looking at other systems overseas, Lian said.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>",Icahn launches proxy fight after stalled talks with Occidental CEO,"By Gary McWilliams
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn formally launched on Thursday a proxy fight against Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY) to win control of four board seats, a regulatory filing showed, after talks with the oil company's CEO failed to reach an agreement. 
Icahn, who owns 4.4% of Occidental shares, said last month he planned to launch a proxy fight to oust and replace four Occidental directors. Icahn has blasted the Houston-based oil and gas producer for failing to give owners a say on its proposed $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC), which he has called ""misguided and hugely overpriced"". 
""Occidental refused to craft a compromise and so we'll happily take our case to stockholders which the company should have done with this bet-the-company transaction,"" Icahn told Reuters on Thursday. 
""We prefer to have peace and have a great record in reaching settlements,"" Icahn added. 
Icahn's use of a consent solicitation to elect directors would require a majority of shares outstanding to be voted in favor, a greater hurdle than a special meeting of shareholders, according to an Occidental spokesman. Occidental has urged shareholders to reject the activist's proxy, calling the request ""not in the best interests of Occidental or its shareholders"". 
If Icahn's solicitation is successful, the record date for a vote on the Icahn candidates could be scheduled as soon as September or October.
In the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn identified his four candidates for the board: John Hofmeister, the former president of Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Company; Alan LeFevre, the former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp; and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, two executives with Icahn's own investment company. 
Icahn spoke with Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub on July 10 in an 11th-hour effort to reach a compromise and avert a proxy fight. His associates also spoke with Occidental executives twice earlier this month, according to the filing. 
The investor expects to schedule meetings with Occidental shareholders in the next four weeks to press the case for board seats. The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes. 
Occidental has proposed selling Anadarko's Africa assets, including a proposed Mozambique liquefied natural gas project estimated to cost $20 billion. Anadarko also owns significant offshore wells and production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Freeport-McMoRan (N:FCX), which in 2016 sold some of those same offshore assets to Anadarko, did so while under pressure from Icahn's investment fund, which held seats on the mining firm's board. 

Anadarko shareholders are expected vote in favor of the Occidental deal on Aug. 8.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) has hired the man credited with turning around Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) as its new chief executive, as it moves on from the abrupt departure of its leaders this year in the fallout of a misconduct inquiry.
New Zealand national Ross McEwan, 62, is the outgoing CEO of Britain's RBS and has also held senior roles at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA). He joins NAB as the No. 4 bank and its peers fight to win back customer trust after damaging findings at the Royal Commission inquiry into the financial sector.
Although the inquiry lambasted the whole industry for rampant fee-gouging and overly aggressive sales tactics, NAB was the worst hit of the so-called ""Big Four"" lenders, losing its CEO and chairman over accusations they had failed to accept responsibility for wrongdoing at the company.
""It's going to be a tough job,"" said banking analyst at Morningstar David Ellis. ""He's facing a very hostile environment and a soft economy.""
NAB shares were 2.2% higher on Friday, following the announcement, while the broader financial sector (AXFJ) was up 1.2%.
The hire presents NAB shareholders with a fresh face - but with experience in the local market - to lead the company through a period of strategic and political rebuilding, in contrast to early speculation that the company had pegged an internal candidate for the job.
McEwan is also seen as an experienced banker who has led RBS through a period of complex change and has dealt with many of the issues currently facing the Australian banks, including an increasingly tough revenue environment.
He is not a stranger to criticism either. As he announced his exit from RBS, analysts raised questions over the timing of the departure, just months before Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union and with dark clouds looming over the British housing market.
In a call with journalists on Friday, McEwan said he was approached by NAB soon after he resigned from RBS.
He said it was important to ""protect and accelerate"" NAB's transformation of its operations and culture into a better bank - a comment analysts read as a signaling restructuring beyond the bank's current digitization project, which aims to save A$1 billion in costs and shed thousands of staff by 2020.
""Over the years we have had the occasional interactions with Mr McEwan as CEO of RBS. (During that time) RBS took multiple provisions in relation to restructuring and customer remediation,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts told clients in a note.
""With this in mind we view the risk is that Mr McEwan rebases more than what the market expects and that the majority of the $1bn of cost saves from the current transformation program ... are utilized in the next program with shareholders seeing very little immediate benefit.""
On Friday, McEwan said it was ""a privilege to return to Australia and lead NAB at a crucial time for the bank, its customers, employees, shareholders and the broader community.""
McEwan quit RBS in April with a year's notice and would start at NAB by April 2020, NAB said. Interim CEO Philip Chronican will then become its new chairman.
""NAB, for 20 years or so, has been underperforming,"" said Morningstar's Ellis. ""He's got a lot of work to do to bring NAB up to its peers""."
285,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 11:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: WeWork to host Wall Street analyst day in IPO push - sources,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The We Company, parent of shared office space manager WeWork, plans to host an analyst day for Wall Street banks on July 31, as the company steps up its preparations for an initial public offering (IPO), people familiar with the matter said. 
WeWork's decision to host the event at this stage is unusual, given that IPO hopefuls have typically hired underwriters by the time they invite analysts from Wall Street banks to educate them about their company's business.
While WeWork filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December, it has yet to hire IPO underwriters, the sources said. WeWork wants to be in a position to potentially go public by the end of 2019, the sources added.
The hosting of the event at this early stage indicates that the New York-based start-up wants to leave nothing to chance after other high-profile IPOs struggled or were canceled this year, amid pushback from investors over the frothy valuations sought.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. A spokesman for WeWork declined to comment. 
The IPO market has been challenging for some of this year's biggest listings. Ride-hailing companies  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) faced criticism from investors about their steep losses and the lack of commitment to a timetable to reach profitability.
Last week, Anheuser Busch InBev NV (BR:ABI), the world's largest brewer, shelved the initial public offering (IPO) of its Asian business after it could not muster enough investor support for the valuation it sought.
WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. 
However, the money-losing company has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities.
The losses at WeWork's parent company narrowed slightly in the first quarter of 2019 to $264 million as revenue continues to double annually.
WeWork is looking to raise $3 billion to $4 billion in debt before it goes public, and has held discussions with representatives of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to discuss the debt offering, Reuters reported earlier this month.
A substantial debt offering could allow it to pitch itself to potential investors in a planned IPO as having sufficient funding to see itself to profitability.
WeWork, which was co-founded in 2010 by CEO Adam Neumann, has helped pioneer ""coworking,"" or shared desk-space, with a focus on startups, entrepreneurs and freelancers.

In January, Japan's SoftBank boosted its stake in WeWork by $2 billion in a deal that was billions of dollars below what the company had hoped to raise to fund growth and buy out existing shareholders.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 1.1% and 1.3% respectively by 10:40 PM ET (02:40 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also climbed 1.3%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8%. Data showed today that the country’s core consumer price index rose 0.6% in June from a year earlier, in line with expectations.
Tensions between Japan and South Korea remained in focus after South Korea's Trade Ministry urged Japan to do another round of discussions over Tokyo's tighter export controls.
""There are major concerns that such a move would have a grave impact on not only the economies in both countries, but the global supply chain,"" Lee Ho-hyeon, a director at South Korea's trade ministry, said at a briefing.
""It is regrettable that the Japanese side repeatedly makes claims that are different from truth,"" he said.
""We again urge Japan's genuine response to our request for a director-level consultations.""
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 traded 0.8% higher.
The gains in Asian stocks came after Williams said in a speech that the Fed will “act quickly” to support the economy as “it’s better to take preventative measures than to wait for disaster to unfold.”
However, the New York Fed clarified later that Williams' speech were not indicative of the central bank’s future moves.
""Dovish Fed policy expectations do provide support for the equity markets, which are set to rebound after suffering losses the previous day. But factors such as U.S.-China trade issues and tensions over Iran are likely to limit the markets' gains,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management, in a Reuters report.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer spoke with their Chinese counterparts over the phone, Lighthizer’s office confirmed overnight, but gave no other details.
“Right now we’re having principal-level calls and to the extent that it makes sense for us to set up in-person meetings, I would anticipate that we would be doing that,” Mnuchin said, adding that it is possible the call could lead to an in-person meeting."

Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Steven Mnuchin spoke to the Chinese earlier, a USTR spokesman confirmed. There were no details released on what was discussed. Reuters reported the phone call earlier.
The phone call was the second time the lead negotiators have talked since U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed in late June on another truce in their year-long trade war. The leaders agreed to restart talks for a trade deal -- which had collapsed in May -- but gave no concrete time-frame to reach a deal.
Mnuchin said earlier this week that if discussions with Chinese officials by phone were productive that he and Lighthizer would travel to Beijing for more meetings.
Trump this week reiterated that he could impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports if he wants. Major sticking points in negotiations include when and by how much China will increase its imports of U.S. farm products, and how exactly the U.S. will ease trade restrictions on Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co.

Japan has cited ""inadequate management"" of sensitive items exported to South Korea, with Japanese media reporting some items ending up in North Korea.

289,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",Top Emerging Markets Join Policy Easing Tide to Spur Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Central banks across key emerging markets finally joined the the tide of monetary policy easing Thursday as the world economy slows.
South Africa, Indonesia and South Korea, initially slow to follow peers in lowering borrowing costs, all announced a quarter-point cut in interest rates. In Latin America, Chile kept its key rate unchanged after last month’s shock half-point reduction.
The move by two of Asia’s biggest emerging markets and Africa’s most-industrialized economy demonstrates that even those reluctant to cut are now being forced to respond as global risks worsen. They had held off on easing too quickly: South Korea had worries about financial stability due to high levels of household debt, Indonesia needs higher yields to attract foreign investors to fund a current-account deficit and South Africa wants inflation expectations at the midpoint of its target range.
Their decision to cut is an indication of pronounced fears of a deepening downturn and demonstrates the policy space that’s opened up since the Federal Reserve’s dovish tilt. Central banks in Australia, India and Russia are among those that have recently cut. Nigeria surprised in March with the first reduction in more than three years.
“Dovish surprises remain the trend at this point,” said David Mann, chief economist for  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc in Singapore. “Inflation is low and growth is clearly decelerating, albeit not rapidly, but the risks to the outlook are growing.” He projects global growth of 3.4% this year, down from 3.8% in 2018.
The biggest culprits dragging down the world economy are the U.S.-China trade war, a fading technology boom and a soggy global autos market. China data this week showed second-quarter growth was the weakest since the early 1990s while business and consumer confidence globally is depressed.
In Asia, there’s almost daily evidence of economic pain. Japan said Thursday exports fell for a seventh straight month in June. Singapore’s shipments plunged to the second-worst rate since the global financial crisis, in line with weakening world trade.
Manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes have been softer across Asia and in other regions. Factory activity shrank across Europe and Asia in June while the U.S. teetered on the brink of contraction.
“Many Asian economies are at the leading edge of the global industrial cycle and policy rate cuts across the region reveals expectations that the current export malaise will endure,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Hong Kong.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The Bank of Korea and Bank Indonesia were among the last major central banks in Asia to join the easing club. Their cuts show that the policy focus has turned firmly to supporting growth, overriding earlier concerns over financial stability risk and currency pressures. The widely expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also makes monetary easing easier to pull off for Asian central banks.”-Chang Shu, chief Asian economist
In Seoul, the Bank of Korea cut the seven-day repurchase rate to 1.5% from 1.75%. It now expects the economy to grow 2.2% this year, versus 2.5% projected in April, and inflation to rise 0.7%, versus 1.1% previously.
With the benchmark rate now only a quarter percentage point above a record low, and financial stability still a concern, BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the central bank still has room to act again -- but not much.
Indonesia’s central bank cut its benchmark rate for the first time in almost two years and pledged more easing to come as it shifts focus to supporting growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. The seven-day reverse repurchase rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 5.75%, in line with the forecasts of most economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
“The region is in need of macro policy support, both monetary and fiscal, to stabilize growth amid ongoing trade uncertainties,” said Juliana Lee, chief economist for Asia at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
South Africa’s cut came as the central bank almost halved its growth forecast for the year to 0.6%. The MPC made it clear though that the move can only boost the economy if the government removes the underlying structural restraints.
Chile’s central bank, long known as one of Latin America’s more predictable monetary authorities, reverted to form Thursday by keeping borrowing costs unchanged. The pause comes a month after the bank delivered its first reduction in two years, surprising all 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Economists worry about how much space central banks have to cut, given benchmark rates around the world remain at historical lows after years of effort to support growth in the wake of the global financial crisis. At the same time there are concerns over how potent any rate cuts will prove given rising levels of debt. It means that central banks alone won’t be able to rescue their economies.
“For this, greater certainty around trade policy will be needed, as well as more accommodative fiscal policy among the world’s largest economies,” said HSBC’s Neumann.
(Updates to add Chile’s decision to keep rate unchanged.)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met on Thursday with the chief executives of major American airlines to discuss their accusations that subsidies by Qatar and United Arab Emirates are costing jobs in the United States.
The meeting between Trump and the CEOs of American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL), JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and Atlas Air (O:AAWW) included Vice President Mike Pence, the White House said.
The meeting also included the CEO of state-owned Qatar Airways, Akbar al-Baker, who was also at the White House last week to tout its decision in June to buy five new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 freighters.
The White House did not immediately provide details of the meeting.
Since 2015 the largest U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), American and United Airlines - have argued their Gulf rivals are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, distorting competition and costing U.S. jobs - something the Gulf carriers deny.
The Partnership for Open & Fair Skies, a group representing Delta, American, United and aviation unions, said it had a ""productive meeting"" with Trump.
""The president shares our concerns and instructed us to keep working with the U.S. Department of Transportation, which we plan to do,"" Scott Reed, the group's managing partner, said in a statement.
The CEOs of JetBlue, FedEx and Atlas Air have warned that restricting the rights of Qatar Airways could lead to retaliation against U.S. carriers and added, in an April letter, it could lead to ""a rapid unraveling of hard-fought aviation rights around the world when other governments take similar action to shield their state-owned airlines from competition.""
Last week, the CEOs of Delta, United and American wrote a joint USA Today op-ed urging the White House to act ""decisively to hold Qatar and the UAE accountable."" They suggested that failing to respond would ""signal to other countries that they too are free to exploit American workers."" 
In April, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration was scrutinizing Qatar Airways' acquisition of a 49% stake in Air Italy, which has been flying to U.S. destinations since 2018 in a move seen by U.S. lawmakers as flouting a deal not to add new flights to the domestic market.
Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have said they were concerned that the deal with the Italian carrier contravened an understanding Qatar Airways reached with the United States in early 2018.
Qatar Airways acquired the 49% of Italian airline Meridiana in 2017, rebranded it Air Italy and transformed it into a carrier with five announced nonstop U.S. destinations from Milan.

The Qatari government said in 2018 it was unaware of any plans to launch flights from Qatar to U.S. destinations via stops in Europe known as ""Fifth Freedom"" flights.

291,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",The Unusual Courtship of China's ESports Queen,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Forget medical school and engineering degrees. With a record 8.3 million university graduates this year, Beijing is urging its best and brightest to take up competitive video-gaming. ESports professionals can make triple the national average salary, according to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. As the economy slows, pouring resources into China’s night-shift GDP might just be wacky enough to work. 
Municipal governments have taken the hint, luring gaming clubs with cash handouts and other perks. The resort island of Hainan is setting up a 1 billion yuan ($150 million) development fund and giving up to 10 million yuan in subsidies for international tournaments. Shanghai’s Yangpu district offers a 30% rental discount to businesses in the sector.
The push has made unlikely pairings of 60-year-old local bureaucrats and thirtysomething eSports executives, who’ve been forced to ditch their PowerPoint presentations for formal government memos. Pan Jie, nicknamed “the Queen” among China’s professional gamers, has learned that Bohemian dresses and video-game T-shirts don’t go over well when officials visit the Hangzhou headquarters of her club, LGD-Gaming, one of China’s largest.
With government support, Pan Jie’s dream of operating her own eSports stadium is getting closer to fruition. Still, you’d be forgiven for doubting that layers of statist procedure can springboard the competitive video-gaming sector, particularly when China’s private enterprises are already struggling to get the funding they need. 
Having scouted venues across China, Pan Jie settled on a plot of land on the outskirts of Hangzhou, within a shantytown development zone located in the Xia Cheng district. Beijing has been working to revive these areas since 2015, with the central bank flying in more than 3.5 trillion yuan of helicopter money to support such projects through pledged loans. 
The Xia Cheng district is hoping that a new eSports park – along with the tourism and tech jobs it can generate – will bring in over 1 billion yuan, more than 10% of the 8.9 billion yuan in fiscal revenue it collected in 2018. Judging from a publication by the district’s news office, officials seem to have outlined concrete policies rather than grand promises. 
Indeed, the local government was quick to act, tearing down old residential buildings to make space for the new construction, which will eventually house up to 1,000 startups. To help LGD-Gaming move into the new center by its May deadline, officials even called furniture shops late at night, demanding employees work overtime to meet the company’s needs. A handful of bureaucrats temporarily stationed at the park have been assigned as startup liaisons.
Whether Xia Cheng can meet all the grand expectations is a big unknown. Hangzhou is home to China’s wealthiest businesses, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. Yet not all areas are created equal. Last year, Xia Cheng’s GDP grew 6.1% to 93 billion yuan, not even half that of the tourist district of Yu Hang. 
Meanwhile, Xia Cheng has entrenched business interests to deal with. Smack at the center of the eSports zone is a huge, five-story warehouse occupied by Zhejiang Food Stuff Corp., a provincial champion known for its cured ham. The district has to wait for the company to build another site before any demolition work can begin. For the time being, startups have occupied a small corner of the redevelopment zone, and Shenzhen-based Quantum Capital, a venture-capital firm, postponed opening a branch there. 
Over the next five years, China’s competitive video-gaming industry can absorb close to 2 million workers, according to the Ministry of Human Resources. But throwing cash at an idea isn’t enough. Bureaucrats will need to show that they can work effectively with what they once called the “lost souls” of the gig economy. During a recent visit to LGD-Gaming, one official pooh-poohed a hipster barbecue joint inside the eSports park: Grilling lamb chops on an open pit? How undignified, he apparently complained. The business was shut within days. “We were sad for a while, because their lamb tasted great,” Pan Jie lamented."

Frydenberg told the AFR he had ""secured a guarantee"" from the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) that it would accept all recommendations of an independent review into the regulator released earlier this week.
APRA Chairman Wayne Byres had expressed reservations with some of the more contentious recommendations from the capability review, including a veto on directors.
""We have agreed to act on all five recommendations relevant to government, including providing APRA with sufficient powers regarding the appointment and reappointment of directors and senior executives, and APRA has stated it also supports implementation of all 19 recommendations directed at it,"" Frydenberg told the AFR.
Byres had also argued that APRA, which is government-funded but independent, needed more money to carry out its work.
""We will give APRA the resources that they need and that will be considered in the context of the budget,"" Frydenberg told the AFR. ""It will be defined by APRA and Treasury working together.""

The drone was a threat to the ship and its crew, Trump said at the White House on Thursday. The president said he’s calling “on other nations to protect their ships as they go through the Strait.” The Boxer is an amphibious assault ship.
“The Boxer took defensive action against an Iranian drone which had closed into a very, very near distance -- approximately 1,000 yards, ignoring multiple calls to stand down and was threatening the safety of the ship and the ship’s crew,” Trump said.
Oil futures in New York traded at $55.80 a barrel in early Asia trading, up 50 cents from Thursday’s close.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement that the Boxer “was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz” when a drone “closed within a threatening range” and “the ship took defensive action.”
The confrontation comes as tensions between Washington and Tehran remain high over a spate of attacks on cargo ships, the downing of an American drone and the British seizure of a tanker carrying Iranian oil.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. condemned Iranian naval activity in the Persian Gulf and demanded that the Islamic Republic release a small tanker and its crew that its forces seized this week.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Wednesday that said his country is capable of shutting the Strait of Hormuz, but doesn’t want to do so.
“We certainly have the ability to do it, but we certainly don’t want to do it because the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf are our lifeline,” Zarif said in New York. “It has to be secured. We play a big role in securing it, but it has to be secure for everybody.”
About one-third of the world’s seaborne crude and fuels passed through the Strait of Hormuz last year, highlighting its key role in global oil markets. In May and June, six tankers were attacked in the region. While Iran has been blamed for attacks on merchant shipping, it has denied responsibility.
“It’s dangerous because it is very crowded,” Zarif said, adding that the last time the area was this crowded, the U.S. shot down an Iranian commercial airliner with 290 passengers in 1988. “We feel the danger and that is why we want to avoid a dangerous escalation, but we cannot give up defending our country.”
Iran and the U.S. have been at loggerheads since last year, when Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear agreement he called the “worst deal ever.” In May, the administration refused to extend waivers to eight governments for Iranian oil purchases, ratcheting up the pressure on the country’s already battered economy.
‘Serious Gesture’
Speaking to reporters in New York on Thursday, Zarif said he had made a “substantial” offer to break the impasse with the U.S. While Trump administration officials have said they are willing to meet Iranian leaders without preconditions, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has laid out a series of demands -- including ending support for proxy militias in other countries -- he says Iran must adhere to before sanctions are lifted. Iran wants some easing of sanctions first.
In the meantime, Iran has proceeded with efforts to enrich uranium beyond limits proscribed by the 2015 accord.
A Trump administration official, asking not to be identified, said a “serious gesture” on Iran’s part would involve ending uranium enrichment immediately and move toward ending ballistic missile development. Zarif and other officials have said they won’t bargain away the right to have missiles for defensive purposes.

294,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 06:00PM ET</span>",Japan Is a One-Party State Again And Voters Are Fine With That,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party is heading into Sunday’s upper house election burdened with an unpopular sales tax hike plan, a divisive bid to change the pacifist constitution and a black mark for fueling public unease over the pension system.
It’s expected to win hands down.
The country’s fragmented opposition has consistently failed to take advantage of cabinet scandals, gaffes and a security agenda that has sometimes sparked voter anger. As a result, almost seven years after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to office, he is set to win his sixth straight national election victory and become the country’s longest-serving premier come November.
It’s a phenomenon that has even some members of the LDP lamenting the lack of competition. “Even though we’re going into the election calling for a tax increase, the LDP is in pretty good shape. This is incomprehensible,” said Shigeharu Aoyama, an upper house lawmaker from the ruling party. “It’s not healthy at all.”
Opposition parties are campaigning on popular pocketbook issues they say will ensure financial stability for families, trying to capitalize on public support for canceling Abe’s planned October sales tax increase. Abe is promising stability, strength and the status quo, which seems to be a winning formula.
The LDP-led block is expected to take at least 70 of the 124 upper house seats up for grabs, a Kyodo News poll released this week showed. The party has controlled the lower house, and thus the government, for all but four of the past 64 years.
“There are various parties in opposition now, but they can’t present a unified front,” said Mieko Nakabayashi, a former lawmaker with the Democratic Party of Japan, which a decade ago was the last opposition group to seize power from the LDP. “That means it’s hard for them to win elections. The public doesn’t look at this favorably,” said the lawmaker turned politics professor at Waseda University.
For example, voters in Tokyo will not only have a choice between the LDP, its coalition partner Komeito and the two halves of the former DPJ -- the Constitutional Democratic Party and the Democratic Party for the People -- but a total of 20 candidates from about a dozen different parties and groups.
Changing Times
Back in 2009, the DPJ ejected an LDP that voters saw as out of touch, sparking hopes that a two-party system could take root. But the government’s support rate tumbled to about 13% after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that left about 20,000 people dead or missing, with reasons cited by respondents being distrust of its statements on the nuclear crisis and the party’s political infighting.
A crushing election defeat in 2012 stopped the Democrats’ advance and they were returned to the political wilderness, where they’ve remained ever since. To make matters worse, a 2017 attempt to oust Abe by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike ended up splitting the DPJ into two parties that have shown no sign of reunifying.
Meanwhile, a buoyant jobs market has helped shield Abe from complaints about his administration, which has been able to end a deflationary spiral in the world’s third-largest economy through unprecedented monetary easing and government spending. He’s also managed to maintain the LDP’s traditional close relations with the U.S. -- Japan’s sole security guarantor -- despite occasional criticism from President Donald Trump.
Asked which party they supported, 45% of respondents to a poll carried out by the Asahi newspaper July 13-14 said they didn’t know or didn’t favor any. While the LDP had 34% support, no other party scored more than 6%.
“If the LDP wins every time, there will be no checks on it,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor of politics at the University of Tokyo. The remnants of the DPJ “should work together to oppose the LDP,” he added.
Faltering Fortunes
The career of Kuniko Koda, who won election to the upper house as a member of the then-rapidly rising opposition DPJ in 2007, traces the party’s faltering fortunes. She left the DPJ before its defeat in 2012 and later joined Koike’s Party of Hope.
This month, she is leaving national politics in favor of a campaign to become governor of Saitama prefecture, bordering Tokyo. She will be running as an independent. Koda said DPJ leaders lacked a determination to keep the party in power and failed to take responsibility for their mistakes by handing over to a new generation.
“We need another major party that can take over from the LDP as the party of government,” Koda said in an interview at her campaign office in Saitama. “The diplomacy and national security policies should be the same, but it should be capable of quick reforms to meet the needs of the time.”
While an upper house election doesn’t lead to a change in regime, an opposition majority can delay the government’s agenda. The main question for Abe this Sunday is whether he can win the two-thirds’ majority needed to order a national referendum on his plan to revise the pacifist constitution.
That such a milestone is within reach is a sign of how voters are opting for stability. Abe has prided himself on managing the economy, but even the prospect of a downturn is unlikely to convince voters to switch allegiance, said Nakabayashi, the former DPJ lawmaker.
“If the voters become dissatisfied with the administration, the only other option is the opposition parties. But they are not showing they have the capacity to run the government,” she said. “Voters feel nothing good will come from having the opposition take over.”"

Indonesia plans to spend billions of dollars in building aluminum and nickel smelters as it seeks to cut reliance on imports of finished metal and stem exports of raw minerals.
State-owned PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium will earmark as much as $10 billion over the next five years to develop refineries and smelters, according to President Director Budi Gunadi Sadikin. The investment will be made by the company and its units including nickel and bauxite miner PT Aneka Tambang, he said.
Indonesia is seeking to reshape its mining industry by making it mandatory for miners to build smelters after decades of free exports of raw materials left it reliant on costly imports to meet demand. The company is investing $850 million in building a 1-million ton smelter-grade alumina refinery in West Kalimantan that, when completed in 2022, will help reduce the country’s 500,000 tons of alumina imports each year, Sadikin said.
“The refinery will use Indonesia’s abundant bauxite supply,” Sadikin said in an interview at his office in Jakarta on July 16. “This is an energy-intensive industry. We can benefit from abundant water supply and construct hydro power plants.”
Bauxite Reserves
Inalum plans to ramp up the capacity of its Mempawah refinery to 2 million tons eventually and export half its output as global demand for the metal has been steadily rising in recent years, Sadikin said. Inalum, which has access to an estimated 579 million wet metric tons of bauxite ore reserves through Aneka Tambang, known as Antam, plans to boost aluminum production to 2 million tons by 2035 from 250,000 tons now, he said.
Inalum, which owns a controlling stake in the world’s second-largest copper mine, is seeking to compete with mining majors such as  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group, United Co. Rusal and Aluminum Corp of China Ltd. with its expansion, Sadikin said.
The company’s expansion plans will not be without hurdles, Sadikin said, adding securing permits for hydro power plants in Indonesia were still difficult. However, Inalum is seeing rising demand of aluminum from its clients, whose operations span from automotive to construction. PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia has ordered the metal for its car rims, while state electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara is seeking it as light-weight transmission cables, Sadikin said.
Vale Stake
Inalum is also close to sealing a deal with nickel miner PT Vale Indonesia to acquire a 20% stake and the purchase may help tighten its grip in nickel production as demand for the metal soars from battery makers for electric vehicles. The acquisition will be based on Vale’s current market price, he said.
The nickel major, majority owned by Vale SA, has until October to sell the stake to Indonesian buyers under its contract of work with the government. Vale’s 20% stake will be valued at about $445 million at Wednesday’s closing price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Inalum’s other expansion plans include:"
296,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 05:26PM ET</span>","Morgan Stanley reports drop in profit, but wealth management gains","By Elizabeth Dilts and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reported a drop in quarterly profit Thursday, hit by lower market activity amid global trade tensions and expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts.
It was the last big U.S. bank to report earnings in a quarter that exposed weaknesses in Wall Street's investment bank and trading businesses. But Morgan Stanley executives downplayed the toll rate cuts could have on profitability and highlighted growth in the bank's wealth management unit.
The wealth business, which contributes 44% of Morgan Stanley's revenue, rose 1.9% to $4.40 billion from a year earlier. The unit benefited both from higher stock prices and more lending to customers. That more than offset the effects of lower interest rates.
The bank reported pre-tax profit margin of 28.2% for the business, just above the high end of its 26% to 28% target. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman placed a huge bet on wealth manager nearly a decade ago as a source of stable revenue.
Lower interest rates can squeeze a bank's net interest income, or the difference between what it pays for deposits and earns from loans. But Morgan Stanley officials said they expected net interest income for the third quarter to remain in line with 2018 at roughly $1.1 billion.
""What drives the numbers is not just net interest income,"" said Gorman on a call with analysts. ""We have some other businesses over here and some of these businesses are chugging along quite nicely.""
Still, Morgan Stanley's sales and trading revenue fell 12% in the second quarter, with both bond and equity trading seeing a dip. By comparison, main rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) on Tuesday reported a drop in revenue from bond trading but higher equities trading.
Concerns about up to three rate cuts this year weighed on bank earnings throughout the week and caused rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to lower its projected net interest margin for the year.
Morgan Stanley does not report this metric, but Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said interest rate cuts would crimp margins in the wealth business. What it would do to the rest of the bank's business, he said, is less clear.
""What it does to our fixed income business and our equity business is really a function of how people interpret the cut,"" Pruzan said. ""If it improves people's view of the world that we're going to extend the economic expansion and people want to press that view in the equity markets, it could ... help.""
Equity sales and trading net revenues fell 14% in the second quarter from a year earlier.
Revenue from investment banking, which includes advising on deals and helping corporations raise money, fell 13%, helping push the bank's total revenue down to $10.2 billion.
The bank said earnings attributable to Morgan Stanley fell to $2.20 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $2.44 billion, or $1.30 per share, a year ago.
Non-interest expenses fell 2% to $7.34 billion, helped by lower compensation costs.
The bank beat analysts profit expectations of $1.14 per share. Its stock was up 0.4 percent at $43.95."

299,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>",More Puerto Rico protests planned as governor resists calls to resign,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Massive and at times violent protests in Puerto Rico showed no sign of stopping as labor unions on Thursday organized a Friday march to keep up pressure on the governor to resign, while dozens of guns were stolen in a raid on police firearms center.
Thousands of protesters have jammed streets in San Juan since Saturday, calling on Governor Ricardo Rossello to step down after the leak of a raft of controversial and vulgar text messages between him and his closest allies. The scandal comes on the heels of a federal probe into government corruption on the bankrupt island.
The guns were stolen from a police station in the coastal city of Guayama, which was vandalized with graffiti calling for the governor to resign or face bullets, according to a Thursday police statement. The FBI was investigating, it said.
The political turmoil comes at a critical stage in the U.S. territory's bankruptcy. It has also raised concerns with U.S. lawmakers who are weighing the island's requests for billions of federal dollars for healthcare and for recovery efforts following devastating hurricanes in 2017.
""Like never before, all factions of the country agree that Ricardo Rossello has to go,"" Juan Cortés, president of the Central Federation of Workers, a public- and private-sector union, said in a statement.
Rossello said on Thursday he continued to ask for forgiveness for what he has called ""improper"" but not illegal acts on his part, while affirming his commitment to remain in office.
""I recognize the enormous challenge I have before me due to the recent controversies, but I firmly believe that we can restore trust and, after this painful and shameful process, achieve reconciliation,” he said in a statement.
Two top officials in Rossello's administration, who had participated in the governor's group chat, resigned on Saturday following the release by Puerto Rico journalist group Centro de Periodismo Investigativo of 889 pages of text messages. They showed how Rossello and his closest advisers exchanged memes, comments that were derogatory, misogynistic and homophobic, as well as privileged information in a Telegram group chat.
Last week, U.S. authorities announced indictments involving six people, including two former high-ranking Puerto Rico government officials, who were charged with conspiracy and other crimes in connection with millions of dollars in federal Medicaid and education funds.
Wednesday's protest, the biggest so far, included singer and actor Ricky Martin and reggaeton artist Bad Bunny.
Rossello acknowledged that people have the right to protest, but he chastised ""a few"" protesters who he said had clashed with and injured police.
Citing ""questionable riot-control practices,"" U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat, on Wednesday asked the U.S. Justice Department to protect the civil rights of protesters on the island by deploying personnel to ""observe and document"" local police activity.
""It is my belief that the federal government must employ all appropriate mechanisms to prevent and address grievances stemming from alleged abusive practices,"" she said in a letter, adding she was troubled by reports that federal immigration agents will be involved in policing protests.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for  Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL), which canceled stops in San Juan for two ships this week, citing ""unrest"" in Puerto Rico's capital city, said a third ship docked there on Thursday."

To win over the Justice Department, which is not involved in the lawsuit, T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including selling the prepaid brand Boost.
The companies have been in talks for weeks to sell Boost to Dish Network Corp (O:DISH) but are haggling over issues such as restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future. T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), which owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, are seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company.
Sprint is controlled by Softbank Group Corp (T:9984). 
The companies told the court in late June that they were willing to refrain from closing the deal until after the state attorneys general case is completed.
The two companies have a July 29 deadline to complete the deal but are expected to extend it.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has given his blessing to the merger in principle and is expected to circulate a formal order within weeks.

Mizuho downgraded its rating on AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) to neutral from buy, sending its shares nearly 2% lower by 2:13 p.m. ET (18:13 GMT). 
The downgrade, however, does little to dent the AMD’s growth story given its solid portfolio and product ramps, the bank suggested. But, with the chipmaker's shares boasting gains of more than 80% so far this year, well above the 31% rally in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, further upside in the second half of the year could be hard to come by. 
“With the stock past our price target and at [a] 10-year high, we see 2H upside more limited,” Mizuho said. 
Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh cited several reasons for its somber outlook on AMD, including a slower ramp up of the company’s “Rome” product stack and expectations for a subdued pick up in second-half server and spending combined with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) pricing pressure. He did raise his price target on the stock to $37 from $33. That's higher than the $31.07 consensus price target among analysts polled by Investing.com.
In response to AMD’s line-up of Ryzen desktop processors, released July 7, rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has cut prices of some its processors by as much as 15%. 
AMD has been scooping up new business at the lower end of the market, following Intel’s decision to de-prioritize shipments of low-end CPUs after a ramp up in activity in its data center-related businesses weighed on its ability to churn out processors.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are up just 5% this year."
309,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 02:24PM ET</span>",Southwest joins U.S. rivals in removing Boeing 737 MAX till early November,"By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) joined U.S. rivals on Thursday in cancelling more flights until early November due to the continued grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX, which has also prompted the low-cost carrier to freeze new pilot hiring.
Dallas-based Southwest said on Thursday it would schedule without the 737 MAX until Nov. 2, a decision that proactively removes about 180 daily flights from its schedule, more than the 150 daily flights it was removing through early October.
Boeing's top-selling 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people. The timing of its return to service is uncertain.
With deliveries also on hold, Southwest has had to defer two new-hire pilot classes and two captain upgrade classes for existing pilots until it has more clarity, Southwest said in an e-mailed statement. 
As of March 31, Southwest was expecting to take delivery of 34 additional MAX 8s and seven MAX 7s in 2019.
It received three MAX 8 jets before the March 13 grounding by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which must approve updated software and training by Boeing meant to ensure that the plane is safe to fly again.
A Boeing official told Reuters last month that the company will not submit the updates until at least September following the discovery of a fresh flaw. U.S. airlines had previously expected the MAX to be flying again at some point this summer.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holding (O:UAL) also have removed the 737 MAX from their flying schedules until early November.
United Airlines, with 14 MAX jets, posted quarterly earnings on Tuesday that showed a boost in unit revenues thanks to reduced seat capacity in the sector, though costs are seen spiking over the year due to the grounding.

Southwest, the world's largest MAX operators with 34 jets, and American are due to report quarterly earnings on July 25.

U.S. President Donald Trump is barring appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body, saying its judges have overstepped their mandate and ignored their instructions. Unless the block is lifted, the world's top trade court will be unable to hear appeals in international trade disputes by December.
Trudeau, speaking after a meeting with top EU officials in Montreal, said Canada backed existing attempts to restore a fully operational Appellate Body.
""In the event that those efforts are unsuccessful, we need to be prepared. So we have been working with the European Union to find an interim fix,"" he told a news conference.
""After this summit we are closer to finalizing an agreement which would help preserve the function of an appeal system within the WTO until we find a more permanent solution.""
A joint statement issued after the Montreal meeting said the fix involved setting up an interim appeal arbitration arrangement based on existing WTO rules.
The EU last month proposed using WTO arbitration rules to set up a shadow version of the body and keep the appeals process moving, but there is uncertainty about how such a structure would work.
Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU's trade chief, told the news conference that the deal on a possible fix ""sends a strong message of our shared objective to ensure the full effectiveness of the WTO and the stability of world trade."""

327,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Pain From Hong Kong Protests Spreads as Luxury Brands Get Hit,"(Bloomberg) -- The impact from the Hong Kong protests is spreading to global luxury retailers, with jewelry and cosmetics getting hurt as shoppers and big-spending travelers stay away.
Swiss luxury-goods maker Richemont became the latest casualty, saying Thursday the street demonstrators dealt a blow to local sales. The owner of Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels echoed Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) AG in saying that the unrest in Hong Kong, the top export market for Swiss watches, weighed on sales due to store closures and lower tourist arrivals.
With restaurants and consumer brands already affected, retailers now face a widening disruption as shops from the city center to Hong Kong’s suburbs have been forced into early closures due to a lack of customers. A peaceful gathering of tens of thousands of protesters last Sunday turned into a fight with the police at a mall in Sha Tin on the city’s outskirts.
LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA are scheduled to report first-half earnings next week, potentially giving more insight into how badly the luxury sector is affected.
Travel Impact
The historic demonstrations have been brought about by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s bid to ease extraditions to the mainland. The proposal has prompted hundreds of thousands of protesters to take to the streets, bringing parts of the city to a halt since early last month.
HSBC estimates that 350,000 mainland Chinese tourists will stay away this year because of the unrest, SCMP reported. Flight bookings from Asia -- excluding the mainland and Taiwan -- to Hong Kong fell 5.4% in the period of June 16 to July 13, according to researcher ForwardKeys.
Singaporean Charles Kee, who had booked a flight to Hong Kong for August, said he will cancel the trip if the violence escalates. “Hong Kong is a pretty small place, so if tourists want to try to avoid possible protest areas, there may not be enough things for us to do,” he said.
Bad Timing
The setback comes at an inopportune time for retailers already facing headwinds from the trade war, a depreciating Chinese currency that lowers mainland tourists’ purchasing power and the threat of a global recession affecting consumer spending, said Jennifer So, senior analyst at Lego Asset Management in Hong Kong.
“Retailers that rely more on tourist spending or discretionary spending like jewelry, cosmetics and hoteliers will suffer the most,” So said. “Online spending and e-commerce will fare better.”
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association said Tuesday that most of its members reported a single-to-double-digit drop in average sales revenue between June and the first week of July, when multiple demonstrations converging on major office and retail districts took place.
Among these affected were Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd., a seller of cosmetics, which reported a 15.3% drop in same-store sales in Hong Kong and Macau for the three months through June. For the same period, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. posted an 11% decline.
Possibly easing the retailers’ pain is an expected decline in store rents caused by the protests. Rent for street shops is set to drop 5% during the second half of the year, said Simon Smith, who heads Savills Research & Consultancy in Hong Kong.
“The retail market is not looking good in the second half,” Smith said."

Earnings per share fell over 5% from a year earlier to $1.23, but were still higher than the $1.15 expected by analysts. Strong revenue gains of more than 20% in its wealth management and investing management businesses helped to offset a decline in revenues at institutional securities which includes investment banking and its sales and trading division.
Overall revenue fell 3.5% to $10.24 billion, fractionally ahead of forecasts for $10.01 billion.
The bank's shares traded largely sideways in premarket after the release. By 08:10 AM ET (12:10 GMT) in premarket trade, they were at $43.65, unchanged from before the publication. They've lost 2.5% this week as most of its Wall Street rivals have reported declining trading income and a squeeze on lending margins. Morgan Stanley has one of the smallest lending businesses of the big Wall Street banks.
The bank saw a decline of 3% in net interest income from a year earlier, matching similar reports from rivals this week. Margins have been squeezed as the spread between short- and long-term interest rates has shrunk, crimping banks' ability to invest customer deposits profitably.
Morgan Stanley is the last of the six largest U.S. banks to report earnings in a difficult environment. Rising geopolitical uncertainties and the impact of future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve present challenges to banks’ efforts to increase revenue.
Rival Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) noted that fact on Wednesday after its own earnings report, saying that Fed policy easing will likely hit net interest income.
Markets are currently pricing in a 25 basis point reduction at the Fed’s July 30-31 meeting with an additional two rate cuts by the end of the year.
 On Tuesday, JPMorgan reported second quarter EPS of $2.82 on revenue of $29.57B, compared to forecasts of EPS of $2.51 on revenue of $28.84B.

The European Commission, the EU's competition regulator, accused Qualcomm of predatory pricing between 2009 and 2011 aimed at forcing out British phone software maker Icera, now part of  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA).
""Qualcomm's strategic behavior prevented competition and innovation in the market,"" Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. 
In a news conference, she later defended the time it had taken to reach a decision - the Commission first accused the company of predatory pricing in 2015 - saying it had been a complex case that depended on evidence from Qualcomm. 
The fine amounts to 1.27% of Qualcomm's turnover in 2018. 
Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision, saying it was ""unsupported by the law, economic principles or market facts.""
The Commission also fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.1 billion) last year for paying iPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL) to use only its chips, a tactic aimed at thwarting rivals including Intel (O:INTC). 
The Commission is investigating another U.S. chipmaker, Broadcom (O:AVGO), over whether it hampers rivals. Vestager said the Commission may impose so-called interim measures, which are typically warnings to change behavior, in early autumn.
Qualcomm has been targeted by other enforcers for its business practices. In May, it lost an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission, with the judge issuing a sweeping antitrust ruling against the company.
Hefty fines, in particular against U.S. tech giants, have been a hallmark of Vestager's five-year run as Europe's antitrust enforcer, a policy which has earned her the ire of U.S President Donald Trump.
Vestager said she hoped to remain in the post when a new Commission takes office in November, but did not rule out another role. Her term ends on Oct. 31.

332,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs' equities-backed earnings results may pressure,"By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Booming stock markets around the globe helped  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) offset declines in other businesses last quarter, but those gains may not be sustainable, analysts said.
The biggest contributor to the bank's profits was the $1.5 billion it notched from its own equity investments – including $375 million from electronic trading company Tradeweb – some of which it sold during the second quarter.
Its investment bankers also handled more stock offerings than any rivals during the period, which in turn helped boost revenue from equity trading, where Goldman is also nabbing market share.
These were all bright signs in otherwise dreary results for Goldman Sachs, however. Its revenue from other major businesses, including bond trading, M&A and investment management, all fell.
Analysts warned that without more insight into how Goldman racked up equities gains last quarter and the stock market facing headwinds, they are not giving the results much weight.
""We consider these to be solid results given the operating environment ... but they underscore the importance of the firm's strategic initiatives,"" wrote David Fanger, senior vice president at Moody's.
Excluding the gains from Tradeweb, Fanger said the bank is facing ""muted client activity levels...investor concerns over trade and tariffs, uncertainty over shifts in central bank policy, and tighter credit markets compared with a year ago.""
Goldman Sachs is in the middle of a front-to-back business review launched by new Chief Executive David Solomon aimed at adding new businesses like credit cards and cash management to diversify the bank's revenue streams. Goldman's IPO investments were the biggest star of the second quarter. The investing & lending division reported net revenues of $2.5 billion, its highest in 8 years.
The bulk of revenues came from the performance and some sale of investments in Tradeweb Markets Inc,  Avantor Inc  (N:AVTR),  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and Headhunter Group Plc (O:HHR), which together make up 55 percent of the bank's public investment portfolio.
While competitor banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  (N:C) also reported big gains this week from investments in Tradeweb, Goldman's gain had a proportionately bigger impact because it is smaller, analysts said.
Still an adroit trading house, Goldman reported equities trading revenues of $2 billion, or a 6 percent rise from last year, outperforming rival banks that reported equities revenue declined.
The bank said it benefited from improved client activity and market share.
Deutsche Bank AG (N:DB) put its share of the market up for grabs earlier this month when it said it would close its equities trading business.
""The success that Goldman had this quarter (in equities trading) is definitely a more sustainable performance than the large gains in the investing & lending business,"" said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.
""To the extent that people want to trade they'll continue to have momentum there with clients."""
333,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>",GM's mid-engine Corvette gears up to take on Europeans,"By Alexandria Sage
TUSTIN, Calif. (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) was set on Thursday to unveil its newly designed mid-engine 2020 Corvette in a splashy tribute to its emblematic sports car, even as the No. 1 U.S. automaker faces mounting pressures in a sluggish and uncertain global sales environment.
Revved up to take on high-performance European rivals with the all-new model dubbed the C8, top GM executives plan a glitzy evening presentation in Orange County outside Los Angeles of the long-awaited eighth generation of the 66-year-old ""Vette"" to enthusiasts, dealers and media.
The launch comes at a challenging time for GM, which along with other global carmakers faces slowing sales and new financial pressures related to global trade, electrification and unresolved emission standards.
Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said the sports car gives the Detroit automaker a sorely needed shot in the arm after a difficult year.
""A Corvette is not going to help pad margins the way a Silverado would,"" Caldwell said. ""But from an image and excitement standpoint ... that halo effect the Corvette fills is unique.""
The Chevy Silverado full-size pickup truck, a perennial best-seller, ranks among GM's most profitable vehicles.
Since 2013, GM has sold over 100,000 C7-model Corvettes in the United States, according to Edmunds. The car ceased production this summer.
Bidding adieu to the front-engine configuration that has marked the famed two-seater since its appearance in 1953, GM has opted for a mid-engine architecture for better handling and weight distribution, the choice of many European sports carmakers.
Expected to cost far below the $113,000 starting price for the rear-engine Porsche 911, the Corvette's price could attract a younger buyer lured in recent years to high performance vehicles from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and others.
The hangar where the gasoline-fueled Corvette was set to take the stage is less than 40 miles (64 km) from Tesla's Southern (NYSE:SO) California design center, where Chief Executive Elon Musk in 2017 unveiled a prototype of a new electric Roadster - dubbed ""the quickest car in the world"" by the automaker.
Whether the Corvette can generate enough excitement to attract even the loyal buyers of the pricier European brands from Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Porsche, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, McClaren and Lotus - remains to be seen.
GM has teased the launch for months. In April, Corvette Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra drove a camouflaged C8 Corvette through New York's Times Square (NYSE:SQ) during rush hour in a high-profile tease.
Almost mythic in the American imagination, the car has been immortalized in television and film from ""Route 66"" and ""Hot Rods to Hell"" in the 1960s to ""Corvette Summer"" in 1978. Even Elvis drove the Corvette Stingray Racer in the 1967 film ""Clambake.""
Ahead of the evening launch inside a vast hangar, Corvette owners planned to mingle at a ""Corvette Corral."" One enthusiast set to attend, John Elegant, 72, said he has been waiting since his teenage years for a mid-engine Corvette. Over four years ago, he put down a deposit with a dealer for the C8.
The co-founder of http://www.midenginecorvetteforum.com, Elegant purchased his first Corvette, a canary yellow C7, in 1998 after putting his daughters through college.
""My wife turned to me and said, 'You waited 35 years, go get your Corvette.'""
Explaining the Corvette's lasting appeal, Elegant described it as ""an American sports car.""
""There are other brands that make really good muscle cars, like Mustang, but a Mustang is not a sports car. Sorry, Mustang lovers."""

The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.5% at a three-week low of 385.68 by mid-morning in Europe, a performance that would have been even worse without a bright update from pharma giant and index heavyweight   Novartis   (SIX:NOVN), which rose 3.3% to an all-time high after raising its full-year guidance.
Germany’s Dax and Spain’s IBEX were both down 1%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 fell 0.6%.
Software giant SAP (DE:SAPG), Germany’s most valuable company, fell 6.5% after revenue fell short of forecasts due to weakness in Asia, something that looks set to be a recurring theme for this quarter. SAP touched a nerve already laid bare overnight by another sharp fall in Japanese exports and an unexpected interest rate cut from South Korea.
The IBEX’s problems were due largely to construction group ACS (MC:ACS), which fell 5.6% after a disappointing update from its Australian subsidiary.
Nordea (HE:NDAFI), the biggest bank in the Nordic region, fell 6.1% after missing consensus on profit by some 10% and announcing it would review its financial targets for the year. Higher compliance costs in the wake of a money-laundering scandal and rock-bottom interest rates were largely responsible for the miss.
  Anglo American   (LON:AAL), the world’s biggest producer of diamonds, fell 1% after announcing a drop in gem sales in the first half of the year. It revised down its forecasts for diamond output this year, citing weak demand. However, it raised its forecast slightly for iron ore output and maintained its guidance on copper and coal.
Fast fashion group ASOS (LON:ASOS) continued its fall from grace, saying that problems with its new warehouses would lead to this year’s pretax profit being barely half of consensus forecasts. The stock fell as much as 14% before paring losses. It’s now wiped out its gains for this year and is testing a five-year low.
And luxury goods group   Richemont   (SIX:CFR), the owner of jeweler Cartier, fell as much as 4% after announcing results that suffered from the political unrest in Hong Kong, one of its most important markets. Like Swatch (SIX:UHR) and   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) before it, the company noted that tourist numbers had dropped, and that it had closed its stores out of safety concerns. The stock found bidders at lower levels and traded down only 0.6% by 4:45 AM ET (0845 GMT)."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) has sent letters to local partners urging them to stockpile more Japanese components in case Tokyo expands its export restrictions, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The move comes in the face of Tokyo's curbs on some exports of high-tech materials to South Korea that threaten to disrupt the global supply of microchips used by technology companies around the world.
The source, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said the letters were recently sent to local suppliers for the smartphone and home appliances businesses.
Earlier on Thursday, Yonhap news agency reported that Samsung had sent the letters and was ""exploring all possible means"" to secure more components in preparation for Japan possibly expanding the restrictions.
In letters sent earlier this week, Samsung asked partners to secure components by the end of July, or before Aug. 15 at the latest, the Yonhap report says.
Samsung, the world's biggest memory chipmaker, declined to comment on the report.
Japan is considering whether to remove South Korea from its ""white list"" of countries with minimum trade restrictions, a move South Korean officials have said would cause a ""tremendous amount of problems"" and strain ties between Japan, South Korea, and the United States.
Samsung has told its partners it would shoulder the additional costs of stockpiling the components, the report says."

Nissan shareholders last month approved the appointment of a new board at the Japanese carmaker with a more international profile as well as Senard and his Renault Chief Executive Thierry Bollore.
""There is a change,"" Senard told reporters in a briefing at Renault headquarters. ""We have a new board that is conscious of its fiduciary duty. Let that board work.""
Speaking to the Anglo-American Press Association of Paris, Senard expressed confidence that Nissan directors would see alliance cooperation as essential in the face of challenges facing the auto industry. ""Necessity sometimes helps,"" he said.
Senard, appointed in January to replace an absent Ghosn - now awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies - has had a turbulent first six months at Renault's helm.
Alliance relations, already strained by Ghosn's arrest, were further tested by Senard's failed attempts first to secure a full Renault-Nissan merger and later to combine Renault with  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA), a move thwarted by the French state.
Renault currently owns 43.4% of Nissan, whose 15% reciprocal stake in its French parent carries no voting rights.
While insisting the focus now was on alliance operations, Senard stopped short of ruling out either a full Renault-Nissan merger or a revival of deal talks with FCA (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
""I'm not pushing anything,"" the Renault chairman said, but added: ""If the board is conscious about its role, it will have to consider all the options.""
Confronted with trade risks and the investment demands of electrification and autonomous driving, ""anything that can bring synergies and cash flow is good"", he said.
No tie-up talks with FCA are ongoing as of today, Senard also said - while making clear he would still support a revived deal. ""Everyone has the right to dream."""

341,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 06:21AM ET</span>","BMW to pick new CEO, Zipse emerges as favorite","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) is set to name Oliver Zipse as its new chief executive, picking the manufacturing expert to help the German automaker make the shift to electric and self-driving cars and tackle new competition from technology giants.
The company's supervisory board will discuss new leadership at BMW's U.S. plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, later on Thursday, after 53-year-old Harald Krueger said he would not be available for a second term as CEO.
Zipse, 55, is now the front runner, with 59-year-old board member for research Klaus Froehlich also a contender, company sources told Reuters.
A fluent English speaker who joined BMW as a trainee in 1991, Zipse has risen through the ranks, holding posts including head of brand and product strategies before becoming board member for production.
Zipse has emerged as favorite because BMW's efficient production network, which he expanded in Hungary, China and the United States, has helped the company deliver industry-leading profit margins despite its relatively small scale.
But experts say auto industry leaders also need other skills for the new era of software-driven electric and autonomous cars.
""A CEO needs to have an idea for how mobility will evolve in future. This goes far beyond optimizing an existing business,"" said Carsten Breitfeld, chief executive of China-based ICONIQ motors, himself a former BMW engineer.
""He needs to be able to build teams, to attract key talent, and to promote a culture which is increasingly oriented along consumer electronics and internet dynamics.""
Being able to cope with shorter product cycles and new technologies, and a willingness to take bold decisions, are among the qualities needed, Breitfeld said.
BMW, Audi (DE:NSUG) and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn) have dominated the market for high-performance limousines for decades, but analysts warn a shift towards more sophisticated technology and software is opening the door to new challengers.
""Tesla has a lead of three to four years in areas like software and electronics. The millennials are much more focused on these things. There is a risk that the Germans can't catch up,"" UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said.
BMW had an early lead in premium electric vehicles but throttled back its ambitions after the i3, an expensive city car, failed to sell in large numbers, leading Tesla (O:TSLA) to overtake BMW in electric car sales.
Krueger's reluctance to push low-margin electric vehicles led to an exodus of talented engineers, including junior managers like Christian Senger, now Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) board member responsible for software, and Markus Duesmann, who is seen as a future Audi CEO.
Duesmann and Senger were poached by Volkswagen (VW) CEO Herbert Diess, himself a former BMW board member responsible for research who defected in 2015 to implement a bold 80 billion euros electric car strategy at VW.
Zipse, who prefers suits and ties to open shirts and sneakers, will need to ramp up BMW's software expertise as new players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) muscle into the mobility sector.
""Production expertise is important, but if you want to avoid ending up being a hardware provider for Google or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you need to have the ability to move up the food chain into data and software,"" a former BMW board member said, declining to be identified."
342,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 06:16AM ET</span>",Trump's tariffs trip up the all-American RV industry,"By Timothy Aeppel
ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - Carrie Gray points to a stack of unwelcome mail on a conference table at the offices of Renegade RV, one of the leading U.S. manufacturers of high-end recreational vehicles. She’s buried in bad news from most of her about 350 suppliers.
“We got letters from 75 percent of them demanding tariff-related price increases,” explains Gray, Renegade’s materials manager.
About 85% of the recreational vehicles sold in the United States are built in and around Elkhart County, making it a popular stop for politicians to tout their visions for U.S. manufacturing – including President Donald Trump, who staged a rally here last May.
And yet this uniquely American manufacturing sector has been caught in the crossfire of Trump’s trade war, according to interviews with industry insiders and economists, along with data showing a steep sales decline amid rising costs and consumer prices. The industry has taken hits from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and other duties on scores of Chinese-made RV parts, from plumbing fixtures to electronic components to vinyl seat covers.
Shipments of RVs to dealers have fallen 22% percent in the first five months of this year, compared to the same period last year, after slipping 4% in 2018, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association.
The RV industry’s woes illustrate how even the most “American” of manufacturers, the kind of industries Trump has vowed to protect, can be heavily exposed to tariffs in a world of globalized supply chains.
Tariff-related price hikes have forced manufacturers to pass on some of the increased costs though higher RV prices, which in turn has contributed to slower sales. As dealers cut orders, many plants furloughed workers or reduced hours, including Renegade, which has reduced its headcount of 160 by about 10 workers since May at its two factories here.
Michael Hicks, a Ball State University economist who tracks the industry, said its decline is far worse than he or other analysts expected and could signal a wider economic downturn. RV shipments have fallen sharply just before the last three U.S. recessions. (For a graphic on RV sales and past recessions, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XCPbL2 )
“The RV industry is a great bellwether of the economy,” said Hicks, because the vehicles are an expensive and discretionary purchase, easily delayed by consumers who start to worry about their financial stability.
The Commerce Department said in a statement that it has “met with private industry” to hear concerns about steel and aluminum tariffs and that it has granted most U.S. companies' requests for tariff exemptions among the applications it has fully processed. The department referred questions about tariffs on Chinese goods to the office of the United States Trade Representative, which did not respond to requests for comment.
The RV industry may have contributed to its own problems by building too many factories during a sales boom in recent years, leading to an oversupply now. But tariffs were the pivotal factor in the industry's decline, said managers at RV manufacturers and suppliers.
“The tariff price increases are what tipped the RV business — it started the landslide, no question,” said Tom Bond, the materials and purchasing manager at Adnik Manufacturing, an Elkhart-based division of Norco Industries that has been hit with higher costs on metals it uses to make components such as seat frames.
Sitting in an office near the front of the Adnik factory, Bond and Ronald Dick, the company’s brand manager, spent an hour griping about the speed and scope of their materials costs increases. And yet, like many in this region that strongly supported Trump’s election, they often added the caveat that they support the larger goal of the tariffs to protect U.S. factories from unfair foreign competition.
“It’s good for our country in the long haul,” said Dick, “but it’s going to hurt.”
 Thor Industries  Inc (N:THO) - which controls nearly half the RV market - said its sales in North America fell about 23% in its fiscal third quarter, which ended in April, compared to a year ago. The company said in a release that it has cut production and shifted to four-day weeks at some North American plants.
Workers such as Demiris Jahmal Williams (NYSE:WMB) are bracing for bumpy times. He has worked for a division of Thor for the last seven years, often working as many hours as he wanted. But his hours were cut recently, and his factory's normal week-long shutdown in July was extended to three weeks.
“This is the worse I’ve seen it,” he said.
The unemployment rate in Elkhart county has risen to 2.6%, up from a post-recession low of 2.1% last April. During the last recession, the jobless rate in Elkhart County soared to more than 19%.
Tim Sullivan, CEO of REV Group (N:REVG), Renegade's parent company, said U.S. suppliers have raised prices alongside their foreign counterparts because tariffs have sparked a rush of demand for U.S. parts.
“It’s been a total feeding frenzy,” he said.
Michael Happe, CEO of  Winnebago Industries Inc  (N:WGO), said he expects tariffs will add more than $10 million to the company's costs this fiscal year, ending in August.
The upshot, he said, is that most RV manufacturers have had to boost prices they charge dealers.
“Those make their way to the end customer,"" he said.
CUTTING WORKERS AS STEEL PRICES RISE
Despite its all-American image, the RV industry relies on imports for everything from air compressors and appliances to bedding fabrics and the LED light strings that have become a popular interior feature.
The cost of metals surged dramatically after sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum were imposed last year. Those prices have since moderated, but manufacturers say many of the price increases on the metal parts they buy haven’t gone away.
Elkhart’s RV industry anchors a large network of related transport equipment companies, including utility trailer makers and specialty bus manufacturers, who rely on the same supply chains. Matt Arnold, president of utility trailer manufacturer Look Trailers based in Middlebury, Ind., said the axles he buys had three price hikes and are now 28% higher than before tariffs, while his Chinese tire rims were hit with a 65% tariff.
(For a graphic on how tariffs drive up trailer costs, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2O3HLvO )
His rim supplier shifted to a source in Vietnam, but those still cost 8% more than he was paying before. In response, he boosted his trailer prices by about 20%, but that tanked sales. So far, he’s had to shutter his Georgia factory, laying off 80 people, and cut about 10% of his workforce in Indiana.
RISING RV PRICES, SLOWING SALES
Tariffs have so far translated into a 5% increase in RV sticker prices for consumers, estimates Gregg Fore, chief revenue officer at trade magazine RV Business and the former owner of an RV parts supplier, based on anecdotal reports and proprietary sales data he has seen.
“That doesn’t sound like a lot, until you start to talk about adding $1,000 to the price of a $20,000 vehicle,” he said.
Many RVs cost far more. Renegade, for instance, sells models that cost as much as $750,000 and can come with multiple bathrooms, heated tile floors and cedar closets.
Some industry leaders say the business will stabilize once dealers reduce excess stocks. But many of the region’s leaders are worried, including Jackie Walorski, the Republican who represents the area in Congress.
Walorski is an outspoken critic of President Trump’s tariffs, although she steps lightly. In a statement, she praised the President’s tax cuts and other policies for helping fuel economic growth.
“At the same time, I have not been afraid to stand up for Hoosiers when tariffs and retaliatory measures have put those gains at risk,” she said, using a common nickname for Indiana residents. “As I’ve told the president, we need to put a stop to China’s unfair trade practices by using a scalpel, not an axe.”"

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Novartis  (S:NOVN) boss Vas Narasimhan raised full-year targets on Thursday and announced that $700 million has been set aside in the hope of settling a decade-old lawsuit alleging that the Swiss drugmaker bribed U.S. doctors.
Shares in the company rose about 5% to their highest since 2015, buoyed by second-quarter results, earnings guidance and the prospect of avoiding trial in a case that began in 2011 as a whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former employee.
The lawsuit, since joined by the U.S. government, contends that Novartis paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to doctors so they would prescribe its products, including hypertension treatment Lotrel and diabetes drug Starlix.
A May trial was canceled as talks began in an effort to settle a case that could result in a multibillion-dollar hit if the company lost in court.
""We're working in settlement discussions to resolve the civil suit,"" Chief Executive Narasimhan told reporters. ""We've provisioned approximately $700 million."" 
A string of alleged ethical shortcomings over two decades have already cost Novartis $1 billion in the United States, China and Korea while damaging a reputation that Narasimhan has made a priority of improving since becoming CEO in 2018.
U.S. prosecutors have declined to comment. 
RAISED GUIDANCE
Novartis on Thursday reported a 20% jump in second-quarter core operating income to $3.6 billion with sales up 8% at $11.8 billion, beating an $11.5 billion forecast in a Refinitiv poll. 
The company now expects 2019 core operating income to grow at low double-digit to mid-teen percentages, Narasimhan said, up from a previous target in the high single digits. 
Sales growth is expected in the mid-to-high single digits, against previous guidance for a mid-single-digit percentage.
Its Entresto heart failure medicine registered an 81% leap in second-quarter sales to $421 million. Inflammation drug Cosentyx, the company' top seller, reached $858 million, up 25%. 
The company's Innovative Medicines business achieved a core operating margin of 35.4%, hitting Narasimhan's mid-term target ahead of schedule.
""The margin for the quarter was particularly convincing for Innovative Medicines,"" said Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider. ""The raised FY guidance does not look ambitious.""
Novartis also revised full-year sales forecasts for its Sandoz business, lifting them broadly in line with last year or possible low-single-digit growth as its copies of Roche's (S:ROG) Mabthera, AbbVie's (N:ABBV) Humira and Amgen (O:AMGN) and Pfizer's (N:PFE) Enbrel capture market share in Europe. 
SANDOZ REVAMP
Narasimhan called the result a positive surprise, adding that a revamp of Sandoz to make it an autonomous division within Novartis, which some analysts speculate could herald an eventual sale, remains ""a couple-of-years journey"".
He also highlighted the second-quarter launch of gene therapy Zolgensma, the world's most expensive drug at $2.1 million per patient, for deadly spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), saying he was pleased with its progress. 
Payers are grappling with its high one-off cost, but Narasimhan on Thursday said that children under two -- the initial patient group for which U.S. regulators approved the medicine -- have access when physicians request it. 
""We're on track and fully in line with what we expected,"" Narasimhan said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Memory chip spot prices have risen for the first time this year, indicating grim warnings of ""never seen before"" spikes and a supply disruption could come to pass as a dispute between South Korea and Japan drags on.
The 15% spike in DRAM chip prices over a week - in a sector dogged by oversupply and weak demand for more than a year - comes after Japan tightened curbs on exports of some chipmaking materials to South Korea - home to the world's top two memory chipmakers, Samsung (KS:005930) and  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660).
To be fair, the price surge indicated by industry tracker DRAMeXchange refers to the spot market that accounts for less than a tenth of the memory chip landscape as most major tech firms source through mid- and long-term contracts. 
Given this background, major customers such as iPhone maker Apple (O:AAPL) are yet to start stockpiling, but the price spike has started fuelling fears that Japan's curbs will soon impact supply, several industry sources said.
""If the ban continues, memory prices will skyrocket like never seen before as 75% of DRAM and 45% of NAND global output is at risk,"" Mark Newman from Bernstein said, referring to South Korea's dominance in the supply of those memory chips.
A person at a South Korean chipmaker said customers were ""following the situations closely"" but ""taking a wait-and-see approach as demand still remains weak"". 
Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment.
""We will need contingency plans if the impact materializes,"" said a spokeswoman at Vaio, a Sony Corp (T:6758) spinoff.
""Options include seeking alternative chip suppliers outside South Korea,"" she said, adding business at the Japanese computer maker had, however, not yet been hit.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), the world's top contract chipmaker, warned that Japan's export curb is the ""biggest uncertainty"" for the fourth quarter.
CONTINGENCY PLANS
Japan has tightened curbs on exports of three chipmaking materials - fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays; photoresists, used to transfer circuit patterns on to semiconductor wafers; and hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas when making chips.
South Korea sourced 94% of fluorinated polyimides, 92% of photoresists and about 44% of hydrogen fluoride from Japan in the first five months of this year, Korean industry data showed.
Seoul has said it is seeking to make its supply chain more independent and has been getting fresh offers from Russia and China to provide hydrogen fluoride.
A local media reported that South Korea was considering lowering import tariffs on these products from other countries to fill in any potential supply gaps.
""We ... do see some (chip) module manufacturers raising their quotes or announcing halts to production in light of the material restrictions ...,"" research firm TrendForce said.
In NAND flash market, supply has also been hurt by an output halt at Japan's Toshiba Memory last month due to a power outage.
A person at Toshiba Memory said the plant resumed operations in mid-July but it will take time for shipments to recover fully and that the company still has to catch up with existing orders.
Brokerage UBS said this week it expects NAND contract chip prices to fall 5% in the third quarter, less than a previous forecast for a 10% quarter-on-quarter drop, citing Toshiba's output cut and Japan's export curbs. But it kept its projection for a 17% drop in DRAM contract prices unchanged.
NAND chips are found in mobile devices as well as memory cards, USB flash drives and solid-state drives, while DRAM is used to support electronic devices performing multi-tasks.
Clear winners from better chip prices would be Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Toshiba, Nanya and  Western Digital , Bernstein's Newman said.
""Samsung and SK Hynix, although potentially hurt from production issues, would also benefit from significantly higher prices and ironically likely still be net winners,"" he added.
Shares of Micron have risen 12% since Japan announced the export curbs on July 1, while Western Digital Corp (O:WDC) and SK Hynix have gained 8% and 7% respectively. Taiwan's Nanya Technologies (TW:2408) has increased 5%.

Samsung shares, however, have dipped 2% over the period, hurt by its forecast for a 56% plunge in second-quarter profit due to tumbling memory chip prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares slipped on Thursday on growing signs that a trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on corporate earnings, with nerves spreading from Wall Street through Asia to European markets.
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.2% to their lowest in nine days, while the Euro STOXX 600 slipped 0.5% to its lowest in almost three weeks.
The earnings season, kicking off this week, brought bad signs as rail freight giant CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX), cut its revenue forecast as it warned of the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, pushing down Wall Street indexes on Wednesday.
In Europe, too, earnings were top of the agenda. Tech stocks led the slide as software firm SAP, Europe's most valuable tech stock by market cap, reported poor results, also flagging the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
With nerves already on edge over when face-to-face talks between the United States and China will resume, U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday maintained pressure on Beijing with a threat to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods.
Investors also cited a report that progress toward a U.S.-China trade deal has stalled as the Trump administration works out how to address Beijing's demands that it ease restrictions on Huawei Technologies.
""It's still about the U.S. and China dispute,"" Christophe Barraud, chief economist and strategist at Market Securities. ""The trade war is creating uncertainty, weighed on capex, and clearly on trade flows."" 
""There are also problems with guidance, especially in the transportation sector. The fact is that one of the key stories of this year is global trade flows contraction,"" he said. 
Adding to the concerns over corporate health, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shed U.S. subscribers for the first time in 8 years, sending shares falling over 10% after the close of the market. 
For a graphic on U.S. versus European earnings, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2k0q0j0 
Compounding the trade concerns were concerning signs for the economy emerging from Japan to the United States. 
Japan's exports slumped yet again, falling 6.7% in June, while manufacturers' confidence fell to a three-year low in July on the back of the trade tensions and slowing China growth. 
U.S. housebuilding fell in June for a second consecutive month, with building permits also falling, in a possible sign of more trouble ahead for the housing market. 
The earnings anxiety and macro data boosted demand for safe haven assets, with yields on benchmark 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasuries climbing overnight.
Euro zone government bond yields slipped back toward record lows on Thursday as economic indicators and corporate earnings deepened gloom on the global economy and increased bets on interest-rate cuts by major central banks. 
Amid the gloomy outlook, bets for further monetary policy easing from major central banks have grown, with speculation on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will be cut by 25 basis points or 50 basis points in July.
While markets take comfort from central banks' willingness to support growth, said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, there were concerns for equity markets that have rallied on the back of stimulus expectations. 
The weak start to the Q2 earnings season may spill over into the outlook for the remainder of the year, threatening equity markets' stellar rally this year.
""We are probably in the middle of analysts downgrading Q3 company earnings expectations,"" he said. 
Earlier in the day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.3%, with Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei tumbling 2.0%, its biggest one-day fall in four months.
POUND TO PARITY?
In currencies, the dollar edged lower against its rivals on the softer U.S. Treasury yields, with investors focusing their attention on the Fed's meeting next week.
Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar edged 0.1% lower to 97.195.
Sterling was a shade higher at $1.244, off its lowest since April 2017 touched on Wednesday amid growing risks of Britain leaving the European Union in a no-deal Brexit.
Major British banks, such as HSBC, are already talking of the possibility of the pound breaching post-Brexit referendum lows of $1.149, with some asking whether the pound is headed for parity against both the dollar and the euro.
Oil prices were mixed, with U.S. crude extending losses after data showed U.S. stockpiles of gasoline and other products rising sharply last week, suggesting weak demand.

Brent crude futures were up 6 cents, or 0.1%, at $63.71 a barrel by 0755 GMT. They fell 1.1% on Wednesday.

The solar park, called Bargas, will be built in Toledo, some 80 km (50 miles) south of Madrid, and be operated without government subsidies, the firms said in a statement. Construction is scheduled to start in coming weeks.
For Aventron, the deal is a way to secure the project's financing as power purchase agreements are crucial for subsidy-free plants, chief operating officer Eric Wagner said.
""Τhis is a crucial element for the marketability of subsidy-free green electricity production,"" he said.
Operations at the plant are expected to start in July 2020.
Earlier on Thursday, Statkraft said its underlying operating profit (EBIT) for the second quarter of 2019 reached 2.6 billion crowns ($303 million), up from 1.4 billion a year earlier, due to higher power output and improved market operations.
For the first six months of 2019, underlying EBIT reached a record-high 9 billion crowns, up from 7.4 billion a year earlier."

Prices of iron ore, used with coking coal to make steel, have outperformed other base metals and hit five-year highs after a Vale (SA:VALE3) dam disaster in Brazil led to production shut-ins. 
Anglo American's iron ore production was helped by the ramp-up of the Minas Rio mine in Brazil and a strong performance from coking coal after plant upgrade work in the first quarter, helping offset the impact of reduced diamond production.
""We remain broadly on track overall to deliver this full year's production targets,"" CEO Mark Cutifani said in a statement.
Diamond production at the company's De Beers unit fell 14% as work continues at its Venetia mine in South Africa to switch to underground mining from open pit and against a backdrop of weaker demand and lower prices. 
The company revised its diamond production forecast down to about 31 million carats, at the lower end of its previous 31-33 million carats range, citing weaker trading conditions. 
The weaker market was partly because of ""caution due to macro-economic uncertainty, including the U.S.-China trade tensions"", it said, adding De Beers would continue to produce in response to demand for the year. 
Copper production increased by 1% and platinum rose 3% year on year.
Minas Rio's iron ore production climbed to 5.9 million tonnes. Anglo American restarted operations there in December after receiving regulatory approval to step up production following a prolonged outage because of a leak.
Anglo American is still waiting for one more permit needed for work on a tailings dam, which it says is expected before the end of the year.
Metallurgical, or coking, coal production increased by 11% following site improvements, while thermal coal, used for power, fell 8% because of a lack of water. 
In a note, analysts at Bernstein reiterated their outperform rating for Anglo American but said the results were mixed.

Anglo American's share price slipped 1% by 0820 GMT. The stock has risen by nearly 25% since the start of the year.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>","Truckmaker Volvo beats expectations, picks Samsung for batteries","By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb) raised its market forecasts for North America and Europe on Thursday, as higher trucks and construction equipment deliveries helped it to top profit estimates.
The world's second largest truckmaker behind  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) also announced a partnership with Samsung (KS:006400) to develop battery packs for its electric trucks, its second big deal in recent weeks. 
The company, which joined forces with  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) last month to develop artificial intelligence for self-driving trucks, is racing with rivals to develop autonomous and electric trucks.
The battle comes as rising geopolitical tensions and signs of economic slowdown have ignited concerns that, after years of strong growth, demand for trucks may have peaked. 
Volvo indicated it now expected truck demand in Europe this year to be flat, compared with its previous forecast of down 6%, while North America would be up 5% instead of flat. 
However, order intake for trucks, which the company sell under the Volvo, Mack,  Renault  (PA:RENA) and UD Trucks brands, fell for a second consecutive quarter - by 21% to 47,821 units.
""The higher truck guide in Europe reflects a strong start to the year, but it has to be noted that Volvo has a less favorable mix versus others versus those regions performing well,"" Citi analyst Klas Bergelind said in a note. 
Volvo shares, which have gained about a quarter in value this year, were little changed in early trade. 
ADAPTING PRODUCTION
Chief Executive Martin Lundstedt said the company would begin to adapt production to expectations of a market slowdown during the second half of the year. In the past, this has included reducing inventory and cutting working hours.
The company also undertook a 10 billion Swedish crown cost-cutting program that completed in 2016, which included shedding thousands of mainly white collar jobs and focusing its spending on businesses where it could be a market leader.
Lundstedt, however, ruled out launching a new large-scale cost savings program, telling analysts: ""My firm conviction is this type of big program is a story of yesterday.""
Handelsbanken analyst Hampus Engellau said: ""The cycle is slowing coming into next year, and therefore I think this is important ... to avoid ending up in an underproduction, which has been the Achilles' heel historically for Volvo.""
Volvo has seen strong demand in recent years as truck buyers renewed fleets starved of investment during the last downturn, but this has led to it facing supply chain bottlenecks that have added costs and weighed on profit.
The Gothenburg-based has taken steps to address this and reported second-quarter operating margin grew to 12.5% from 11.9% a year earlier, staying above its 10% target.
Operating profit rose to 15.11 billion Swedish crowns ($1.62 billion) from 12.34 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' average forecast of 13.34 billion, according to Refinitiv.

""These are solid numbers by Volvo and we expect (full year)consensus EPS (earnings per share) to move up by 2-3%,"" Citi's Bergelind said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo on Thursday announced plans to cut fixed costs by 2 billion Swedish crowns ($214 million), becoming the latest carmaker to warn that pricing pressure and tariffs arising from the China-U.S. trade war were denting profitability.
Carmakers are under pressure from trade conflicts, hefty investment needed to develop electric and driverless cars and an overall downturn in the car industry.
Volvo, part of China's Geely family, aims to produce premium cars to rival BMW (DE:BMWG) and Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz. It has rejigged its global production plans in an effort to reduce the impact of increased tariffs.
Volvo began reviewing its staffing and other costs earlier this year. So far it has cut 750 jobs, mainly engineering and IT consultants, and reduced the hourly wage for such consultants, which CEO Hakan Samuelsson would led to savings 1 billion crown from July.
The carmaker said the new cost measures would start in the second half and run to the first half of 2020. Samuelsson said these would include some further job cuts but would mainly be focused on cost-cutting to save another billion. 
""Market conditions are expected to put continued pressure on margins, but the combination of volume growth and cost measures is expected to result in a strengthened profit in the second half of the year compared with the same period last year,"" Volvo said in a statement.
Second-quarter operating profit fell 38.1% to 2.6 billion crowns in the three months to June 30, a worse quarter-on-quarter drop than in the first quarter and despite revenues improving by 1.8% to 67.2 billion crowns.
Earlier this month,  Daimler  cut its profit forecast for the fourth time in 13 months. In May, BMW warned on profits, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said the return on sales at its passenger cars division would come in at the lower end of its target.
Volvo has a deal for its new models in China to use in-car applications from Huawei, which is still facing partial U.S. sanctions and potential bans in European countries over fears that its equipment could be used for spying.
CEO Samuelsson said the actions against Huawei would have no impact on Volvo's plans, which is using Huawei's app store in China, while relying on Google's (O:GOOGL) app store elsewhere in the world.
""We'll use the Google Android app store worldwide but it's not available in China so we have a cooperation with Huawei. But it's not really about technology's access to their apps so we don't see any influence from that cooperation in anyway to our business,"" he told Reuters.

Second-quarter pre-tax profits fell to 4.76 billion Danish crowns ($716.6 million) from 5.49 billions the previous year, missing a mean forecast of 5.06 billion by analysts according to Refinitiv data.
""In the first half of 2019, we faced a challenging rates and margin environment as well as increased costs for compliance measures. But we also saw continued growth in lending and solid credit quality,"" Danske's newly-appointed chief executive Chris Vogelzang said on Thursday. 
 Danske Bank , whose shares have dropped more than 40% over the last year, cut its profit outlook July 8, partly due to higher costs related to compliance and anti-money laundering activities.
In a scandal that has rocked the Nordic banking sector, Danske said last year it had channeled 200 billion euros of suspicious payments through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Danske said it expected to have to add to its capital reserves after retail clients had been overcharged fees in relation to an investment product called Flexinvest Fri and also because of an inspection into its IT governance structure. The bank said this would be in the mid-single-digit billion Danish crown range.
Danske said in June it would compensate around 87,000 Flexinvest Fri clients who had been overcharged, which would cost the bank approximately 400 million Danish crowns this year and further weighing on costs this quarter.

The bank has already increased its capital requirements by 10 billion Danish crowns earmarked for ""increased compliance and reputational risks"" after the Estonia money laundering case in response to orders from the Danish financial regulator.

The budget airline added it had poached Peter Bellew as its chief operating officer from Ryanair (I:RYA).
EasyJet said total revenue for the quarter ending June 30 increased by 11.4% to 1.8 billion pounds, driven by more bookings and more ancillary revenue from additional services like bag check-ins.
The robust trading, at a time when many smaller rivals are struggling, comes despite a general softening of demand due to tougher macroeconomic conditions across Europe as well as Brexit-related consumer uncertainty in Britain, it said.
""With second-half forward bookings at 78% we have better visibility on the second half and expect to deliver a profit before tax of between 400 million pounds and 440 million pounds, in line with market expectations,"" Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said. 
The group added that it had hired Bellew who is stepping down from his role at Ryanair at the end of the year, according to a memo to staff seen by Reuters.

“We expect capital requirements to be subject to change going forward,” the Copenhagen-based bank said on Thursday. The report follows a profit warning earlier this month, in which Danske said that extra compliance costs and a tougher trading environment forced it to lower its outlook for 2019.
“We anticipate an additional Pillar II add-on in the mid-single-digit billion range. On the basis of our earnings capacity and capitalization, we are confident that we will be able to adapt to these changes in our capital requirements,” the bank said.
Once a star among European banks, Danske has been in survival mode since its Estonian money-laundering scandal erupted last year. As investors struggle to keep up with the newsflow, Danske’s shares have plunged by almost 60% since the beginning of 2018, equivalent to more than $20 billion in lost market value.
Danske is still waiting for the result of criminal probes across Europe and in the U.S., while a number of its former top people, including ex-chief executive officer Thomas Borgen, have had preliminary charges brought against them. More recently, the bank fired a former star executive, Jesper Nielsen, after it emerged that he’d overseen a unit that had overcharged retail investors.
In June, Danske brought in ABN Amro veteran Chris Vogelzang to run the bank. He has made clear that his first priority will be to rebuild trust.
Danske has said it plans to unveil measures later this year to help the bank perform better. On Thursday, it said that it’s still “making significant investments to combat financial crime, which drives costs upwards.”
“Given these circumstances and the conditions we are operating under, we see a need for initiatives to improve our financial performance and regain our business momentum,” it said.

362,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>",Apple Chip Supplier’s Solid Performance Shows Resilience in Trade Fight,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) projected current-quarter revenue ahead of estimates, as the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). supplier shrugs off a smartphone slump and U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co. to ride demand for cutting-edge chips.
The world’s largest contract chipmaker expects sales of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion in the September quarter, according to an online presentation, ahead of average projections for about $8.9 billion. The Taiwanese company earlier reported a fall in June-quarter net income to NT$66.8 billion ($2.1 billion), surpassing the NT$65.7 billion estimated.
TSMC’s solid outlook may allay fears of a persistent global chip downturn as Washington and Beijing clash. Its technological edge in chipmaking may help it grab an outsized portion of demand for advanced high-performance semiconductors, particularly as countries roll out ultra-fast fifth generation wireless networks.
Orders for crypto-mining gear are expected to help TSMC’s third-quarter sales, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which recently lifted its target price on the stock by 9%. The typical year-end ramp up of iPhone manufacturing and a new chip-product cycle from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. could also buoy the top line.
“The guidance shows that management is confident on the recovery of demand in 2H, possibly boosted by new orders from AMD,” Bloomberg Intelligence Charles Shum said. “And, we expect the gross margin can return to 50%” by the fourth quarter.
TSMC and its industry peers are grappling with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by top customer Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs that have hammered No. 2 customer Huawei. It previously reported a 4.5% slide in first-half revenue -- its worst January-to-June performance since 2011.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 12:34AM ET</span>","SoftBank's Son says Japan lacks investment opportunities, is AI 'developing country'","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Thursday that there is a dearth of investment opportunities in Japan, which he said is lagging in the race to develop artificial intelligence (AI).
""Until recently Japan was at the technological leading edge. In the most important current technology revolution – artificial intelligence – Japan has become a developing country,"" Son said at an annual SoftBank event for suppliers and customers.
While SoftBank's $100 billion Saudi-backed Vision Fund has poured tens of billions of dollars into bets on late-stage tech startups around the world, it has overlooked Japan in favor of countries such as the United States, China and India.
""Unfortunately there are virtually no companies that can be called global No. 1 unicorns,"" Son said of Japan, referring to startups reaching $1 billion valuations.
Son asked the assembled corporate attendees in Tokyo to raise their hands if their companies have employed 1,000 AI engineers, with none doing so.
With a limited pool of IT engineers in Japan, particularly when English language skills are required, tech firms investing in AI like SoftBank rival  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) and flea market app operator  Mercari  Inc (T:4385) have been looking overseas with India a recruitment focus.
Rakuten, which will begin mobile services in October - putting it in direct competition with SoftBank's domestic telco, SoftBank Corp (T:9434) - plans to double the number of IT engineers in Bengaluru over the next year from 550 currently.
Innovation in artificial intelligence has become how Son defines the Vision Fund's investment thesis, whose bets on 82 companies span sectors including ride-hailing, fintech and healthcare.
""Japan needs to wake up to this new reality and catch up,"" he said.
Underscoring the contrast with his home country, where technology innovation remains dominated by long-established companies, Son brought on stage self-made entrepreneurs from SoftBank portfolio companies.
Speakers included Ritesh Agarwal, 25-year-old founder of Indian hotel chain OYO, and Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of payment app Paytm parent One97 Communications.
Many of these companies are expanding beyond their original remits, with Paytm, which has grown rapidly by offering QR code payments, moving into insurance and credit, and Southeast Asian ride-hailing app Grab offering payments and food delivery.

While SoftBank has served as a gateway into Japan for some of its portfolio companies, its ability to help drive synergies between them is yet to be demonstrated, with this week's conference bringing some of the founders together in Tokyo.

While the Mumbai-based lender returned to profit in the three months ended June, its provisions for soured debts almost tripled from a year earlier, results showed late Wednesday. Yes Bank will need to issue fresh capital to give it room to boost revenue and profitability, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Diksha Gera said.
The results “turned out to be far worse than what we had anticipated,” Jefferies analysts led by Nilanjan Karfa wrote in note, cutting their share price target for Yes Bank to 50 rupees from 80 rupees. “Capital infusion is of utmost urgency.”
Yes Bank is grappling with a crisis among shadow lenders because of its sizeable exposure to the cash-strapped industry. The issue has complicated new Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill’s efforts to clean up the balance sheet after the lender clashed with the Reserve Bank of India last year for not adequately disclosing problem loans.
The shares slid 11% at 9:28 a.m. in Mumbai, taking this year’s decline to 52%. The stock is the worst performer on India’s benchmark Sensex index this year.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Yes Bank’s profitability could face pressure due to capital constraints hampering revenue growth, further aggravated by margin pressure and elevated provisions.
--Diksha Gera, bank analyst

Net income was 1.14 billion rupees ($16.6 million) in the three months ended June 30 compared with a loss of 15.07 billion rupees in the March quarter and profit of 12.6 billion rupees a year earlier, a filing showed late Wednesday. That missed the 1.48 billion rupee average analyst estimate.
Yes Bank set aside 17.8 billion rupees as provisions in the quarter. They included a one-time impact of 11 billion rupees for losses in investments due to rating downgrades at companies belonging to two financial services groups, the bank said, without identifying them. The provisions rose from 6.26 billion rupees a year earlier but were smaller than 36.6 billion rupees three months ago.
Other Key Figures
The decline in the core capital ratio “is worrisome,” said Jaikishan Parmar, an analyst at Angel Broking. “It means that they won’t be able to grow if they cannot raise capital.”

Leung is alleged to have offered employment to the son of the chairman of a logistics company as a reward for the chairman favoring JPMorgan when choosing banks to work on the company's IPO, Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in May.
Leung did not comment when approached by Reuters outside the court room. The trial for the case has been set to start on Feb. 25, 2020, and will continue for eight days. 
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment on the development on Thursday and instead referred to a statement in May that said: ""This is a historical case, which J.P. Morgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016.""
JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million in 2016 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-settlement/jpmorgan-to-pay-264-million-to-resolve-china-hiring-probe-sec-doj-idUSKBN13C1Z8to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials - dubbed ""princelings"" - to win banking deals. 
The bank did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business.
U.S. authorities at the time said JPMorgan's Asia unit created an elaborate program, called ""Sons and Daughters"", that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires.
The U.S. Federal Reserve banned former JPMorgan managing director, Timothy Fletcher, from the industry for life, in February, for his role in the hiring program. Fletcher worked in the bank's Hong Kong office. 
Leung was vice-chair of Asia investment banking when she left JPMorgan in February 2015 amid a wider reshuffle in the bank's regional leadership. 
She first joined JPMorgan in 1994, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, and left to join rival Merrill Lynch in 2001, before rejoining JPMorgan in 2002.
The prosecutor in Leung's case, Glen Kong, asked the judge on Thursday to consider merging the case with that of another ongoing investigation as the two share a similar witness list.
No arrests have been made in the other case but the suspect, currently in mainland China, is likely to return to Hong Kong, the prosecutor said. Details of the case were not available.
Judge WK Kwok did not make a decision about merging the two cases on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Australia's LendLease Group (AX:LLC) on Thursday said it secured a contract with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google to develop $15 billion worth of residential and retail space in Silicon Valley, sending the builder's stock to a more than eight-month high.
The deal is a significant boon for LendLease, coming at a time when Australian developers navigate the domestic property market's worst downturn in a generation, characterized by a drop in building approvals and tighter consumer spending.
It is also a major win for LendLease's strategy to expand abroad, and will see it reinforce its core role as a residential developer after being hobbled by its engineering division.
""It's an important deal and the client is very well known and it's likely to be a very innovative development,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets
""So in reputation terms, it's a positive for the company and it may very well attract further attention, in particular attention from international players.""
The announcement sent LendLease's share price up in morning trade by as much as 5.3% to A$14.84, its highest since Nov. 8.
In a statement, LendLease said it will develop up to 15 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of residential, retail and hospitality space and associated amenities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and that Google will develop office space.
Last month, Google said it would set aside $750 million worth of land and $250 million in financing to spur developers in the San Francisco Bay Area to build at least 20,000 homes and renovate other housing over the next decade.
LendLease said it will partner Google for the next 10 to 15 years to redevelop the U.S. firm's landholdings in Sunnyvale, San Jose and Mountain View, with work starting as early as 2021.
It quoted Google Vice President of Real Estate and Workplace Services David Radcliffe as saying the deal would boost the tech firm's plans to ""accelerate the production of residential units in the Bay Area"" and ""build mixed-use developments"".
""LendLease will play a key role in helping deliver at least 15,000 new homes on our land,"" Radcliffe said in LendLease's statement.
LendLease is currently involved in over 100 developments in the United States with most of its marquee projects located in New York. The Americas accounted for 25% of new work secured last year, LendLease's 2018 annual report showed.

In February, it reported a 96.3% drop in first-half net profit due to reduced productivity in its engineering and services businesses, and cut its dividend by almost two-thirds.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) said on Wednesday it lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas, an announcement that jarred investors ahead of looming competition.
Netflix shares sank nearly 12% in after-hours trading after the company posted quarterly results that showed it shed 130,000 U.S. customers from April to June.
The world's dominant subscription video service said its slate of new shows during the quarter was not as appealing as expected and price increases in some markets dented growth.
Netflix reported that it added 2.83 million paid streaming subscribers outside the United States, below analyst expectations of 4.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts had forecast a U.S. gain of 352,000.
""Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.
""We think Q2's content slate drove less growth in paid adds than we anticipated,"" it said.
(For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XPFdGg)
Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on a video call with analysts the company's internal projection still showed it expected to end 2019 with more new subscribers than it added in 2018. It currently boasts 151.6 million streaming customers worldwide.
""I think our position is excellent,"" he said.
Netflix has staked its future on global expansion and creating original TV shows, movies and documentaries to attract new customers and keep the existing ones paying monthly subscription fees.
""Even though we expected slowing user growth in the U.S., a negative paid net additions number is shocking,"" said Clement Thibault, analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
""The problem is that with intensifying competition, there is no guarantee Netflix has the pricing power needed to raise prices without massively bleeding users.""
Netflix raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe during the second quarter.
A Reuters/IPSOS poll in March found 81% of U.S. Netflix subscribers polled said they would cut the service if the monthly price rose by $5.
The last time Netflix lost U.S. subscribers was in 2011 following an uproar over a price hike and a plan to split its DVD-by-mail and streaming services.
Looking ahead, Netflix projected it would add 7 million paid streaming customers in the third quarter with help from a new season of supernatural thriller ""Stranger Things,"" released on July 4. That is more bullish than the 6.6 million forecast from analysts polled by Refinitiv.
But looming in November is the launch of Disney+, seen as a formidable entrant into the streaming market, and original programming from Apple Inc (O:AAPL). AT&T Inc (N:T) and Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) have said they plan their own offerings next year.
Netflix also faces the future loss of its two most-streamed shows. ""The Office"" will come off Netflix in January 2021 and head to Comcast's streaming platform, while ""Friends"" will end its run on Netflix at the beginning of 2020. It will move exclusively to the upcoming AT&T service HBO Max.
Net income fell to $270.7 million, or 60 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from 85 cents a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $4.92 billion from $3.91 billion.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $4.93 billion.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 07:44PM ET</span>",U.S. government report on housing finance reform is 'essentially done': regulator,"By Pete Schroeder and Richard Leong
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration's hotly anticipated blueprint for overhauling mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may not be published until September as the U.S. Treasury juggles several other pressing issues, the housing regulator told Reuters.
Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which oversees the government-sponsored enterprises, said in an interview it was his ""hope"" that they would have exited or be ready to exit conservatorship before his term ends in 2024.
However, Calabria is not operating toward a hard deadline, he noted.
""That's my time horizon,"" he said, referring to the end of his term. ""I'm under no expectation to try to get all this done. ... So if in four years, nine months they're not out of conservatorship, I'm not pushing them out.""
Calabria's comments will temper market expectations for a speedy overhaul of Fannie and Freddie before the 2020 presidential election.
Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee over half of all U.S. mortgages, have operated under government conservatorship since their bailout during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Washington has struggled for years to devise a plan to safely return them to the private sector.
The Trump administration has said it is eager to push ahead with housing finance reform and industry analysts and insiders had expected a Treasury-led proposal for removing them from conservatorship to be published by this month. Calabria said the report was ""essentially done,"" that he had seen a draft, and expected it to be published in August or September.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has led the push for reforming Fannie and Freddie within the administration, is ""juggling a number of balls,"" Calabria said. Mnuchin is involved in the ongoing trade war with China, debt ceiling negotiations with Congress and imposing sanctions on Iran. Craig Phillips, Mnuchin's adviser who had been closely involved in the reform plan, also left in June.
Despite his heavy workload Mnuchin continues to work with his team on housing finance issues on a weekly basis, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Calabria said he expected the Treasury will in the report back some form of government guarantee for Fannie and Freddie. But he said he planned to advocate for a guarantee limited to the mortgage-backed securities issued by the pair, rather than a government backstop for the companies themselves.
While Calabria sketched a potential five-year time horizon for removing Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship, he added that the government did not have forever to overhaul them and needs to progress while the housing market remains stable.

""The market looks pretty strong now, so that to me is the time when we want to make real repairs, he said.

(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday, as efforts to make its platforms easier to navigate attracted more customers, coupled with growth in its advertising and payments businesses.
The company's shares rose nearly 7% to $41.60 in extended trading.
EBay, facing intense competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT), has focused on its promoted listings program and payments business, as well as worked to make its platform simpler to use through the introduction of grouped listings and personal recommendations.
More than 940,000 sellers took advantage of the promoted listings, resulting in $89 million of advertising revenue during the quarter, the company said.
""The results show eBay's new revenue sources are working to fuel growth in the bottom-line profitability. The company's renewed focus on advertising and its new payments business are boosting sales, and that's enough for investors to get excited,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
EBay also said it had reached an agreement with India's Paytm Mall, owned by Paytm e-commerce, to bring its global inventory onto Paytm's marketplace.
""As part of this collaboration, eBay is making an investment in Paytm Mall for a stake of approximately 5.5%,"" Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig said.
EBay forecast third-quarter adjusted profit from continuing operations in the range of 62 cents to 65 cents per share and revenue of $2.61 billion to $2.66 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of 63 cents on revenue of $2.68 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
San Jose, California-based eBay in March announced a review of its StubHub and eBay Classifieds businesses and said it would name two new directors to its board as part of an agreement to ease pressure from activist investors.
EBay said active buyers grew 4% to 182 million globally in the reported quarter. However, the company's gross merchandise volume, which is the value of goods sold on its websites within a certain time frame, fell about 4% to $22.60 billion.
The company's net income from continuing operations fell to $403 million, or 46 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $638 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 68 cents per share, beating analyst expectations of 62 cents. Revenue rose nearly 2% to $2.69 billion, above estimates of $2.68 billion."
371,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 06:12PM ET</span>",Bank of America trims net interest income guidance,"By Imani Moise and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) lowered its annual net interest income guidance on Wednesday to reflect a weakened interest rate environment as the second-largest U.S. lender reported higher-than expected earnings fueled by strong consumer trends.
Rate trends have prompted the bank to scale back its expected full-year net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, to 2% from 3%, executives said on a conference call with analysts.
Net interest income, the difference between interest earned from lending and how much the bank pays for deposits, rose 6% last year.
Its interest margin fell in the second quarter to 2.44% from 2.51% three months earlier, though it was still higher than a year earlier.
Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call with reporters the sequential decline was due to lower long-term interest rates.
""When long-term interest rates fall, we see more people pay off their mortgages and that translates into more mortgage-backed securities being redeemed and that forces us to write off some premiums,"" he said. ""I don't think you can extrapolate that into the future because long-term rates have stabilized at this point.""
The lender is the most sensitive of the big U.S. banks to interest rate changes because of its large deposit stock and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.
Consumer banking has held up for the big Wall Street banks that have reported second-quarter results this week, cushioning a blow from weakness in trading and advisory businesses.
But warning signs also emerged with JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and Well Fargo reporting a dip in margins, stoking fears that interest rate cuts could further pressure profit by narrowing the spread between what banks charge on loans and pay on deposits.
In the absence of higher interest rates to help pad revenue, banks can improve margins by reducing expenses.
Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on call with analysts that 2019 expenses are projected to be lower than 2018, against previous expectations for the bank to have flat expenses through 2020.
Expenses during the quarter were up slightly as the bank invested more in its consumer, commercial and wealth management businesses.
Total loans in its consumer banking unit rose 6%, while deposits were up 3%, pushing income from the business up 13% to $3.3 billion.
""We see solid consumer activity across the board, with spending by Bank of America consumers up 5% this quarter over the second quarter of last year,"" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a statement.
Growth in the consumer business helped offset softness in market revenue and Wall Street businesses.
The retail bank and wealth management segments each recorded double digit profit gains while its commercial and markets businesses each saw profit and revenue decline from lower investment banking and trading fees.
Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's global market business, which includes bond and equities trading, fell 5.7% to $4.18 billion.
Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 10% to $7.11 billion, or 74 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. Excluding items, the bank earned 75 cents per share.
Revenue, net of interest expense, was up about 2% at $23.08 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 71 cents per share on revenue of $23.2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday it will dedicate half of a $100 million fund it created after two crashes of its 737 MAX planes to provide payments to families of those killed, with veteran U.S. compensation expert Ken Feinberg hired by the world's largest plane maker to oversee the distribution.
The announcement of Feinberg's hiring came minutes before a U.S. House of Representatives hearing featuring dramatic testimony by Paul Njoroge, a father who lost three children, his wife and mother-in-law in a 737 MAX Ethiopian Air crash in March.
Feinberg told Reuters his team will ""start immediately drafting a claims protocol for those eligible,"" with the first meeting with officials from Chicago-based Boeing later this week in Washington. Feinberg has administered many compensation funds including for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, General Motors (NYSE:GM) ignition switch crashes and numerous school shootings.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March following the Ethiopian Airlines crash after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. The two crashes killed 346 people.
Njoroge, 35, told reporters after he testified he did not think the public would trust Boeing going forward. ""Do you want to fly in those planes? Do you want your children to fly in those planes?"" Njoroge asked. ""I don't have any more children.""
Njoroge told a House subcommittee he still has ""nightmares about how (his children) must have clung to their mother crying"" during the doomed flight.
Njoroge, who was born in Kenya and lives in Canada, said Boeing has blamed ""innocent pilots who had no knowledge and were given no information of the new and flawed MCAS system that could overpower pilots.""
Boeing did not address specific questions raised by Njoroge but said in a statement ""we truly regret the loss of lives in both of these accidents and we are deeply sorry for the impact to the families and loved ones of those on board.""
A Boeing official told Reuters last month that after a new software flaw emerged the company will not submit an MCAS software upgrade and training revision until September, which means the planes will not resume flying until November at the earliest. U.S. airlines have canceled flights through early November as a result of the 737 MAX's grounding.
Boeing shares closed up 1.9% Wednesday.
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told Fox Business Network on Wednesday that the agency has made a lot of progress since the plane's grounding.
""We have discovered some anomalies and then we have directed Boeing to mitigate those anomalies,"" Elwell said, declining to set any timetable for returning the plane to service. 
""The 737 MAX is not going to fly until it passes the most thorough and intense look,"" said Elwell, adding that he had spent several hours with Njoroge during a recent meeting.
Boeing said on July 3 it would give $100 million over multiple years to local governments and non-profit organizations to help families and communities affected by the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Feinberg, who will jointly administer the fund with lawyer Camille Biros, said the other $50 million in the fund was earmarked for government and community projects. 
Boeing reiterated on Wednesday that the money distributed through the fund would be independent from the outcome of any lawsuits. The company is facing a slew of litigation from the families of victims of both crashes.
""Through our partnership with Feinberg and Biros, we hope affected families receive needed assistance as quickly and efficiently as possible,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.
Boeing's initial announcement of the $100 million fund was met with anger by some victims' families, who described the offer as a publicity stunt.

At the hearing in Washington, Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he would call Boeing officials to testify at a hearing. DeFazio said the committee was in the middle of an in-depth investigation and had just received a ""trove"" of documents that panel investigators were reviewing.

BOSTON (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp's push to reinvigorate its money management business has yet to stem a continuous outflow of client cash from its $322 billion complex of index-based investment products.
BNY Mellon executives delivered more bad news on Wednesday when they detailed $22 billion in net withdrawals from index portfolios during the second quarter. Most of that outflow came from a single, unnamed client that took assets in-house, BNY Mellon Chief Financial Officer Michael Santomassimo said on a conference call.
But since the end of 2014, net withdrawals from index products have totaled $136 billion, according to company financial statements.
The decline in those assets is not a proportional hit to revenue because the bank's index products are mostly low-fee strategies. By contrast, BNY Mellon's $709 billion portfolio of liability-driven investments (LDI), which are popular with pension funds, command higher fees. LDI has been a bright spot in the bank's asset management division, attracting $101 billion in net deposits from 2016 to 2018.
Nevertheless, second-quarter asset management revenue fell 12% to $618 million, compared to the year-ago period. The downturn reflected net withdrawals from investment products and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, the company said.
But assets under management rose 2% to $1.84 trillion from the year-ago quarter as buoyant markets more than offset outflows and currency impacts.
Shares closed up 2.4% at $44.15 as the company's overall quarterly profit beat analysts' expectations with cost cutting moves.
BNY Mellon manages most of its index assets for institutional investors, with a greater concentration in equities. But some sovereign wealth funds have sold index holdings to raise cash. Other institutional investors have rebalanced portfolios to hold more fixed income or exchange-traded funds, said Desmond Mac Intyre, the CEO of Mellon, BNY Mellon’s affiliated multi-asset investment firm.
The bank does not offer exchange-traded funds or have any major presence in target-date funds, missing out on what has been a seismic shift of money into those products.
Mac Intyre said he expects a turnaround in BNY Mellon index products as his team works more closely with the bank's asset servicing division while adding more products that appeal to clients. Mellon also has reset its investment management fees and securities lending splits to be more competitive for clients, which allows their index portfolios to collect more income from that activity.
On a smaller scale, BNY Mellon offers index mutual funds, but if it cut management fees to be more competitive it would risk undercutting revenue. Its S&P 500 Index Fund, for example, has endured more than $2 billion in net withdrawals since early 2014.
With an expense ratio of 0.50%, the $2.36 billion fund is cheaper than the median price of peers, but at least 12 times more expensive than S&P 500 index portfolios run by Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group, according to Morningstar Inc.
""You can jumpstart your index fund by cutting the price,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at New York-based research firm CFRA. ""There is a Catch-22, though, as you risk reducing the profitability of such a product with that strategy.""
BNY Mellon has taken a number of steps to reduce the complexity of its asset management business. For example, it has reduced the number of open-ended long-term mutual funds to 92 from 106. And fees have been lowered on municipal bond funds, a BNY Mellon spokesman said.
Last month, the bank dropped the Dreyfus name from its long-term retail mutual funds, allowing BNY Mellon to use its own name as a single global brand for those portfolios."

(Reuters) - Andrew Left's Citron Capital posted a net return of 24.7% after fees and expenses in the first half of 2019, according to an investment letter posted on the fund's website Wednesday, but said ""it has been an extraordinarily challenging environment to be a short seller.""
Citron said in the letter that the firm was able to find opportunities in the initial public offering market betting against shares of Jumia Technologies AG and betting on disruptive business models such as Revolve Group.
Citron also made remarks on its stance in shares of Beyond Meat Inc, which Left in May said on Twitter he was shorting because valuations had become ""Beyond Stupid.""
In Citron's investment letter, the firm said: ""While Citron can’t justify Beyond Meat's (BYND) absurd valuation, we cannot ignore unfavorable technical dynamics (e.g., tight float and high borrow cost). We were able to capitalize on trading around our position in Beyond Meat, which was another top contributor to fund performance during 1H 2019.""
In May, Left said Citron believed Beyond Meat shares would go back to $65 a share. Beyond Meat shares are currently trading around $170 a share."

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - When Californian counties and cities first sued paint makers in 2000, they wanted the companies to pay billions to remove dangerous old lead paint from hundreds of thousands of homes.
After a 19-year legal struggle, they have finally succeeded in getting the companies to fund a remediation program, albeit on a much smaller scale. Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), ConAgra Grocery Products Co. and NL Industries have agreed to a $305 million settlement, according to a filing in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California on Wednesday.
The resolution marks a rare success for a public nuisance claim, under which counties and municipalities can sue corporations for past activities - including those conducted decades ago - they say have harmed communities.
High-profile public nuisance claims have proliferated in recent years in the United States as local governments try to use the courts to make corporations pay for societal ills like lead poisoning, the opioid addiction crisis and climate change.
Yet the glacial pace and complex twists in California’s lead paint case highlight just how difficult it can be to use the public nuisance strategy against corporations, even in a state whose courts are particularly consumer friendly.
A trial judgment in 2014 ordered the paint companies to pay $1.15 billion, but an appeals court decision led to the amount being slashed by more than half in 2017. Once the companies had exhausted the appeals process, they threatened to sue individual property owners who received help cleaning up their properties, by claiming they had failed to properly maintain their housing.
“This landmark settlement will allow thousands of homes to be remediated, and as a result current and future generations of California children will no longer face the threat of lead poisoning,” said James Williams (NYSE:WMB), County Counsel for Santa Clara County, where the lawsuit was first filed.
“We’re pleased that we’ve been able to hold lead paint manufacturers accountable and responsible,” he said.
The defendant paint companies did not admit any wrongdoing under the settlement, and Sherwin-Williams and ConAgra welcomed the end of the legal battle.
""Sherwin-Williams is pleased to have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation, and it will continue to vigorously and aggressively defend against any similar current or future litigation,"" the company said in a written statement.
BITTERSWEET VICTORY
The number of U.S. children poisoned by lead has fallen sharply since the United States banned the toxic metal from residential paint and gasoline, during the 1970s and 80s.
But for California districts like Oakland and Los Angeles, where childhood lead poisoning still exacts a heavy toll, the outcome of the legal struggle is bittersweet.
In the decades it took the local governments to prevail, tens of thousands more children in California have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead, state public health data shows.
In Alameda County, for example, some zip codes have lead poisoning rates higher than those found in Flint, Michigan, at the peak of that city’s water contamination crisis (https://reut.rs/2XUaLWq).
County inspectors found dangerous paint dust in the East Oakland home of 3-year-old Alexander Avila, who tested with lead levels more than five times the elevated standard of five micrograms per deciliter set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
When a reporter visited the nearly century-old home last month, Alexander was a ball of hyperactive energy. His mother Stephanie, 26, said he is able to speak few words and has trouble engaging with other kids at preschool. She fears his past lead exposure will affect him for life.
“People just don’t know what’s in their own houses, or the dangers their kids can face,” she said.
A county program helped fix lead paint hazards at the home, but public funds are scarce to repair housing before it can harm children.
In nearby Hayward, California, another predominantly working class city in the San Francisco Bay Area, five members of the Mariscal family, including two children, were poisoned by lead paint at their old home during 2017 and 2018, county health data and inspection reports show.
Three year-old Isaac, who tested at levels more than twice the CDC’s elevated threshold, suffered anemia - a common symptom of lead exposure - and, like Alexander, has also had speech problems.
The CDC says there is no safe level of lead in children’s blood. At least 4 million U.S. children remain at risk of exposure from chipping paint or lead dust in their housing, the agency says. Lead paint doesn't pose an immediate danger unless it is deteriorating.
Many of the 10 counties and cities that brought the lawsuit have tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of older housing units. Neutralizing lead paint hazards in a single home can cost thousands of dollars, so the settlement money may only cover the clean-up of a fraction of homes that need work.
“The litigation money can only go so far, but it’s a start,” Larry Brooks, director of Alameda County's lead poisoning prevention program, said in an interview last month.
More than 6,300 children have been exposed to elevated lead levels in his county since 2000, when the litigation began, according to county health data.
Although the United States banned lead paint sales in 1978, most old housing still contains it, and thousands of U.S. neighborhoods still have alarming poisoning rates, Reuters found in a series of articles in 2017. (https://reut.rs/2MfnIGn)
NEW LEGAL PRECEDENT?
California jurisdictions are the first to have a public nuisance verdict upheld against former lead paint manufacturers. Several lawsuits in other states have failed since 2000, from Illinois to Missouri and Rhode Island.
The California case may set a new legal precedent for seeking remediation. Legal scholars say it could encourage new lawsuits against paint companies, and Californian local governments report receiving inquiries from counterparts in other areas of the country interested in bringing their own nuisance claims.
In product liability lawsuits, attorneys must prove harm to individual plaintiffs. In public nuisance cases, the plaintiffs don’t have to prove harm to specific people. Instead, they can claim that the defendants’ activities impeded broad community rights, such as the public right to enjoy property.
In California, the plaintiffs argued the companies were responsible for creating a public health threat and knew of the toxic dangers of lead paint when they marketed it, without properly warning consumers, for decades before the U.S. government banned its use in homes.
The paint companies argued that they stopped marketing lead paint products once risks became known. They contended that home owners were responsible for preventing any poisoning hazards in their living spaces.
Santa Clara County recently filed another public nuisance case against opioid pill manufacturers, and similar cases are popping up with increasing frequency nationwide.
Many of these suits share a common goal: making big business pay to fix high-cost societal burdens that their profit-making activities may have left behind.
Corporate defense attorneys worry that more wins for local governments under the public nuisance doctrine could saddle businesses with huge and unpredictable liabilities, in some cases for decades-old actions they thought were safe at the time.
WHY SETTLE NOW?
The California local governments and the companies settled after a marathon legal battle that saw both sides suffer setbacks.
Beyond seeing the earlier $1.15 billion judgment sharply cut back by an appeals decision, the plaintiffs were concerned with court-imposed restrictions on how the money could be used. 
For instance, the terms had limited the remediation program to housing built before 1951, and only indoor paint hazards could be fixed. The local governments also faced a tight, four-year window to complete the program, after which any unspent funds would be returned to the paint companies.
As recently as January, court filings from the case show, lawyers for the paint companies vowed to sue California property owners who sought to use the remediation funds. Counties were concerned the mere specter of these suits would have a chilling effect on the remediation program, which will rely on housing owners' voluntary participation.
It was an unusually bold move, legal scholars say.
“Talking about suing property owners is an aggressive tactic,” said Bob Rabin, a tort law specialist at Stanford University.
“I can’t think of another public nuisance judgment where defendants turned around and said recipients of the damages should be disqualified because they are to blame,” he said.
With the settlement in place, these threats and court-imposed limitations on how the money can be spent will now be lifted.

Paint companies have agreed not to target property owners with lawsuits, cities and counties can take as much time as they need fixing homes, and housing built through the 1970s – when lead paint was still being sold – are also eligible for help, including on exterior walls.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>","Paint makers reach $305 million settlement in California, ending marathon lead poisoning lawsuit","By Joshua Schneyer
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - After a 19-year legal struggle, three former makers of lead paint have agreed to a $305 million settlement with California county and city governments to mitigate poisoning dangers still present in old housing.
Under the deal, disclosed in a filing in Santa Clara County Superior Court on Wednesday, defendants Sherwin-Williams, ConAgra Grocery Products Co. and NL Industries agreed to pay out the sum over six years, starting with a $75 million payment later this year.
The defendant paint companies did not admit any wrongdoing under the settlement.
Most of the money will go toward a remediation program to eliminate lead paint hazards in older homes across the 10 jurisdictions that participated in the suit. These include Los Angeles, San Francisco, Alameda, and Santa Clara counties, as well as individual cities such as Oakland and San Diego.
During the litigation, the plaintiffs had sought a far larger judgment mandating removal of lead paint from hundreds of thousands of older homes. Just how many homes can be made safer with the settlement funds isn’t clear.
Last year, Santa Clara County Superior Court estimated that inspecting one housing unit would cost around $140 on average, while lead paint remediation would cost around $1,500 per unit.
Some of the settlement money - 17% - is also due to outside counsel hired by local governments during the case.
The home clean-up program will be free for property owners who qualify to participate, and officials have said the remediation efforts could prevent thousands of new lead exposure cases.
""This landmark settlement will allow thousands of homes to be remediated, and as a result current and future generations of California children will no longer face the threat of lead poisoning,” said James Williams, Santa Clara County Counsel.
Sherwin-Williams said the settlement was favorable, limiting its liability. It pledged to fight other lawsuits over its legal advertising or sales of lead paint many decades ago, before U.S. sales were banned.
""Sherwin-Williams is pleased to have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation, and it will continue to vigorously and aggressively defend against any similar current or future litigation,"" the company said in a statement.
Michael Cummins, a spokesman for ConAgra, said the company is ""pleased to have reached a resolution to put this nearly 20-year old litigation behind us.""
TOXIC DANGER
The local governments first brought the lawsuit in 2000 with the aim of making the companies pay billions for the clean-up. They claimed the companies knew of the toxic dangers of lead paint when they marketed it for decades before the U.S. government banned its use in homes in 1978.
The companies contended they did not continue marketing leaded paints once the risks were known. They also argued that private property owners were responsible for the upkeep of homes to ensure potential paint hazards would not harm residents.
The settlement represents a rare success for plaintiffs suing paint companies under the so-called public nuisance doctrine, which allows public entities to sue parties whose activities negatively impact broad communities by infringing upon a public right.
Public nuisance cases against former lead paint makers have failed in other states, including Rhode Island, Illinois and Missouri.
Still, the $305 million falls far short of what the plaintiffs had counted on until recently. In a 2014 trial verdict, the companies were ordered to pay $1.15 billion, but in 2017 an appeals court decision led to the judgment being reduced to $409 million. Taken together, the court decisions also restricted how the money could be spent.
For instance, the funds could only be used to fix paint hazards in the interior of homes built before 1951, though lead paint continued to be sold into the 1970s and exterior paint also harms children. The plaintiffs had also faced a short, four-year window to complete the clean-up program, after which unspent funds would be returned to the companies.
In striking a compromise for a lesser amount, the California jurisdictions managed to get those terms lifted, giving them more leeway and no time constraint on using the remediation funds, the court filing showed."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes dipped on Wednesday as weak results from CSX Corp stoked concerns that the protracted trade war between the United States and China could hurt corporate earnings.
CSX (O:CSX) shares tumbled 9.9% and were set for their biggest one-day drop since 2008 after the rail freight company posted lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year revenue forecast. Ongoing trade tensions have contributed to a decline in truck and rail freight volumes in the first half of 2019.
The losses in CSX shares helped push down the S&P 500 industrials index (SPLRCI), whose 1.9% slide was the largest among the S&P's 11 major sectors. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) fell 3.2%.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a compendium of anecdotes from U.S. businesses, also pointed to trade-related pressures on transportation and manufacturing companies.
Despite a pause on additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, ""none of the underlying issues have really been put to bed,"" said Ed Campbell, portfolio manager and managing director at QMA in Newark, New Jersey. ""It's a risk factor that could come back at any time.""
Indeed, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he could impose tariffs on additional Chinese goods at any time.
But persistent trade-related concerns are a critical factor supporting expected interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this month, Campbell said. The anticipation of rate cuts has helped propel U.S. stocks to new highs in the past week.
""One of the things Trump is doing with trade is he's using it as a cudgel against the Fed,"" he said. ""The Fed is citing uncertainty relating to trade as a reason they're open to cutting rates.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 67.45 points, or 0.25%, to 27,268.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 11.8 points, or 0.39%, to 2,992.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 13.76 points, or 0.17%, to 8,209.03.
In addition to CSX, shares of other rail companies fell.  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) shares dropped 6.2%,  Norfolk Southern  Corp (N:NSC) shares slid 6.3% and Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) shares slipped 4.4%.
Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern will report results on Thursday and Friday, respectively.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) rose 2.0% after posting a profit beat, though the company lowered its annual net interest income forecast.
Profit for S&P 500 companies is expected to rise 0.4% in the second quarter from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
 Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) shares rose 3.3% after the medical device maker topped quarterly profit estimates and lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast.
 Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) shares rose 0.8% after the U.S. Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling against the mobile chip supplier.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported earnings of 60 cents share, beating expectations from Investing.com for 56 cents per share. But revenue of $4.92 billion was slightly below estimates of $4.93 billion.
Netflix fell more than 12% in aftermarket hours.
The earnings miss was driven by slowing global subscriber numbers, the company's main growth driver. Global subs fell short of analysts' estimates.
Global subscriber numbers grew by 2.7 million missing expectations of 5 million for the quarter. That was also below with company's guidance in April for 4.7 million international subscribers. Domestic paid subscriber fell by 126,000, compared with expectations of a gain of 352,000.
The company said competition was not a factor behind its weaker subscriber additions in the quarter, blaming the miss on regions where it increased the price of streaming service. It also said that the content released during the second quarter had generated weaker-than-expected subscriber additions.
""Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases,"" Netflix said. ""We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape during Q2, and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions (while our over-forecast was in every region).""
""Rather, we think Q2’s content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated. Additionally, Q1 was so large for us (9.6m net adds), there may have been more pull-forward effect than we realized.

By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A wave of quarterly reports from Netflix (O:NFLX) and other top-tier, high-growth companies starting on Wednesday will test Wall Street's willingness to extend a recent rally driven by expectations of lower interest rates.
Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL), all part of the so-called FANG group of widely held stocks, have jumped over 5% so far in July, with investors increasingly willing to bet on the volatile names thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by as much as half a percentage point to support economic growth.
The FANG companies, combined with investor favorites Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT), account for about 17% of the S&P 500's $26 trillion market capitalization, making reaction to their quarterly results key to Wall Street sentiment.
Netflix has been the FANG group's poorest performer this month, up just 0.2% as investors worry that looming competition from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) in video streaming could limit its already cooling subscriber growth.
Still, the leading video entertainment company is up 2% since its weaker-than-expected quarterly report in April, and up 37% year to date.
The reports by Netflix, scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft (O:MSFT) on Thursday, and Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet next week could fuel gains on Wall Street, or put an end to the market's recent strength.
""The FANG stocks have done well because of overall market sentiment. But we've come a long way in a hurry, and a little bit like a baby, you've got to worry if there has to be a little burp,"" said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago.
Netflix in April forecast weaker-than-expected growth in new subscriptions, and concerns since then have only increased following announcements that Netflix will lose its two most-watched shows in the United States - ""Friends"" and ""The Office"" - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc (N:T) and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, said his Diversified Equity Fund (N:ADX) is overweight Netflix due in part to its strong original content. The fund is underweight Facebook on expectations that the company has not fully recognized the regulatory challenges it faces, including in relation to its plan to launch a cryptocurrency, which has faced a backlash from governments and central bankers since it was unveiled last month.
""Who at Facebook thought it would be a good idea to bring up this Libra cryptocurrency right now? The nicest way to say it is that it was ill-advised, given everything that's on their plate,"" Stoeckle said.
Netflix predicted in April it would pick up a softer-than-expected 5 million new streaming subscribers in the June quarter. Analysts expect Netflix's second-quarter revenue to rise 26% to $4.93 billion, while its net income is seen falling 34% to $255 million, according to Refinitiv. Earnings per share are is expected at 56 cents.
""Netflix is going to be interesting when it comes to guidance,"" said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago. ""They are going to have lot of competition, and I think they're going to have to give us some guidance on whether they believe they can fight it off.""
Since 2002, Netflix's second-quarter reports on average have been followed by a 5.9% decline in its stock the following day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That compares to an average increase of 0.6% in the following trading day across all quarters for Netflix.
Facebook is to post its results on July 24, followed by Amazon and Alphabet on July 25. Facebook and Alphabet face challenges including calls for increased regulation, while investors worry that Amazon's race to expand one-day shipping will cut into its profits just as competitors including Walmart (N:WMT) and  Target  (N:TGT) improve their own online sales and deliveries.
Year-to-date, Amazon has surged 35% and is less than 2% below its record high set last September.
Facebook has rallied 56% in 2019 and is 6% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline as investors worried about fallout from the company's mishandling of users' personal information.
Even after their rallies this year, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are trading at forward price/earnings multiples below their two-year averages.
Analysts expect Amazon's quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.4 billion, with non-GAAP net income growing 10% to $2.78 billion.
Facebook's June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.3 billion, with net income up 6% to $5.4 billion. Analysts expect Alphabet's quarterly revenue to climb 17% to $38.2 billion, with net income falling 4% to $7.9 billion.
Analysts expect Microsoft, the only U.S. company with a stock market value greater than $1 trillion, to post a 9% increase in quarterly revenue to $32.8 billion, with strong growth in cloud computing making that business larger than its Windows business for the first time ever."
387,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 02:59PM ET</span>",Facebook to face more scrutiny from Congress on Libra,"By Pete Schroeder and Anna Irrera
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers bashed Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday over its planned cryptocurrency, after a bruising first bout a day earlier when senators from both parties condemned the project, saying the company had not shown it could be trusted.
The social media company is fighting to get Washington on its side after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with its announcement on June 18 that it was hoping to launch a new digital coin called Libra in 2020.
It has faced criticism from policymakers and financial watchdogs at home and abroad who fear widespread adoption of the digital currency by Facebook's 2.38 billion users could upend the financial system. 
""I have serious concerns with Facebook's plans to create a digital currency and digital wallet,"" Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the Democrat-controlled House Financial Services Committee, said in her opening remarks. 
""If Facebook's plan comes into fruition, the company and its partners will yield immense economic power that could destabilize currencies.""
Lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee questioned David Marcus, the Facebook executive overseeing the project, who was grilled by the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday over the possible risks posed by Libra to data privacy, consumer protections and money laundering controls.
The hearing in Congress was proving to be even more tense on Wednesday.
""We're told by some that innovation is always good,"" said Democratic U.S. Representative Brad Sherman. ""The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama bin Laden came up with innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers. ... This may do more to endanger America than even that."" 
Sherman repeatedly insisted that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testify before the committee. 
The panel has already circulated draft legislation that could kill the project by banning Facebook and other tech firms from entering the financial services sector.
Democratic U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney pushed Marcus to commit to a Libra pilot program with 1 million users overseen by U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve.
""I don't think you should launch Libra at all,"" Maloney said. ""At the very least you should agree to do this small pilot program.""
Marcus, who was president of PayPal from 2012 to 2014, did not commit to a pilot, but tried to assuage lawmakers by pledging not to begin issuing Libra until regulatory concerns had been addressed. 
""We will take the time to get this right,"" Marcus said. 
He said the company had unveiled the project at an early stage in order to get feedback from all stakeholders.
Congress members on both sides of the aisle asked how Facebook will ensure sufficient consumer protection and prevent the cryptocurrency from being used for illegal activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing. 
""I'm concerned a 2020 launch date represents deep insensitivities about how Libra could impact U.S. financial security, the global financial system, the privacy of people across the globe, criminal activity and international human rights,"" said Republican U.S. Representative Ann Wagner.
Facebook has said its digital wallet subsidiary Calibra will be carrying out compliance checks on customers who want to sign up.
Lawmakers are also concerned about the impact Facebook's entry into financial services through Libra could have on financial stability, and how the company will protect users' payments data.
Facebook has been on the defense amid a backlash over mishandling user data and not doing enough to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
While many lawmakers aired concerns and skepticism about the project, several Republicans also argued the government should not be reflexively opposed to new ideas from the private sector, and noted Libra could produce significant benefits for people lacking traditional banking services.

""We should presume that innovation is good, it presents enormous opportunity,"" said Republican U.S. Representative Andy Barr.

391,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 01:48PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Levis Slides as Goldman Warns of Unfashionable Performance Ahead,"Investing.com – Levi Strauss led the slump in apparel stocks Tuesday after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) signaled it was time to move out of apparel brands who rely on department stores to flog their branded merchandise amid fears that increasingly unfashionable performances await in the second half of the year. 
Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on Levi Strauss, Ralph Lauren and PVH, parent company of brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, to sell from neutral, triggering selling across the sector. 
Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) fell 5.6%, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) 4.5% and PVH (NYSE:PVH) 3.5%. 
The bank warned that several multibrand retailers were laden with more merchandise than they're able to sell amid overly optimistic expectations for spring demand and a tough first half. 
""The combination of persistently tough first-half retail trends and an optimistic spring ordering season has driven inventory overhangs at several multibrand retailers,"" the Goldman note said. 
The dour second-half outlook comes ahead of the key back-to-school shopping season, with the investment bank warning of increased pressure on brands that shift high volumes of their clothes through department stores. 
""These retailers are thus tightening up ordering as we head into the critical back-to-school and holiday season. We thus see incremental sell-in risk for apparel brands, particularly those with high exposure to department stores."" 
The bank zoned in on the woes facing the trio of downgraded apparel stocks. 
Citing Levis' weaker first quarter, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said the apparel retailer's first-quarter results show it isn't impervious to the sluggish retail backdrop that has weighed on it’s peers margin growth.
At Ralph Lauren, same-store sales are ""languishing"" amid headwinds in the wholesale market, the bank said. 
PVH, meanwhile, is behind the curve when it comes to investment in direct-to-consumer sales channels, so will likely come under pressure as outlets remain an important sales channel. 
But not all apparel brands are to face the same second-half fate, Goldman said, as brands that have been investing in building strong direct-to-consumer omnichannel commerce such as  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) are likely to be more insulated. 
""We take a more cautious view on nonathletic apparel brands whose direct-to-consumer businesses are skewed towards outlet stores, particularly given challenged traffic trends in these locations,"" Goldman said."

395,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>",New man on the board to clean up Deutsche Bank's act,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Qatari-backed lawyer tasked with trying to draw a line under Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) regulatory scandals has risen rapidly at the German bank, jumping to the management board after three years as a ""sparring partner"" on the bank's supervisory body.
 Deutsche Bank  is desperate to clean up its act and restore its reputation after years of turmoil including the Libor rate-rigging scandal and money-laundering investigations, and Stefan Simon has an intimate knowledge of the bank's rocky relationships with regulators and courts.
The enigmatic corporate lawyer will soon be sitting on Deutsche's management board, promoted from its external oversight board as part of a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) overhaul which will see the bank shrink and lose 18,000 jobs.
Simon joined Deutsche's supervisory board three years ago, with the backing of the lender's largest shareholder, Qatar. He played an influential role on that board, impressed his backers and served on the very committee that engineered his own promotion.
The 49-year-old former partner at Bonn-based law firm Flick Gocke Schaumburg has kept largely out of the public eye, but he has worked behind the scenes since his 2016 appointment to shake up Deutsche's management.
""The role of the supervisory board as a sparring partner for the management board...has become more important in recent years,"" he wrote several months ago.
Simon sits on six of the supervisory board's nine committees, more than any other member other than Chairman Paul Achleitner. His seats include one on the most powerful committee - the chairman's committee, which decides on the appointment and dismissal of management board members.
This month, the supervisory board fired three of the bank's nine management board members, including those overseeing the investment bank, the retail bank and the regulatory chief, the role that Simon himself will fill.
Simon replaces Sylvie Matherat, a former French central banker appointed to Deutsche in 2015. Achleitner last week praised her for enhancing Deutsche's ""new compliance and risk culture"", but she fell out of favor with regulators and investors as Deutsche repeatedly landed in hot water.
DAMAGED REPUTATION
In 2017, the bank was fined $7.2 billion in the U.S. for its role in the mortgage crisis, nearly toppling the bank. It failed stress tests with the U.S. Federal Reserve, and German regulators took the rare step of condemning the bank for lapses in controls to prevent money laundering.
In November, Matherat sought to downplay Deutsche's role in a money laundering scandal involving Danske Bank and suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros from 2007 until 2015.
But Simon, as head of the supervisory board's integrity committee, opted to get an independent view and commissioned the law firm Gibson Dunn to advise the board on Danske, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Gibson Dunn didn't respond to a request for comment.
As a lender to U.S. President Donald Trump, Deutsche has also been subpoenaed by U.S. Congress to hand over information on his finances.
The U.S. Department of Justice is separately investigating Deutsche for trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the bank being fined nearly $700 million.
In Germany, prosecutors are escalating a money laundering inquiry involving Deutsche Bank using a subsidiary alleged to help clients avoid taxes. Deutsche has said it is cooperating with the investigation and Simon's integrity committee vowed to devote ""special attention"" to it, according to Deutsche's annual report in April.
When asked last week about Simon, Deutsche's chief executive officer Christian Sewing told analysts: ""We have looked for somebody who knows, obviously, our legal portfolio, who has contributed to the clean-up over the last two to three years.""
RAPID RISE
At Flick Gocke, Simon advised Deutsche on its involvement in the Libor rate-rigging scandal, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That helped put him on the bank's and Qatar's radar.
The bulk of Simon's career was focused on mergers and acquisitions, insolvencies and corporate governance. He was made partner after just five years and his clients included the energy company E.ON and the bank HVB, according to Juve, a publication that follows the legal industry.
Simon was ""really entrepreneurial"", something ""untypical"" for a lawyer, said Thomas Roedder, a partner at the firm.
He attracted unwelcome attention though, when the founder of one of his clients, an insolvent developer of offshore wind farms, filed a criminal complaint accusing Simon of acting against the interests of the company. Simon denied wrongdoing and prosecutors didn't pursue the suit.
When Simon left Flick Gock to join Deutsche's supervisory board he founded his own firm, Simon GmbH, based in Zurich, locating himself close to where he likes to cycle in the Alps.
He has also tried his hand at acting and film production and had a role in the 2017 film ""Dirty Bomb"" about wartime Germany.
When he makes the switch to the management at the end of July, his income from the bank is set to increase to at least 2.4 million euros, plus bonus, from the 488,000 euros he earned last year from the bank.
It is unusual for someone to jump to management from the supervisory board, but not unheard of. Former CEO John Cryan made the shift. Regulators are likely to have informally signed off on Simon's appointment, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment and a spokesman for Simon declined to be interviewed.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (T:4502) has reached out to prospective bidders for a portfolio of drugs for sale in western Europe as it seeks to trim its debt following the $59 billion purchase of Shire, sources close to the matter told Reuters.
Takeda is hoping to fetch around 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) from the sale and has sent out information packages to interested parties, the sources said.
The drugs on the block include over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines, patents for most of which have run out, meaning they can be copied by generic drug makers.
The assets have combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about 160 million euros, the sources said, with OTC drugs accounting for about 40 million euros.
Takeda is working with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to find a new owner and wants to receive indicative bids after the summer, the sources said.
Takeda and JPMorgan declined to comment.
The sale comes amid a wave of multi-billion dollar deals as drugmakers seek to buy other companies to combat expiring patents on their blockbuster medicines and renew their drug pipelines.
While the acquisition of Shire gave Takeda global heft, it also left it highly indebted, with 5.7 trillion yen ($52.73 billion) of debt as of end-March this year.
Japan's biggest drugmaker said in January it would dispose of $10 billion worth of assets. It subsequently sold its dry-eye drug Xiidra to  Novartis  (S:NOVN) for up to $5.3 billion.
The group has pledged to focus on five key areas - oncology, gastroenterology, neuroscience, rare disease, and plasma-derived therapies – which contribute about 75% of its total revenue, while disposing of the rest.
It is hoping to clinch a deal for its Western European drugs with either an industry player or a private equity firm, the sources said, adding the portfolio could also be split and offered to two sets of bidders.
The OTC drugs are expected to draw interest from the likes of Germany's Stada (D:STAGn), France's Zentiva and Italy's  Recordati  (MI:RECI), the sources said.
The remainder of the business may appeal to industry players who are seeking to expand their distribution channels and increase penetration of their own drugs, they added.
Another source said while there is no obvious buyer for the entire portfolio, private equity funds with existing healthcare investments - such as Cinven and Bain Capital, who jointly back Stada, and Asian players, particularly Indian pharmaceutical companies - are likely get involved as they want scale in Europe.
Takeda is also in the process of divesting its Latin American assets, which are valued at about $1 billion.
The Latam sale is in the final stages, with Brazilian pharmaceutical firm EMS seen as the frontrunner, the sources said.
 Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) and Uruguay's Megalabs have been shortlisted along with EMS to submit binding offers for the Latam portfolio, but are less likely to win, they said.
EMS, Reckitt and Megalabs declined to comment."

400,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 12:51PM ET</span>",Italian banks ready to avert another Carige funding failure: sources,"By Andrea Mandala and Stefano Bernabei
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks are set to fund the bulk of a 900 million euro ($1.01 billion) rescue plan for troubled regional lender Carige (MI:CRGI) in a last-ditch attempt to avert liquidation, three sources close to the matter said.
Weakened by decades of mismanagement, Carige risks collapse as a result of bad loans accumulated during a deep recession that followed the global financial crisis a decade ago.
In January, the European Central Bank placed the Genoa-based bank under special administration and told it to find a buyer.
After at least two bailout plans fell through, the ECB has given Carige until July 25 to come up with a solution. A source with knowledge of the matter said its administrators were working to meet that deadline.
Under the latest rescue plan, a depositor protection fund (FITD) financed by Italian banks would inject some 520 million euros including by converting into equity a 320 millions euro bond bought from the bank last year, according to the sources.
The sources said Cassa Centrale Banca, an unlisted cooperative bank based in northern Trentino region, could provide some 80 million euros, while two state-owned banks, Credito Sportivo and Mediocredito Centrale, could help by underwriting up to 200 million euros in convertible bonds.
A source close to the FITD said on Monday Cassa Centrale Banca was expected to take an initial stake of just under 10%.
Up to 100 million euros of the cash call could be reserved for current shareholders of Carige.
The lender's top shareholder, the Malacalza family, could pitch in. It has already invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015 and now owns 27.5% of the bank.
Carige, FITD, Cassa Centrale Banca, Mediocredito Centrale, Credito Sportivo and Malacalza declined to comment.
Carige's administrators in February unveiled a 630 million euro capital shortfall, but a new business plan calls for a much bigger clean-up of Carige's bad loans, requiring a larger capital injection, one of the sources said.
The deal needs to be approved by Carige's shareholders, meaning the position of the Malacalza family will be key.
At the start of the year the family, which made its fortune in steel, blocked a proposed cash call, a move which prompted the ECB to place the lender under special administration.
One of the sources said two private investors could also join a rescue, easing the burden on Italian banks and Carige's shareholders.
On Monday, FITD chief Salvatore Maccarone said its shareholders would vote on July 23 on the planned conversion of Carige bond.

LIMA (Reuters) - Sweden is turning its gaze towards Peru and other South American countries for lithium tie-ups amid a global race to lock in supply of the ""white gold"" metal that is key for the batteries that power electric vehicles.
A senior trade official from the Scandinavian nation told Reuters by phone that firms in Sweden - which is making a push in such batteries is home to global car brand Volvo - were looking for alliances with regional lithium and copper producers.
Governments and automakers around the world, with an eye on huge expected demand for electric cars, are looking to seal tie-ups for the light metal, including in the so-called ""lithium triangle"" centered on Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.
Peru - a major copper producer - is also looking to edge in on the action. Canada's Plateau Energy Metals (V:PLU) last year announced the discovery of 2.5 million tons of high-grade lithium resources in the south of the country, with the potential to be the largest lithium mine in the world.
""What you see in Sweden, Germany, in many countries now is how we are going out to obtain the materials and minerals needed for the future of electrification,"" Niklas Johansson, State Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Trade told Reuters.
""This is not only lithium, but also copper, which is very important in Peru.""
CHINA CONTROL
Johansson added that a major push by China in lithium was putting a spotlight on global supply. The Asian giant is making a major strategic drive to bolster its home-grown electric carmakers and battery manufacturers.
""If someone controls a lot, this is not good for (lithium) prices, it's not good for the competition and it also becomes a safety issue and a safety supply problem,"" he said, adding it was important for countries like Sweden to have a ""range of supplies in different parts of the world"".
China produces nearly two-thirds of the world's lithium-ion batteries, and controls the majority of lithium processing facilities globally, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, which tracks lithium prices.
In the region, China's Tianqi Lithium Corp (SZ:002466) has taken a major stake in Chilean miner SQM (SN:SQMa). Germany has also made a major push with a deal in Bolivia to help exploit the country's huge largely untapped reserves.
Sweden's home-grown auto industry includes Volvo cars, now controlled by Chinese auto giant Geely, and truck makers AB Volvo and Scania. Swedish firm Northvolt will start construction in August of a huge lithium-ion battery plant.
In copper, also needed for the electric revolution, Peru is the second largest producer in the world.
Johansson added Swedish firms were both interested in potential lithium supplies in the region, but also in helping develop the deposits.

""There are many companies that are interested in lithium and buying lithium, and there are also other Swedish companies that are suppliers of mines that are very interested in helping to make the mines more sustainable,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and lifted its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday, boosted by a near 64% jump in sales of its blood sugar monitoring device.
Shares rose 4% to a record high of $86.59, adding to the about 15% gain since the start of the year.
Abbott is betting on the device, FreeStyle Libre, and is working on newer versions to cushion slowing growth in some of its older products.
The continuous glucose monitor, which helps diabetics track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers, is used by more than 1.5 million people worldwide.
FreeStyle Libre 2, the next-generation device, which is already approved in Europe, is now under U.S. regulatory review.
To expand its reach, Abbott plans to ramp up manufacturing capacity for FreeStyle Libre by three to five times in the next few years, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
When asked on the conference call what that increased capacity could mean, Chief Executive Miles White said he sees potential for Libre to bring in annual sales of $5 billion ""in a reasonable time"".
Libre's sales are expected to reach $1.5 billion this year, the company has said.
Abbott is also focusing on another growth driver, MitraClip. Sales of the device used for heart valve repair jumped 26.7% to $169 million in the quarter.
Momentum continues for Abbott's key growth drivers and ""we don't believe it is slowing down any time soon"", BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch wrote in a client note.
Sales of FreeStyle Libre rose 63.9% on a reported basis to $433 million in the second quarter.
Total sales at the diabetes unit jumped 28.2% and helped Abbott's medical devices division report a 6.4% rise in revenue to $3.08 billion.
(For an interactive graphic on diabetes unit sales, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/32yCqje)
Abbott raised its 2019 forecast for adjusted earnings from continuing operations to $3.21 to $3.27 per share, from its prior forecast of $3.15 to $3.25 per share.
The company's net earnings rose 37% to $1 billion in the second quarter ended June 30.

(Reuters) - Blue Apron Holdings Inc's (N:APRN) beleaguered stock closed 35% higher on Tuesday after the meal-kit subscription service said it would add Beyond Meat Inc's (O:BYND) plant-based burgers to its menu, betting on a growing market for premium meat alternatives to attract new customers.
Overwhelmed by rising competition and falling sales, Blue Apron's stock has collapsed since its Wall Street debut in 2017. After Tuesday's rally, it was still down more than 90% from the price in its initial public offering.
Blue Apron said its Signature Two-Serving Plan - a curated meal plan subscription - would include recipes using the Beyond Burger, a four-ounce patty with 20 grams of plant-based protein.
Beyond Meat shares closed 3.6% higher, and have increased over 580% since its public listing in May, making it 2019's most successful U.S. IPO by far. Its investors are betting the California company will become the dominant player in the nascent market for plant-based hamburgers, sausages and other meat alternatives, even though it has yet to turn a profit.
The company's burger patties and sausages are on sale in supermarkets at prices higher than equivalent meat products. Its foods are also sold through Carl's Jr, Del Taco (O:TACO) and other restaurants.
""We know a growing number of customers are interested in plant-based proteins, whether as an alternative to meat, a desire to explore a new ingredient, or an opportunity to make more sustainable food choices,"" Blue Apron Chief Executive Linda Kozlowski said in a statement.

U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods grew 11% in the past year, bringing the total market value to $4.5 billion, according to new data from Good Food Institute and trade organization Plant Based Foods Association.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks are set to fund the bulk of a 900 million euro ($1.01 billion) rescue plan for troubled regional lender Carige (MI:CRGI) in a last-ditch attempt to avert liquidation, three sources close to the matter said.
Weakened by decades of mismanagement, Carige risks collapse as a result of bad loans accumulated during a deep recession that followed the global financial crisis a decade ago.
In January, the European Central Bank placed the Genoa-based bank under special administration and told it to find a buyer.
After at least two bailout plans fell through, the ECB has given Carige until July 25 to come up with a solution. A source with knowledge of the matter said its administrators were working to meet that deadline.
Under the latest rescue plan, a depositor protection fund (FITD) financed by Italian banks would inject some 520 million euros including by converting into equity a 320 millions euro bond bought from the bank last year, according to the sources.
The sources said Cassa Centrale Banca, an unlisted cooperative bank based in northern Trentino region, could provide some 80 million euros, while two state-owned banks, Credito Sportivo and Mediocredito Centrale, could help by underwriting up to 200 million euros in convertible bonds.
A source close to the FITD said on Monday Cassa Centrale Banca was expected to take an initial stake of just under 10%.
Up to 100 million euros of the cash call could be reserved for current shareholders of Carige.
The lender's top shareholder, the Malacalza family, could pitch in. It has already invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015 and now owns 27.5% of the bank.
Carige, FITD, Cassa Centrale Banca, Mediocredito Centrale, Credito Sportivo and Malacalza declined to comment.
Carige's administrators in February unveiled a 630 million euro capital shortfall, but a new business plan calls for a much bigger clean-up of Carige's bad loans, requiring a larger capital injection, one of the sources said.
The deal needs to be approved by Carige's shareholders, meaning the position of the Malacalza family will be key.
At the start of the year the family, which made its fortune in steel, blocked a proposed cash call, a move which prompted the ECB to place the lender under special administration.
One of the sources said two private investors could also join a rescue, easing the burden on Italian banks and Carige's shareholders.
On Monday, FITD chief Salvatore Maccarone said its shareholders would vote on July 23 on the planned conversion of Carige bond.

LIMA (Reuters) - Sweden is turning its gaze towards Peru and other South American countries for lithium tie-ups amid a global race to lock in supply of the ""white gold"" metal that is key for the batteries that power electric vehicles.
A senior trade official from the Scandinavian nation told Reuters by phone that firms in Sweden - which is making a push in such batteries is home to global car brand Volvo - were looking for alliances with regional lithium and copper producers.
Governments and automakers around the world, with an eye on huge expected demand for electric cars, are looking to seal tie-ups for the light metal, including in the so-called ""lithium triangle"" centered on Chile, Bolivia and Argentina.
Peru - a major copper producer - is also looking to edge in on the action. Canada's Plateau Energy Metals (V:PLU) last year announced the discovery of 2.5 million tons of high-grade lithium resources in the south of the country, with the potential to be the largest lithium mine in the world.
""What you see in Sweden, Germany, in many countries now is how we are going out to obtain the materials and minerals needed for the future of electrification,"" Niklas Johansson, State Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Trade told Reuters.
""This is not only lithium, but also copper, which is very important in Peru.""
CHINA CONTROL
Johansson added that a major push by China in lithium was putting a spotlight on global supply. The Asian giant is making a major strategic drive to bolster its home-grown electric carmakers and battery manufacturers.
""If someone controls a lot, this is not good for (lithium) prices, it's not good for the competition and it also becomes a safety issue and a safety supply problem,"" he said, adding it was important for countries like Sweden to have a ""range of supplies in different parts of the world"".
China produces nearly two-thirds of the world's lithium-ion batteries, and controls the majority of lithium processing facilities globally, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, which tracks lithium prices.
In the region, China's Tianqi Lithium Corp (SZ:002466) has taken a major stake in Chilean miner SQM (SN:SQMa). Germany has also made a major push with a deal in Bolivia to help exploit the country's huge largely untapped reserves.
Sweden's home-grown auto industry includes Volvo cars, now controlled by Chinese auto giant Geely, and truck makers AB Volvo and Scania. Swedish firm Northvolt will start construction in August of a huge lithium-ion battery plant.
In copper, also needed for the electric revolution, Peru is the second largest producer in the world.
Johansson added Swedish firms were both interested in potential lithium supplies in the region, but also in helping develop the deposits.

""There are many companies that are interested in lithium and buying lithium, and there are also other Swedish companies that are suppliers of mines that are very interested in helping to make the mines more sustainable,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and lifted its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday, boosted by a near 64% jump in sales of its blood sugar monitoring device.
Shares rose 4% to a record high of $86.59, adding to the about 15% gain since the start of the year.
Abbott is betting on the device, FreeStyle Libre, and is working on newer versions to cushion slowing growth in some of its older products.
The continuous glucose monitor, which helps diabetics track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers, is used by more than 1.5 million people worldwide.
FreeStyle Libre 2, the next-generation device, which is already approved in Europe, is now under U.S. regulatory review.
To expand its reach, Abbott plans to ramp up manufacturing capacity for FreeStyle Libre by three to five times in the next few years, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
When asked on the conference call what that increased capacity could mean, Chief Executive Miles White said he sees potential for Libre to bring in annual sales of $5 billion ""in a reasonable time"".
Libre's sales are expected to reach $1.5 billion this year, the company has said.
Abbott is also focusing on another growth driver, MitraClip. Sales of the device used for heart valve repair jumped 26.7% to $169 million in the quarter.
Momentum continues for Abbott's key growth drivers and ""we don't believe it is slowing down any time soon"", BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch wrote in a client note.
Sales of FreeStyle Libre rose 63.9% on a reported basis to $433 million in the second quarter.
Total sales at the diabetes unit jumped 28.2% and helped Abbott's medical devices division report a 6.4% rise in revenue to $3.08 billion.

Abbott raised its 2019 forecast for adjusted earnings from continuing operations to $3.21 to $3.27 per share, from its prior forecast of $3.15 to $3.25 per share.
The company's net earnings rose 37% to $1 billion in the second quarter ended June 30.

(Reuters) - Blue Apron Holdings Inc's (N:APRN) beleaguered stock closed 35% higher on Tuesday after the meal-kit subscription service said it would add Beyond Meat Inc's (O:BYND) plant-based burgers to its menu, betting on a growing market for premium meat alternatives to attract new customers.
Overwhelmed by rising competition and falling sales, Blue Apron's stock has collapsed since its Wall Street debut in 2017. After Tuesday's rally, it was still down more than 90% from the price in its initial public offering.
Blue Apron said its Signature Two-Serving Plan - a curated meal plan subscription - would include recipes using the Beyond Burger, a four-ounce patty with 20 grams of plant-based protein.
Beyond Meat shares closed 3.6% higher, and have increased over 580% since its public listing in May, making it 2019's most successful U.S. IPO by far. Its investors are betting the California company will become the dominant player in the nascent market for plant-based hamburgers, sausages and other meat alternatives, even though it has yet to turn a profit.
The company's burger patties and sausages are on sale in supermarkets at prices higher than equivalent meat products. Its foods are also sold through Carl's Jr, Del Taco (O:TACO) and other restaurants.
""We know a growing number of customers are interested in plant-based proteins, whether as an alternative to meat, a desire to explore a new ingredient, or an opportunity to make more sustainable food choices,"" Blue Apron Chief Executive Linda Kozlowski said in a statement.

U.S. retail sales of plant-based foods grew 11% in the past year, bringing the total market value to $4.5 billion, according to new data from Good Food Institute and trade organization Plant Based Foods Association.

By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A wave of quarterly reports from Netflix (O:NFLX) and other top-tier, high-growth companies starting on Wednesday will test Wall Street's willingness to extend a recent rally driven by expectations of lower interest rates.
Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL), all part of the so-called FANG group of widely held stocks, have jumped over 5% so far in July, with investors increasingly willing to bet on the volatile names thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates later this month by as much as half a percentage point to support economic growth.
The FANG companies, combined with investor favorites Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT), account for about 17% of the S&P 500's $26 trillion market capitalization, making reaction to their quarterly results key to Wall Street sentiment.
Netflix has been the FANG group's poorest performer this month, up just 0.2% as investors worry that looming competition from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) in video streaming could limit its already cooling subscriber growth.
Still, the leading video entertainment company is up 2% since its weaker-than-expected quarterly report in April, and up 37% year to date.
The reports by Netflix, scheduled for after the bell on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft (O:MSFT) on Thursday, and Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet next week could fuel gains on Wall Street, or put an end to the market's recent strength.
""The FANG stocks have done well because of overall market sentiment. But we've come a long way in a hurry, and a little bit like a baby, you've got to worry if there has to be a little burp,"" said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago.
Netflix in April forecast weaker-than-expected growth in new subscriptions, and concerns since then have only increased following announcements that Netflix will lose its two most-watched shows in the United States - ""Friends"" and ""The Office"" - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc (N:T) and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds, said his Diversified Equity Fund (N:ADX) is overweight Netflix due in part to its strong original content. The fund is underweight Facebook on expectations that the company has not fully recognized the regulatory challenges it faces, including in relation to its plan to launch a cryptocurrency, which has faced a backlash from governments and central bankers since it was unveiled last month.
""Who at Facebook thought it would be a good idea to bring up this Libra cryptocurrency right now? The nicest way to say it is that it was ill-advised, given everything that's on their plate,"" Stoeckle said.
Netflix predicted in April it would pick up a softer-than-expected 5 million new streaming subscribers in the June quarter. Analysts expect Netflix's second-quarter revenue to rise 26% to $4.93 billion, while its net income is seen falling 34% to $255 million, according to Refinitiv. Earnings per share are is expected at 56 cents.
""Netflix is going to be interesting when it comes to guidance,"" said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago. ""They are going to have lot of competition, and I think they're going to have to give us some guidance on whether they believe they can fight it off.""
Since 2002, Netflix's second-quarter reports on average have been followed by a 5.9% decline in its stock the following day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. That compares to an average increase of 0.6% in the following trading day across all quarters for Netflix.
Facebook is to post its results on July 24, followed by Amazon and Alphabet on July 25. Facebook and Alphabet face challenges including calls for increased regulation, while investors worry that Amazon's race to expand one-day shipping will cut into its profits just as competitors including Walmart (N:WMT) and  Target  (N:TGT) improve their own online sales and deliveries.
Year-to-date, Amazon has surged 35% and is less than 2% below its record high set last September.
Facebook has rallied 56% in 2019 and is 6% short of the record high it set a year ago, just before it warned of a multi-year squeeze on its business margins, sending its stock into months of decline as investors worried about fallout from the company's mishandling of users' personal information.
Even after their rallies this year, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are trading at forward price/earnings multiples below their two-year averages.
Analysts expect Amazon's quarterly revenue to grow by 18% to $62.4 billion, with non-GAAP net income growing 10% to $2.78 billion.
Facebook's June-quarter revenue is seen jumping 25% to $16.3 billion, with net income up 6% to $5.4 billion. Analysts expect Alphabet's quarterly revenue to climb 17% to $38.2 billion, with net income falling 4% to $7.9 billion.
Analysts expect Microsoft, the only U.S. company with a stock market value greater than $1 trillion, to post a 9% increase in quarterly revenue to $32.8 billion, with strong growth in cloud computing making that business larger than its Windows business for the first time ever."

420,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Woodford biotech stakes first off block in asset sale - source,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Carolyn Cohn and Douglas Busvine
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - British fund manager Neil Woodford is looking to kick off the sale of his unlisted biotech investments at the end of July, but faces months of negotiations to offload the portfolio, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Woodford, one of Britain's best-known money managers, has left thousands of investors without access to their savings after suspending his flagship 3.7 billion pound ($4.63 billion) equity income fund six weeks ago after a surge of exit requests.
The assets will be sold as part of a structured auction process which could last up to three months, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
This means investors may need to wait until the fourth quarter to try to recoup their cash.
The firm's administrator Link Fund Solutions has tapped boutique investment bank PJT to handle the sale but has yet to sign an official mandate, the source said.
PJT - founded by former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rainmaker Paul Taubman in 2015 - is expected to receive a green light to start the process later this month, the source said, and has so far handled inbound interest from investors in the United States and Europe.
Link declined to comment. It said on July 1 that the suspension of the Woodford Equity Income fund would continue, without giving a reopening date.
PJT was not immediately available for comment.
The sale will initially address Woodford's illiquid assets which will be bundled into multiple portfolios to be auctioned off to hedge funds and secondary market funds, the source said.
The 59-year-old fund manager will also part ways with some of its listed but illiquid assets as well as his liquid investments on the stock market which will be packaged into relevant portfolios and put on the block separately, the source said.
Investors including HarbourVest Partners and Coller Capital are expected to bid for parts of the portfolio, the source said.
HarbourVest declined to comment and Coller Capital did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Existing investors in companies including top 10 holdings BenevolentAI and Oxford Nanopore have pre-emptive rights and will need to be approached before trying to lure third parties into any deal, according to the companies' rules.
Hedge funds Lansdowne Partners, Odey Asset Management and Redmile have shares in Oxford Nanopore along with Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. Goldman Sachs (N:GS) unit Broad Street Principal Investments is an investor in BenevolentAI.
There is no deadline to finalize the various divestments and some major holdings might be sold individually, depending on investors' appetite, the source said.
""Price is the main thing here,"" he said. ""It's all about getting the best value.""
A Woodford spokesman referred to comments made by Neil Woodford in a video on July 1, when he said: ""my view is that we won't have to take big discounts"".
VALUATION HEADACHE
Healthcare and biotech was a favored Woodford sector, making up nearly a quarter of the fund's portfolio, including listed stocks.
Drug discovery company BenevolentAI and DNA sequencing technology firm Oxford Nanopore - unicorns with $1 billion-plus valuations, made up 7% of the portfolio, or 306 million pounds.
But such firms are hard to value, as they often have few or no orders or revenue. Six British Woodford biotech holdings made losses last year, according to UK company filings.
Rather than current performance, analysts and investors look years into the future and make a valuation based on ""the potential for profitability"", said Brigitte de Lima, director in corporate finance at goetzpartners.
Nooman Haque, managing director, life sciences and healthcare, at Silicon Valley Bank, called the process ""quite an art form"".
BenevolentAI made losses of 26.9 million pounds in 2018, yet saw its valuation soar to $2 billion after its latest funding round in 2018, while Oxford Nanopore had an after-tax loss of 57 million pounds in 2017, and was valued last year at 1.5 billion pounds.
""There was a strong business case and growth story for BenevolentAI,"" said Abhishek Singh, vice president in the IT services group at consultancy Everest. He said the firm caught Everest's attention in 2017 when it was researching ""hot start-ups"" but fell ""off our radar"" subsequently.
A BenevolentAI spokesman highlighted the firm's ""recently announced collaboration with AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and other deals in progress"" as a sign of the company's potential.
An Oxford Nanopore spokeswoman said the firm, which opened a factory this month, was ""very ambitious - a great British growth story""."
421,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 10:57AM ET</span>","Microsoft, AT&T ink cloud deal worth more than $2 billion","By Stephen Nellis and Angela Moon
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) on Wednesday said they reached a deal under which the telecommunications company will tap Microsoft's Azure cloud service for its computing needs and use Microsoft 365, which includes Office productivity software, for much of its 268,000-strong workforce.
Under the deal, Microsoft and AT&T will also work together on so-called edge computing, which will see Microsoft technology deployed alongside AT&T's coming 5G network for applications that need extremely small delays in passing data back and forth, such as air traffic control systems for drones. The multi-year deal is worth more than $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The agreement is a major win for Microsoft, which will become AT&T's ""preferred"" cloud vendor and is fighting to gain market share from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Amazon Web Services, the biggest provider of public cloud services. Cloud service customers run their software applications in data centers managed by the cloud provider.
AT&T will remain responsible for its own core networking operations for cell phones and other devices. But John Donovan, chief executive of AT&T Communications, told Reuters the deal is a fundamental shift for the telecommunications provider to become ""public cloud first,"" meaning that it will predominately rely on data centers built by others to power the rest of its business.
""This is one of the most far-reaching initiatives we have put together because of it being so comprehensive,"" he said.
For Microsoft's part, the company will also gain a partner to sell its edge computing services, which will help software developers write programs for situations like factories whose machines are fitted with sensors to collect data or retail stores fitted with sensors and cameras to help keep inventories up to date.
""Our general heritage of being a developer tools company, combined with the network capabilities of AT&T, is unique,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Sayta Nadella told Reuters. 
The deal between Microsoft and AT&T came a day after AT&T said that its AT&T Business Solutions unit will tap International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp to help modernize its software for the cloud and move it back and forth across data centers. An  IBM  spokesman confirmed that the deal is worth billions of dollars over several years but did not provide a precise figure. The Financial Times earlier reported the IBM deal value. 
Ed Anderson, an analyst with research firm Gartner, said too little is known yet to say how important the 5G and edge computing aspects of the deal will be.

""In addition to (AT&T) being an important customer, you've got two big important technology companies starting to come together to think about what some other possibilities are,"" Anderson said. ""But at this point, it's really kind of left to the imagination to kind of figure out what those possibilities are.""

427,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 08:13AM ET</span>",U.S.-Japan Talks Heat Up and May Get Messy,"(Bloomberg) -- With Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s coalition on track to win a clear majority in the upper house Sunday, attention is likely to turn swiftly back to his policy agenda. And U.S. President Donald Trump may push trade up Abe’s priority list.
The pace of talks is expected to pick up rapidly in the coming weeks—and it could get a little messy. Trump has so far protected Japan from his threat of auto tariffs. But the U.S. president will want to see progress on a trade deal that addresses the U.S.’s almost $70 billion trade deficit with Japan and will require some concessions on farming, which is a sensitive area for Tokyo.
So far, it’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. is willing to give Japan in return. Negotiations on the working level have been taking place weekly for more than a month and are resuming in Washington on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the planning.
Japan is still developing its wish list and asking the Trump administration to lower or eliminate tariffs on a range of products, including auto parts and other industrial goods.
Japan’s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi is expected to travel to Washington several times next month for negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a person familiar with the plans said. Officials in both countries want to announce some sort of agreement when Trump and Abe meet at the UN General Assembly in September. But that’s an ambitious goal that will be hard to meet, a Japanese official said.
If talks aren’t moving fast enough, Trump might pull a familiar move: repeating his threat for duties on Japanese auto imports and opening another global front in his trade battle.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was down 0.3% after it reported earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $23.1 billion. As with results from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) earlier this week, relatively strong consumer banking offset weakness in its markets-based businesses. The spate of reports has generally shown upbeat retail banking results but closing net margins, causing investors to worry about the impact of the Federal Reserve cutting rates this year. 
The market's focus switches away from finance after the bell, when Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) post their earnings.

Trade developments reverted to being a minor negative for sentiment after U.S. President Donald Trump said there was a “long way to go” on a trade deal with China. Trump also suggested that the U.S. could impose sanctions on another $325 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) fell 5.3% in premarket trade after the Swedish-based maker of telecom network gear warned that it would take a hit to its gross margins as it tries to recover lost ground against China's Huawei.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fifth Wall, a venture capital firm focused on real estate technology, raised $503 million from a group of 50 large U.S., European and Asian property owners who will provide a market for the start-ups and their products it invests in.
Venice, California-based Fifth Wall said on Wednesday its real estate venture capital fund is the largest ""proptech"" investment pool raised to date and its investor base is the largest consortium of property owners ever assembled.
Property owners have been slow to adopt technologies that use predictive analytics and sensors, for example, to slash energy consumption or increase efficiency. Fifth Wall, founded in 2017, is seeking to fill a void as functions such as data collection are increasingly being computerized.
Fifth Wall invests in companies that will benefit its group of property owners, which include Gecina SA in France, Spain's Merlin Properties and  British Land  Co Plc (LON:BLND) in Europe, and Mitsubishi Estate in Japan, said Brendan Wallace, a managing partner at the VC fund.
Fifth Wall targeted the largest homebuilders, brokerages, office and retail building owners in Europe, Asia and the United States, he said.
The consortium's size increases access, insight, collaboration and the sharing of ideas among the investors and portfolio companies, Wallace said, calling it a network effect.
Fifth Wall noticed the nine investors in its first proptech fund sought not only a financial return but also synergies and cost savings with the technologies they adopted, he said.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis real estate owners have recognized their business no longer is buying and selling assets, but being a better operator, Wallace said.
Stuart Miller, executive chairman at  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN), told analysts in June that the use of Fifth Wall portfolio companies Opendoor, a direct home buyer, title insurer States Title, and digital mortgage platform Blend has cut expenses and increased operating margins.
""What we've been seeing is 10 basis points here, 20 basis points there over the last quarter, year,"" Miller said, according to transcripts of the call. ""Technology has made us better at what we're doing.""
The money Fifth Wall raised more than doubled the size of its first fund, which closed in May 2017 at $212 million. With a third, retail-oriented fund, Fifth Wall now oversees more than $1 billion, the company said.
Fifth Wall said it has delivered more than $340 million in revenue to companies with its portfolio, an increase from over $100 million in May 2018."

LONDON (Reuters) - Acacia Mining said on Wednesday it was seeking a stay of international arbitration proceedings against Tanzania, a step that could ease tensions between the two sides locked in a dispute following a $190 billion tax bill.
Adding to pressure on Acacia, the company said late on Tuesday it had been notified of an imminent ban on the use of a storage dam that would prevent its North Mara gold mine - its main source of revenue - from operating.
The offer to postpone arbitration, which was scheduled to start on Monday, precedes a looming July 19 deadline for Acacia's majority owner Barrick Gold Corp, holder of a 63.9% stake, to make a firm bid to buy out Acacia.
Acacia and other shareholders have been opposing the offer, saying it is too cheap.
International arbitration is generally a last resort for mining companies in disputes with governments. 
But some of Acacia's shareholders have said it has a good chance of winning, which would increase the value of the company and could be preferable to accepting too low an offer from Barrick.
Barrick declined to comment on Wednesday.
It has been leading negotiations with Tanzania over a $190 billion tax bill - about four times the country's gross domestic product. The bill was handed to Acacia in 2017 for allegedly under-reporting output. Acacia denies the allegation.
""If the Tanzanian government agrees to the stay, Acacia would expect the arbitration hearing to be postponed to provide time for the government of Tanzania to complete its settlement discussions with Barrick Gold Corp,"" Acacia said in a statement.
ENVIRONMENTAL RULES
Tanzanian allegations that Acacia has broken environmental regulations have ratcheted up the pressure on Acacia.
Late on Tuesday, Acacia said the Tanzanian National Environment Management Council issued a notice for Acacia's North Mara mine to prevent it using its tailings storage facility by 6 a.m. local time on Saturday on the grounds the mine had breached environment rules.
In a statement, Acacia said it would request any investigation reports or data upon which the North Mara notice is based. 
Acacia's North Mara mine was issued with an Environmental Protection Order and fine in May 2019 for alleged deficiencies at a tailings storage facility. 
But Acacia says it has never received any reports that would justify the ban on use. It said the North Mara technical team has been working ""constructively and collaboratively"" with the Tanzanian government.
Analysts at Berenberg, which rates Acacia ""hold"", said the postponement request should be received positively by Tanzania.
But it said the risk for Acacia is a prolonged outage at North Mara, which would have a ""very significant"" impact on finances given the mine makes up 70% of group revenue, and cannot operate without a tailings dam. 
Acacia's share price was 0.5% lower at 180.6 pence at 1115 GMT.

The company reported earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $23.08 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $0.71 on revenue of $23.12 billion.
The bank's shares turned lower after the release and were off 0.3% to $28.90 by 7:10 AM ET (13:10 GMT) in premarket trade, compared to $29.17 ahead of the publication.
Net interest income rose 3% due to higher interest rates and growth in loan and deposit balances, but that confirmed a slowdown that chief financial officer Paul Donofrio had warned of in April. Net interest income rose 6% in 2018.
Brian Moynihan, chairman and chief executive, said the results were the best quarterly and first-half earnings in the bank’s history and that the outlook points to a “steadily growing economy”.
“We see solid consumer activity across the board, with spending by Bank of America consumers up 5% this quarter over the second quarter of last year,” he said.
These earnings follow the general pattern seen by rivals who reported this week.
JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday but reported weaker net interest income, pointing to rising deposit costs.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) reported a drop in its net interest margin on Monday. Margins have being squeezed as the spread between short- and long-term interest rates has shrunk, crimping banks' ability to invest customer deposits profitably. All of the major banks have also reported underlying declines in revenue from trading in equities, bonds and currencies.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>",Amazon in deal with German watchdog to overhaul marketplace terms,"By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Amazon (O:AMZN) has reached a deal with Germany's anti-trust authority to overhaul its terms of service for third-party merchants, acting to appease regulators as the European Union announced its own investigation of the e-commerce giant.
Germany's Federal Cartel Office said on Wednesday it was dropping its seven-month investigation after Amazon agreed to amend a Business Services Agreement that applies to hundreds of thousands of merchants trading on its platform.
Within hours, however, EU antitrust regulators said they would open their own investigation into whether the world's largest online retailer's terms of service and use of merchant data violated competition rules.
The changes will apply not only to Germany, Amazon's No. 2 market after the United States, but also to its marketplaces in Britain, France, Italy and Spain, as well as its other worldwide sites in America and Asia, the German regulator said.
""We have achieved far-reaching improvements for retailers on Amazon's marketplaces,"" cartel office chief Andreas Mundt said in a statement. ""We are dropping our investigation."" 
Responding, Amazon said the changes to its Business Solutions Agreement, to take effect in 30 days, would clarify the rights and responsibilities of selling partners that account for 58% of physical merchandise sales on its platform.
""We’ll continue working hard, investing heavily, and inventing new tools and services to help our selling partners around the world reach new customers and grow their business,"" said Amazon.
Amazon, responding to news of the EU probe, said it would cooperate fully.
PLATFORMS VS REGULATORS 
Silicon Valley's tech giants have come under increasing scrutiny, with Google (O:GOOGL) hit with billions of euros in fines for breaches of EU competition rules.
Germany's anti-trust regulator, while subordinate to Brussels in many regards, has also been active, ordering Facebook (O:FB) to change how it handles user data after finding the social network abused its market dominance.
Facebook has challenged that decision, in contrast to Amazon which came to a relatively quick understanding with the German regulator. No fines had been foreseen in the Amazon case.
At issue is the power of so-called platform companies that provide a venue for others, for example, to sell new or second-hand books. 
In an inherent conflict of interest, that business has also long been a mainstay of Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos in his garage in 1994 and has gone on to command a market valuation of nearly $1 trillion.
Third-party sellers had complained that Amazon's terms of service were stacked against them, a view backed by the German cartel office which found Amazon dealt with them in an opaque and arbitrary manner.
U.S. lawmakers raised similar concerns in a hearing on Tuesday, pressing Amazon counsel Nate Sutton over allegations it competed against its own sellers and pushed them to buy advertising and fulfilment services.
NEW TERMS
Among the changes in its new terms of service, Amazon will comply with European rules governing liability towards its business partners on its European platforms, whereas earlier it had faced no such liability.
It should now give 30 days notice and a reason for removing a merchant from its platform. Before, it could break off its relationship with or block a seller without warning or explanation.
Merchants using its European marketplaces will be able, in certain circumstances, to take Amazon to court in their own country, whereas before this was only possible in Luxembourg - a deterrent for small-time traders.
They will also be able to appeal against decisions by Amazon regarding who should bear the costs of returns and refunds. Other changes cover product descriptions, ease of understanding Amazon's terms of services and fairer presentation of customer reviews, the cartel office said.
The changes will directly affect 300,000 merchants active on Amazon.de, the company's German site, of which an estimated 60-65% are German. The site had a turnover of 20 billion euros last year, making it by far the biggest of Amazon's European sites.

The German cartel office said it had consulted closely with the European Commission on its probe. Separately, neighboring Austria said it was dropping its own investigation after Amazon changed its terms of service.

439,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",Yield Hunters Lured by Junk Bonds Even as Defaults Pick Up,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are rushing to buy high-yield bonds in Europe at a time when the number of issuers defaulting has reached the highest level since 2010.
The 12-month notional-weighted default rate could rise to 2% by year-end compared with 0.6% a year ago, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Meanwhile high-yield funds with a European focus have attracted inflows for five consecutive weeks totaling 2.7 billion euros ($3.0 billion), the analysts said citing the bank’s own data.
“The search for yield will continue with high-yield being a renewed hunting ground for investment grade buyers,” said Andrew Wilmont, a senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management SA in Geneva, which manages 165 billion euros of assets. “They’re on the lookout for better returns amid a growing negative yielding market.”
But the current rally across fixed income markets, fueled by speculation that the European Central Bank is preparing another round of monetary stimulus, may be masking a key risk in the high-yield market: the fragility of corporate balance sheets.
Blow-Ups
Amid the hunt for yield some portfolio managers are avoiding the riskiest categories of high-yield bonds however, given concerns about idiosyncratic risks, valuations and liquidity.
“Investors have to keep owning the right names and with default rates rising it’s a case of trying to avoid the blow ups,” said Azhar Hussain, head of leveraged finance at Royal London Asset Management, who manages 4.7 billion pounds of assets.
Spread dispersion in Markit’s iTraxx Crossover index is at an all-time record, indicating the current diversity of risks in high-yield names and how selection is critical for portfolio performance, Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mahesh Bhimalingam wrote in a research note Tuesday.
There’s “a huge bifurcation in the market right now” with investors buying BB-rated and good quality B-rated names and “not daring to touch weaker B-rated and triple-C deals with a barge pole,” Royal London’s Hussain said.
Yield Grab
A decade of easy monetary policy has pushed bond investors into riskier assets that yield enough to match their liabilities. And with hints of more monetary stimulus to come, investors predict it’s only a matter of time before people turn their attention to what is yielding more.
“Value is being squeezed thanks to the inflows from investment-grade accounts and we now expect investors to begin reaching down the quality curve for yield,” said Mark Benbow, a fund manager at Kames Capital Plc. “People thought we were at the end of the cycle but Draghi is giving us a few more hours on the dance floor.”
The Edinburgh-based fund manager said he has started buying CCC-rated credits -- which are seven levels below investment grade -- after de-risking earlier this year in a bid to boost his returns, but added that the key is to stay credit selective.
“The next bet will be on CCC credit, it will be a case of ‘that looks reasonable.’ Normally we know it’s the final hour when CCCs let rip,” he said."

Investing.com -- It’s not enough for President Donald Trump to throw wrenches in the machinery of your biggest competitor: success still has to be earned.
That appears to be the big takeaway from Ericsson's (ST:ERICb) latest quarterly numbers.
The Swedish maker of telecom networks gear has been one of the chief beneficiaries of the U.S. administration’s targeting of Huawei as part of its broader attempts to contain growing Chinese influence in world trade and technology. Its shares rose 80% in the 12 months to April as its Chinese rival’s problems with Washington intensified.
However, they were down 5.9% by mid-morning in Stockholm after Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) warned that it would take a sizable hit to gross margins in order to claw back market share – even though it again struck an upbeat note on a long-term outlook that’s dominated by the global rollout of 5G technology.
For comparison, the local benchmark index was down 0.4%, while the Stoxx 600 was down less than 0.1%, consolidating gains made in the first half of the week. The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% on largely political concerns, while the German Dax was down 0.1%
“Strategic contracts in Networks, with initially low margins, taken to strengthen the market position, will have a negative impact on gross margin,” the company said. It added that “the negative impact is expected to increase in 2H 2019” but would not jeopardize its margin target for 2020, the year when it expects its investments in 5G to start paying off more markedly.
Ericsson also warned that the shift to more service-based sales in North America will add further pressure to margins, albeit gradually.
The warnings appeared to hit its biggest European rival too. Shares in Nokia (HE:NOKIA) – which have not recovered from the ravages of Huawei to anywhere near the same extent as Ericsson’s have, fell 1.4%
Ericsson was still able to report a big swing to profit, with net income of 1.8 billion kronor ($192 million), as the cost of previous restructurings faded into the past. It also cut its guidance for future restructuring costs by 1 billion kronor."
441,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",Ericsson second-quarter operating profit matches expectations,"By Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) posted quarterly earnings in line with forecasts but said it expected costs related to winning new contracts for its network business to hit profit margins in the second half of the year.
The result reported on Wednesday halted a streak of five previous quarters of earnings beats as strategic contracts aimed at carving out market share cut into profits.
Its shares fell 7.1% to 83.98 crowns in early trade.
Some analysts had also expected the company to upgrade its 2020 targets after showing steady profitability improvements in 2018 and 2019 following an industry-wide downturn in the middle of the decade in which operators cut spending.
Instead, Ericsson said it was on track to meet its financial targets for 2020 and 2022 due to strong demand for 5G equipment.
""We see strong momentum in our 5G business with both new contracts and new commercial launches as well as live networks,"" Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said in a statement. ""To date, we have provided solutions for almost two-thirds of all commercially launched 5G networks.""
The mobile network equipment maker has staked its recovery on growing demand for next-generation 5G equipment. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (AS:ASML) also said on Wednesday the rollout of the high-speed networks had helped it boost profit margins. 
Some analysts think Ericsson could benefit from current turmoil surrounding market leader China's Huawei but the firm's chief financial officer said he had not yet seen any impact.
""We don't see it in the books but we are close to our customers in discussions,"" Carl Mellander told Reuters. ""When we win business, its technology-based.""
NETWORKS WEIGHS
The company, which also counts Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) as its main rival, has pledged to deliver an operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, of over 10% in 2020. 
Quarterly gross margin in Networks fell to 41.4% from 43.2% in the previous quarter, mainly due to litigation settlement costs, strategic contracts and lower intellectual property rights licensing revenues.
Ericsson said the strategic contracts would boost margins in the long run but would hurt profitability in the near term.
""In the quarter we had a negative impact on gross margin and expect this impact to increase during the second half of the year,"" it said in the report.
Overall, gross margin rose to 36.6% from 34.8% a year ago. Excluding restructuring charges the margin fell to 36.7% from 38.5%.
Quarterly operating profit rose to 3.7 billion crowns from a 0.2 billion profit a year ago, in line with a mean forecast for a 3.7 billion profit in an analyst poll. 
Sales rose to 54.8 billion crowns from 49.8 billion and topped forecasts of 53.2 billion.

In North America, continued 4G and 5G investments by all major customers lifted sales while deliveries of next generation equipment in South Korea and 4G deployment in mainland China boosted business.

LONDON (Reuters) - Resurgent trade tensions, concern over the outlook for corporate America and the growing risk of a chaotic Brexit in the United Kingdom dampened appetite for equities on Wednesday while keeping alive interest in the dollar and government bonds.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened again to tax another $325 billion of Chinese goods, amid nervousness over when the two sides will resume trade talks. But the United States too could face Chinese sanctions following a World Trade Organization ruling on Tuesday.
Wall Street which surged to record highs recently on back of the Federal Reserve's rate-cut signals, has shown nervousness this week as big banks reporting quarterly earnings -- Citi, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) -- have shown drops in net interest margins, a sign low interest rates are squeezing bottom lines.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are among companies reporting results later in the day and investors will watch for signals on the profit outlook.
""The market is over-extended. The anticipation is for a lot of liquidity injections and rate cuts and there's little room in the market for disappointment in corporate earnings,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""If there is disappointment in earnings-per-share, that will drive more consolidation in the market.""
Investors fear central banks may find it hard to rescue a world economy under pressure from a year-long trade spat -- the latest sign of which came from Singapore whose exports sank by the most in six years in June.
Equity futures suggest a modestly firmer opening on Wall Street while MSCI's global equity index held just off recent 10-day highs.
MSCI's index of Asian shares ex-Japan fell a quarter percent, while a pan-European index opened flat to weaker..
A Fed rate-cut cycle would put further pressure on margins at U.S. banks. Money markets are are 100% priced for three interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each by next March, while some banks such as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) predict three cuts by the end of the year.
Those wagers have not budged even after a surprisingly strong U.S. retail sales reading on Tuesday, robust June jobs data and the biggest rise in New York manufacturing in over two years. In fact, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans touted 50 basis points of easing this month.
Savary said those expecting three rate cuts this year could be disappointed as that magnitude of easing would be ""compatible with a recession.""
But Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets, said the domestic data would not deter the Fed. 
""The Fed knows the U.S. consumer is strong; policymakers are worried about the downside risks associated with global growth and weak manufacturing/business investment, which is why they believe a rate cut is appropriate.""
That alongside the trade uncertainty and soft equity markets kept bonds well-bid -- U.S. Treasury yields, which rose after the retail data, inched lower again. Another 'safe' asset, German bonds, also saw a fall in yields. 
STERLING STRICKEN
Fed expectations have not dented the dollar however. It stood around a one-week high against a basket of currencies after the previous day's half-percent jump.
The greenback tends to benefit from trade war jitters but also is backed by higher interest rates than most other major currencies. It is also receiving a boost from the concerns around sterling which has fallen to 27-month lows on fears Britain will tumble out of the European Union with no trade deal to soften the blow. 
The pound fell further below $1.24, bringing losses this month to almost 2.4%. It has fallen 8% from its March peak of $1.3383.
The euro which lost 0.4% on Tuesday remains under pressure after weak business sentiment data heightened expectations the European Central Bank will cut rates twice this year from its current minus 0.4% level.

The dollar's gains tarnished gold, pushing it 0.2% lower to $1,403 per ounce while oil prices stabilized after falling more than 3% earlier..

444,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 03:58AM ET</span>",From Viet Cong to Team USA: Hanoi garment factory's Olympic transformation,"By Kham Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - When Nguyen Thi Thu Huyen started work at the No. 40 Garment Factory, it was still producing boots and uniforms for the Vietnamese army, just as it had done during the Southeast Asian country's long war with the United States.
Now the sprawling, Soviet-built complex on the outskirts of Hanoi has a different mission: churning out millions of units a year for global sportswear brands like  Nike  (N:NKE) and the U.S. Olympic team, Team USA.
""I feel very proud watching the Olympics and seeing our garments on screen. It might not be the exact one I made, but one of them must be,"" said Huyen, who began working at the factory in the early 1990s.
At the height of the Vietnam War, the ""X40"" factory, as it had been code named by the Vietnamese defense ministry, was one of three factories producing uniforms for the North Vietnamese army and its Viet Cong guerrillas in the south.
But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, state-owned factories came under extra pressure to focus on export-oriented products and raise much-needed hard currency.
Vietnam had already begun its ""doi moi"" process of reform at the time, but it was still under a U.S. trade embargo that would not be lifted until 1994. 
""They were making jackets and shoes and even missile covers for the Vietnamese military. By the time I arrived in 1991, the factory had already converted to making garments for export,"" said Australian businessman Jef Stokes, who was among the first wave of foreign investors to place orders at X40 after Vietnam opened up.
Stokes bought the factory in 2006 and transformed it into Maxport Limited, a sportswear manufacturer that now boasts as clients Nike (N:NKE), Asics (T:7936) and a handful of Olympic teams. 
""We outfit quite a few big countries,"" Stokes said. ""A lot of sports stars: Roger Federer, Tiger Woods, Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB), Rafael Nadal ... these are all under the Nike umbrella that we produce for.""
The factory has undergone a physical transformation too. 
Surrounded by a sea of concrete, few trees had existed at the factory complex, except for a large banyan tree which, according to a much-repeated legend among the factory workers, was planted by Vietnam's founding president, Ho Chi Minh.
Stokes planted more than 6,000 trees to form a thick jungle that which engulfed the buildings in rich foliage to create an atmosphere that feels more like a Silicon Valley startup than a Communist-era factory.

""I no longer feel uncomfortable when I tell people that I'm a factory worker,"" said Huyen, who began work when the factory was still known as X40. ""Fashion follows history.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In a packed Shanghai classroom on a hot afternoon, nearly a hundred ""mom-and-pop"" investors were honing their trading skills ahead of the first opening bell for China's Nasdaq-style tech board.
They were learning survival techniques from veteran trader Shen Shikang, who predicted ""a burst of stir-frying"" -- quick buying and selling of stocks -- when trading starts on Monday.
Markets are brutal, Shen warned, urging students to ""be disciplined"" and ""cut their losses ruthlessly"". 
Eight months after President Xi Jinping unveiled plans for Shanghai's technology innovation board, the first batch of 25 companies - ranging from chip-makers to biotech firms - will debut on the STAR Market.
Modeled after Nasdaq, and complete with a U.S-style IPO system, STAR may be China's boldest attempt at capital market reforms yet. It is also seen driven by Beijing's ambition to become technologically self-reliant as a prolonged trade war with Washington catches Chinese tech firms in the cross-fire.
China's notoriously volatile stock markets are not for the faint-hearted. But with looser trading rules designed to give market forces a bigger role in setting prices on the new board, even seasoned investors are bracing for a wild ride.
""You will see kamikaze squads in this market, definitely,"" said investment banker Terence Lin, using a local term for groups of die-hard punters who drive share prices to the sky. 
Lin, CEO of boutique investment bank World Financial Holding Group, said that while Nasdaq is dominated by professional investors STAR risks becoming a playground for speculators.
""Many Chinese retail investors buy stocks on recommendations from chat groups in social media such as QQ and Wechat, without even knowing what those companies are doing."" 
Some analysts say the board's success will hinge largely on whether it can attract domestic listings from the likes of  Alibaba  (N:BABA) or Tencent (HK:0700), or firms that could potentially be China's own Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Foreign companies cannot list on the market. 
REGULATORS URGE CALM, INVESTORS BUCKLE UP 
Regulators are calling for understanding. 
""Initially, there could be trading imbalances between supply and demand, and the market should look at fluctuations in a reasonable way,"" Liu Ti, deputy general manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, told a recent forum. 
The first batch of companies to list raised about 37 billion yuan ($5.38 billion), amid frenzied demand and some eye-popping valuations that in one case was 171 times earnings.
The IPOs were 1,695 times oversubscribed among retail investors, setting the stage for a scramble in the secondary market when trading begins.
Zhou Liang, founder of Shanghai Minority Investment Management, said he has a massive number of IPO shares which he plans to sell to hungry buyers.
""Prices will be higher because investor enthusiasm runs high,"" Zhou said.
There will be no daily price limits during the first five days of a company's listing, after which stocks will be allowed to rise or fall up to 20% in a day. Elsewhere in China, price gains are capped at 44% on debut, and limited to 10% swings in either direction thereafter.
And, for the first time, loss-making companies will be allowed to list in China, giving start-ups more access to funding. (For a FACTBOX with more details on the new market, see)
Reagan Li, fund manager at Shanghai V-Invest Co Ltd, expected ""boisterous"" trading initially. He said he would only buy shares of selected companies at reasonable prices, hoping ""the market can give us such a chance."" 
CHINA'S NASDAQ 
China's previous attempts to create its own Nasdaq have largely floundered. 
Shenzhen's tech-heavy ChiNext, designed to be a driver of innovation, was launched a decade ago, but became a hotbed of speculation and corporate cheating. Investor confidence has still not fully recovered after that bubble burst during the broader 2015 market crash.
An over-the-counter equity market, the New Third Board, saw a similar fate. After initial excitement, the board has been deserted by investors and issuers.
Having witnessed ChiNext's implosion, Luo Huasen said he has no plans to venture into STAR, at least initially. 

""I suspect the craziness of this market will be beyond my understanding,"" said Luo, chairman of Shanghai Hengsui Asset Management. ""I will stay on the sidelines.""

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 03:06AM ET</span>","Budweiser APAC's IPO failure hurt retail investors, say newspaper adverts urging reform","By Felix Tam
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The dramatic failure of brewer Budweiser APAC's $9.8 billion Hong Kong listing left ""mom and pop"" investors badly out of pocket, a local broker has said in an unusual series of full-page advertisements in newspapers across the city on Wednesday.
Bright Smart Securities & Commodities Group Ltd (HK:1428) urged bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (HK:0388) and regulator Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to reform the listing process.
Retail investors accounted for 23% of trading in Hong Kong last year, far higher than in other major markets such as New York or London. They are also active participants in the city's initial public offering (IPO) market.
They typically borrow from their brokers to subscribe to IPOs, using the shares they hope to obtain as collateral.
Last Thursday, investors awaited the pricing of Budweiser APAC shares in what would have been the world's largest IPO so far this year. However, Belgian parent Anheuser Busch InBev NV (BR:ABI) canceled the pricing and called off the IPO the following day.
Retail investors nevertheless had to pay interest on the money they had borrowed to subscribe to the IPO.
Calling off the IPO ""made investors pay interest for no reason,"" Bright Smart Securities said in its adverts. ""If another company shelves its IPO, that company should compensate for paid interest to investors to ensure fairness.""
HKEX and the SFC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Budweiser APAC said subscriptions for the IPO were done in accordance with local market practice.
Local brokers are a significant force in Hong Kong because of the high level of retail trading. They have a leading role in electing the financial services representative who sits in the city's Legislative Council - the current representative, Christopher Cheung is chief executive and chairman of broker Christfund Securities.
While brokers have welcomed some reforms to Hong Kong's securities market, they have actively opposed others. In 2012, they took to the streets to protest against plans to shorten the bourse's trading lunch break. (https://tinyurl.com/y6hvejx2)
Bankers at multinationals and their advisers often privately blame local brokers and retail investors for hindering reforms in the city that would make the market operate more like its U.S. rivals.
While New York IPOs price one evening and begin trading the next morning, Hong Kong deals require a settlement gap of five working days because the system is still largely paper-based.
Retail investors still file paper applications to subscribe for shares and they pay in advance by cheque or cashier order.
Earlier this year the exchange said it was looking to shorten the five-day cycle, and that it was working on a paperless model for the securities market to help them to achieve this."

450,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 01:33AM ET</span>",Tencent-backed live-streaming firm DouYu prices U.S. IPO at low end of range,"By Joshua Franklin and Julie Zhu
NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  DouYu International Holdings  Ltd (N:DOYU), China's largest live-streaming platform, on Tuesday said it sold $775 million in stock at a $3.73 billion valuation after pricing its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) at the bottom of an indicative range.
DouYu, which is backed by Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), sold American depositary shares (ADS) at $11.5 each, compared with a previously stated target of $11.50 to $14.00, the firm said in a statement. Every 10 ADSs represent one ordinary share.
That makes the deal the largest Chinese IPO in the United States so far in 2019, eclipsing that of  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK) which raised $645 million, according Refinitiv data.
However the weak pricing opens questions about the necessity of DouYu's decision in May to put its IPO on hold amid a global markets sell-off stemming from U.S.-China trade tensions.
The IPO was also a test of U.S. investor demand for Chinese stocks after Anheuser Busch InBev NV (BR:ABI) called off the Hong Kong listing of its Asia-Pacific brewing business due to weak orders from U.S. ""long only"" fund managers.
DouYu, which primarily focuses on the live-streaming of games, is one of several Chinese start-ups in the growing market for live-streaming in the world's second-biggest economy, along with Huajiao and U.S.-listed Huya Inc (N:HUYA).
DouYu has exclusive streaming rights to 29 major tournaments in China, including League of Legends, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and DOTA2, according to its IPO filing.
The rapid growth of the live-streaming sector has seen China's tech heavyweights - Tencent,  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) - open their wallets to back a slew of firms in the hope of boosting existing services in e-commerce, social networking and gaming.
DouYu's losses in 2018 widened to 876.3 million yuan ($127.43 million) from 612.9 million yuan a year earlier, its prospectus showed. The company did, however, report a profit of 18.2 million yuan for the first three months of 2019.
Of the shares on sale in the IPO, DouYu sold two-thirds to raise $517 million, with the remainder sold by existing investors.
Shares of DouYu, which translates to ""Fighting Fish"", are due to start trading on Wednesday under the symbol ""DOYU"" on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank Of America Merrill Lynch and CMB International are the underwriting banks on the IPO."
451,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",Nouriel Roubini Ramps Up Campaign Against Crypto Exchange BitMEX,"(Bloomberg) -- Nouriel Roubini, a well-known critic of cryptocurrencies, just escalated his debate with BitMEX’s Chief Executive Officer Arthur Hayes, posting a report that suggests Hayes’s exchange “may be openly involved in systematic illegality.”
Roubini, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business, said BitMEX lets traders take on too much risk, allowing them to leverage bets to 100 times the amount of funds they put down. He cited estimates in an anonymous blogger’s widely read post on Medium last year that liquidations may, at times, account for a significant share of BitMEX’s revenue. He also pointed to the blogger’s claim that BitMEX trades against clients. And Roubini said the exchange “skirts” regulations designed to stop money laundering.
Crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX, which is based in the Seychelles, is hardly the only crypto exchange to offer customers 100 times leverage. And Hayes told Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance last year that the exchange doesn’t make money when customers are liquidated and doesn’t trade against them.
“BitMEX provides safe, fast, professional and liquid ways for those who see the potential of crypto and to trade and hedge cryptocurrency risk,“ Hayes told Bloomberg News via an email from a spokeswoman. “We continue to monitor all legal and regulatory developments around the world and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations; we reject any allegations of criminality, manipulation or unfair treatment of our customers, who are at the center of everything we do.”
Roubini is entitled to his opinion, Hayes added. That opinion was withering.
“At a minimum, Hayes and all of the others overseeing similar rackets from offshore safe havens should be investigated, before millions more retail investors get scammed into financial ruin,” Roubini wrote.
The posting extends a public debate Roubini and Hayes held at the Asia Blockchain Summit earlier this month, dubbed by organizers as the “Tangle in Taipei,” in which both men later declared themselves the winner. Roubini spent days demanding on Twitter that the video of the debate be released, and it eventually was.
Their spat comes amid heightened skepticism of crypto ventures in Washington. Congress is holding hearings on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).’s plans to help start a new digital currency called Libra. In recent days, President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have all commented on Libra and cryptocurrencies in general, expressing worries that they may be used by criminals and terrorists.
Other exchanges have been accused of generating fake trading volume, or not stopping pump-and-dump schemes in which traders buy coins, get others to buy them driving up the coins’ price, and then dump them."

Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) Chairman Wayne Byres told reporters on a conference call the regulator will need to work with the government to decide how to progress on recommendations from the review published late on Tuesday. 
Byres could not provide the exact sum needed but said it ""was not a trivial amount.""
""The government has told us we can put a submission in (and) we certainly intend to do so,"" he said.
""We are quite lightly resourced, even with the resourcing that the government has announced,"" he added, referring to the federal government's move earlier this year to boost APRA's funding by A$150 million ($106 million).
The review, ordered by the government following a misconduct inquiry into the finance sector, accused APRA of being unwilling to challenge itself, slow to respond and tentative in addressing issues outside of traditional financial risks.
APRA's preference for working ""behind the scenes"" with the more than 500 companies it oversees limited its effectiveness, and the regulator needed to communicate about its work more publicly and forcefully, the report added.
Byres, who has been the APRA chairman since 2014, said the regulator may have focused too much on consistency, which ""may have played out in terms of slower responses"".
From now, he said, when it came to ""naming and shaming, the general direction is to do more of that"".
He pointed to a July 11 announcement that APRA was making three of Australia's biggest banks - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) increase their capital reserves due to concerns about non-financial risk management.

""Those are the kinds of things you can expect to see going forward,"" Byres added.

LONDON (Reuters) - The cryptocurrency market took a beating on Tuesday with bitcoin losing over 10% in value after U.S. lawmakers grilled Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on its cryptocurrency plans, as political and regulatory scrutiny of digital coins intensifies.
The social media giant is fighting to get Washington onside after it shocked regulators and lawmakers with its announcement on June 18 that it was hoping to launch its own digital coin called Libra in 2020. 
David Marcus, the company's top executive overseeing the planned Libra project, answered questions from the Senate Banking Committee. During the hearing, a U.S. senator said Facebook was ""delusional"" to believe people will trust it with their money.
Facebook's Libra plan, which is seen as a major step for wider adaptation of virtual currencies, has helped stoke this year's rally in bitcoin, ethereum and other digital coins.
""Libra is essentially slammed in the Senate,"" said Lennon Sweeting, head trader at Coinsquare Capital Markets Ltd. ""It's just headline-driven volatility.""
Digital currencies will likely recover with bitcoin returning to a $11,000-$12,000 trading range, Sweeting said.
At 2:56 p.m. (1856 GMT), bitcoin fell 11.69% to $9,582.12 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. It fell below $10,000 for the first time in two weeks.
The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency climbed to nearly $14,000 in late June, not long after Facebook unveiled its Libra plan. That was still far below its record high of nearly $20,000 set at end of 2017.
Ethereum, the No. 2 virtual currency, lost 13.32% to $198.2 after hitting $190.41, which was its lowest level since May 13.
Other widely followed currencies such as ripple were down 8% on the day.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>",U.S. Justice Department asks appeals court to pause antitrust ruling against Qualcomm,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause the enforcement of a sweeping antitrust ruling against mobile chip supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Tuesday, citing support from the Energy Department and Defense Department.
""For DoD, Qualcomm is a key player both in terms of its trusted supply chain and as a leader in innovation, and it would be impossible to replace Qualcomm's critical role in 5G technology in the short term,"" Ellen M. Lord, Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, wrote in a filing made in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Qualcomm, the largest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks, on May 21 lost in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year.
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive patent-licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the mobile chip market. Koh ordered Qualcomm to license its technology to rival chipmakers, which include firms like Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's HiSilicon chip unit.
Qualcomm has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursues an appeal. The San Diego, California, company has argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks.
Koh declined to pause the ruling, bringing the case before the 9th Circuit.
The Justice Department's antitrust division had asked Koh to hold an additional hearing about potential penalties before she made her ruling, but she declined to do so. 
In a friend of the court filing on Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys argued her ruling was ""erroneous"" and called her decision to forego additional hearings ""unlawful.""
Energy Department officials also filed in favor of a pause.
""DOE’s missions in nuclear security and protection of the Nation’s energy and nuclear infrastructure are dependent on secure and advanced wireless communications, of which Qualcomm is the major and predominant U.S. supplier of both current generation and upcoming 5G chipsets,"" wrote chief information officer Max Everett.

Lord wrote that the Defense Department ""firmly believes that any measure that inappropriately limits Qualcomm's technological leadership, ability to invest in research and development, and market competitiveness, even in the short-term, could harm national security.""

456,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 07:39PM ET</span>",Worried UK employees call for changes to proposed immigration reform,"LONDON (Reuters) - A coalition of British industry groups and education bodies, worried by the prospect of Brexit worsening skills and labor shortages, has called for the next prime minister to relax proposed reforms of the immigration system.
The #FullStrength campaign said on Wednesday it had written to both Boris Johnson, frontrunner to be the next leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister, and his rival, foreign minister Jeremy Hunt, calling for the government they would lead to lower the salary threshold proposed in draft immigration legislation from 30,000 pounds ($37,000) to 20,000.
In December, Britain set out in a policy paper the biggest overhaul of its immigration policy in decades, ending special treatment for European Union nationals.
Concern about the social and economic impact of immigration helped drive Britain's 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.
#FullStrength brings together bodies including London First, techUK, the British Retail Consortium, the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, UKHospitality, the Federation of Master Builders and Universities UK. Collectively they represent tens of thousands of businesses and employ millions of workers across all sectors and regions of Britain.
Their joint letter said more than 60% of all jobs in the UK currently fall under the proposed 30,000-pound salary threshold, highlighting the risk in setting the future level too high for vital services such as health and social care.
The coalition also wants the government to extend the temporary work route for overseas workers from one year to two years, revise the sponsorship model to make it easier for firms of all sizes to bring in the overseas talent they need, and reinstate the two-year, post-study visa for international students to work in Britain post-graduation.
“Without the ability to access international talent, many of our world-class sectors are at significant risk,"" the joint letter said.
""As the UK prepares to leave the EU in the near future, it is imperative that the government puts in place measures that will avoid employers facing a cliff-edge in recruitment, and works towards building a successful economy that is open and attractive.”

Johnson has pledged that Britain will leave the EU with or without a transition deal on Oct. 31 if he becomes prime minister, while Hunt has said that he would, if absolutely necessary, go for a no-deal Brexit.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 07:39PM ET</span>","As steep patent cliff looms, Shionogi moves to develop its own U.S. sales staff","By Takashi Umekawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - For much of its 141-year history, Japan's Shionogi & Co Ltd (T:4507) has played safe when selling its drugs in the United States and other overseas markets - relying on bigger partners to promote its products and avoiding the cost of maintaining a large sales force.
It followed that pattern for blockbuster cholesterol treatment Crestor, its biggest success story, which was developed in-house until mid-stage trials when it teamed up with AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN). AstraZeneca gained the rights to sell the drug in all markets but Japan.
But Shionogi, Japan's most profitable drugmaker by operating margin, has become open to more risk - prodded into seizing more sales for itself by a looming patent cliff that will see a key HIV drug and three combination medicines exposed to generic competition in nine years time.
""We'll have to increase by a bit the portion of what we sell by ourselves and not just rely on others,"" CEO Isao Teshirogi told Reuters in an interview.
Shionogi tested the waters in the world's biggest drug market last year with Mulpleta, a drug designed to prevent excessive bleeding in patients who need surgery and have a lower blood platelet count due to chronic liver disease. 
It also plans to develop its own U.S. sales team for cefiderocol, an antibiotic it hopes will gain approval this year and which will be used as a last-resort treatment for patients with infectious disease not cured by other antibiotics.
""Cefiderocol is a drug that will only be used by specialists at big hospitals and across the U.S., we're only going to need 50 to 70 medical representatives. That makes it a good next entry point for us - something we can do under own steam,"" he said.
Shionogi declined to disclose its sales team numbers for Mulpleta, a drug it expects will earn $12.3 million this year. It has also not disclosed sales estimates for cefiderocol.
Japan's No. 9 drugmaker by revenue is, however, also keen not to bite off more than it can chew. 
Teshirogi said while it might be possible to take on U.S. sales of a drug like an HIV medicine with a team of 100-plus, primary care market drugs that require teams of 400 to 500 people were another matter.
An attempt at U.S. sales in 2013 for Osphena, used by women who experience pain during sexual intercourse, became too costly, as it was a primary care market drug and as it was the only drug Shionogi had in women's healthcare at the time. It licensed out Osphena to Canada's Duchesnay in 2017.
Shionogi, which gains roughly half its revenue from royalties, has notched up four straight years of record operating profit and boasts an operating profit margin of 38%. It also has promising drugs like newly launched flu-drug Xofluza but the patent cliff for its HIV treatments will create an earnings gap that will be hard to completely offset.
HIV drug Tivicay and three combination treatments, which are marketed by GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) ViiV Healthcare Ltd, accounted for a third of Shionogi's 364 billion yen ($3.4 billion) in revenue in the last financial year. 
""The next few years are going to be key for Shionogi,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi.
The drugmaker currently has 23 drugs in clinical trials with five of those trials having progressed to late-stage.
In other moves to diversify its revenue stream, Shionogi has partnered with U.S. startup Akili Interactive Labs Inc to develop and sell two medical apps, one for ADHD and one for patients on the autism spectrum.
Japan has yet to approve apps designed to treat diseases or disorders. By comparison, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave its first nod for such medical apps in 2010.
Teshirogi said Shionogi was keen to develop drugs made from so-called mid-sized molecules such as peptides - an area that few other drugmakers were looking at. Shionogi is working with universities and had partnered with Japanese biopharmaceutical firm  PeptiDream Inc  (T:4587) to conduct joint research.
""I truly believe we're going to see two or three products come out of these efforts that will help us counter our HIV patent cliff,"" he said.

Dr. Leana Wen, the first physician in nearly 50 years to lead the federation and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said she took the job last September intending to advocate for a broad range of public health policies, not just abortion.
The federation's board, however, decided to ""double down"" on making abortion rights a key priority as the group engages in legal and political battles after some states passed severe restrictions women's ability to terminate pregnancies, Wen said. 
""With the landscape changing dramatically in the last several months and the right to safe, legal abortion care under attack like never before, I understand the shift in the board's prioritization,"" she said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Planned Parenthood has been a high-profile target for anti-abortion activists.
The Washington-based Planned Parenthood groups announced Wen's departure, which takes effect immediately, without giving a reason for it and apparently catching her off guard.
""I just learned that the @PPFA Board ended my employment at a secret meeting,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""We were engaged in good faith negotiations about my departure based on philosophical differences over the direction and future of Planned Parenthood.""
The groups said that Alexis McGill Johnson, a former board member for both, would take over for Wen as acting president and CEO of the federation and acting president of the action fund.""Alexis is a renowned social justice leader, lifelong political organizer, and a tireless advocate for reproductive rights and access to quality, affordable health care,"" PPFA and PPAF said in a statement.
Johnson is the co-founder of the Perception Institute, a research group that works to reduce racial bias and other forms of discrimination.
The groups said they would launch their search for a permanent replacement for Wen early in 2020 with the aim of having a successor in place by the end of the year.

Planned Parenthood provides abortion, birth control, cancer screenings, disease testing and other health services to 2.4 million people at more than 600 centers in the United States, according to its most recent annual report.

1. Rebound in Housing Market to Continue?
Housing market numbers are on the agenda for Wednesday, with many eager to see whether homebuilder activity will finally get a boost from lower mortgage rates following an unexpected drop in May. 
The Commerce Department will report on housing starts and building permits for June at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect that housing starts slipped to an annual rate of 1.261 million last month. 
Building permits, an indication of future demand, are forecast to show a small increase to a rate of 1.3 million.
If there's an abrupt month-to-month change in either estimate, look to see if is occurring in multi-family housing. Starts and permits are more volatile in buildings with five or more units. A gain in single-family starts and permits has a larger impact on the economy.
2. Crude Inventories to Fall for Fifth-Straight Week?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, comes as oil prices continued their decline for a second-straight day on Tuesday as President Donald Trump toned down his rhetoric on Iran. 
Trump insisted his administration was ""not looking for regime change"" in Iran, and acknowledged the country's foreign minister's willingness to open talks with the U.S. over its missile program. 
""They’d like to talk, and we’ll see what happens,"" Trump said, easing U.S.-Iran tensions and deflating some of the premium that had been baked into oil prices as escalations surged between the two sides in recent weeks. 
West Texas Intermediate futures fell 3.3% to settle at $57.62. Brent , the global benchmark, fell 3.2% to $64.35 a barrel. Both may get a boost Wednesday if domestic inventories continue their four-week slide. 
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data showing weekly crude stockpiles fell by 1.4 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a drawdown in crude stockpiles of 2.69 million barrels for the week ended July 14. That would mark the fifth-weekly draw in crude stockpiles.
Netflix,  IBM  and Bank of America Ready Earnings 
With markets ending the day just below all-time highs, quarterly earnings from a host of companies including Netflix, IBM and Bank of America may justify whether the broader market is running too hot or not. 
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reports earnings after the closing bell, and its subscriber numbers will be closely watched, at a time when rivals such as Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) are pulling content as the streaming wars gather pace. Netflix is off 0.4% in July but is up a whopping 36.7% for the year.
Net new subscribers are expected to come in at 352,000 domestic and 4.8 million international. In April, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) said it expected to add 300,000 new domestic subscribers and 4.7 million international subscribers.
Netflix is expected to report earnings of 56 cents per share on revenue of $4.9 billion, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. 
The streaming giant's outlook will also garner attention after Disney, WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal reclaimed the rights to popular titles such as ""Friends"" and ""The Office.""
Elsewhere in tech,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) will report earnings after the closing bell, with many expecting the tech giant's costly acquisition of Redhat to prove short-term pain but offer long-term gain. 
IBM is expected to report earnings of $3.08 a share on revenue of $19.18 billion. 
The report comes as the tech company inked a multiyear agreement with AT&T (NYSE:T) on Tuesday to allow the carrier to host its business applications on the IBM Cloud.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), meanwhile, will roll out its second-quarter earnings before the bell. The bank's cost-cutting efforts will come under scrutiny, as will its investment banking performance. 
Investment banking revenues are expected to take hit from rising trade tensions and a slowing global economy, while borrowing costs and geopolitical concerns likely weighed on M&A deal activity. 
The bank is expected to report earnings of 71 cents on revenue of $23.12 billion.
Other notable names reporting performance on Wednesday include eBay, Abbott Labs, US Bancorp(NYSE:USB) and Kinder Morgan. "

463,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:53PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Micron Slides as Analysts Downplay Memory Price Pop,"Investing.com - Micron (NASDAQ:MU) fell on Tuesday, even as UBS raised its price target on the chipmaker's stock as analysts downplayed expectations that the recent pop in memory prices amid export restrictions on Korea would continue.
UBS maintained its neutral rating on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and raised its price target to $47 from $37, though it tempered expectations by claiming 2020 would be a transition year unless gross margins in memory chips improve. Micron was down about 2.8% on the day.
The new UBS target is closer in line to the $42.86 consensus target among analysts polled by Investing.com. With the stock at about $43, the shares are up 36% this year.
“We get the near-term stock reaction to geopolitical (Japan/Korea) and competitor production issues, but given the historically strong correlation between the stock and gross margins, it is just hard to believe the stock is off to the races unless margins are snapping higher,” UBS said in a note.
Japan earlier this month imposed export restrictions on South Korea, which controls about 70% of the global market for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and 50% for NAND flash memory.
The move prompted fears of supply shortage, boosting chip prices. But Morgan Stanley said it sees no long-term impact on DRAM pricing and thinks the 10% rise in spot pricing in the past week will prove short-lived.
Others on Wall Street went further, with Lynx Equity saying it was time to take profits on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) amid fears further headwinds in the chipmaker's core memory business could see the stock retrace some of its 2019 gains.
The concerns about Micron (NASDAQ:MU) come just a month after the chipmaker drew praise from Wall Street following better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and an upbeat outlook on memory demand.
Micron said last month it still expected to see ""healthy year-over-year growth"" in global DRAM semiconductor demand, though admitted that further capex cuts would be needed in order to reach supply-demand balance in current inventories. "

466,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:50PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia Set for 24-Hour Trading Amid Prayer Time Confusion,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia said it will allow some businesses to stay open 24 hours a day, an announcement that triggered puzzlement over whether it was ending rules that require shops to shut for Islam’s five daily prayers.
A cabinet decision on Tuesday permitted stores and restaurants to operate all day in exchange for paying a fee, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. The Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs will determine the charge, as well as which commercial activities will be affected, it said.
“This is positive news that I expect will increase consumption and create jobs,” said Mazen Al-Sudairi, head of research at Al-Rajhi Capital in Riyadh. “Fast-food restaurants, cafes and cinemas will be the primary beneficiaries.”
The decision to allow all-day trading was welcomed by many in a society that skews nocturnal despite businesses currently closing around midnight. But there was confusion over whether the conservative Islamic kingdom was ending its practice of forcing stores to close during prayers. Doing so would amount to another substantial loosening of regulations since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman began an overhaul of the economy to reduce its reliance on oil.
Saudi-owned television channel Al-Arabiya initially published a tweet saying shops would now be allowed to stay open during prayers, but that was later deleted and an official subsequently rejected the idea in an interview with the same network.
The cabinet decision “doesn’t include carrying out commercial activities during prayers and it doesn’t touch any previous decision related to prayer times,” said Khalid Al-Degaither, a deputy at the ministry implementing the change.
Pressed repeatedly by the presenter about whether a shop that opened during prayers would be violating the law, Al-Degaither didn’t commit either way.
A government document last year had called for an end to mandatory prayer closures, though the recommendation was buried on page 156 of the document and removed in a later version. Over the past year, many shops and restaurants in Riyadh have relaxed their approach, quietly keeping their doors unlocked during prayers or openly directing their customers to enter through side doors.
Muted Backlash
In the past two years, the government has lifted a ban on women driving, allowed cinemas to open and sponsored gender-mixed concerts in a country where music was rarely heard in public.
The changes haven’t been without controversy, but the backlash from more conservative citizens has been muted -- out of deference to the kingdom’s rulers and also due to a climate of fear that grew as the government cracked down politically, detaining dozens of domestic critics.
The prayer closures have long been part of the rhythm of life in Saudi Arabia, with cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls and pharmacies shutting down for 30 minutes at a time, sometimes even locking their doors with customers inside. The practice contrasts with neighboring Muslim-majority states, many of which close businesses for a special Friday prayer but otherwise continue commerce as usual.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>","United Airlines quarterly profit beats on strong travel demand, higher fares","By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) on Tuesday reported a bigger-than-expected increase in second-quarter profit, driven by strong air travel demand and the ability to charge more for seats after the grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX reduced capacity.
The three U.S. airlines that operate the MAX - United,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) - are cancelling thousands of flights each month since a worldwide grounding in March following crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed a total of 346 people.
Chicago-based United said net income rose 54% to $1.05 billion, or $4.02 per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $683 million or $2.48 per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the airline earned $4.21 per share for the quarter. Analysts on average expected a profit of $4.08 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The No. 3 U.S. air carrier is in the midst of a three-year plan to claw back domestic market share from rivals by building up connections through its main U.S. hubs, including Chicago, New York and San Francisco, cities that attract lots of travelers willing to fly first-class and business-class.
Citing continued strong demand, United lifted its 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $10.5-$12.0 versus $10.0-$12.0 previously.
Still, the earnings per share growth for the year is expected to be slower than in 2018 due to the MAX grounding and closed Pakistani air space, which forced United to cut its 2019 capacity growth target for a second time this year. It now expects capacity to increase between 3% and 4%, versus an original forecast of 4%-6% growth.

Pakistan reopened its airspace to international civil aviation on Tuesday after months of restrictions imposed because of clashes with India, which forced long detours that cost airlines millions of dollars.
United said it was reviewing options to resume service to India in coming weeks.
But the timing of a 737 MAX return remains uncertain.
United has pulled its 14 MAX aircraft from its flight schedule until early November, though many analysts do not expect the aircraft to fly again this year. Boeing has said it will likely take until at least September to fix a fresh flaw in the 737 MAX discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration last month.
When the jets were first grounded in mid-March, United largely avoided flight cancellations by servicing MAX routes with larger aircraft, but as new MAX deliveries remain frozen, it estimates daily cancellations will more than double from about 40 or 45 in July to 95 in October.
United was expecting another 16 MAX deliveries this year.
Total operating revenue rose 5.8% to $11.40 billion in the quarter, while closely watched revenue per available seat mile rose 2.5%, the top end of United's guidance for growth between 0.5% and 2.5%, helped by supply constraints due to the MAX grounding.
United shares were up 0.6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. United management will host a conference call on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT.
United is the first of three U.S. 737 MAX operators to post second-quarter results, with Southwest and American due to report on July 25.

Rival Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), which does not operate the 737 MAX, lifted its 2019 profit forecast last week and said it was seeing a ""marginal benefit"" from supply constraints in the market due to the aircraft's grounding.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday said New York City can ban advertising inside vehicles driven for companies such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), handing a victory to the millions of passengers who it said find such ads ""extremely annoying.""
Reversing a lower court ruling, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled 3-0 that the ban did not violate the First Amendment, in a case brought by a technology company that places digital content inside ride-sharing vehicles.
Chief Judge Robert Katzmann called the two-decade-old ban a reasonable means to advance the city's substantial interest in ""improving the overall passenger experience.""
The ban included an exception for Taxi TV, which the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission lets medallion cab owners display to offset the cost of installing mandatory technology to help passengers monitor their fares and pay by credit card.
Vugo Inc, the Minnesota-based plaintiff, sued New York City in 2015 over the ban, which it said unconstitutionally impeded its commercial speech rights.
Its ads differ from Taxi TV because passengers cannot turn them off or mute them. Vugo splits ad revenue with drivers.
A lawyer for Vugo had no immediate comment.
New York City's law department, through a spokesman, said it was pleased the court upheld the ad rules, ""which directly advance the city's strong interest in promoting passenger comfort for its residents.""
The decision reversed a February 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams in Manhattan.
She had said the ban lacked a ""sufficient fit"" with the city's goal of shielding passengers from annoying ads, saying the city could have required on-off switches or mute buttons, and that Vugo's ads were no more annoying than Taxi TV.
Katzmann, however, endorsed the city's effort to help residents and visitors enjoy ""peace and quiet"" from the rear seat, and said the city was entitled as a policy matter to exempt yellow cab owners who upgraded their technology.
""The prohibition is the most direct and perhaps the only effective approach to prevent the harms of intrusive and annoying advertisements,"" he wrote.
Vugo filed a similar lawsuit against Chicago in February 2017. That case was dismissed in December 2018, according to court records.

The case is Vugo Inc v City of New York, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-807.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former executives at American Realty Capital Properties Inc, including the onetime billionaire who built it, have reached more than $60 million in settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of charges they wrongfully extracted millions of dollars from the real estate investment trust.
The SEC said on Tuesday that AR Capital LLC, its majority owner Nicholas Schorsch, and its former chief financial officer Brian Block agreed to be collectively liable for more than $39 million of disgorgement and interest.
It also fined AR Capital $14 million, Schorsch $7 million and Block $750,000.
American Realty is now called Vereit Inc (N:VER) and under new management, following a 2014 accounting scandal.
The SEC said the defendants improperly inflated incentive fee calculations on two mergers, enabling them to obtain an extra 2.92 million American Realty operating partnership units as part of their pay.
It also said the defendants approved misleading asset purchase and sale agreements that enabled AR Capital to collect $7.27 million of ""unsupported charges"" related to the mergers.
The SEC accused Schorsch, who was American Realty's chief executive, of negligence, and Block of fraud over conduct from late 2012 to January 2014.
None of the defendants admitted or denied wrongdoing.
""Mr. Schorsch is very pleased to have resolved this matter,"" said Lorin Reisner, his lawyer.
A spokesman for AR Capital said the New York-based company was pleased to settle, and will continue to focus on ""creating value for the shareholders of the REITs that we manage.""
Block's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""REIT managers and their professionals have an obligation to tell the truth when making disclosures to shareholders about their compensation,"" Marc Berger, director of the SEC's New York office, said in a statement.
""AR Capital and its partners Schorsch and Block failed to do so and benefitted themselves greatly at the expense of shareholders,"" he added.
Block has been appealing his 2017 jury conviction and 18-month prison sentence for inflating American Realty's financial statements.
Schorsch, who was not criminally charged, was a pioneer in so-called nontraded REITs, which are considered less liquid than traditional REITs but can throw off higher dividends.

Forbes magazine said in December 2014 it no longer considered Schorsch a billionaire after American Realty's accounting problems surfaced, and the value of AR Capital fell.

So it was Tuesday as investors seemed to take a ""show me"" attitude before making decisions that could push a pricey market higher.
The major averages moved to new intraday highs soon after the open, but the gains faded as the day wore on. The Dow gave up the last of its gains at the close, finishing off 0.1%. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 0.5%. 
At the end of the day, the S&P 500 was still up 19.8% for this year, with the Dow up 17.2% and the Nasdaq enjoying a 23.9% gain.
The stagnation may be in part to traders being noplussed by earnings reports. But it also may be that they're considering taking money off the table after the market's big run since early June. The S&P 500 is up 9.5% since June 3, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell began signalling a rate cut might be coming.
Stocks jumped to new record highs last week in response to Powell's continued hints about lower rates.
Holding the market back Tuesday was weakness in energy, utility and healthcare shares.
Apache (NYSE:APA), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) were all lower, along with Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED), the big New York utility company. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) were lower. 
On the flip side, there was a group of winners from the oil-price drop: airlines like JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU),   Alaska Air   (NYSE:ALK) and United Airlines parent United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL).
 
What strength you could find was in industrials, materials and consumer discretionary shares, with gains in such stocks as Boeing (NYSE:BA), Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) and International Paper (NYSE:IP).
Among consumer stocks, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Hershey (NYSE:HSY) moved up. Costco's gain was tiny and came after hitting a new intraday high.
In oil, WTI futures slumped more than 3% to $57.62 a barrel on a comment from President Donald Trump suggesting Middle East tensions were easing. That raised fears that global oil supplies are more than ample. WTI fell to as low as $57.02. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 3.2% to $64.35. The price had fallen to as low as $63.82. 
As a result,   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) fell 1.5%;   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) dropped 0.8%. The Philadelphia Oil Service index dropped 1.5%. 
In addition, interest rates moved up, even as Fed Chief Powell repeated his vow to act as appropriate to support the economy. The 10-Year Treasury yield rose 1% to 2.113%. 
Financial stocks had decent performances. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose 1.1%, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) climbed 1.9% after second-quarter results beat analysts' estimates.
  Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) fell 3%, however, after officials warned expenses will be at the high range of projections and likely to run at the same level in 2020. Wall Street had been looking for costs to come down. 
Earnings reports due Wednesday include   IBM   (NYSE:IBM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday as quarterly results from banks added to concerns about lower interest rates dampening their profits, while comments from U.S. President Donald Trump on trade also dragged down Wall Street's major indexes.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) beat quarterly profit estimates but reported weaker net interest income, pointing to rising deposit costs. Those results followed  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) results on Monday, in which the bank reported a drop in its net interest margin.
JPMorgan shares erased early losses to end 1.1% higher. Wells Fargo shares, however, slipped 3.0% as the bank tempered its outlook for cutting costs.
""The expectation is the yield curve is going to remain flat, so you're going to still continue to see net interest margins compress, and that's going to hurt profitability,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of expected upside to Q3 and Q4.""
Stocks also moved lower after Trump said there was a long way to go with China on trade and threatened to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods.
The major indexes briefly pared losses after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the U.S. economy humming, but they later moved back to their previous levels.
""In a really quiet market, a headline like this has a magnified effect, so even if it's not something investors don't already know, it can move the market with ease,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee of Trump's comments.
Shares of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), which also announced results, rose 1.9%. Goldman Sachs is considered the least rate-sensitive of the three major banks that gave quarterly reports on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 23.53 points, or 0.09%, to 27,335.63, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 10.26 points, or 0.34%, to 3,004.04 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 35.39 points, or 0.43%, to 8,222.80.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) shares slipped 1.6% after the diversified healthcare company warned that competition from generic and copycat drugs could impact its third-quarter results. Johnson & Johnson was the second-biggest drag on the S&P 500.
Shares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc (O:JBHT) jumped 5.6%, the greatest percentage gain among S&P 500 stocks, after the trucking company posted strong quarterly performance in its second-largest unit DCS, which provides final-mile delivery.
The rise in J.B. Hunt shares helped lift the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) 1.8% and aided a 0.7% rise in industrials (SPLRCI).
In economic news, a better-than-expected June retail sales report pointed to strong consumer spending. The data did not change the expectations of a rate cut this month, though it lowered hopes of an aggressive cut.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 70 new lows.

The average management fee charged by new hedge funds globally in the first half of this year slipped to 1.2% from 1.6% in 2007, before the financial crisis battered the industry, according to a report from Eurekahedge. Fees linked to performance fell to about 14.5%, leaving funds overall well below the “two and 20” fee model once considered standard.
Years of poor performance have led many investors to seek out less expensive alternatives. Hedge funds reported the best first half in a decade this year as managers capitalized on the surge in stocks, but the 5.7% gain across the industry paled in comparison with the S&P 500 Index, which returned almost 19% in the period. And it came after hedge funds delivered their worst performance since 2011 last year.
While more than half of hedge-fund assets worldwide are managed by firms with a performance fee of at least 20%, managers who charge less have boosted their market share to 41.3% of industry assets in June from 16.3% at the end of 2008, according to the report published on Tuesday.
The “asymmetric” nature of performance fees -- hedge fund managers share in their clients’ profits, but not their losses -- have contributed to the pressure from investors to charge less, said Mohammad Hassan, head analyst of hedge fund research and indexation at Eurekahedge.
“The point that’s being made is that when the fund is performing well, they will pay,” he said."

The airline, grounded since April 17, was admitted to the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal on June 20.
Since then, the court has directed the bankruptcy resolution firm Grant Thornton, which liaises with creditors on behalf of the benkrupt firm, to complete the recovery process within 90 days instead of the 180 days that is typically awarded.
The bankers are also considering a request to provide interim funding of $10 million to pay some employee, legal, compliance, operational and maintenance costs, among other things, said one of the sources, who was present at the first meeting of the core committee of creditors (COCA).
The Expression of Interest window to gauge buyer interest in the airline will open next Saturday and candidates should be shortlisted by early August, according to one of the sources.
An SBI-led consortium of 26 banks has informed the resolution professionals that Jet Airways owes them about 85 billion rupees, added the banker. Apart from this, it also owes over 4 billion rupees to employees in unpaid salaries."
475,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 02:29PM ET</span>",JPMorgan beats profit estimates but shows signs of pressure,"By Elizabeth Dilts and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) reported a quarterly profit that beat estimates on Tuesday as higher interest income and consumer lending offset lower activity at its trading desks.
But even as the biggest U.S. bank reported record earnings, there were warning signs across Wall Street that the playing field is beginning to tilt against the financial industry.
Like  Citigroup  (N:C) on Monday and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) on Tuesday, JPMorgan reported its net interest margin declined to 2.49% from 2.57% a year ago, as deposit rates and the rate the bank pays for other borrowings both rose.
JPMorgan also lowered its outlook for net interest income to ""about $57.5 billion"" in 2019 from the $58 billion to $60 billion projection executives gave in February.
While Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon maintained a bullish outlook about the U.S. economy as a whole, he conceded that uncertainties relating to global trade, which tend to impact trading volumes, were a drag.
""The consumer in the United States is doing fine,"" Dimon said on a conference call. ""Business sentiment is a little bit worse, mostly driven by the trade war. But...I wouldn't get too pessimistic.""
Average loans rose 2%, driven largely by JPMorgan's consumer bank, Chase, which reported credit card loans were up 2% and credit card sales surged 11%. The cost of handling that credit was flat.
Overall income from the consumer and community banking, JPMorgan's largest business, rose 22% to $4.17 billion, which offset declines across other businesses.
Total net interest income, the difference between what banks pay on deposits and earn on loans, rose 7% to $14.40 billion.
Net income climbed 16% to $9.65 billion as a tax gain and higher net interest income overshadowed lower activity on its trading desks. Excluding the tax gain, it earned $2.59 per share. Net revenue rose 4% to $29.57 billion.
Return on tangible common equity, a key profit measure for how well it uses shareholder money, rose to 20%, up from 19% in the first quarter and higher than the bank’s 17% target.
Analysts were expecting earnings of $2.50 per share on revenue of $28.90 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

481,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 12:29PM ET</span>",Big banks beat profit expectations but warning signs grow,"By Elizabeth Dilts, Imani Moise and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) - Three big U.S. banks reported strong earnings on Tuesday even as warning signs emerged that the playing field is beginning to tilt against the financial industry.
While the biggest risk ahead is that lower interest rates will pressure banks' bottom lines in the coming months, the squeeze is already beginning.
JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co both reported drops in net interest margins as they paid more for deposits. JPMorgan, the nation's biggest bank, lowered its outlook for net interest income to ""about $57.5 billion"" in 2019 from the $58-plus billion it estimated in February.
On Monday, Citigroup similarly reported a decline in net interest margin.
Most bank stocks fell initially in early trading on Tuesday, before some recovered. In midday trading, shares of JPMorgan were up 0.4%. Goldman Sachs Group Inc - the least rate-sensitive of the three banks was up 0.6%, with Wells Fargo down 2.4%.
""We're not as dynamically correlated to rate changes,"" Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr told analysts, noting the bank holds fewer deposits ""than the big commercial banks.""
Trading volumes have dropped at large U.S. banks as a tit-for-tat tariff war between Beijing and Washington has kept investors on edge. A flattening of the Treasury yield curve and rising bets for a U.S. interest rate cut have also challenged banks' ability to boost revenues.
Investors worry that if the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in July, it could pressure margins at banks, which have benefited recently from higher rates. JPMorgan now expects as many as three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said.
STRONG CONSUMER BUSINESS
There was good news in the earnings reports as well. The consumer business remained buoyant, offsetting weakness in other areas. At JPMorgan Chase, average loans increased 2% on the back of an 8% rise in credit-card loans. Debit and credit card purchase volumes each rose 6% at Wells Fargo showing consumers are still feeling confident and spending more.
And even as investors have been concerned over the impact of the U.S.-China trade spat on global growth, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon remained bullish about the economy. The bank's performance is often considered a bellwether for the health of the U.S. economy.
""We continue to see positive momentum with the U.S. consumer – healthy confidence levels, solid job creation and rising wages – which are reflected in our Consumer & Community Banking results,"" Dimon said in a statement.
JPMorgan's net income surged 16% https://www.reuters.com/article/jpmorgan-results/jpmorgan-profit-rises-16-on-tax-gain-idUSL4N24H2J1 to $9.65 billion as a tax gain and higher net interest income overshadowed lower activity on its trading desks. Excluding that tax gain, it earned $2.59 per share. Net revenue rose 4% to $29.57 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of $2.51 per share and revenue of $28.90 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The bank’s return on tangible common equity, a key profit measure for how well it uses shareholder money, rose to 20%, up from 19% in the first quarter and above the bank’s 17% target.
At Wells Fargo, meanwhile, net income applicable to common stock rose to $5.85 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-results/wells-fargo-posts-higher-profit-on-cost-controls-rise-in-loans-idUSKCN1UB1DP, or $1.30 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $4.79 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a profit of $1.15 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Wells Fargo has been leaning on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line amid sluggish revenue in the wake of sales-practice scandals that spread to each of its primary business segments and claimed two chief executives.
Wells Fargo executives warned on a conference call with analysts that expenses would come in at the upper end of the bank's previously-guided target range.
Wells Fargo is also being squeezed by the changing interest-rate environment. Its net interest margin dropped 11 basis points to 2.82% in the most recent quarter. The bank reported non-interest expense of $13.4 billion, down $533 million from a year earlier, while total loans rose 0.6% to $949.88 billion.
BRIGHT SPOT
Goldman Sachs Group Inc's fixed-income business suffered another disappointing quarter with net revenues falling by 13%, impacted by interest rate products and currencies.
Equity trading was a bright spot https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-results/goldman-sachs-profit-beats-estimates-boosted-by-strong-equities-trading-idUSKCN1UB1AU for Goldman, however, as revenue increased by 6%, its second highest quarterly performance in four years. Goldman said clients were more active than the same period a year ago. That helped it achieve earnings which were ahead of market forecasts.
On a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said the bank was picking up market share in equities. Rival Deutsche Bank last week announced plans to close its equities trading business.
However, revenue fell at three of its four major businesses, with the biggest declines in trading and investment management.
Institutional client revenue, which includes trading, slipped 3%, while investment banking revenue was down 9%. However, revenue from the bank's investing and lending business rose 16%, its highest quarterly performance in eight years.
The bank's net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 6% to $2.20 billion in the quarter. Earnings per share fell to $5.81 from $5.98 a year earlier. Total net revenue fell 2% to $9.46 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of $4.89 per share on revenue of $8.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

484,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Wall Street finds blockchain hard to tame after early euphoria,"By Anna Irrera and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two years ago Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) announced a new blockchain system they said would make payments of private securities transactions more efficient. Nasdaq Chief Executive Adena Friedman called it ""a milestone in the global financial sector.""
But the companies did not move forward with the project, a person familiar with it said, because while it worked in testing, the cost to fully adopt it outweighed the benefits. 
Blockchain, the person added, ""is a shiny mirage"" and its wide-scale adoption may still ""take a while."" 
In a joint statement, the companies said the pilot was successful and they were ""happy to partner"" on other initiatives. Both companies are also working on other projects.
Companies, including banks, large retailers and technology vendors, are investing billions of dollars to find uses for blockchain, a digital ledger used by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Just last month,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) revealed plans for a virtual currency and a blockchain-based payment system. 
But a review of 33 projects involving large companies announced over the past four years and interviews with more than a dozen executives involved with them show the technology has yet to deliver on its promise. 
At least a dozen of these projects, which involve major banks, exchanges and technology firms, have not gone beyond the testing phase, the review shows. Those that have made it past that stage are yet to see extensive usage. 
Regulatory hurdles have often slowed down implementation, some executives said. Scrutiny is likely to only increase after Facebook's plans drew global backlash from regulators and politicians. (For a sample of these projects, click https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-finance-factbox/factbox-blockchain-projects-a-status-update-idUSKCN1UB0ZC)
The euphoria that surrounded the early days of Wall Street's interest in blockchain is giving way to pragmatism, as companies realize that it will likely take years before it takes off in a substantial way. 
""This is a transformation of the market. It isn't a big bang,"" said Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investments for UBS AG's (S:UBSG) investment bank.
It could take three-to-seven years before major projects have significant impact, he said.
One UBS-backed project, a digital cash system for financial transactions called Utility Settlement Coin, is expected to be commercialized next year after more than five years of work, said Rhomaios Ram, head of a separate entity created for the project. 
But Ram said that for the system to be transformational, it will require other market processes to move to blockchain-based systems as well.
""There is a recognition now that it is a journey, rather than something with a short time frame,"" Ram said.
BLOCKCHAIN'S PROMISE
Blockchain was created about a decade ago as a way to keep track of bitcoin transactions. As cryptocurrencies became more mainstream following a 2013 rally and crash in bitcoin's price, consultants, analysts and other proponents said their underlying technology could be transformational, especially for the financial industry. 
It could help trades settle instantly, accelerate international payments and remove the need for costly intermediaries, potentially saving the industry tens of billions of dollars, they said.
Investment followed. Last year the capital markets and banking sectors allocated $1.7 billion on blockchain initiatives, up 70% from 2016, according to estimates by research and advisory firm Greenwich Associates. 
By 2022, blockchain investment across industries is expected to reach $12.4 billion, according to research firm IDC. (For a graphic about blockchain in capital markets, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2JxuQgl)
Some big companies have rushed in. International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) has around 1,500 people working on the new technology for use in several different sectors. In an ad released during the Academy Awards this year it called for the use of blockchain ""to help reduce poverty"".
A system  IBM  was developing along with the  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc (L:LSE) to issue private shares did not move beyond testing, the companies said. But a trade finance platform developed by numerous banks along with IBM has been commercialized.
""I certainly think there has been a share of hype associated with blockchain,"" said Marie Wieck, a general manager at IBM.
BUSINESS BENEFITS
But Wieck and other industry executives said they remain bullish about the prospect of the technology and their companies continue to invest in it. ""To me the business benefits of blockchain are clear,"" Wieck said.
John Whelan,  Banco Santander  SA's (MC:SAN) head of digital investment banking, said blockchain projects need to work on three areas at the same time: technology, demand and compliance.
""Those of us who were involved in blockchain early on maybe did not appreciate the extent to which the three parts have to move together,"" Whelan said. Santander is involved in numerous blockchain projects, including the Utility Settlement Coin.
Around the time the project with Citi was announced in 2017, Nasdaq also started testing a proxy voting system in Estonia that automates a manual and lengthy process. 
Lars Ottersgard, Nasdaq's head of market technology, said demand has been limited for the product.
""To be honest, the value differentiation using blockchain from using traditional technology has not been obvious,"" he said.
A Nasdaq spokesman said the exchange operator has since developed the system further with South Africa's central securities depository, which plans to launch it later this year.

The strike affected about a third of the approximately 400 stores that Walmart Inc (N:WMT) operates in Chile.
""Walmart Chile and Lider's Inter-Company Union sealed a collective agreement that was satisfactory to both parties. The proposal presented by Walmart Chile covers the main points raised by the Union,"" the company said late Monday.
The agreement includes salary increases, bonuses, training and other benefits, Walmart Chile said, though exact numbers were not disclosed.
Union leaders had said the key sticking point was a salary increase. As automation in stores has increasingly replaced workers, workers say they are forced to juggle more tasks among fewer employees."
486,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs profit beats estimates, boosted by strong equities trading","By Sweta Singh and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as the Wall Street investment bank benefited from increased stock trading.
The bank said equities trading revenue increased by 6 percent from a year ago to $2 billion, the second highest in four years. Goldman also said it benefited from higher revenues in client execution including an improved performance in cash products and derivatives.
Shares of the bank were up 1.8 percent in morning trading.
However, Goldman's fixed income business suffered another disappointing quarter with net revenue falling by 13 percent. The bank said that reflected significantly lower net revenue from interest rate products and currencies.
Goldman is shifting the focus of its business model away from trading to a more stable, consumer-oriented revenue stream. Despite the better-than-expected performance, revenue still fell at three of its four major businesses, with the biggest declines in trading and investment management.
Rising geopolitical uncertainties and the impact of future interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve present challenges to efforts by Goldman and its rivals to increase revenue.
Institutional client revenue, which includes trading, slipped 3%, while investment banking revenue was down 9%. However, revenue from the bank's investing and lending business rose 16%, its highest quarterly performance in eight years.
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said Goldman had delivered a ""pretty good quarter"" with most business lines performing ""a little better than expected.""
""Looking ahead, we expect management to continue to invest in new initiatives and businesses and return plenty of capital,"" Schorr said.
Chief Executive David Solomon, who was promoted to the role in October last year, is undertaking a strategic review of the business and plans to announce the results early next year.
The bank has already made moves to further develop its consumer division, by expanding online bank Marcus and launching a credit card with Apple Inc (O:AAPL). It also announced plans in May to acquire United Capital, a boutique wealth management firm. Solomon said on an analyst call discussing earnings that the United deal would close Tuesday.
Goldman is aiming to generate $5 billion in new revenue by 2020.
While overall revenue slipped in the quarter, lower compensation expenses provided some relief. Total operating expenses were nearly flat at $6.12 billion.
The bank's net earnings applicable to common shareholders in the second quarter fell 6% to $2.20 billion. Earnings per share fell to $5.81 from $5.98 a year earlier.
Total net revenue fell 2% to $9.46 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $4.89 per share and revenue of $8.83 billion, according to IBES estimate from Refinitiv.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as higher interest income and buoyant consumer lending offset lower activity at its trading desks. Also on Tuesday, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported higher quarterly profit despite flat revenue as the bank benefited from lower costs. Top Goldman rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday."

(Reuters) - CQS, the London-based global multi-strategy credit-focused asset management firm with $17.7 billion in assets, is looking to grow its presence in the United States, Xavier Rolet, who took over the chief executive officer role from its founder in January, said.
""The U.S. has 55% of the world’s financial assets and is the largest owner of financial assets globally,"" Rolet, who succeeded billionaire investor Michael Hintze, said in a recent sitdown interview.
Less than 25% of CQS' assets under management is exposed to the United States. Rolet said CQS plans to continue to invest in the United States as a source of global investment returns and in providing client-focused asset-allocation strategies.
Founded in 1999, CQS has offices in London, New York, Hong Kong and Sydney. The asset manager's investors include pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations and private banks.
The firm’s flagship $3.2 billion Directional Opportunities Fund, managed by Hintze, has gained 7.3% this year as of June 19, while the firm’s ABS Fund has gained 4.27% for the same period.
The Directional Opportunities fund has annualized returns of 14.3% since its inception in August 2005, while the firm's ABS Fund has annualized returns of 16.61% since its inception in October 2006. The $7 billion CQS Multi-Asset Credit Fund is up 3.83% so far this year as of June 19.
Rolet said the firm is taking advantage of any volatility in the credit markets. ""We take a relative value approach across geographies and sectors,"" he said. ""Our multi-asset approach allows us to actively manage and take advantage of dispersion, and there is growing dispersion globally.
""Our favorite strategies for the second half are short-duration structured credit, European mid-market special situations/distressed, relative value credit and Significant Risk Transfer trades,"" he added.
Rolet said the insatiable appetite for yield and income against the backdrop of an expected interest-rate cut later this month by the Federal Reserve played a factor in targeting U.S. markets.
""We look at our business strategically and with a strong client focus,"" he said. ""Sure, rates do weigh on short-term positioning, as do other factors, but bespoke solutions are designed to be flexible enough to maximize superior returns over the long-term.""
Rolet, a former equities trader at Lehman Brothers, stepped down as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange in 2017 after almost a decade, taking the business beyond its roots in stock trading and helped turn it into a post-trade and information powerhouse."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain leaving the European Union midweek without a deal would compound market disruption as banks would not have enough time to make technology changes, a European banking industry body said on Tuesday.
Brexit had been due to take place late on Friday, March 29, and then at the same time on Friday, April 12, both of which gave banks a full weekend to get their systems ready if there is a no-deal exit.
The latest deadline is midnight on Thursday, Oct. 31, with the markets open the next day in Britain and some EU states.
""This will give rise to additional operational challenges, in particular mid-week code release for new reporting as firms will not have a weekend in which to switch over systems,"" the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) said in a paper on market preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
Global trading banks may have to report trades to a different regulator, depending on where they are based. Such a switch would normally require a full weekend to ensure proper testing.
Additional challenges may arise from Nov. 1 being a public holiday in many but not all EU countries, meaning not all regulators may be in place on that day, AFME said.
Sterling plunged to a six-month low against the euro on Tuesday and approached two-year lows against the dollar, as the two candidates to lead Britain's ruling Conservative Party vied for the hardest Brexit stance to win over its members.
Markets see their positions as sharply raising the risk of Britain leaving the European Union on Oct. 31 without any transitional trading agreements in place.
The Bank of England said last week that in the absence of further actions by EU authorities, some disruption to cross-border financial services is possible from a no-deal departure.
AFME also called on the EU to extend the temporary market access it has granted for LCH (L:LSE) and other clearing houses in London.
Access under a no-deal Brexit would end on March 30, 2020, and unless there is an extension, clearers may have to force EU customers in December to begin moving derivatives positions from Britain ahead of the March expiry date, AFME said."

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Germany's Ursula von der Leyen, seeking to become the first female head of the European Commission, has said she wants U.S. tech giants to pay ""fair taxes"" in the EU instead of gaming the different systems across the bloc to cut their bills.
If she should win the European Parliament's backing for the job, and implement the policy, it could further strain ties between the European Union and the United States, already troubled by differences over trade, antitrust and politics.
""I will stand for fair taxes – whether for brick and mortar industries or digital businesses. When the tech giants are making huge profits in Europe, this is fine because we are an open market and we like competition,"" von der Leyen told the parliament on Tuesday before a confirmation vote at 1600 GMT.
""But if they are making these profits by benefiting from our education system, our skilled workers, our infrastructure and our social security ... it is not acceptable that they make profits, but they are barely paying any taxes because they play our tax system. If they want to benefit, they have to share the burden.""
The move could hit companies such as Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB).
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager kicked off the quest for fairer taxes nearly five years ago by ordering Luxembourg, Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Britain and Belgium to recover back taxes from companies ranging from Apple (O:AAPL) to Starbucks (O:SBUX) and ENGIE (PA:ENGIE) because of illegal sweetheart deals.
France has taken the fight further and last week gave final approval to a 3% tax on the revenue of big technology firms that provide digital services in France.
That prompted President Donald Trump to order an investigation into the tax, which could lead to the United States imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions. 
Austria, Britain, Spain and Italy have also announced plans for their own digital taxes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14 points or 0.1% by 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT), while the S&P 500 was down half a point or 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell 3 points or 0.1%. 
JP Morgan reported better-than-expected earnings, but its interest margin slipped, just a day after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) also reported a similar fall. The results caused concerns that lower interest rates are hurting profits on lending. That's especially worrying, given that the banks' U.S. lending operations, notably to consumers, have performed better than their markets-based businesses.
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the end of the month. JPMorgan chief financial officer Marianne Lake told analysts that the bank's new forecasts, which included a cut in expectations for net interest income, are based on assumptions of three rate cuts this year.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) inched down 0.2%, while Goldman Sachs rose 2.3% after its results were better than expected, despite a 6% fall in quarterly profit. Wells Fargo slipped 0.7% - also on lending margin concerns - even though earnings topped forecasts.

More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 passenger planes were taken out of service after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, within 5 months, killed 346 passengers.
Following are airlines that have warned about potential cost and end-date of grounding:
TUI Airways (DE:TUIGn)
TUI expects its 2019 underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) to fall by 17%, having previously expected the figure to be in line with the 1.18 billion euros ($1.32 billion)generated in 2018.
It added that EBITA could even fall as much as 26% in 2019 if the planes remained grounded beyond the middle of July
RYANAIR (I:RYA)
Ryanair said on Tuesday it was expecting the 737 MAX to return to service before the end of the year, with the first of new planes it has ordered to be delivered in January and February of 2020.
Europe's largest budget airline has cut its growth forecasts for next summer, now expecting to carry 3% more passengers, down from its previous 7% forecast. It blamed possible further delays in deliveries of Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX planes for the revisions.
Ryanair said it would close routes and bases in November to adjust for the lower growth.
NORWEGIAN AIR SHUTTLE (OL:NWC)
Norwegian said in its second-quarter release that it expected its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to return to service in October. The grounding reduced the second quarter profit by around 400 million Norwegian crowns ($46.8 million), the airline said.
UNITED AIRLINES (O:UAL)
United Airlines said its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX would stay of its flight schedule until Nov.3, after Boeing said last month it would take at least until September to fix fresh flaws in the grounded planes discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration.
AMERICAN AIRLINES (O:AAL)
American Airlines said on Sunday it was extending cancellations of around 115 daily flights until Nov. 2 because of the continued grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes.
The airline cut its annual profit forecast in April, citing an estimated $350 million hit from the MAX groundings.
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES (N:LUV)
Southwest Airlines said on July 1 it expected to keep its Boeing 737 MAX jets off the flying schedule beyond the current Oct.1 re-entry date.
On March 27, the largest global operator of the MAX planes, cut its 2019 financial outlook after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes out of service.
TURKISH AIRLINES (IS:THYAO)
Turkish Airlines said on June 25 that its Boeing 737 MAX planes would be grounded until further notice, resulting in several flight cancellations throughout the summer.
AIR CANADA (TO:AC)
 Air Canada  suspended its 2019 financial forecasts on March 15, saying it continued to adapt a contingency plan to address the uncertainty surrounding the planes.
In May, the airline reported a surprise first-quarter profit despite the the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets. It reports second-quarter results on July 31.
WESTJET (TO:WJA)
On March 18 The Canadian carrier suspended its 2019 financial projections following the groundings.
In May, the airline said it expected its 13 MAX planes to return to service in the third quarter."
493,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Wall Street finds blockchain hard to tame after early euphoria,"By Anna Irrera and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two years ago Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) announced a new blockchain system they said would make payments of private securities transactions more efficient. Nasdaq Chief Executive Adena Friedman called it ""a milestone in the global financial sector.""
But the companies did not move forward with the project, a person familiar with it said, because while it worked in testing, the cost to fully adopt it outweighed the benefits. 
Blockchain, the person added, ""is a shiny mirage"" and its wide-scale adoption may still ""take a while."" 
In a joint statement, the companies said the pilot was successful and they were ""happy to partner"" on other initiatives. Both companies are also working on other projects.
Companies, including banks, large retailers and technology vendors, are investing billions of dollars to find uses for blockchain, a digital ledger used by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Just last month,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) revealed plans for a virtual currency and a blockchain-based payment system. 
But a review of 33 projects involving large companies announced over the past four years and interviews with more than a dozen executives involved with them show the technology has yet to deliver on its promise. 
At least a dozen of these projects, which involve major banks, exchanges and technology firms, have not gone beyond the testing phase, the review shows. Those that have made it past that stage are yet to see extensive usage. 
Regulatory hurdles have often slowed down implementation, some executives said. Scrutiny is likely to only increase after Facebook's plans drew global backlash from regulators and politicians. (For a sample of these projects, click https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-finance-factbox/factbox-blockchain-projects-a-status-update-idUSKCN1UB0ZC)
The euphoria that surrounded the early days of Wall Street's interest in blockchain is giving way to pragmatism, as companies realize that it will likely take years before it takes off in a substantial way. 
""This is a transformation of the market. It isn't a big bang,"" said Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investments for UBS AG's (S:UBSG) investment bank.
It could take three-to-seven years before major projects have significant impact, he said.
One UBS-backed project, a digital cash system for financial transactions called Utility Settlement Coin, is expected to be commercialized next year after more than five years of work, said Rhomaios Ram, head of a separate entity created for the project. 
But Ram said that for the system to be transformational, it will require other market processes to move to blockchain-based systems as well.
""There is a recognition now that it is a journey, rather than something with a short time frame,"" Ram said.
BLOCKCHAIN'S PROMISE
Blockchain was created about a decade ago as a way to keep track of bitcoin transactions. As cryptocurrencies became more mainstream following a 2013 rally and crash in bitcoin's price, consultants, analysts and other proponents said their underlying technology could be transformational, especially for the financial industry. 
It could help trades settle instantly, accelerate international payments and remove the need for costly intermediaries, potentially saving the industry tens of billions of dollars, they said.
Investment followed. Last year the capital markets and banking sectors allocated $1.7 billion on blockchain initiatives, up 70% from 2016, according to estimates by research and advisory firm Greenwich Associates. 
By 2022, blockchain investment across industries is expected to reach $12.4 billion, according to research firm IDC. (For a graphic about blockchain in capital markets, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2JxuQgl)
Some big companies have rushed in. International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) has around 1,500 people working on the new technology for use in several different sectors. In an ad released during the Academy Awards this year it called for the use of blockchain ""to help reduce poverty"".
A system  IBM  was developing along with the  London Stock Exchange  Group Plc (L:LSE) to issue private shares did not move beyond testing, the companies said. But a trade finance platform developed by numerous banks along with IBM has been commercialized.
""I certainly think there has been a share of hype associated with blockchain,"" said Marie Wieck, a general manager at IBM.
BUSINESS BENEFITS
But Wieck and other industry executives said they remain bullish about the prospect of the technology and their companies continue to invest in it. ""To me the business benefits of blockchain are clear,"" Wieck said.
John Whelan,  Banco Santander  SA's (MC:SAN) head of digital investment banking, said blockchain projects need to work on three areas at the same time: technology, demand and compliance.
""Those of us who were involved in blockchain early on maybe did not appreciate the extent to which the three parts have to move together,"" Whelan said. Santander is involved in numerous blockchain projects, including the Utility Settlement Coin.
Around the time the project with Citi was announced in 2017, Nasdaq also started testing a proxy voting system in Estonia that automates a manual and lengthy process. 
Lars Ottersgard, Nasdaq's head of market technology, said demand has been limited for the product.
""To be honest, the value differentiation using blockchain from using traditional technology has not been obvious,"" he said.
A Nasdaq spokesman said the exchange operator has since developed the system further with South Africa's central securities depository, which plans to launch it later this year.

France has taken the fight further and last week gave final approval to a 3% tax on the revenue of big technology firms that provide digital services in France.
That prompted President Donald Trump to order an investigation into the tax, which could lead to the United States imposing new tariffs or other trade restrictions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14 points or 0.1% by 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT), while the S&P 500 was down half a point or 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite fell 3 points or 0.1%. 
JP Morgan reported better-than-expected earnings, but its interest margin slipped, just a day after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) also reported a similar fall. The results caused concerns that lower interest rates are hurting profits on lending. That's especially worrying, given that the banks' U.S. lending operations, notably to consumers, have performed better than their markets-based businesses.
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the end of the month. JPMorgan chief financial officer Marianne Lake told analysts that the bank's new forecasts, which included a cut in expectations for net interest income, are based on assumptions of three rate cuts this year.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) inched down 0.2%, while Goldman Sachs rose 2.3% after its results were better than expected, despite a 6% fall in quarterly profit. Wells Fargo slipped 0.7% - also on lending margin concerns - even though earnings topped forecasts.

More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 passenger planes were taken out of service after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, within 5 months, killed 346 passengers.
Following are airlines that have warned about potential cost and end-date of grounding:
TUI Airways (DE:TUIGn)
TUI expects its 2019 underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) to fall by 17%, having previously expected the figure to be in line with the 1.18 billion euros ($1.32 billion)generated in 2018.
It added that EBITA could even fall as much as 26% in 2019 if the planes remained grounded beyond the middle of July
RYANAIR (I:RYA)
Ryanair said on Tuesday it was expecting the 737 MAX to return to service before the end of the year, with the first of new planes it has ordered to be delivered in January and February of 2020.
Europe's largest budget airline has cut its growth forecasts for next summer, now expecting to carry 3% more passengers, down from its previous 7% forecast. It blamed possible further delays in deliveries of Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX planes for the revisions.
Ryanair said it would close routes and bases in November to adjust for the lower growth.
NORWEGIAN AIR SHUTTLE (OL:NWC)
Norwegian said in its second-quarter release that it expected its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to return to service in October. The grounding reduced the second quarter profit by around 400 million Norwegian crowns ($46.8 million), the airline said.
UNITED AIRLINES (O:UAL)
United Airlines said its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX would stay of its flight schedule until Nov.3, after Boeing said last month it would take at least until September to fix fresh flaws in the grounded planes discovered by the Federal Aviation Administration.
AMERICAN AIRLINES (O:AAL)
American Airlines said on Sunday it was extending cancellations of around 115 daily flights until Nov. 2 because of the continued grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes.
The airline cut its annual profit forecast in April, citing an estimated $350 million hit from the MAX groundings.
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES (N:LUV)
Southwest Airlines said on July 1 it expected to keep its Boeing 737 MAX jets off the flying schedule beyond the current Oct.1 re-entry date.
On March 27, the largest global operator of the MAX planes, cut its 2019 financial outlook after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes out of service.
TURKISH AIRLINES (IS:THYAO)
Turkish Airlines said on June 25 that its Boeing 737 MAX planes would be grounded until further notice, resulting in several flight cancellations throughout the summer.
AIR CANADA (TO:AC)
 Air Canada  suspended its 2019 financial forecasts on March 15, saying it continued to adapt a contingency plan to address the uncertainty surrounding the planes.
In May, the airline reported a surprise first-quarter profit despite the the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets. It reports second-quarter results on July 31.

504,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",Out of the shadows: Australia's finance regulator told to be more 'forceful',"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prudential regulator should become less ""discreet""
and be given more power, including the ability to veto corporate boardroom hires, a government report said, in a sign oversight bodies are being dragged into a banking sector clean-up.
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) may need more resources and an expanded armory of penalties - criminal and civil - so it can have ""greater flexibility when enforcing the law"", the independent report said.
The ""capability review"" was ordered by the government after a special inquiry into finance sector misconduct, which had sparked some criticism that regulators were asleep at the wheel.
Though the ""Royal Commission"" inquiry ultimately left the structure of the banking industry intact, it cost several top bankers their jobs amid allegations of rampant fee-gouging and brought intense scrutiny to the regulatory system that enabled it.
""APRA has a strong preference to do things behind the scenes with regulated entities,"" said the report, published on Tuesday, and ""this limits its impact and authority.
Though there were sometimes ""good reasons for a prudential regulator to be discreet ... APRA needs to shift the dial towards a more strategic and forceful use of communication to ensure that it maximizes its impact with regulated entities"", the report added.
APRA, formed in 1998 to oversee the money management of banks, insurers, and pension funds, has largely restricted its mandate to regulating the amounts of cash that industry players keep in reserve to ensure they can meet their obligations.
The regulator must now expand its remit to include non-financial risks like governance, culture and accountability in the 510 companies, with a combined A$6.5 trillion ($4.6 trillion) in assets, that it supervises, the report said.
""There is no doubt that in matters of traditional financial risk APRA is an impressive and forceful regulator but APRA's tolerance for operating beyond quantifiable financial risks has been low,"" the report said.
APRA appeared unwilling to challenge itself, slow to respond and tentative in addressing issues that do not entail traditional financial risks, which limited its ability to deliver on its mandate and adapt to new challenges, the report added.
APRA said it backed the report, which it said highlighted ""the increasingly complex industry dynamics in which APRA operates and that the expectations of its role and mandate have increased"".
The regulator added that four of the 19 recommendations directed to it - including improving its technology risk capability and running ongoing self-assessments of banks - would require more funding.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in an email that the federal government had given APRA another A$150 million in the most recent budget and passed laws to give the regulator greater power.
The government would act on the report's five recommendations directed at it, including giving APRA the power to veto hiring of company directors and senior executives, Frydenberg said.
The government would also review APRA's available penalties, Frydenberg said, after the report said it was ""important to ensure that penalties are effective deterrents and in step with community expectations""."

509,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Bond Trading, Revenue Outlook Suffer From Fed Reversal","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). was hit by the Federal Reserve’s about-face on interest rates in the second quarter, posting its fourth-straight decline in fixed-income trading revenue and warning that lending income will fall in the second half.
The largest U.S. bank on Tuesday reported a drop in bond trading and cut its full-year outlook for net interest income -- revenue from customers’ loan payments minus what the bank pays depositors -- by $500 million. NII accounted for about half the New York-based company’s revenue last year.
Less revenue from loans is a problem for JPMorgan, which has been leaning on its traditional lending business to weather four back-to-back quarters of declining revenue from trading stocks and bonds. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week opened the door to a July cut in interest rates, stressing a cooling global economy and trade friction. It’s a reversal from the start of the year, when investors were betting the Fed would boost interest rates.
JPMorgan notched the highest profit in U.S. banking history in 2018 with $32.5 billion, spurred in part by rising interest rates and the Trump administration’s corporate tax cuts. The bank now sees net interest income at $57.5 billion this year after saying in April it could increase to more than $58 billion.
Shares of the company, which climbed 17% this year through Monday, fell 1.5% at 7:10 a.m. in early New York trading.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). on Monday said net interest revenue increased 2% in the second quarter, which was roughly in line with analysts’ average estimate. The bank left its full-year growth outlook for the figure unchanged at 4%.
JPMorgan’s revenue from stock and bond trading slipped 6% in the second quarter, excluding a one-time gain related to the initial public offering of Tradeweb Markets Inc. Analysts had expected a 5% drop. Investment-banking fees fell 9% to $1.8 billion.
Revenue from the corporate and investment bank slipped 3% from last year’s record to $9.6 billion as market uncertainty drove investors to the sidelines and damped corporate sentiment.
Non-interest expense rose by 2% to $16.3 in the quarter, less than the average analysts’ estimate of $16.4 billion. The bank said in February adjusted expenses for the full-year would rise to less than $66 billion from about $63 billion last year.
JPMorgan has been ramping up spending as it expands its consumer bank into new states for the first time in more than a decade, uses technology to transform how its corporate and investment bank does business and constructs a new headquarters in New York."
510,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>","GSK, Vodafone Among Firms Fighting EU Clawback Order","(Bloomberg) -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc,  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc and BT Group (LON:BT) Plc are among more than a dozen companies that have challenged a European Union order forcing the U.K. to claw back millions in tax breaks, adding to the list of potential EU flash points ahead of Brexit.
Glaxo and Vodafone filed separate challenges with the EU General Court in Luxembourg on July 5, a day after BT. As many as 14 companies filed similar appeals, according to the tribunal’s website. The U.K. last month also sued the European Commission, asking the EU’s second-highest court to annul the regulator’s April order.
EU Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in April said an investigation had found some corporations in the U.K. had received an improper benefit from British anti-tax avoidance rules. Amid the country’s efforts to exit the EU, Vestager signed off on a decision to order it to recoup unfair tax subsidies.
Vodafone said it challenged the EU decision. According to its last financial statement, Vodafone said “that the Group’s Luxembourg financing activities are properly established and operate in accordance with EU and local law.”
Vestager has made the fight a linchpin of her tenure as EU competition commissioner, irritating chief executive officers and politicians along the way. The decision is one of a series of cases involving the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and governments over tax deals that allow them to attract big business.
At least 56 companies, including  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc, Pearson Plc and  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) Plc, had come forward since the EU probe started in 2017. They estimated their tax liabilities at about 1.35 billion pounds ($1.7 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg Tax. The final bills may now be much lower because the EU didn’t outlaw the entire program.
The EU court challenge marks the start of at least two years of legal quarreling in the tribunals in Luxembourg -- courts that the U.K. was keen to sever ties with through Brexit -- currently scheduled for Oct. 31. Any ruling at the lower court could be appealed to the EU’s Court of Justice, which would add another two years of litigation.
The commission’s April decision said the U.K. exemption was partly justified. It didn’t specify which firms unduly benefited from it.
The British corporate financing exemption, introduced in 2013, allowed companies to pay little or no tax on income from interest payments on loans received from a foreign unit through an offshore subsidiary. The EU regulator said that it considered the exemption illegal when the financing income stemmed from U.K. activities.
The exemption was modified at the end of last year in a way that no longer raises concerns, the EU has said. The commission declined to comment on the U.K. court challenge.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a promotion for U.S. shoppers on Prime Day, the 48-hour marketing blitz that started Monday: Earn $10 of credit if you let Amazon track the websites you visit.
The deal is for new installations of the Amazon Assistant, a comparison-shopping tool that customers can add to their web browsers. It fetches Amazon's price for products that users see on Walmart (NYSE:WMT).com,  Target  (NYSE:TGT).com and elsewhere.
In order to work, the assistant needs access to users' web activity, including the links and some page content they view. The catch, as Amazon explains in the fine print, is the company can use this data to improve its general marketing, products and services, unrelated to the shopping assistant.
The terms underscore the power consumers routinely give to Amazon and other big technology companies when using their free services. In this case, Amazon gains potential insight into how it should tailor marketing and how it could stamp out the retail competition.
""This data is often used for training machine learning models to do better ad targeting,"" said Bennett Cyphers, a technologist at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""But in the U.S., there aren't really restrictions on what you can do with this kind of data.""
Amazon already has more than 7 million customers using its assistant via Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, according to data published by those web browsers. Other companies offer similar shopping tools.
While another technology known as tracking pixels shows Amazon information from visitors to roughly 15 percent of the top 10,000 websites, the assistant lets Amazon follow a smaller set of users from page to page, Cyphers said.
Amazon's combination of tools still pales in comparison to data collection by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, which has tracking pixels on most web pages.
Amazon did not discuss how it uses the data it gathers via the assistant for any unrelated purposes, but a job listing for an affiliated team known as Browser Integration Technologies says the group's influence ""spans across advertising and marketing, pricing and selection.""
""Customer trust is paramount to Amazon, and we take customer privacy very seriously,"" a company spokeswoman said, noting compliance with the assistant's privacy policy, which says data collection is for websites that users visit ""where we may have relevant product or service recommendations.""
The policy also notes that customers can disable certain features of the assistant, and that Amazon only links browsing data to an individual's account when the assistant is in active use.
U.S. lawmakers have recently increased their scrutiny of Silicon Valley's data collection practices. A bill introduced in the Senate last month proposed requiring that big platforms disclose what information they gather from users and how much that is worth.
""When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do,"" said Republican Senator Josh Hawley in a statement announcing the bill.
Amazon's Prime Day promotion offers a window into what it will pay for browsing data. For Prime Day 2018, it offered $5 off to new Amazon Assistant users who spent at least $25. This year it offered $10 off to those spending at least $50.
Amazon is also fine paying nothing for the data: New customers only get the $10 credit if they install the assistant from a particular landing page, if they are Prime members, and if they make their purchase via the assistant by Aug. 2."

(Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) has slashed its growth plans for next summer, blaming delays in deliveries of Boeing's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX jet, lifting the shares of rival airlines which had feared a surge in new planes would hit ticket prices.
Europe's largest budget airline, which has firm orders for 135 of the 737 MAX, is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the plane. The aircraft was grounded in March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed a total of 346 people.
Boeing is working on a software fix that people close to the matter have said it hopes to present to regulators in September. 
Ryanair said on Tuesday it expected the 737 MAX to return to service before the end of the year, with the first new planes to be delivered to it some time between January and February 2020. 
Ryanair said the delay, coupled with constraints on how quickly it could bring new planes into service, had forced it to cut the number of MAX planes flying in its 2020 summer schedule to 30 from 58. 
The Irish airline now expects to carry 3% more passengers next summer, down from its previous forecast of 7%. That reduces its traffic estimate for the year to March 2021 to around 157 million from 162 million.
""We are now planning our summer 2020 schedules based on taking up to 30 B737 MAX aircraft deliveries up to end of May 2020,"" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. 
""This number could rise, or fall further, depending on when the B737 MAX actually returns to flight services,"" he added. 
O'Leary said Ryanair would start discussions with airports and trade unions to determine which of its bases would be cut or closed from November 2019 to adjust for the lower growth. 
Shares in Ryanair, which had warned journalists of the possible cuts at a briefing last week, were up 0.6% after the announcement, which Davy Stockbrokers described as ""prudent.""
Shares of rivals, most of which have less exposure to MAX delays, posted bigger gains amid expectations that Ryanair's cuts would help to address overcapacity in Europe's saturated airline market and boost average fares. 
Shares in British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG), easyJet (L:EZJ), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and KLM Air France (PA:AIRF) were all up by more than 2% at 0900 GMT. 
Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said that while slower growth would support unit revenues across the industry, Ryanair would see the cost benefits of its new aircraft postponed. 

Ryanair's plan to close routes and bases in November may also be interpreted as an indicator of weak current trading, Khoo said.

""While it is disappointing that we have delays, while it is disappointing that the growth for next year will be slightly slower than we had originally planned, we remain confident in the aircraft. We still think it is a great product,"" O'Leary told a conference call with investors.
""As soon as we can reasonably organize these deliveries with Boeing we would intend to take all of the 135 firm aircraft we have ordered over the next five years,"" he said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Darkening German investor morale and fresh Brexit woes cast a shadow over European markets on Tuesday, with German benchmark bond yields coming under pressure and the pound plunging to six month-lows against the euro. 
Germany's ZEW indicator showed that the mood among investors in Europe's largest economy deteriorated more than expected in July, with the survey pointing to the unresolved China-U.S. trade dispute and to political tensions with Iran.
The report knocked Germany's 10-year bond yield deeper into negative territory at minus 0.316%, [GVD/EUR] while Germany's main stocks index nudged into the red. European markets struggled for direction with the pan-region Stoxx 600 treading water.
The underlying picture was more mixed, with gains in airline and healthcare stocks offsetting losses in telecoms and automotives as the earnings seasons gets underway. (EU) [LIVE/]
Asian markets fared better. MSCI's Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index gained 0.3% as gains in South Korea and Taiwan offset losses in China's blue-chip CSI300 index. China was still smarting from Monday's tepid growth data, which showed the toll the Sino-U.S. trade war is taking, even as new data highlighted Beijing's efforts to boost spending. (SS)
In equity markets, much of the focus was shifting to the United States, where futures pointed to a flat opening. Heavyweights JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are all due to report earnings. 
Markets also await U.S. retail sales data - expected to show a 0.1% rise in June. That comes ahead of major central bank decisions, with the European Central Bank due on July 25 and the Federal Reserve expected to deliver a U.S. rate cut shortly thereafter. 
""The market is waiting for what the ECB will do, followed by what the Fed will do, and in the meantime there is still this undercurrent of waiting for some of the earnings season results to come out,"" said Gerry Fowler, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""The 2019 earnings season will be roughly zero growth ... unless we see broader economic growth recovery, we may not see material earnings growth again for quite some time.""
Citigroup's results on Monday provided markets with a taste. A decline in net interest margin in its mixed quarterly report underlined risks for financial firms in a lower interest rate environment. That decline partly overshadowed better-than-expected profit, triggering a fall in shares of other banks on concerns that it would presage lower profits across the industry. 
The fallout from trade tensions has also cast a cloud. Overnight, U.S. President Donald Trump showed no signs of softening his stance on China, warning Washington could ramp up pressure as trade talks sputtered along.
That has reinforced expectations of central bank policy easing. Markets have fully priced in a 25-basis-point cut by the Fed at its meeting at the end of this month.
In currency markets, the pound sank to a six-month low against the euro after a debate between the two candidates to become Britain's next prime minister re-ignited worries about a no-deal Brexit.
Against the euro, the pound slipped to 90.225 pence. It reached a six-day low against the dollar at $1.2463.
Labour market data did little to soften the blow, showing potential signs of future weakness in jobs growth, even though wages have grown at their fastest pace in more than a decade.
Elsewhere, the dollar was up 0.1% against the yen at 108.01 while the euro bought $1.1244.
The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was a touch stronger at 97.063.
Elsewhere in fixed income markets, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes turned higher to 2.0973% while the two-year yield, closely watched as a gauge of traders' expectations for Fed fund rates, rose to 1.8416%.
Oil prices steadied after falling earlier on signs the impact of a tropical storm on U.S. Gulf Coast production would be short-lived. [O/R]
Global benchmark Brent crude was flat at $66.45 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $59.56 per barrel. 

Trade in gold echoed the cautious tone of equity markets. It was last down 0.03% on the spot market at $1,413.20 per ounce. [GOL/]

Transaction volume of commercial property totaled HK$21.1 billion ($2.70 billion), 6.2% lower than the first quarter, with investment volume by Chinese investors falling to the lowest quarterly total since Q3 2015, CBRE said.
But sentiment is expected to improve if interest rates stay low for a longer period and trade conflict does not escalate, it added.
For office leasing, rents declined for the first time since Q2 2014 due to subdued demand, with overall rents falling 0.6% compared to the previous quarter.
CBRE expected rents in core submarkets to weaken further in the second half of 2019, but office decentralization by companies will ensure rents in non-core submarkets increase 2-3%.
""High-value added service sectors, including banking and finance and professional services, which are highly sensitive to financial and asset market instability, will be especially vulnerable,"" said CBRE in a report.
""As a result, occupiers, especially multi-nationals, are expected to remain cautious towards real estate expenditure in the short term, a trend that will cap expansion demand for office space."""
524,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Home Builder Persimmon Falls After TV Program Highlights Faults,"(Bloomberg) --  Persimmon  Plc (LON:PSN) shares fell after a television documentary highlighted customer complaints about the quality of the homes the company builds, fire-safety concerns and excessive executive pay.
The program, which aired Monday evening on Britain’s Channel 4, contained interviews with disgruntled customers of the country’s second-largest home builder. They laid out a litany of construction faults and described high-pressure sales tactics used by the company, which has been a major beneficiary of the government’s Help to Buy low-cost loan program for new home buyers.
Persimmon dropped as much as 2% in London trading on Tuesday, following a 2.9% decline on Monday before the program was broadcast. That compares with a dip of about 1% for competitor  Barratt Developments  Plc (LON:BDEV) since Friday’s close.
The Help to Buy program is set to be modified and extended from 2021 through 2023, and the U.K. government is weighing whether to ban Persimmon from selling its homes to buyers using the interest-free loans, the Times reported in February. About half the homes Persimmon builds are sold using Help to Buy.
In a statement provided to the program, Persimmon said it “can and will do better” under its new leadership. “We fully accept that on too many occasions in the past we have fallen short on customer care and the speed and empathy with which we dealt with problems,” according to the statement.
Housing Secretary James Brokenshire is concerned about the company’s quality of construction and handling of complaints, in addition to the practice of selling houses using leasehold structures that require buyers to pay an annual rent on the land beneath their homes, the Times said. Persimmon Chief Executive Officer Dave Jenkinson said at the time that the company hadn’t been in direct contact with the government about the issue.
Help to Buy was introduced shortly after Persimmon brought in an uncapped long-term incentive plan that resulted in a 75 million pound ($93.5 million) bonus for then CEO Jeff Fairburn. He decided to leave the company after the bonus became the focus of public ire about executive pay. Former Chairman Nicholas Wrigley and Jonathan Davie, former head of the company’s remuneration committee, both resigned in 2017 as a result of a decision not to impose a cap on the plan.
The Channel 4 program brought in an independent building surveyor to inspect a Persimmon home that was recently sold. He found almost 300 faults, including leaking sinks and a poorly fitted fire door. More than 70% of the issues raised fell short of building regulation standards, according to the program. Customers also complained that Persimmon had taken more than a year to make some fixes.
Persimmon started an independent review to examine its quality, customer care, governance and incentives in April. The new focus on customer service has resulted in an improved build quality rating, but is impacting sales volumes and margins, the company said in an earnings statement earlier this month."

Arcadia said the challenges to the CVAs, which were approved in June by the majority of creditors, were ""without merit"" and it would defend itself against them.
Vornado, a landlord to some of the Topshop and Topman stores in New York, was not available to respond to Reuters request for a comment outside of business hours. 
Arcadia's other landlords include  British Land  (L:BLND),  Intu Properties  (L:INTUP),  Aviva  (L:AV) and  Land Securities  (L:LAND).
CVAs have been carried out by several British retailers, including fashion chain New Look, floor coverings firm  Carpetright  (L:CPRC), mother-and-baby goods group Mothercare (L:MTC) and department store chains House of Fraser and Debenhams. 
Landlords of UK retail property, however, are starting to fight back against tenants proposing CVAs in order to close stores and reduce their rent burden.
Earlier in the month, Debenhams said M&G Real Estate had agreed to withdraw the court action related to its CVA that wiped out investors but kept the company operating. The company has also been challenged by former shareholder  Sports Direct  (L:SPD) over the plan.
Arcadia's restructuring will close stores, cut rents and make changes to the funding of the group's pension schemes, but it will enable it to keep operating under the Green family's ownership.

Investing.com -- It’s not gone unnoticed that England’s first-ever victory in the cricket World Cup came with a substantial dollop of help from foreign-born players. The same formula appears to be working for luxury goods group  Burberry  (LON:BRBY), whose shares are back within 10% of their all-time high on Tuesday after an impressive performance in the three months to June.
Burberry, famous for its trademark check patterns, posted a 4% gain in comparable sales in the quarter, the first of its fiscal year, thanks to the roll-out of designs by its new chief designer Riccardo Tisci, who was hired by fellow Italian Marco Gobbetti last year. Gobbetti himself had taken over from Christopher Bailey at the start of 2017.
The acceleration in sales growth, from a disappointing 1% three months earlier, reflected the fact that Tisci’s designs now account for 50% of product in the company’s stores, a figure that should rise to 65% in the next three months and 75% by the end of the year. The amount of old stock that is being sold at discounted prices (Burberry doesn’t break that out precisely) should accordingly fall.
The company’s shares rose over 9% in early trading in London Tuesday, easily outpacing the rest of the FTSE 100, which was itself the best-performing among European indexes with a 0.2% gain. The Stoxx 600 was up less than 0.1%, as was the German Dax and the French CAC 40.
The performance was due chiefly to strong sales in greater China and the Far East, a reassuring sign of stability in Asian demand that also gave a modest lift to its bigger French rivals - LVMH (PA:LVMH), Hermes (PA:HRMS) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) – in early trading.
Asia Pacific sales grew by a little less than 10%, while mainland China sales grew by a “mid-teen” percentage despite the well-publicised slowdown in Chinese growth. Investor relations head Annabel Gleeson acknowledged there had been a modest impact on sales in Hong Kong from the recent political unrest. The company had closed two of its flagship stores for five days to protect staff, Gleeson said.
Gleeson also noted that Tisci will be turning his attentions to updating Burberry’s signature trenchcoats in the coming months, after concentrating first on its fashion collections.
At 2,180 pence, Burberry’s shares are now only 8% off the all-time high they hit last year as investors started to buy into Gobbetti’s vision of re-positioning the group as an ultra-luxury brand name and stopping a gentle drift downmarket. "

Store sales rose 4% on a comparable basis for the three months through June, double the rate analysts predicted. New products from Riccardo Tisci, formerly of French fashion house Givenchy delivered strong double-digit percentage growth, the trench-coat maker said Tuesday.
The shares rose as much as 6.4% in early London trading, the most since November on an intraday basis.
Sales in mainland China rose in the mid-teen percentages, even as the country reported its slowest economic growth in nearly three decades. Chinese policies including cuts to sales taxes and import duties are encouraging shoppers to rein in foreign shopping trips and instead spend at home.
The strong report from Burberry, the first European luxury company to report sales this quarter, could boost prospects across the sector amid questions about the resilience of Chinese demand.
The update “should reassure with a healthy uptick in mainland Chinese consumption,” MainFirst analyst John Guy said in a note. Results were better than expected across Asia, where protests in the key Hong Kong shopping hub were seen as a possible drag.
Store Closings
Interest in Tisci’s fresh looks helped offset the impact of continued store closings. Burberry has been scaling back in non-luxury and discount locations as it aims to boost perception of the brand.
A year after Tisci’s arrival at Burberry, his designs made up more than half of products in stores by the end of the quarter, the company said.
The designer has plastered a flashy new monogram print across duffel bags, hoodies and shoes in a bid to make the brand more visible. Alliances with top models, pop stars and style bloggers have helped to amplify his message online.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 03:36AM ET</span>",Renault sees new model push as softening sales decline,"PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) posted a 6.7% decline in first-half vehicle sales amid a global auto slowdown, but said a forthcoming product offensive would begin to help soften the blow in key markets.
Sales fell to 1.94 million light vehicles in January-June from 2.08 million a year earlier, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. The slump was outpaced by a 7.1 percent global market contraction, it added.
The sales announcement comes amid gathering gloom for the global auto industry, with major markets in decline and trade barriers looming. It also comes a day after domestic rival PSA (PA:PEUP) recorded a 12.8% slump in deliveries.
""Renault maintained its market share in the first half of the year in a market that was in sharp decline,"" the carmaker said, adding that it had held its ground with ""no new products"".
The rollout of a new Clio mini will help lift sales in the second half, sales chief Olivier Murguet told reporters, bolstered by an updated Zoe electric car. Global sales of battery-powered models rose 42.9% in the first half.
While the core Renault brand's sales fell 11.5% in the first half, lower-cost brands showed gains, with Dacia up 4.5% and the Russian Lada marque advancing 6.8%.
Group sales were flat in a declining European market but down 27.7% in the sales region spanning Africa, the Middle East and India, - largely as a result of Renault's 2018 withdrawal from Iran under threat of U.S. sanctions.
Deliveries fell 5.2 percent in the Eurasia region including Russia, and 3.9% in the Americas, where Renault sees the Brazilian market rebounding 8% this year.
The global market will show a new decline of about 3% this year, Renault said, with Russia down a further 2-3% and Europe stable, assuming that a hard Brexit is averted.
Renault is scheduled to publish full first-half results on July 26."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) are starting to lower the interest rate they use to stress test customers' loan applications, a move expected to help stabilize house prices.
The banks are the first two of the Big Four lenders dominating Australia's banking system to implement the loosening of mortgage lending rules, introduced by the prudential regulator earlier this month.
From Tuesday, Westpac now assesses the serviceability capacity of its customers using the lower of 2.5% over its lending rate, or a minimum 5.75% floor test, according to its website.
That compares with a 7.25% minimum testing rate the banks used before the regulator removed the mandated floor. 
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) earlier this month scrapped the minimum testing rate as it added to the stimulatory tools being deployed to revive the country's sluggish economy.
ANZ told clients on Friday that its new floor rate for retail lending would fall to 5.50% from Monday, according to a marketing memo seen by Reuters.
A spokeswoman for Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) said the bank was in the process of reviewing its own testing rate. 
In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) said ""now is the right time to change the approach to how the affordability rate floor is determined, given the continuing low interest rate environment."" She did not reveal the new testing rate applied by the bank. 
Following a protracted property downturn, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday said house prices were now stabilizing and APRA's credit easing measure was ""likely to see a boost in borrowing capacity for many new borrowers"", its July policy meeting minutes showed. 
The central bank, however, said it does not expect a material pick-up in borrowing. 
The move means that borrowers applying for home loans carrying variable loan rates of about 3.5% will now be tested on their ability to repay a loan carrying 6% interest - that is 1.5 percentage points lower than before. 
According to analysts, every 1% drop lets home buyers borrow up to 10% more.

The spring season in the housing market would be a key litmus test for whether the changes have worked, Royal Bank of Canada said in a note to clients.

The fashion label is more than a year into a high stakes overhaul by CEO Marco Gobbetti aimed at taking Burberry more upmarket and reviving its image, including with edgier takes by Tisci on some of its classic products like the trench coat. 
The brand said new products had accounted for around half the wares on offer in its shops by the end of June, more than some analysts had expected. 
This helped lift same store sales by 4% - following lacklustre growth of 1% in the previous three months and topping market expectations of around 2% - and its gamble on a new designer appeared to be paying off for now. 
""The consumer response was very promising, delivering strong growth in our new collections,"" Gobbetti said in a statement. 
Burberry has in recent quarters lagged the performance of luxury industry leaders like LVMH's Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) or Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci, which benefited from thriving demand in China in spite of U.S. trade tensions. 
Those firms are due to post sales for the April to June quarter next week. 
The pace of Burberry's revenue growth within China and more broadly across Asia also improved slightly, despite slowing Chinese economic growth. 
Its revamp has included rolling out a new logo-style print, or monogram, it hopes will catch on as it works on extending its reach in high-margin handbags; and it is redesigning stores as well as making a big marketing push with social media campaigns. 

The company maintained its forecast for broadly stable revenue and operating margin at constant exchange rates for the 2020 financial year. Revenue and operating profit are not expected to pick up in a more meaningful way until 2021.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",South Korean forced labor victims to seek Japan's Mitsubishi asset sale,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreans forced to work for Japanese occupiers will seek a court order to forcibly liquidate Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' (T:7011) assets to compensate them, their lawyers said on Tuesday, risking more Japanese anger over the issue.
The question of compensation for South Koreans for labor during Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula has soured the U.S. allies' relations, which took a turn for the worse this month when Japan restricted exports of high-tech material to South Korea.
The export restrictions threaten global supplies of memory chips and smartphones.
Japan has denied that the dispute over compensation for laborers is behind the export curbs, even though a Japanese government minister this month cited broken trust with South Korea over the labor dispute in announcing the export restrictions.
Instead, Japan has cited ""inadequate management"" of sensitive items exported to South Korea, with Japanese media reporting that quantities of one of the materials had been shipped to North Korea.
South Korea denies that. The Japanese government has said it had not said any materials were going to North Korea.
A South Korean court ruling forcing Mitsubishi Heavy to liquidate its assets in South Korea to compensate workers would put an additional strain on relations, likely making a resolution of the dispute over exports even more difficult.
South Korea's Supreme Court last year ordered the Japanese company to compensate 10 forced labor victims, drawing a strong rebuke from Japan, which believes the matter was settled under a 1965 treaty. 
The lawyers said they would file court papers seeking the sale of Mitsubishi's assets, as it had failed to respond by a Monday deadline to requests for discussions on the case.
""For plaintiffs who are over 90 years old, the process set by the law can no longer be delayed,"" the lawyers said in a statement, adding Mitsubishi has done nothing to address the court ruling for more than six months.
""We will apply for an order to sell the assets of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as soon as possible,"" they said. 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had no immediate comment. 
The South Korean Supreme Court ruled in November Mitsubishi must pay between 80 million won and 150 million won ($68,000-$127,000) to each of 10 people who worked for the company during World War Two. 
The same court had ruled earlier in October that Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp's (T:5401) must pay four steel workers 100 million won each for their forced labor during the war.
A Nippon Steel Corp spokesman said it had no immediate comment.
Speaking about the possible court order, Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said he hoped the matter would be solved through diplomatic channels.

""Japanese companies should not come to actual harm. Basically, this is something we'd like to have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deal with,"" he told a briefing in Tokyo.

In a letter to Judge Victor Marrero on Monday, attorney Glenn Pomerantz said that in exchange for the expedited October 7 trial date, the states had been promised materials on a settlement between the Justice Department and the companies by June 28. Since the government and companies have not reached a settlement, those materials are not available.
""Plaintiff states engaged in discussions yesterday with defendants regarding the appropriate trial date and pre-trial schedule and continue to confer with defendants,"" Pomerantz wrote in his letter.
In their lawsuit, filed in June, state attorneys general argued that the deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.
To win over the Justice Department, which is not involved in the lawsuit, T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including selling the prepaid brand Boost.
The companies are in talks to sell Boost to Dish but are haggling over issues such as restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future, with T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company.
T-Mobile is about 63% owned by Deutsche Telekom. 
The companies told the court in late June that they were willing to refrain from closing the deal until after the state attorneys general case is completed.
Pomerantz, in a second letter dated Monday to another court official, expressed doubt that any deal with the Justice Department would satisfy the states.
""Although it is very unlikely that any settlement between Defendants and USDOJ could prevent the anticompetitive injury that the proposed merger will cause, there is no doubt that the settlement would dramatically change the nature of the evidence needed for trial,"" he wrote.

539,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>",Philippine Stocks May Extend Bull Run as Earnings Look Promising,"(Bloomberg) -- The bull run for Philippine stocks still has legs amid tailwinds of stronger corporate earnings, cooling inflation and continued monetary stimulus.
The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index entered the bull market on Monday after climbing more than 22% from a November low. The gauge is now the best performer in Southeast Asia and one of the top gainers in Asia this year. The surge was also propelled by a stronger peso, which has been among the best performing currencies in the region. The equities index was little changed as of 10:12 a.m. Tuesday.
Foreign investors have returned to the market -- which was among the worst performing last year, pouring more than $432 million into equity funds this year. That improvement was partly due to inflow of funds after investors finished adjusting allocation on the back of MSCI Inc.’s expansion of China weighting in some of its benchmarks.
“After building momentum in the last two months, the market has convincingly broken the ceiling at 8,100 and it looks like there’s still enough gas in the tank for it to move higher,” said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. “Some of those who were hesitating jumped in for fear of getting left behind.”
The nation’s market was roiled by the U.S.-China trade war, escalating inflation and a weakening peso last year. Foreign investors pulled over $1 billion out of the nation’s stocks in 2018 -- their biggest withdrawal in three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A double digit growth in second-quarter earnings at SM Prime Holdings Inc., the nation’s largest shopping mall operator, supports expectations that household spending has recovered and corporate results will be better than the first quarter, according to Ravelas.
Stronger corporate earnings combined with falling inflation and a less tighter monetary condition as the central bank’s pushes with its expansionary policy will help propel the index to 8,500 in the near term, he said.
All but two of the PSEi’s 30 components have gained since the low in November with JG Summit Holdings Inc. and First Gen Corp. surging more than 65%. About half of the gauge lagged the index’s 22% gain during the period including SM Investments Corp. and Jollibee Foods Corp.
Monday’s rally sent the Philippine stock index’s 14-day relative strength index into overbought territory, indicating profit taking may occur. The last time the PSEi’s technical indicator hit above 71 in December, shares fell for four straight days and lost nearly 5%.
While the bull market will be well supported with valuation still at “reasonable“ level, “investors should rotate money from the winners to the laggards as the round of portfolio adjustments that will come with changes in the MSCI in August will provide headwinds and temper gains,” said Miguel Ong, analyst at AP Securities Inc.

In a decision on Friday, U.S. District Judge Holly Teeter in Kansas City, Kansas, rejected racketeering claims by Albert Ogles, the Alabama man leading the proposed class action.
Teeter said Ogles failed to offer enough evidence that the annuity he bought was fraudulently designed, and said one of his legal theories was preempted by state law.
Lawyers for Ogles did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Guggenheim's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. Walter was not a defendant.
Ogles said Guggenheim deceived investors into buying a type of annuity from its Security Benefit Life unit, for which he paid $145,000 in 2012, by lulling them into thinking they could enjoy ""uncapped"" returns that rival annuities could not.
Instead, Ogles said the annuity performed poorly, and was simply a means for Guggenheim to generate higher fees from Security Benefit Life and promote its own interests, including to help fund the $2.15 billion Dodgers purchase in 2012.
Guggenheim countered in court papers that Ogles fell ""far short of pleading with the required specificity that the Guggenheim defendants engaged in mail or wire fraud"" necessary to support a racketeering claim. It also suggested that Ogles' only alleged injury came because he believed his annuity did not perform as well as he expected.
Guggenheim recently had more than $265 billion of assets under management, according to its website. It bought Security Benefit Life in 2010. Walter is worth $3.6 billion, Forbes magazine said.
The case is Ogles v Security Benefit Life Insurance Co et al, U.S. District Court, District of Kansas, No. 18-02265."

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday slashed a damages award  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) owed a California man who blamed Roundup weed killer for his cancer, to $25.27 million from $80.27 million, while rejecting the company's bid for a new trial.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said evidence against the former  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co, which Bayer bought last year, supported the $5.27 million in compensatory damages that a jury awarded Edwin Hardeman. He also said the jury acted reasonably in awarding punitive damages.
Chhabria nonetheless reduced punitive damages to $20 million from $75 million, saying that while Monsanto ""deserves to be punished"" the higher award was ""constitutionally impermissible"" because it was nearly 15 times the compensatory damages award.
""Monsanto's conduct, while reprehensible, does not warrant a ratio of that magnitude, particularly in the absence of evidence showing intentional concealment of a known or obvious safety risk,"" Chhabria wrote.
Hardeman said he used Roundup for many years starting in the 1980s to treat poison oak and weeds on his property.
He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014, but is now in remission.
Hardeman is one of more than 13,400 plaintiffs who have sued Bayer and Monsanto over Roundup, saying the herbicide's active ingredient, glyphosate, is unsafe. His case was considered a bellwether for hundreds of similar cases before Chhabria.
In a statement, Bayer called Chhabria's decision ""a step in the right direction,"" but said it still plans to appeal.
Bayer said the verdict and damages award ""conflict with both the weight of the extensive science that supports the safety of Roundup, and the conclusions of leading health regulators in the U.S. and around the world that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.""
Hardeman may appeal Chhabria's decision to reduce the damages award, which one of his lawyers, Michael Baum, in a statement called a ""reversible error.""
U.S. Supreme Court precedents limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9 to 1.
""We are pleased that the judge denied Monsanto's motion to throw out the verdict, and recognized that Monsanto deserved to be punished,"" Jennifer Moore, a lawyer for Hardeman, said in an interview. ""We disagree with any reduction in the jury verdict.""
Bayer paid $63 billion for Monsanto.

The case is In re Roundup Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02741. The Hardeman case is Hardeman v Monsanto Co in the same court, No. 16-00525.

542,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:20PM ET</span>",Chevron Seeks All-Electric Canada LNG Plant to Cut Emissions,"(Bloomberg) --  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) is seeking approval to modify its plans for a liquefied natural gas export facility on Canada’s Pacific Coast to an all-electric design that it says will result in the lowest greenhouse-gas emissions per ton of LNG of any large project in the world.
Chevron and its partner Woodside Petroleum Ltd. earlier this year had announced they’d applied to expand the capacity of their LNG project in Kitimat, British Columbia, by as much as 80% to 18 million metric tons a year.
That triggered a new federal screening of the project that’s expected to “commence shortly,” according to a July 8 letter filed by Chevron to the provincial environmental assessment office. As part of the fresh round of approvals sought, the project is proposing to become an “all-electric plant” powered by hydroelectricity, allowing expanded capacity without the corresponding increase in emissions of a traditional LNG facility, the letter said.
LNG is created by cooling gas to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 127 degrees Celsius) in an energy-intensive process typically powered by burning natural gas. Kitimat LNG instead proposes electric motor drives totaling 700 megawatts to run all liquefaction, utility compressors, pumps and fans with hydro-power bought from the provincial utility, according to its revised project description dated July 8. It will have backup diesel power generators on site for emergencies.
The proposed plant “will achieve the lowest emissions intensity of any large-scale LNG facility in the world,” according to the project description. Kitimat LNG will produce less than 0.1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for every ton of LNG compared with a global average of more than 0.3 ton of CO2 equivalent, according to the document.
All-electric LNG plants are still uncommon, according to Alex Munton, principal analyst for Americas LNG at Wood Mackenzie in Houston. The only large-scale, electric-drive LNG plant under construction in North America is Freeport LNG in Texas, he said.
Kitimat LNG’s decision to go with an electric design may increase the project’s costs. “If you’re installing turbines that are gas-fired and your fuel is very low-cost gas -- and the outlook for Canadian gas prices if very low long term -- then it’s difficult to beat that using electricity,” said Munton. “But clearly there’s a consideration around carbon taxation and how that affects the economics.” The carbon tax on LNG projects in British Columbia will rise to C$50 ($38) a ton by 2021 from C$40 at present.
Chevron and Woodside expect to make a final investment decision in 2022 to 2023 with production starting by 2029, according to the project description. The revised proposal may trigger the need for a federal environmental assessment, according to the document.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 05:19PM ET</span>",Citigroup profit beats estimates on gains in consumer lending,"By Imani Moise and Sweta Singh
(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc topped expectations for quarterly profit on Monday as a tight lid on costs and strength in consumer lending helped the third-largest U.S. bank counter weakness in its trading business.
New York-based Citi is the first major bank to report second-quarter earnings. Fellow Wall Street titans JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc report later in the week.
Bank stocks have lagged the market in recent weeks on concerns that net interest margins, a key measure of bank profitability, have peaked as the Fed gets ready to start cutting interest rates.
Citi's interest margin declined slightly to 2.67% from 2.70% a year earlier and 2.72% in the first quarter of 2019. But the bank was able to make more money from its lending activities during the quarter and net interest income rose 2%.
Overall revenue rose 2% to $18.76 billion, driven by 4% growth in Citi's consumer business as customers spent more on their credit cards. Branded card revenue jumped 7% as more customers initially attracted with promotional offers started paying interest. Interest-earning card balances rose 10%.
Strength in its consumer sector helped offset softness in Citi's Wall Street business and corporate banking.
Trading revenue remained challenged for a third consecutive quarter. Fixed-income trading fell 4%, excluding a gain from Citi's investment in Tradeweb, while equities revenue declined 9%.
Corporate lending was 9% lower than the year-ago period. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters on a call that trade tensions have discouraged some corporate customers from taking out loans.
""There's a bit of caution that many of the corporate clients are exercising, in particularly in Asia,"" Mason said.
He said Citigroup's loans to corporate clients in Asia were down about 5%, partly because of aggressive pricing by competitors, but also because of ""some of the trade tensions.""
Overall, Citi continued to add loans and deposits in the most recent quarter, allaying concerns that a weaker economic outlook was hurting consumers' ability to borrow.
Firmwide loans rose 3% to $689 billion, while deposits increased 5%, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations.
Banks have been under pressure to cut costs as a weaker economic outlook raised concerns about revenue growth. Mason said earlier this year the bank has accelerated some cost-cutting plans to cope with potential headwinds.
Expenses fell 2% during the quarter, putting the bank on track to end the year on the high end of its projected $500 million to $600 million in annual savings, Mason said on a call with analysts.
Return on tangible common equity, one of the broadest measures of performance, improved more than one percentage point to 11.9%, putting Citi in striking distance of its 12% ROTCE goal for the year.
Citi's per-share earnings have been propped up by a lower outstanding share count due to large stock buy-back programs, but investors have been pressuring the bank to prove it can grow profit organically. Its share count declined 10% in the second quarter from a year earlier.
The stock ended little changed on Monday, off 6 cents, or 0.08%, at $71.71.
Net income rose to $4.80 billion, or $1.95 per share, in the second quarter, from $4.50 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the impact of a one-time gain related to Citi's investment in electronic trading company Tradeweb. the bank earned $1.83 a share.
Analysts had expected a profit of $1.80 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

548,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Speak, Industrial Output on Tap
Retail sales and industrial output make up the top-tier U.S. economic data on Tuesday, while speeches from a bevy of Federal Reserve members also will likely come under scrutiny. 
The Commerce Department will release its retail sales numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:50 GMT). Economists on average expect retail sales slowed to a rise of 0.1% in June from 0.5% the prior month. Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, were expected to slow to a 0.3% rise. 
Ahead of numbers, some have attributed expectations for a slowdown to a fall in gas prices. 
“Gas prices were lower by about 5% month-on-month and carry about an 8% weight that could knock a few tenths off month-ago growth in total retail sales,” Scotia Economics said in a note to clients. 
The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – is expected to slow from last month's 0.4% print.
U.S. industrial output was expected to slow to a 0.1% rise in June from 0.4% a month earlier. 
On the monetary policy front, traders will be on the lookout for insights into the Fed’s thinking on policy measures ahead of widely expected rate cut at the Fed’s meeting next week. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell speaks Tuesday at a Banque de France event in Paris in a speech titled “Aspects of Monetary Policy in the Post-Crisis Era.” That's scheduled for 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman speaks at another ""Fed Listens"" outreach event at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT) followed by speeches from four voting regional Fed presidents.
2. API Data on Watch
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data will be eagerly anticipated after oil prices made a negative start to the trading week as oil demand fears resurfaced following further signs of a slowdown in China. 
Crude Oil WTI Futures fell 1.1% to settle at $59.58 a barrel on Monday.
Oil prices are expected to remain range-bound as a myriad of different catalysts attempt to sway direction, including weaker oil demand growth, ongoing OPEC production cuts and strong U.S. shale production, Scotia Economics said in a note to clients. 
3. Banking Earnings in Focus 
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) kicked off the earnings season for Wall Street banks on Monday, with a beat on both the top and bottom lines – and investors will be watching with interest on whether JPMorgan,  Wells Fargo  and Goldman Sachs can follow suit with all three set to release earnings before markets open Tuesday. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is expected to report earnings of $2.51 a share on revenue of $28.8 billion, according to analysts’ polled by Investing.com. 
Like its rivals, JPMorgan’s loan business is expected to have taken a hit from a decline in net interest margin following a plunge in U.S. Treasury yields amid expectations for a Fed interest rate cut later this month.
Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which remains under sanctions from the Federal Reserve since February last year after several allegations of customer abuses, is expected to report earnings of $1.17 a share on revenue of $20.94 billion.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), meanwhile, is expected to deliver second-quarter earnings of $4.93 a share on $8.88 billion in revenue. "
549,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",Stocks - Nervous Market Treads Water Ahead of 2nd Quarter Earnings,"Investing.com - Stocks were waiting on Monday for the second-quarter earnings season to shift into high gear.
That should start Tuesday when financial giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) report results. The two stocks, off 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, were the laggards among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average today.
In the meantime, the S&P 500 was up 0.02%. The Dow was up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.17%. All three indexes (and the Nasdaq 100 Index) hit record intraday highs after the open, then slipped back and came to finish with small gains and closing records. In the S&P 500's case, 0.02% was a gain of 0.53 of a point. 
Monday's market opened with what were described as mixed results from {{|Citigroup}}. Earnings beat estimates, but profit margins narrowed. Citi opened lower but recovered its losses by noon and slipped to a 0.1% loss on the day.
But the damage was done to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Also weighing on the Dow was Boeing (NYSE:BA), off 1% after a Wall Street Journal story Sunday suggested that the 737 Max could remain grounded until after the New Year. As it is, many airlines are scaling back schedules because they can't use the planes. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), a key Boeing supplier, also fell 0.4%.
Tuesday is a big day for financial company earnings. In addition to JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs,   Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) and   Wells Fargo   (NYSE:WFC) also report before the open. Other reports are due from Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and railroad giant CSX (NASDAQ:CSX).
This earnings season is projected to be frustrating. Factset is forecasting a 3% decline in earnings for S&P 500 companies, based on pre-announcements of potential earnings misses and possible upside surprises. But of the 24 companies that reported by the end of last week, 20 had earnings surprises and 17 reported better-than-forecast revenue.
Utilities, technology and real estate shares led the market; energy, financial stocks and industrials were laggards.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) moved higher. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was flat. Cybersecurity company Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) fell nearly 11% on reports that talks for a potential merger with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO have collapsed.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) slipped 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively. The PHLX Oil Service Index fell 2%. 
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) hit new intraday highs.
Weighing on the market was a higher dollar, which depressed a wide array of commodity prices. Crude oil and grains fell. Gold, copper and silver futures were higher. Interest rates moved lower. The U.S. 10-Year yield fell 0.7% to 2.09%. 
Winners and Losers in the S&P
Fertilizer-maker CF Industries (NYSE:CF), chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were the S&P 500's top performers
Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) and oil-and-gas producers Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and   Cimarex Energy   (NYSE:XEC) were among the worst S&P 500 performers."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 index ended little changed on Monday after oscillating between positive and negative territory throughout the session after  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) kicked off the earnings season with a mixed quarterly report.
The bank reported a better-than-expected profit but also a decline in its net interest margin. The fall in net interest margin triggered a fall in shares of other banks on concerns that it would presage lower profits across the industry as interest rates have dropped.
Though Citigroup shares erased nearly all their losses to end just 0.1% lower, the S&P 500 bank index <.SPXBK> slid 1.0%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) - all set to report results on Tuesday - declined more than 1%.
As a result, financial shares (SPSY) fell 0.5% to weigh most heavily on the S&P 500 among its 11 major sectors.
Gains in technology (SPLRCT) and healthcare (SPXHC) shares offset the losses in financial shares, however. Those sectors helped the Nasdaq edge higher to notch its fourth consecutive record closing high.
Second-quarter earnings start in earnest this week, and analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report a 0.3% fall in profit, which would be the first quarterly drop in three years, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
U.S. stocks will likely be muted until more results come in, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. The three main indexes ended last week at record closing highs as dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell bolstered hopes the central bank would cut interest rates later this month.
""It's definitely a wait-and-see environment,"" Pursche said. ""Citi was looked at as slightly disappointing.""
Yet solid earnings could give U.S. stocks a further boost, said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund in New Orleans.
""We think earnings are going to be generally positive this season,"" he said. ""We've been on a tear this year, but we still have some room to go.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 27.13 points, or 0.1%, to 27,359.16, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.53 point, or 0.02%, to 3,014.3 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 14.04 points, or 0.17%, to 8,258.19.
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) shares rose 2.7%, helping to boost the S&P 500 healthcare index, as the drugmaker said it would invest $5.1 billion in a major expansion of its partnership with biotech  Galapagos  NV (AS:GLPG).
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) shares slipped 1.0% following a Wall Street Journal report https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-737-max-grounding-could-stretch-into-2020-11563112801 on Sunday that its 737 MAX jet could stay grounded until early 2020.
 Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC) shares tumbled 10.7%, the biggest percentage drop among S&P 500 companies, after a report that the cybersecurity company and Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) have ceased deal talks. Broadcom shares rose 1.0%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 66 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 64 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.39 billion shares, compared with the 6.69-billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 03:46PM ET</span>",Balyasny gains in first half after losses prompted reorganization in 2018,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Balyasny Asset Management, a Chicago-based hedge fund that shed $4 billion in assets last year and cut 20% of its staff, was back in positive territory for the first half of this year, suggesting its massive overhaul might be paying off, analysts said.
In the January through June period, the firm returned 8% and cleared its high-water mark, the hurdle required to start charging performance fees again. The firm, whose assets totaled $6 billion at the end of June, employs many teams that invest in a variety of strategies and hired three top executives to shift course during the painful 2018.
""We are pleased with the quality of returns,"" Dmitry Balyasny, who founded the firm in 2001, told Reuters in an interview. Balyasny said last week that teams that bet on and against stocks, currencies and interest rates in all markets around the globe have been performing well.
Long before a late 2018 stock market drop left many hedge funds with losses for the year, Balyasny's returns had been sagging, prompting investors to worry and want out.
By the end of December, losses at the firm had swelled to 7%, saddling Balyasny Asset Management with its first loss in 18 years.
It was a shock for investors who had watched it return an average 12% a year and make money during the financial crisis in 2008. Strong returns helped the firm grow quickly and become a household name among multi-manager firms, along with Citadel, Millennium Management and Point72 Asset Management.
For Dmitry Balyasny, 47, the path back to gains included laying off dozens of staff and bringing in several new top executives last year to oversee equities, macro investing and risk management.
Following last year's cuts, there has been hiring this year and 14 new portfolio managers and 55 analysts have joined.
Still, the memory of 2018 is painful for the fund manager. ""It is no fun to work at a place if you are not winning,"" Balyasny said, adding, ""We weren't happy with performance and we needed to make changes.""
Balyasny hired Jeffrey Runnfeldt, an industry veteran who most recently worked for Chicago-headquartered Citadel, to oversee global equities. In London, Tim Wilkinson, who had also worked for Citadel, joined to build out the firm's macro investing team. And Alex Lurye, another former Citadel executive, joined as chief risk officer in Chicago.
Balyasny, the fund manager, acknowledges that Balyasny the firm grew too quickly, managing $13 billion at its peak in 2017. Over the years a lot of money rushed in. As it rushed out, Balyasny became more careful about its investors and stopped accepting new capital three years ago.
""I believe that our collaborative culture helped us get through a tough period, drives returns and continues to attract talent,"" Balyasny said.
Investors applauded last year's reorganization and said the firm is clearly able to hire staff, one of the most critical indications of success in the competitive hedge fund industry.
""The firm is being right-sized and it has a good culture,"" said David Holmgren, chief investment officer of Hartford HealthCare, a hospital fund with $3.3 billion in assets. ""A rose can't continually bloom unless it is pruned.""
The trio of new executives, investors said, will be helpful in shaping the firm's culture and allow Balyasny, the fund manager, more time to focus on other things. ""It should be a smoother ride now,"" said an investor who was not permitted to speak on the record about his firm's investments."
553,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 03:02PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Symantec Slumps as Merger Talks With Broadcom Reportedly Fall Through,"Investing.com – Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) plunged on Monday after merger talks with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) reportedly fell through as the two parties failed to reach an agreement on price. 
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) reduced its $28.25-a-share offer for Symantec to below $28 a share following a closer examination of the cybersecurity company, CNBC reported. But with Symantec unwilling to accept any offer below $28, talks fell through.
Shares of the Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) sank 13%.
Symantec is the developer of cybersecurity applications for computers, networks and the cloud. It is best known for its Norton family of products. Even with Monday's decline, Symantec shares are up more than 15% this year.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), meanwhile, was up more than 1% on the day and is up 13.7% on the year. 
Analysts at Wedbush had expected the two to reach a deal in the range in the range of $26 to $28. Others on Wall Street, however, believed the offer was too high, with Jefferies saying in a research note last week that it valued Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) at $24 per share. 
The news caught the analyst community by surprise, as many had believed, given Symantec’s woes, that a deal was in the best interest of the company. 
 “With Symantec in the midst of coming off a sudden CEO departure, soft results/guidance, and a myriad of company specific/secular headwinds now is the right time to finally consider a sale of the business after what has been an arduous 14 years of ‘one step forward, two steps back’ history since the doomed Veritas acquisition in 2005,” Wedbush said in a note last week. 
Adding to expectations of an imminent deal, both companies announced last week that talks were at an “advanced stage,” with Bloomberg, citing sources, reporting a deal was expected to be announced as early as Tuesday.
Broadcom was expected to realize up to $1.5 billion in cost savings by merging Symantec with CA, which it acquired in July last year, Wedbush added. The increased focus on acquisition for Broadcom comes as the chipmaker is seeking to grow its software business. "
554,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 02:59PM ET</span>","Oklahoma, J&J to wrap up first trial over opioid crisis","By Heide Brandes
NORMAN, Okla. (Reuters) - Lawyers for the state of Oklahoma on Monday compared Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) to a drug cartel leader as they sought to hold the drugmaker responsible for fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic in the first trial to result from lawsuits over the crisis.
Lawyers for the state, including Attorney General Mike Hunter, told a judge in Norman, Oklahoma that J&J's ""greed"" led the drugmaker to carry out a years-long marketing effort that caused ""utter confusion"" about the addictive painkillers' risks.
Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for the state, said J&J knew opioids were harmful, yet minimized the risk of addiction in their marketing, resulting in a surge in overdose deaths as doctors overprescribed the drugs and they flooded the state.
""They didn't get here from a Mexican cartel,"" Beckworth said. ""They got here from the pharmaceutical cartel, and the kingpin of them all is Johnson & Johnson.""
The state urged Judge Thad Balkman, who presided over the nonjury trial for six weeks, to find J&J liable for creating a public nuisance and force it to pay up to $17 billion over 30 years to address the epidemic.
Larry Ottaway, J&J's attorney, countered its products, which had included the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, were minimally used in Oklahoma and that trial testimony showed doctors were not misled about the drugs' risks before prescribing them.
He said New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J strictly adhered to regulations governing opioids, which served a legitimate purpose, and called Oklahoma's multi-billion dollar demand ""untenable.""
""Only a company that believes its innocence would come in and defend itself against a state, but we take the challenge on because we believe we are right,"" Ottaway said in his closing argument.
Balkman said he would rule after receiving briefs from both sides, due July 31.
The case is one of around 2,000 actions by state and local governments accusing drug manufacturers of contributing to the opioid epidemic. Opioids were linked to a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly in 1,900 cases pending before a federal judge in Ohio who has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial.

Purdue and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) were originally also defendants in the case. Purdue reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma in March and Teva settled for $85 million in May. Both deny wrongdoing.

The Toronto-based lender is set to price $500 million of 3.5-year senior bail-in green bonds at a yield of 58 basis points over Treasuries, at the tight end of guidance earlier offered, according to people familiar with the matter. That compares with a spread of about 63 basis points the bank’s $1.25 billion of 2024 senior bail-in bonds were quoted at on Friday, according to Trace bid prices.
Scotiabank moved ahead with its first green offering a month after a panel of experts appointed by the Canadian government released a set of recommendations for bolstering the green and sustainable bond market, which include a set of tax incentives for investors and issuers as well as improving reporting requirements.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA,  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are helping Scotiabank lead the transaction. Earlier this year, RBC sold 500 million euros of five-year senior bail-in green bonds. In 2014, Toronto Dominion Bank became the first Canadian bank to tap the green market when it priced C$500 million of three-year bonds.
Scotiabank will apply proceeds from today’s sale toward assets, businesses or projects involved in initiatives such as pollution control or green buildings, according to the issuance framework it released last month.
Borrowers so far this year have priced a record $104.4 billion of global green bonds, compared with $70.3 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>","Symantec, Broadcom cease deal negotiations: CNBC","By Greg Roumeliotis and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Cybersecurity company  Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC) has walked away from negotiations to sell itself to chipmaker Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) over price disagreements, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Symantec's decision raises new questions over the future of the U.S. antivirus software provider, which is looking for a new CEO and has been struggling to grow its business serving companies.
It could not be determined why the price negotiations broke down. Broadcom was last week willing to offer as much as $28.25 per share in cash for Symantec and was hoping to ink a deal on Monday, one of the sources said. CNBC, which first reported the news on Monday, said Symantec was looking for more than $28 per share. 
It is possible that talks between the two sides resume, the sources said. However, Symantec has a track record of exploring a sale, only subsequently to walk away from a deal.
Prior to reaching a deal with Starboard Value LP last year that gave it representation on Symantec's board, the Mountain View, California-based company explored going private, according to the sources.
Symantec also held talks last year with private equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC about a leveraged buyout, Reuters reported at the time. Two other private equity firms, Silver Lake Partners LP and Bain Capital LP, are investors in Symantec and each have a seat on its board.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Broadcom and Symantec did not respond to requests for comment.
Symantec's shares fell 12% to $22.43 in Monday morning trading, giving it a market value of $14 billion. Broadcom shares were up 2% at $291.32.
Symantec is struggling with severe competition from nimbler rivals. Several top executives, including CEO Greg Clark, have left the company this year, and it is also being investigated by U.S. regulators over an accounting irregularity.
Symantec completed its $2.3 billion acquisition of LifeLock Inc in 2017, a move aimed at bolstering its consumer security business. That followed the purchase of Blue Coat Inc for $4.65 billion in 2016, which expanded its product line for large corporations.
Broadcom, whose chips power smartphones, computers and networking equipment, is trying to diversify into software after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration last year scuttled its $117 billion bid to buy mobile chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
The Symantec deal would have followed Broadcom's $18.9 acquisition of U.S. business software company CA Inc (NASDAQ:CA) last year.
""Broadcom buys software companies, that's their strategy. If this falls apart, they'll buy something else at some point,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.

DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - The head of the labor union representing most hourly workers at the U.S. automakers struck an adversarial tone on Monday, vowing in likely contentious talks for new four-year deals that they want to share in the companies' profits.
The United Auto Workers and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) officially launched negotiations with a handshake between union President Gary Jones and the automaker's executive chairman, Bill Ford. Soon after, the union head said his members' jobs had been outsourced to Mexico, China and elsewhere in the race to cut costs.
""With this year's negotiations, we will halt that race to the bottom,"" Jones said at the event at the Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters of the No. 2 U.S. automaker. ""We will protect our work, our jobs and our way of life,"" he added.
Rising healthcare costs, job security and the use of temporary workers are also expected to be major sticking points. 
Bill Ford acknowledged there would be ""a lot of tough issues; there always are,"" but was confident a deal could be reached. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) will kick off their own talks with the UAW on Tuesday.
The discussions come at a tricky time for both sides. 
When the negotiators for the union and Detroit's automakers last sat across the table from each other in 2015, U.S. new vehicle sales were booming. 
But sales are expected to decline this year and in 2020, meaning Ford, GM and FCA are all under pressure to bolster profits. Automakers also face rising costs associated with the development of electric vehicles and self-driving cars, although Jones said the union wanted to aid in the development of those businesses.
Meanwhile, the UAW has its own problems. 
The union has been struggling with a wide-ranging federal corruption probe. So far seven people linked to the union and FCA have been sentenced in an investigation into illegal payouts to UAW officials.
The union's long-sought goal of organizing foreign automakers has also proven elusive. Just last month, workers at Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted narrowly against being represented by the UAW. 
Jones expressed concern about Ford's growing alliance with VW, given the German automaker's resistance in Tennessee. On Friday, Ford and Volkswagen said they will jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.
The Detroit automakers also will likely point to the competitive disadvantage affecting them, with average hourly labor costs ranging from $55 for Fiat Chrysler to $63 for GM, compared with only $50 for the international automakers with U.S. plants according to the Center for Automotive Research.
One way foreign automakers have benefited is through the heavier use of temporary or outsourced employment, but Jones said the union wants to curtail, not expand, that use.
At its peak in 1979, the UAW represented 1.5 million workers. Last year, after nine years of gains, membership dropped again, falling 8% to below 400,000. The UAW represents around 140,000 workers at Detroit's automakers.
GM in particular has been a target of union ire since announcing the closure of five North American plants late last year.
That move drew widespread condemnation, including from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump. Criticism has persisted despite GM's stated efforts to seek jobs at other plants for all displaced workers.
During a speech at the union's bargaining convention in March, Jones put Detroit's automakers ""on notice,"" signaling a tougher stance on talks.
""There will be no more quiet closing of plants, no more shipping jobs to Mexico and abroad without a sound,"" he said.

During the convention, the union announced an increase in the amount of money paid to members if they go on strike.

563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Looks Like Brazilians Won’t Be Scootering to Work,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Latin America is a motorist’s nightmare. The region is home to seven of the 25 worst cities for driving, including three Brazilian behemoths Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.
Fortunately it’s also a region where technological innovation can spread even faster than padded public-works contracts. Brazilians are some of the most enthusiastic users of smart phones and the chattering WhatsApp. President Jair Bolsonaro won’t get off Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The country is Uber’s second largest market. So it’s no surprise that electronic scooter giants Bird, Grow (the newly merged Grin and Yellow), and now Lime are vying for riders.
Environmentalists and urban wonks rightly cheer the arrival of the e-scooter. What better than a small, quiet, clean-running two-wheel vehicle to lighten Latin America’s deepening carbon footprint and ease world-class gridlock? YPF Ventures, a venture capital fund founded by the eponymous Argentine oil company, recently invested in Bird, becoming the first oil and gas major to bet on micro mobility. Yet in Brazil, thanks to backward-gazing policymakers and academics, and state regulatory agencies captured by lobbies and political incontinence, nifty additions to the urban planning oeuvre are instead mostly a pricey plaything for the well-heeled.
That’s a shame. Travelers (NYSE:TRV) in big cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo spend 75% more time than necessary commuting, according to Marta Gonzalez of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s department of environmental engineering. In her comparison of five major world cities (Boston, San Francisco, Rio, Lisbon and Porto), Rio clocked the slowest travel time.
Those who rely on mass transit fare the worst. While Latin American metro systems are relatively fast and efficient, they carry just 10% of the region’s 200 million public transportation passengers. That leaves the heavy lifting of public transit to the ignoble bus—“big-cans” in Brazilian street argot—and the burden grows more onerous by the year.
Metropolitan Sao Paulo saw its bus fleet swell by nearly 28% in the decade since 2006, accounting for 12 million daily trips. Although the bus fleet pales before the city’s 7 million private vehicles, these diesel-guzzling clunkers kicked in almost half of metropolitan Sao Paulo’s nitrogen oxide emissions. 
Researchers concluded that by swapping the outdated diesel fleet for more fuel efficient vehicles or electric buses, metropolitan authorities could slash noxious black carbon and other tailpipe emissions. Yet by 2018, only 2% of Sao Paulo buses were electric.
Brazilians have taken note. In 2012, congress passed the National Urban Mobility Policy, mandating local governments to draw up urban transit strategies. Yet by 2018, only 10% of big cities had complied. So it’s little wonder that only around a quarter of greater Sao Paulo’s nearly 20 million residents are effectively served by rapid public transportation.
That’s a failure of vision at the top. In Rio, where bus companies have faced few regulatory fetters, researchers found that 80% of buses run on redundant routes. Another reason is a blackout in investment. A study by the National Association of Urban Transportation Companies showed that the vast majority of mass transit investments in the last decade were gobbled up by expanding two metro lines and creating express bus lanes. “This is more organizing traffic than building new infrastructure,” said Pablo Cerdeira, director of the Center for Technology and Society at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.
Analysts say a competitive private sector could help reset public transit. Brazil should be so lucky. Consider Operation Last Stop, a spin-off of the sprawling Carwash corruption probe. In 2017, it discovered how a handful of bus company moguls in league with shady contractors bribed authorities in exchange for tax breaks, privileges and transit concessions.
Scooters won’t rescue Rio or its gridlocked neighbors from pirates and failed planning. But they could help. According to figures from Grow, which operates Rio’s scooters, the number of scooters and users has risen tenfold so far this year. More than the latest leisure fetish, cheap two-wheeled alternatives could ferry commuters along that crucial “last mile” on the journey from the final bus or metro stop and the workplace or home. And scooters fetch a fraction of the price of electric bikes, the upscale ride for Brazil’s green commuters.
Rio had micro mobility in mind earlier this decade when it launched a network of municipal bike paths. However, city administrators and the sponsoring bank settled on a solution for leisure and sports, not getting people to and from work, and so shepherded cyclists to beaches, parks and plazas. Now policymakers apparently want to confine scooters to the same routes, leaving would-be business commuters to stray into the city at their own peril.
Brazilian cities could do better by easing regulations for scooters and other traffic-optimizing technologies. Using Waze to better distribute buses, for example, could reduce traffic in cities like Rio and Sao Paulo by 15 to 30%, Gonzalez’s team found. Getting the powerful bus lobby on board with tools that reduce demand for their services is another matter.
“Our regulatory laws and policy making are conservative and biased toward cars and buses,” said Cerdeira. “We need innovation and disruption but have a bureaucratic tradition weighted to the current players, not newcomers.”
Under-served passengers may have the last word. Though the motives for Brazilian discontent run deep, recall that a modest rise in bus fares sparked mass demonstrations in 2013 and fueled the revolt that eventually toppled an elected president. The ride since then has been anything but smooth."

MILAN (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies said it would invest $3.1 billion in Italy over the next three years, as the Chinese telecoms giant called on Rome to ensure the ""transparent, efficient and fair"" use of its 'golden power' on 5G network development.
Speaking at an event in Milan on Monday, the chief executive of the telecoms giant's Italian unit, Thomas Miao, said Italy's golden power - which allows the state to intervene in the private sector in the defense of national security - should be extended to all vendors in the European Union.
Italy recently beefed up the measure due partly to concerns over the potential involvement of Huawei and fellow Chinese company ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) in the development of 5G networks, a government source said on Friday.
Miao said Huawei would add 1,000 jobs in the country over the next three years. 
He also confirmed the Chinese company would cut 1,000 jobs in the United States. He said if the company is kept on a blacklist in August by Washington, it has ""a plan B"" to guarantee supplies of components. 
The United States has lobbied Italy and other European allies to avoid Huawei equipment and also to closely scrutinize ZTE, alleging the vendors could pose a security risk. Both companies have strongly denied any such risk.
DECREE
Italy's ruling coalition, forged a year ago between the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League, endorsed China's ambitious ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure plan in March, becoming the first major Western power to back the initiative to help revive the struggling Italian economy.
The rapprochement has angered Washington and alarmed some European Union allies, who fear it could see Beijing gain access to sensitive technologies.
In a move to soothe the U.S. worries, Rome passed a decree last week strengthening its powers in infrastructure projects that involve the rollout of the country's 5G telecoms network.
The decree must be approved by parliament in the next 60 days or it will expire.
Huawei Italia's Miao called for the 5G golden powers to be applied not only to non-EU companies but also to all EU vendors.
""It is very important that the 5G technology is neutral,"" Miao said adding that the new norms should apply ""to all players to make sure that from day one we have a safe and reliable infrastructure"".
He also asked the government to speed up its approval procedures.
""In the worst case scenario up to 165 days may be needed to get approval for deals regarding 5G,"" Miao told reporters, adding this was too long a period of time.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) and  Vodafone  Italia (L:VOD) are expected to finalize soon a deal to jointly roll out 5G infrastructure in Italy. Both companies were waiting for the decree to decide how to deal with Chinese partners such as Huawei.

Miao said that, in the meantime, the company ""is doing business as usual"" with its partners in Italy.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A senior Goldman Sachs (N:GS) banker has highlighted to colleagues the role played by rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) in failed Hong Kong IPOs following the collapse on Friday of Budweiser APAC's $9.8 billion initial public offering, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.
On Friday AB InBev (BR:ABI) called off the Hong Kong listing of its Asia Pacific brewing business, that was being managed by Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan (M:JPN), citing several factors, including prevailing market conditions. 
A further 11 banks were listed as global coordinators and bookrunners but Goldman had no role on the deal. 
In the internal email sent as the deal was faltering on Friday, the Goldman banker told colleagues they needed to call clients ""as soon as possible"" to reassure them that a collapsed deal did not mean markets were closed. 
""MS is the only bank to have played a lead role on the two largest postponed HK IPOs in past decade,"" said the email, sent to investment bankers in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. “GS has successfully led 26 jumbo Hong Kong IPOs above US$1bn as Sponsor since 2010, more than any other bank on the Street (MS 19, JPM 15),"" the email said. 
Aside from the AB InBev deal, the Goldman banker's email was referring to the collapse of the $4.5 billion sought by Chinese-U.S. pork producer WH Group (HK:0288) in April 2014. 
That IPO was pulled as investors balked at the valuation the company sought, although Goldman itself was a sponsor on that deal along with Morgan Stanley and five other banks.
Three months later WH Group successfully raised $2.1 billion in an IPO led solely by Morgan Stanley and Bank of China International. 
Goldman did not get a role in the relaunched deal even though the bank was an investor in the pork producer, holding 5.2% of the shares through its private equity unit. 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Banks fight fiercely for deals and league table credit in equity capital raising, with fees from the business making up about a quarter of the global investment banking fee pool, on average. 
Worldwide, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan typically take the top 3 spots, according to Refinitiv data. In Asia, their fortunes fluctuate more, but Goldman and Morgan Stanley ranked first and second in the table for the past two years.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 10:46AM ET</span>","In makeover mode, Burberry bets on new branding to boost sales","By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - It has a hotshot new designer known for dressing Beyonce and is experimenting with monthly product launches on social media.
Now  Burberry  (L:BRBY) is moving past its famed camel check prints with new logo-style branding meant to give its handbags and other wares the kind of covetable cachet top luxury rivals like LVMH's Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) have long enjoyed.
It's a gamble as fans of the British label digest the unfamiliar monogram - a motif of interlocking ""Ts"" and ""Bs"" in a nod to founder Thomas Burberry - splashed onto everything from hoodies to high heels.
But the makeover, part of a bid to revive stagnant sales, also reflects a growing battle among high-end brands to lure young shoppers in markets like Asia, including with instantly recognizable items they can flaunt - leading to a recent proliferation of logo-driven launches by Burberry rivals too.
Burberry's revamped image is set to get its first real test on Tuesday, with first quarter sales that should reflect the higher proportion of designs by former Givenchy star Riccardo Tisci gradually making their way into stores.
After unveiling his first take on the label last September - including twists on Burberry classics, like trench coats lined with punky rings, more than a third of items in stores should now carry Tisci's stamp, analysts estimate.
Some are optimistic that comparable revenue growth will improve as a result, from an underwhelming 1% in the previous three months to 3% according to JP Morgan.
Burberry's new monogram products, which it began pushing in May in a special collection that included $690 bum bags and $400 baseball caps, will likely only account for a tiny part of that.
But the bet is that heightened buzz around the brand linked to the launch - with campaigns featuring model-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid - should have helped spur demand for other items too.
STRONG REACTIONS
That's despite a mixed reaction to the design so far, including among Chinese consumers, the luxury industry's biggest client base, at a time when the Burberry's growth rates in mainland China have been lagging those of some peers.
""It's a reversal to the trend of designing to appeal to younger people, the monogram looks just old,"" said 22-year-old Kexin Fan, from central China's Zhengzhou city, who said she tended to buy scarves from Burberry every year.
For others, however, the print - with versions in bolder, orange tones or greens and browns - was younger-looking and jazzier than the traditional camel, black and red check.
""I now go to Burberry more, rather than just going there to shop for parents during Chinese New Year in the old days,"" said Shanghai-based Jing Han, 26.
At one of Burberry's New York stores, interspersed with monogrammed products, shop assistants said the collection had been selling well.
""Strong reactions of any kind are usually a good thing,"" one added.
Using trademarks is a minefield for luxury labels, with the risk of damaging or cheapening their image by overdoing it.
Burberry, which under CEO Marco Gobbetti is looking to go more upmarket, had only recently managed to rehabilitate its check print, so widely copied and worn in the early 2000s its sales suffered.
But brands have major incentives to follow this route too, as consumer tastes shift toward more casual clothes - creating a need for trademarks setting apart luxury cotton T-shirts from standard ones.
""There's great value from a margins standpoint from logos for a brand, the price ratio on a product goes up with a logo on it,"" said luxury goods consultant Robert Burke.
Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER), which is also looking to reignite sales growth, is using a new monogram of little C-shaped hooks, or ""gancini"" in Italian, that feature in metal form on its loafers.
LOGOMANIA
Ferragamo and Burberry may benefit in the short term from a monogram fad, as a revival of shoutier, plain logos over the past three years - sparked by the likes of Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci and Balenciaga as a tongue-in-cheek 1990s throwback - starts to peak.
According to fashion trend forecasting firm WGSN, UK online luxury retailers increased their offer of single-logo items by 15% in the first quarter of 2019, down from 48% growth a year earlier.
""Customers (are) responding well to brands who have started to use logos as a design feature, incorporating them into prints,"" said Celenie Seidel, senior womenswear editor at retailer Farfetch.

The walkout has closed at least one fourth of the approximately 400 stores that Walmart Inc (N:WMT) operates in Chile. Striking workers carrying protest signs have blocked access to many stores around Santiago.
The company said in a statement that it hoped to continue with constructive dialogue but said it also worried about ""the illegal blockades of outlets that have occurred throughout the strike.""
Lider's Inter-Company Union (SIL) could not immediately be reached for comment.
Union leaders said the key sticking point was a salary increase. As automation in stores has increasingly replaced workers, workers say they are forced to juggle more tasks among fewer employees. They have demanded the company boost salaries by 4 percent. Walmart Chile has offered 3 percent, the union has said.
The strike has primarily affected Walmart stores under the franchise SuperBodega aCuenta, and, to a lesser extent, Express, Lider and Ekono."

571,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 09:15AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Trouble Brewing as AB Inbev Pulls Asian IPO,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- If you believe that the IPO market is a decent indicator of overall market health, then you are probably a little worried this morning.
Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI), the world’s biggest brewer, scrapped what would have been the year’s biggest initial public offering to date over the weekend, the $8 billion partial spin-off of its Asian business, citing “adverse market conditions.”
It’s the second big deal in a matter of days to be pulled, after insurance giant   Swiss Re   (SIX:SRENH) pulled the listing of its U.K. business ReAssure, which was supposed to raise over $3.5 billion. Like the multinational brewer, Swiss Re also blamed “heightened caution and weak underlying demand.”
The two businesses have little in common, whether sectorally, cyclically or geographically. One is a mature U.K.-focused business – arguably a declining one - that revolves around interest rates and longevity, and the other is a punt on the Chinese middle class’s developing taste for beer. So to see them using near-identical language for their decisions should raise an eyebrow or two.
AB Inbev looks likely to face more scrutiny in the near term, as the failure is another negative judgment by the market on the merger, agreed in 2015, of AB InBev and SAB Miller. That deal, which saddled the merged company with one of the world’s biggest debt loads, has failed to generate the rewards it promised: the stock is down nearly 30% from when it was agreed, a period in which rivals such as Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and   Heineken   (AS:HEIN) have risen by between a third and a half.
AB Inbev fell 1.6% in early trading on Monday in Europe, a morning when almost all European and Asian markets were higher, profiting from some better-than-expected Chinese data on industrial production and retail sales. The Stoxx 600 was flat at 386.12, while Germany’s Dax was up 0.2% and the FTSE 100 was largely unchanged.
It isn’t unusual for buyers and sellers to vary in their opinion of what a business is worth, of course, but it’s always more difficult when the seller’s idea of the right price is colored by the price of a previous deal which looks, in retrospect, unrealistic.
That said, AB Inbev’s management may yet have the last laugh. The company’s profitability depends a lot on the exchange rate, given that most of its $110 billion debt load is denominated in dollars, and the bulk of its sales come from emerging markets. With the Federal Reserve now in easing mode and emerging market currencies strengthening (South Africa, one of the group’s most important emerging markets, saw its currency test a five-month high on the back of the Chinese data), that debt burden will be easier to shoulder. 
But while that would vindicate AB Inbev’s management on the narrower question of timing, it still leaves them with a mountain to climb in delivering their long-term promises."

573,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:46AM ET</span>","With hip hop and bumper home loans, big banks target South Africa's youth","By Emma Rumney
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest banks are betting cut-price accounts, big mortgages and offers on everything from Adidas (DE:ADSGN) backpacks to Xboxes will help them win over the youth market, which many overlooked until it was targeted by a host of start-up rivals.
An ageing client base and competition from old and new, tech-savvy rivals with lower-cost offerings have forced the big four banks to drop their fees and invest in propositions that especially appeal to upwardly mobile youth. Absa (J:ABGJ) is considering offering first-time buyers a mortgage worth more than the value of their home, while FirstRand (J:FSRJ) will launch a no- or low- monthly fee account for students.
They join Standard Bank (J:SBKJ) and Nedbank (J:NEDJ) in weighing more mortgage risk or accepting lower fee revenues in order to attract younger customers.
All four are being thrashed in the youth market by rival Capitec (J:CPIJ), which serves around 45% of the 15-24 year old market and over 40% of 25-34 year olds, according to an estimate of the banks' market shares based on a 2017 Publisher Audience Management Survey (PAMS) provided to Reuters by market research firm Eighty20.
Newer lenders like TymeBank are also threatening to lure even more young customers with fee-free, app-based banking.
Executives at Absa and FirstRand said that while not especially profitable, the youth market is key to the sustainability of their customer bases.
""It's not about the numbers per se but it's about finding the right customers that are upwardly mobile and attractive in terms of the strategy,"" said Christoph Nieuwoudt, head of consumer banking at FirstRand's retail unit, First National Bank (FNB).
The lender had previously left a ""huge gap"" in the student market but wanted to make a comeback, he continued. FNB said its new student offering would combine a digital account, bundled mobile data, deals on third-party products and services and either low or no monthly fees.
LIFESTYLE OFFERS
Analysts said the banks appeared to be waking up to the fact that a number of their customer bases are skewed toward older age brackets, and if they do not start attracting younger clients again they would have to wrestle them away from rivals later or quickly lose relevance.
""The same thought process seems to be playing out at all the big banks,"" Ilan Stermer, banks analyst at Renaissance Capital, said.
Based on responses to the PAMS survey, which asked participants which banks they had an account or card with, around 34% of Absa's customer base is 50 years old or older, compared with 24% at FNB, 25% at Standard Bank and 26% at Nedbank.
Absa, which already offers a low-fee student account, is planning to launch a mortgage product aimed at customers in their early- to mid-20s in the third quarter, Geoff Lee, managing executive of home loans in its retail unit, said.
As part of this it could offer - with strict criteria - mortgages worth more than the house itself to cover transaction costs. Standard Bank, which started offering an account aimed at 16-23 year olds and combining banking and ""lifestyle"" offers last year, has also recently started offering mortgages worth 104% of a house's value to certain first-time buyers.
The moves follow Nedbank's April launch of a digital, zero monthly fee account aimed at under 25s, promoted by a local rapper, and offering career help, DJ and photographer bookings, and deals on everything from fashion and technology to ride-hailing.
For years, the big banks have struggled to grow lending in a weak economy with high levels of household debt. But with players like TymeBank growing fast - it acquired 400,000 customers in four months - executives said the youth market was too important to pass up.
""You can't have a customer base that dies on you,"" said Cowyk Fox, managing executive of everyday banking at Absa, adding that the youth market is growing fast and has better opportunities two decades after the end of apartheid."
574,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","GSK, Vodafone Among Companies Fighting EU Tax Clawback Order","(Bloomberg) -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc,  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc and BT Group (LON:BT) Plc are among more than a dozen companies that have challenged a European Union order forcing the U.K. to claw back millions in tax breaks, adding to the list of potential EU flash points ahead of Brexit.
Glaxo and Vodafone filed separate challenges with the EU General Court in Luxembourg on July 5, a day after BT. As many as 14 companies filed similar appeals, according to the tribunal’s website. The U.K. last month also sued the European Commission, asking the EU’s second-highest court to annul the regulator’s April order.
EU Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in April said an investigation had found some corporations in the U.K. had received an improper benefit from British anti-tax avoidance rules. Amid the U.K.’s efforts to exit the EU, Vestager signed off on a decision to order the country to recoup unfair tax subsidies.
Glaxo said it challenged the EU decision after the full version was published on April 25. According to its last financial statement, Glaxo said “that the Group’s Luxembourg financing activities are properly established and operate in accordance with EU and local law.
Vestager has made the fight a linchpin of her tenure as EU competition commissioner, irritating CEOs and politicians along the way. The decision is one of a series of cases involving the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and governments over tax deals that allow them to attract big business.
At least 56 companies, including  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc, Pearson Plc and  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) Plc, had come forward since the EU probe started in 2017. They estimated their tax liabilities at about 1.35 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) according to data compiled by Bloomberg Tax. The final bills may now be much lower because the EU didn’t outlaw the entire program.
The EU court challenge marks the start of at least two years of legal quarreling in the tribunals in Luxembourg that the U.K. was keen to sever ties with through Brexit -- currently scheduled for Oct. 31 . Any ruling at the lower court could could be appealed to the EU’s Court of Justice, which would add another two years of litigation.
The commission’s April decision said the U.K. exemption was partly justified. It didn’t specify which firms unduly benefited from it.
The U.K. corporate financing exemption, introduced in 2013, allowed companies to pay little or no tax on income from interest payments on loans received from a foreign unit through an offshore subsidiary. The EU regulator said that it considered the exemption illegal when the financing income stemmed from U.K. activities.
The exemption was modified at the end of last year in a way that no longer raises concerns, the EU has said. The commission declined to comment on the U.K. court challenge.

575,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Car-Plant Closings and Corruption Color Detroit Three-UAW Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- On one side of the bargaining table will be union brass angry about plant closures and embarrassed by scandal. On the other will be auto executives sweating shrinking sales and risky billion-dollar bets to survive an era of disruption.
Thus is the difficult backdrop the United Auto Workers and Detroit Three have to overcome to clinch new four-year labor contracts. Negotiations kick off this week with handshake ceremonies that will belie the tension between one of the largest U.S. unions and car manufacturers employing almost 150,000 members.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). riled the union months ago by putting four U.S. factories on the chopping block. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and its UAW counterparts are still dealing with the legal fallout from ex-union and company officials draining millions from a union training fund to enrich themselves. And Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. is said to be prepared to ask hourly workers to pony up more for health care that will otherwise cost the carmaker dearly next year.
Here’s a look at the key issues heading into this year’s talks:
Protecting Plants
GM’s shock decision to cut off any future product from car and powertrain plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland incensed the UAW and made the company a target of criticism from President Donald Trump, Democratic candidates and members of congress.
UAW Vice President Terry Dittes isn’t going to let those factories go down without a fight. The head of the union’s GM department has said those plants “will not be forgotten” and hopes to secure work for members at every one of the facilities. It’ll be an uphill climb, especially with GM’s shuttered Chevrolet Cruze plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which it’s trying to sell to electric truck maker Workhorse Group Inc.
The union has less of a beef on this front with Fiat Chrysler, which is planning to hire 6,500 workers to boost Jeep SUV and Ram truck output, and Ford, which is currying favor with big investments to build electric and self-driving vehicles in Michigan. But the union is still going to battle for whatever job security measures it can secure for other factories even though the U.S. auto market is shrinking.
Temp Workers
The Detroit automakers were able to offset some of the additional labor cost added by handing out raises during the last round of contracts in 2015 by convincing the UAW to let them employ more temporary workers. These arrangements are helpful when the companies need extra help to launch a new model or cover summer vacation schedules.
But GM’s desire to bring on more temp workers is going to run headlong into UAW leadership, who heard an earful during their bargaining convention in March. Members were fired up about limiting use of temps because they’re paid less, are eligible for skimpier benefits and have weaker protections under the union contract.
“How can these companies -- given the uncertainty of the business and where they are in the cycle -- honor any investment commitments?” said Dan Luria, former research director with the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center, and past adviser to the UAW. “That will require some givebacks by the union -- it will have to be on temps.”
Health Care
UAW members have some of the best health-care benefits in America, contributing just 3% to their own coverage, compared with 29% for the average employee-covered family plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Automakers are crying uncle, with a source at Ford saying health-care costs for its 56,000 hourly workers will top $1 billion next year for the first time. GM pays about $900 million a year for the health benefits of its U.S. hourly staff.
To reduce runaway health-care costs, the carmakers are going to have to get creative, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research.“It’s the third rail -- you don’t mess with people’s benefits,” Dziczek said. “The membership will resist and have a hard time ratifying major cost-share changes. They’ve got good benefits and they don’t want to see them change.”
Corruption Scandal
A dark cloud hanging over this year’s talks will be the corruption scandal embroiling the training center jointly run by Fiat Chrysler and the UAW.
In what has been an slow-moving public-relations nightmare, federal prosecutors have indicted former officials for participating in a years-long scheme that the federal government has said funneled millions to ex-leaders at the company and union. Lavish gifts including credit cards, golf trips, designer clothing, furniture and jewelry changed hands as part of an alleged plan on Fiat Chrysler’s part to keep senior UAW officials “fat, dumb, and happy,” according to legal documents.Both the company and the union have blamed the scandal on a group of bad apples and insisted the corruption had no impact on their 2015 contract. Still, the union may feel pressured to put up more of a fight to prove to any doubting members that they are bargaining hard for workers.
Strike Odds
If all the above factors aren’t enough to add up to a recipe for walkouts, UAW President Gary Jones signaled in March that he means business by raising strike pay for members.
The union is likely to have trouble getting the first version of any preliminary agreement reached with a company ratified given all the pressure on both sides of this year’s negotiations, Luria said.
In the last round of contract talks in 2015, workers at Fiat Chrysler soundly rejected the first tentative deal, with just 33% voting in favor. Bargainers went back to the table and sweetened the deal.
“The first agreement will be voted down,” Luria said. “What’s the downside of voting against the first one? They go out for a short strike, get a few things thrown in and it squeaks by on a second vote.”"

That deal, which saddled the merged company with one of the world’s biggest debt loads, has failed to generate the rewards it promised: the stock is down nearly 30% from when it was agreed, a period in which rivals such as Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and   Heineken   (AS:HEIN) have risen by between a third and a half.
AB Inbev fell 1.6% in early trading on Monday in Europe, a morning when almost all European and Asian markets were higher, profiting from some better-than-expected Chinese data on industrial production and retail sales. The Stoxx 600 was flat at 386.12, while Germany’s Dax was up 0.2% and the FTSE 100 was largely unchanged.
It isn’t unusual for buyers and sellers to vary in their opinion of what a business is worth, of course, but it’s always more difficult when the seller’s idea of the right price is colored by the price of a previous deal which looks, in retrospect, unrealistic.
That said, AB Inbev’s management may yet have the last laugh. The company’s profitability depends a lot on the exchange rate, given that most of its $110 billion debt load is denominated in dollars, and the bulk of its sales come from emerging markets. With the Federal Reserve now in easing mode and emerging market currencies strengthening (South Africa, one of the group’s most important emerging markets, saw its currency test a five-month high on the back of the Chinese data), that debt burden will be easier to shoulder. 
But while that would vindicate AB Inbev’s management on the narrower question of timing, it still leaves them with a mountain to climb in delivering their long-term promises."

582,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:46AM ET</span>","With hip hop and bumper home loans, big banks target South Africa's youth","By Emma Rumney
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest banks are betting cut-price accounts, big mortgages and offers on everything from Adidas (DE:ADSGN) backpacks to Xboxes will help them win over the youth market, which many overlooked until it was targeted by a host of start-up rivals.
An ageing client base and competition from old and new, tech-savvy rivals with lower-cost offerings have forced the big four banks to drop their fees and invest in propositions that especially appeal to upwardly mobile youth. Absa (J:ABGJ) is considering offering first-time buyers a mortgage worth more than the value of their home, while FirstRand (J:FSRJ) will launch a no- or low- monthly fee account for students.
They join Standard Bank (J:SBKJ) and Nedbank (J:NEDJ) in weighing more mortgage risk or accepting lower fee revenues in order to attract younger customers.
All four are being thrashed in the youth market by rival Capitec (J:CPIJ), which serves around 45% of the 15-24 year old market and over 40% of 25-34 year olds, according to an estimate of the banks' market shares based on a 2017 Publisher Audience Management Survey (PAMS) provided to Reuters by market research firm Eighty20.
Newer lenders like TymeBank are also threatening to lure even more young customers with fee-free, app-based banking.
Executives at Absa and FirstRand said that while not especially profitable, the youth market is key to the sustainability of their customer bases.
""It's not about the numbers per se but it's about finding the right customers that are upwardly mobile and attractive in terms of the strategy,"" said Christoph Nieuwoudt, head of consumer banking at FirstRand's retail unit, First National Bank (FNB).
The lender had previously left a ""huge gap"" in the student market but wanted to make a comeback, he continued. FNB said its new student offering would combine a digital account, bundled mobile data, deals on third-party products and services and either low or no monthly fees.
LIFESTYLE OFFERS
Analysts said the banks appeared to be waking up to the fact that a number of their customer bases are skewed toward older age brackets, and if they do not start attracting younger clients again they would have to wrestle them away from rivals later or quickly lose relevance.
""The same thought process seems to be playing out at all the big banks,"" Ilan Stermer, banks analyst at Renaissance Capital, said.
Based on responses to the PAMS survey, which asked participants which banks they had an account or card with, around 34% of Absa's customer base is 50 years old or older, compared with 24% at FNB, 25% at Standard Bank and 26% at Nedbank.
Absa, which already offers a low-fee student account, is planning to launch a mortgage product aimed at customers in their early- to mid-20s in the third quarter, Geoff Lee, managing executive of home loans in its retail unit, said.
As part of this it could offer - with strict criteria - mortgages worth more than the house itself to cover transaction costs. Standard Bank, which started offering an account aimed at 16-23 year olds and combining banking and ""lifestyle"" offers last year, has also recently started offering mortgages worth 104% of a house's value to certain first-time buyers.
The moves follow Nedbank's April launch of a digital, zero monthly fee account aimed at under 25s, promoted by a local rapper, and offering career help, DJ and photographer bookings, and deals on everything from fashion and technology to ride-hailing.
For years, the big banks have struggled to grow lending in a weak economy with high levels of household debt. But with players like TymeBank growing fast - it acquired 400,000 customers in four months - executives said the youth market was too important to pass up.
""You can't have a customer base that dies on you,"" said Cowyk Fox, managing executive of everyday banking at Absa, adding that the youth market is growing fast and has better opportunities two decades after the end of apartheid."
583,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","GSK, Vodafone Among Companies Fighting EU Tax Clawback Order","(Bloomberg) -- GlaxoSmithKline Plc,  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc and BT Group (LON:BT) Plc are among more than a dozen companies that have challenged a European Union order forcing the U.K. to claw back millions in tax breaks, adding to the list of potential EU flash points ahead of Brexit.
Glaxo and Vodafone filed separate challenges with the EU General Court in Luxembourg on July 5, a day after BT. As many as 14 companies filed similar appeals, according to the tribunal’s website. The U.K. last month also sued the European Commission, asking the EU’s second-highest court to annul the regulator’s April order.
EU Antitrust Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in April said an investigation had found some corporations in the U.K. had received an improper benefit from British anti-tax avoidance rules. Amid the U.K.’s efforts to exit the EU, Vestager signed off on a decision to order the country to recoup unfair tax subsidies.
Glaxo said it challenged the EU decision after the full version was published on April 25. According to its last financial statement, Glaxo said “that the Group’s Luxembourg financing activities are properly established and operate in accordance with EU and local law.
Vestager has made the fight a linchpin of her tenure as EU competition commissioner, irritating CEOs and politicians along the way. The decision is one of a series of cases involving the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and governments over tax deals that allow them to attract big business.
At least 56 companies, including  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc, Pearson Plc and  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) Plc, had come forward since the EU probe started in 2017. They estimated their tax liabilities at about 1.35 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) according to data compiled by Bloomberg Tax. The final bills may now be much lower because the EU didn’t outlaw the entire program.
The EU court challenge marks the start of at least two years of legal quarreling in the tribunals in Luxembourg that the U.K. was keen to sever ties with through Brexit -- currently scheduled for Oct. 31 . Any ruling at the lower court could could be appealed to the EU’s Court of Justice, which would add another two years of litigation.
The commission’s April decision said the U.K. exemption was partly justified. It didn’t specify which firms unduly benefited from it.
The U.K. corporate financing exemption, introduced in 2013, allowed companies to pay little or no tax on income from interest payments on loans received from a foreign unit through an offshore subsidiary. The EU regulator said that it considered the exemption illegal when the financing income stemmed from U.K. activities.
The exemption was modified at the end of last year in a way that no longer raises concerns, the EU has said. The commission declined to comment on the U.K. court challenge.

584,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Car-Plant Closings and Corruption Color Detroit Three-UAW Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- On one side of the bargaining table will be union brass angry about plant closures and embarrassed by scandal. On the other will be auto executives sweating shrinking sales and risky billion-dollar bets to survive an era of disruption.
Thus is the difficult backdrop the United Auto Workers and Detroit Three have to overcome to clinch new four-year labor contracts. Negotiations kick off this week with handshake ceremonies that will belie the tension between one of the largest U.S. unions and car manufacturers employing almost 150,000 members.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). riled the union months ago by putting four U.S. factories on the chopping block. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and its UAW counterparts are still dealing with the legal fallout from ex-union and company officials draining millions from a union training fund to enrich themselves. And Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. is said to be prepared to ask hourly workers to pony up more for health care that will otherwise cost the carmaker dearly next year.
Here’s a look at the key issues heading into this year’s talks:
Protecting Plants
GM’s shock decision to cut off any future product from car and powertrain plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland incensed the UAW and made the company a target of criticism from President Donald Trump, Democratic candidates and members of congress.
UAW Vice President Terry Dittes isn’t going to let those factories go down without a fight. The head of the union’s GM department has said those plants “will not be forgotten” and hopes to secure work for members at every one of the facilities. It’ll be an uphill climb, especially with GM’s shuttered Chevrolet Cruze plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which it’s trying to sell to electric truck maker Workhorse Group Inc.
The union has less of a beef on this front with Fiat Chrysler, which is planning to hire 6,500 workers to boost Jeep SUV and Ram truck output, and Ford, which is currying favor with big investments to build electric and self-driving vehicles in Michigan. But the union is still going to battle for whatever job security measures it can secure for other factories even though the U.S. auto market is shrinking.
Temp Workers
The Detroit automakers were able to offset some of the additional labor cost added by handing out raises during the last round of contracts in 2015 by convincing the UAW to let them employ more temporary workers. These arrangements are helpful when the companies need extra help to launch a new model or cover summer vacation schedules.
But GM’s desire to bring on more temp workers is going to run headlong into UAW leadership, who heard an earful during their bargaining convention in March. Members were fired up about limiting use of temps because they’re paid less, are eligible for skimpier benefits and have weaker protections under the union contract.
“How can these companies -- given the uncertainty of the business and where they are in the cycle -- honor any investment commitments?” said Dan Luria, former research director with the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center, and past adviser to the UAW. “That will require some givebacks by the union -- it will have to be on temps.”
Health Care
UAW members have some of the best health-care benefits in America, contributing just 3% to their own coverage, compared with 29% for the average employee-covered family plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Automakers are crying uncle, with a source at Ford saying health-care costs for its 56,000 hourly workers will top $1 billion next year for the first time. GM pays about $900 million a year for the health benefits of its U.S. hourly staff.
To reduce runaway health-care costs, the carmakers are going to have to get creative, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research.“It’s the third rail -- you don’t mess with people’s benefits,” Dziczek said. “The membership will resist and have a hard time ratifying major cost-share changes. They’ve got good benefits and they don’t want to see them change.”
Corruption Scandal
A dark cloud hanging over this year’s talks will be the corruption scandal embroiling the training center jointly run by Fiat Chrysler and the UAW.
In what has been an slow-moving public-relations nightmare, federal prosecutors have indicted former officials for participating in a years-long scheme that the federal government has said funneled millions to ex-leaders at the company and union. Lavish gifts including credit cards, golf trips, designer clothing, furniture and jewelry changed hands as part of an alleged plan on Fiat Chrysler’s part to keep senior UAW officials “fat, dumb, and happy,” according to legal documents.Both the company and the union have blamed the scandal on a group of bad apples and insisted the corruption had no impact on their 2015 contract. Still, the union may feel pressured to put up more of a fight to prove to any doubting members that they are bargaining hard for workers.
Strike Odds
If all the above factors aren’t enough to add up to a recipe for walkouts, UAW President Gary Jones signaled in March that he means business by raising strike pay for members.
The union is likely to have trouble getting the first version of any preliminary agreement reached with a company ratified given all the pressure on both sides of this year’s negotiations, Luria said.
In the last round of contract talks in 2015, workers at Fiat Chrysler soundly rejected the first tentative deal, with just 33% voting in favor. Bargainers went back to the table and sweetened the deal.
“The first agreement will be voted down,” Luria said. “What’s the downside of voting against the first one? They go out for a short strike, get a few things thrown in and it squeaks by on a second vote.”"

587,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>","Sports Direct delays results, guidance could be affected","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailer  Sports Direct  (L:SPD) has delayed publishing its annual results, warning problems integrating its purchase of House of Fraser stores and increased scrutiny of its accounts could affect the financial guidance it gave in December.
Shares in the company, controlled by Newcastle United soccer club owner Mike Ashley, dropped as much as 16% to a seven year low of 220.2 pence on Monday. 
Sports Direct described trading in December as ""unbelievably bad"". While it did not give an update on its core sporting goods stores on Monday, it referred to complexities in integrating the House of Fraser (HoF) chain it bought last year and ""uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business"".
""HoF is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation,"" independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said. 
Sports Direct's core chain has been a relatively resilient performer in recent years, compared with a string of British retailers that have collapsed in the face of subdued consumer spending and a shift to shopping online. 
However, the group has also engaged in a raft of dealmaking that has complicated the business. It recently spent time trying - and failing - to buy department stores group Debenhams, after purchasing House of Fraser out of administration last year.
On Monday, the company said it also now controlled video gaming retailer Game Digital, ""thereby adding to the complexity of the business"", according to Bubb.
AJ Bell analysts questioned whether the acquisition spree was proving a distraction. ""Since Mr Ashley gave guidance both including and excluding House of Fraser some eight months ago, this implies that trading in the core retail business has also disappointed,"" they said.
Sports Direct said in December its core business was on track to meet its target of growing earnings by 5-15 percent in the year to April 29, 2019, but the House of Fraser acquisition would result in a drop in full-year earnings. 
AUDIT REVIEW
Sports Direct, which is 61% owned by Ashley, said the timing of its results had also been affected by a review by Britain's accounting watchdog of Grant Thornton's audit of the company's results for the year ended April 29, 2018. 
It said that meant the company had to compile more information than in previous years. 
Britain's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) last week said all of the country's leading accounting firms had failed to meet quality targets set by the regulator for auditing company books for a second year in a row, with Grant Thornton and PwC earmarked to join KPMG for tougher supervision.
Auditing has come under scrutiny after British builder Carillion and retailer BHS collapsed, and Grant Thornton was already being investigated by the FRC for an earlier audit of Sports Direct, and more recently of café chain Patisserie Valerie, which entered administration.
Britain’s competition watchdog has proposed that all but the very biggest top 350 listed companies should have two auditors in a bid to improve quality, but the government has yet to approve a law to implement this. 
The FRC has been criticized for being too soft on auditors and is being replaced by a new, more powerful watchdog.
""Sports Direct believes its accounts and their audit to be at an advanced stage,"" it said.
The company had planned to publish its results on July 18, but said it now expected to do so between July 26 and Aug. 23. 
""Sports Direct would note that its core principles in regards to its financial statements are to be conservative, consistent and simple,"" it said.

Ashley had said in December there were significant challenges for House of Fraser, but there was also a ""fantastic opportunity"" to revive the chain.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>",UK banks say business investment slowing further ahead of Brexit,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's major banks have seen a growing number of business customers delay decisions on investments and borrowing in recent weeks, as the probability of a disorderly exit from the European Union inches higher.
Britain's banks have largely played up the resilience of businesses since the June 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU, but senior executives speaking to Reuters say that in recent weeks they have seen a dip in firms' activity levels.
The country's largest lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (L:RBS), Lloyds (L:LLOY),  Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA), and the UK arm of Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) - are all set to publish half-year results in the coming weeks, with investors watching for any signs of strain.
Bankers responsible for tens of billions of pounds in business debt told Reuters that activity among corporate customers had fallen in recent months, as the two candidates to be Britain's next prime minister have both said they are ready to take the country out of the EU without a withdrawal deal.
""The world has changed a bit,"" one bank executive who asked not to be named told Reuters. ""There is a slowdown across the commercial piece. It started off with people holding off investment, now they're just not transacting.""
An executive at a second bank said more big corporates were delaying investment decisions, with the conversion rate of the bank's potential new commercial business pipeline falling from 70% to 50% in recent months, although lending to smaller firms was holding up.
The executives said they were preparing for a potentially disorderly Brexit, including refining 'early warning' systems to identify struggling clients and spot possible weak links in their supply chains.
Frontrunner to be the next prime minister, Boris Johnson, has committed to Britain leaving the EU by the Oct. 31 deadline with or without a deal, concerning firms that want to see an orderly departure to avoid disruption to cross-border trade.
RBS, HSBC and Barclays have all previously taken multi-million pound provisions against potential future loan losses if the economy dips. The Bank of England has said lenders are resilient enough to cope with a no-deal Brexit.
Banks are also braced for an expected spike in costs for meeting claims for mis-sold insurance known as PPI, which has already cost more than 35 billion pounds ($44 billion), ahead of an August deadline for claims.
Britain's economy grew more than expected in May, according to official statistics published last week, but economists warned the outlook remained weak.
Small businesses in Britain are planning the least investment in two years, a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses found this month.
GETTING ON WITH IT
One bank executive said communication efforts with business customers about potential Brexit disruption had been stepped back up after a lull following the extension of the original departure date from March 29.
This lender was trying to offer clients products to help, such as extending supplier financing and currency hedging, but said take up had been slow.
Britain's state-backed RBS has committed 5 billion pounds of its 6 billion pound small business growth fund - partly designed to help businesses out with Brexit – although only a small proportion of this has been drawn down, a source familiar with the situation said.
RBS has contacted 15,000 businesses to assess their potential exposures, mapping risks across supply chains from big retailers like Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and  Tesco  (L:TSCO) through to farmers and putting in extra credit lines where necessary.
The political impasse is frustrating lenders, who believe the Bank of England and Treasury are likely to step in to boost the economy if Britain does leave without a deal.
""I think there will be a raft of government and central bank measures to support the economy (in a no deal scenario) because they'll be needed,"" said Ian Smith, chief financial officer at mid-sized lender CYBG (L:CYBGC).
Jeremy Hunt, Johnson's rival to be prime minister, has pledged a 6 billion pound no-deal Brexit fund to help farmers and the fishing industry cope with any fallout.
Although businesses are delaying big spending decisions, this is creating pent-up demand, the executive at the second lender said.
""If I'm in my optimistic frame of mind, and my glass half full, you could get a very positive Brexit bounce, because people know all the things that they want to do, but they're just not pressing the buttons."""
591,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>",Party Mood Sours in Saudi Markets After $20 Billion Bonanza,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are starting to tune out the noise of the billions of dollars that flowed into Saudi bonds and stocks in the first half of the year after the kingdom’s upgrade to emerging-market status.
While the Saudi government has accelerated the pace of deregulating its capital markets, concerns about the economy’s reliance on oil and escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf are coming back to the fore.
The bulk of the estimated $20 billion in inflows from Saudi Arabia’s ascension to two key developing-nation equity indexes would materialize by end-August, according to EFG-Hermes. Meanwhile, the tailwind from its dollar bonds’ inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s emerging-market gauges, happening gradually over nine months through September, has largely played out, said Arqaam Capital Ltd.’s Abdul Kadir Hussain.
“Once the passive flows subside, courting active investors will be a hard grind,” said M.R. Raghu, the head of research at Kuwait Financial Centre SAK, which manages $3.8 billion. “Foreign investors will perceive Saudi Arabia as a commodity play for some time to come.”
Active money managers seek to outperform benchmark indexes by buying and selling securities. By contrast, passive funds track an index.
Saudi stocks are also getting more expensive relative to developing-nation equities, with the gap in their estimated price-to-earnings ratios near the widest since 2015. The high valuations are the reason Mark Mobius, a pioneer in emerging-market investing, isn’t joining the party.
What’s more, some investors aren’t ready to forgive or forget the murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
“The Khashoggi incident and the general structure of the rule of law in Saudi Arabia will continue to deter some investors,” said Mobius, who spent three decades at Franklin Templeton Investments before setting up his own firm last year.
No Limit
The prospects may not improve much despite regulatory changes in June that are paving the way for foreigners to take controlling stakes in sectors from banking to petrochemicals after Saudi Arabia removed a cap on ownership of publicly traded companies for international strategic investor. Although foreign direct investment more than doubled last year to $3.2 billion, it remains well below the average level of the past decade.
“Higher valuations are to some extent justified by the earnings outlook and technicals,” said Michael Bolliger, the Zurich-based head of emerging-market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management’s chief investment office. “But for this to be sustained, it is crucial that the government keeps up the reform pace and successfully cooperates with the private sector.”
Saudi Arabia’s bonds have a market value of about $42 billion in JPMorgan’s emerging-market indexes, according to calculations by Arqaam Capital. The debt might be vulnerable to increased swings in U.S. Treasury yields and concerns over global trade tensions and slowing global economic growth in the coming months, said Hussain, the Dubai-based head of fixed-income asset management at Arqaam Capital.
The securities have returned more than 11% this year, outperforming the 9.6% gain in emerging markets, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes.
“Risks for the second half are fairly elevated overall,” he said. “We have already had a strong rally in the first six months.”

592,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",Hold the beers: Budweiser APAC IPO fail shows valuations face investor push-back,"By Julie Zhu, Joshua Franklin and Philip Blenkinsop
HONG KONG/NEW YORK/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Scepticism over AB InBev's high valuations doomed Budweiser APAC's IPO of up to $9.8 billion - poised to be the world's biggest this year - investors and bankers said, putting would-be floats on notice that careful pricing remains key to success.
Anheuser Busch InBev NV (AB InBev) (BR:ABI), the world's largest brewer, dramatically shelved the initial public offering (IPO) of its Asian business on Friday, citing market conditions among other factors. 
After a week-long global roadshow, the shares had been due to price in New York on Thursday evening and to begin trading in Hong Kong later this week.
The deal was expected to raise $8.3 billion to $9.8 billion for AB InBev, helping the heavily indebted brewer reduce its leverage, and giving Budweiser APAC a market capitalization of $54 billion to $64 billion.
Sources involved in the deal said investors were unwilling to accept AB InBev's valuations for Budweiser APAC. Another source added that the reluctance led to weak orders from top-class U.S. ""long only"" fund managers - prized as long-term investors - who had been expected to place big orders. 
""The Company and banks all counted on long-onlys to make big orders,"" said one source involved in the deal, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter and so declined to be identified. ""Many long-onlys got cold feet and didn't show up on the last day as expected."" 
Brussels-based AB InBev,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the two lead banks on the deal, and representatives for Budweiser APAC declined to comment.
AB InBev shares, which closed down 1.5% on Friday after reports on a possible delay, were trading 1.7% lower on Monday, making them among the weakest performers in the FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) of leading European stocks.
Observers noted, however, that markets were currently buoyant. Last week the S&P 500 (SPX) closed above 3,000 for the first time - up 20% this year - while in Hong Kong the blue-chip Hang Seng Index (HSI) has gained 10% this year.
""This is likely a case of valuation push-back, not market conditions,"" said Kathleen Smith, founding principal at Renaissance Capital, a U.S.-based research firm and manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds, who noted that returns from IPOs had generally been strong this year.
""If these returns were negative, that would be a sign that market conditions are an issue in getting IPOs done. For now I would say we have an operating IPO market with cautious investors - that's a good balance: not too hot, not too cold,"" she added.
With the notable exceptions of ride-hailing companies  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), which are trading below their issue prices, more than three-quarters of big IPOs in New York have produced gains for investors, according to data from Dealogic.
In Hong Kong, eight of the top 20 deals are trading higher including the city's biggest this year,  Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd  (HK:3692) which is up 68%.
INVESTOR DISCIPLINE 
The failed flotation came just a day after  Swiss Re  AG (S:SRENH) pulled the $4.1 billion IPO in London of British life insurer ReAssure, citing weak demand from institutional investors.
""If investors are being disciplined on a deal, it often doesn't bode well for the after-market performance,"" said one London-based equity capital markets banker not involved in the Budweiser APAC deal. ""It's a really tricky market at the moment and you'll notice that almost all the deals that priced at the bottom of the range this year have traded down.""
AB InBev's pricing valued its Asian business at 16 to 18 times its expected enterprise value (EV) relative to its expected EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization - in 2020, according to sources involved in the deal.
EV/EBITDA is used to help investors compare companies' operating performance by stripping out the effects of different financing costs.
While ratios are also affected by a company's location, Budweiser APAC's range compared with a ratio of 11 for both parent AB InBev and for Japan's Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (T:2503), another Asia-centric beverage group, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Chinese brewers are rated more highly, with  Tsingtao Brewery  Co Ltd (HK:0168) trading at 14 times and China Resources Beer Holdings Co Ltd (HK:0291) at 19 times EV/EBITDA.
Analysts at Bernstein last week described the company as a ""high-quality asset"", but estimated the shares only offered 6% upside to IPO investors, even at the low end of its price range.

HONG KONG BLOW
The shelved Budweiser APAC deal is also a blow to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), the city's bourse operator, which is lagging behind its New York rivals in the annual battle to be the leading global listings venue.
Last month, logistics real estate developer ESR Cayman Ltd shelved a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.24 billion - then the city's largest this year. That too was due to weak investor interest because of its aggressive valuation, according to two sources involved.
The failed deal also comes as the exchange has been working to align its IPO rules more closely with its global rivals.
The city last year allowed biotech companies without revenue to float in an overhaul that also for the first time accepted companies with weighted voting rights.
It is also seeking to shorten the five days currently needed between pricing and trading an IPO - in New York, the two happen within 24 hours - which has long been a source of concern for bankers and investors worried about market moves in the intervening period.
Also, unlike New York, where companies can raise or lower their guided price range for IPOs, in Hong Kong they can only lower the range by as much as 10% - and only with notice that was not given in the Budweiser APAC case.

Sources involved in the deal said AB InBev decided not to make use of that option.

Currently, SGX has daily circuit limits during trading hours but not for auctions, during which brokers place buy and sell orders. Officials from SGX Regulation (SGX RegCo) said the regulatory unit is proposing a 30 percent price cap for the opening auction and a 10 percent price cap for the midday and closing auctions.
The proposals are aimed at safeguarding against price dislocations, Tan Boon Gin, chief executive of SGX RegCo, told a news conference.
Shares in Jardine Matheson crashed 83 percent in early trade on Jan. 24, wiping nearly $41 billion off its market value, before rebounding as its shares changed hands far below the market level.
Some brokers involved in the trade had requested SGX to amend or cancel the trades but SGX had said trading was orderly and it found no basis to cancel the transactions after a review."

LONDON (Reuters) - Surprisingly upbeat economic soundings from China lifted the global markets mood on Monday, pushing world shares toward an 18-month high and steering the Aussie dollar and copper upwards.
Investors were waiting for a torrent of second-quarter corporate earnings this week and a G7 finance chiefs meeting in France, but there was plenty to be getting on with before that.
China's second quarter annual GDP growth rate fell to a 27-year low of 6.2% as expected, but its quarterly growth reading of 1.6% was ahead of forecasts and June reports on industrial production, retail sales and urban investment were also well above expectations.
Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets had ended marginally positive, only held back by the concern that such a brisk pickup in activity may see economic policymakers ease back on the monetary and fiscal stimulus measures that were deemed largely responsible for the acceleration.
A report by Reuters that Washington may approve licenses for companies to restart new sales to Huawei in as little as two weeks also improved the mood in China’s tech sector, while a steady start in Europe left MSCI's world index eyeing Feb. 2018 highs.
""It is no surprise that China is slowing down and if you look at the other components of the data like retail sales and industrial production, they are looking a little bit better than expected,"" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.
""Traders seem to be content to maintain a bit of optimism.""
With the S&P 500 closing in record territory again on Wall Street on Friday and above 3,000 for the first time, markets are confident the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate by at least a quarter point late this month.
In currency markets, the Australian dollar, often played as a liquid proxy for the Chinese yuan, sprang to its highest since July 4 against the dollar as it ticked higher against the yen and the Swiss franc.
At 12.39%, the Vix volatility gauge had its lowest close since April. Ten-year Treasury yields continued to nudge higher, with the yield curve between 3 months and 10 years – whose inversion for much of the past two months was widely seen as a harbinger of recession over the next couple of years – back probing positive territory for the first since mid-May.
Most euro zone government bond yields edged down from recent 3 1/2-week highs in early moves, although the reassuring signs from the global economy meant the moves were small in scale.
Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield was down just a basis point at minus 0.25%, edging off Friday's 3 1/2-week high but still about 16 basis points above record lows reached earlier this month.
""The whole movement in bonds lost steam last week,"" said Norbert Wuthe, a rates strategist at Bayerische Landesbank. 
RELIEF
Commodities markets struggled to make up their minds about how to interpret the Chinese data. 
Brent crude was off 10 cents at $66.62. U.S. crude fell 21 cents to $60 a barrel, although that also came after both contracts had posted their biggest weekly gains in three weeks on diplomatic tensions in the Middle East and cuts in U.S. oil production. 
Gold slipped to 1,414.25 an ounce, drifting away from a recent six-year top of $1,438.60, but most industrial metals climbed on the data and nickel prices were boosted by additional supply worries from major producer Indonesia.
""This (China data) is a big relief. It seems that the government's support has eventually had some positive impact on the economy, especially in the seasonally weak month of June,"" said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities. 

Later in the week, U.S. retail sales and industrial production data will provide clues about the health of the world's largest economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve will release its 'Beige Book' on Wednesday, which investors will scour for comments on how trade tensions were affecting the business outlook.

The walkouts, under the motto 'No more discount on our incomes"", started overnight and coincide with Amazon's Prime Day when the U.S. online retail giant offers its 'Prime' customers discount deals. Germany is its second-biggest market after the United States.
Amazon has faced a long-running battle with unions in Germany over better pay and conditions for logistics workers, who have staged frequent strikes since 2013.
""While Amazon fuels bargain hunting on Prime Day with hefty discounts, employees are being deprived of a living wage,"" Verdi retail specialist Orhan Akman said in a statement.
Verdi said the strikes had hit Amazon's sites in Werne, Rheinberg, Leipzig, Graben, Koblenz, as well as at Amazon's two sites in Bad Hersfeld.
Amazon did not provide exact numbers for how many employees were striking but said participation was limited and had no impact on customer deliveries.
""The company must finally recognize the collective wage agreements for the retail and mail order sectors,"" Akman said. ""Wages and salaries at Amazon must no longer be determined in the style of a lord of the manor.""
Verdi also demanded that collective bargaining agreements be made binding across Germany's retail sector.
""A universally binding collective agreement would then apply for Amazon too,"" said Akman.
An Amazon spokesman said the company was a fair and responsible employer even without having a collective agreement in place, adding: ""In our fulfillment centers, our wages are at the upper end of what is paid in comparable jobs.""

Amazon runs 12 warehouses - which it calls fulfillment centers - in Germany. Earlier on Sunday, Amazon said it plans to open a new warehouse in Germany this year and create more than 2,800 jobs with permanent contracts.

599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 03:50AM ET</span>",Gilead to Boost Stake in Galapagos as Part of $5.1 Billion Deal,"(Bloomberg) --  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD). agreed to pay $5.1 billion to raise its stake in biotechnology company Galapagos NV to deepen its research into inflammatory diseases and other disorder, sending the Belgian drugmaker’s stock to an all-time high.
The deal is the largest Gilead has executed since new Chief Executive Officer Dan O’Day took the reins in March as he attempts to bolster the San Francisco giant’s drug pipeline. Gilead is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success after launching some of the top drugs of all time, its bestselling hepatitis-C franchise. Sales from those therapies have since declined due to increased competition.
Under the agreement, Gilead, which will pay $3.95 billion upfront to Mechelen, Belgium-based Galapagos and invest $1.1 billion to raise its stake to 22% from 12.3%, the companies said in a statement. The investment, at 140.59 euros a share, is 9.7% higher than the Belgian company’s closing price on Friday. Galapagos shares surged as much as 17% on Monday, reaching 149.55 euros a share.
“Gilead will significantly expand its pipeline in a smart and financially savvy expanded partnership deal with Galapagos, essentially gaining options on everything in their pipeline without having to acquire the company full out,” Jefferies analysts including Michael J. Yee and Andrew Tsai wrote in a note.
As Gilead seeks to fill the growing hole left from its hepatitis drugs, the Galapagos announcement may signal a shift in focus. The smaller biotech has no oncology programs and instead focuses on research into diseases that have to do with inflammation and fibrosis, which is a kind of internal scarring.
Gilead has also had research programs in such diseases, including through its collaboration with Galapagos, though some had speculated it may stake its future on cancer. Gilead is already the biggest shareholder of the Belgium company before the increase in stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Now it gets the option to license all of Galapogos’s future, late-stage drug candidates.
Gilead CEO
O’Day, who joined Gilead from cancer giant Roche AG, said he’s not done making good on his promise to expand the pipeline. He noted the deal almost doubles Gilead’s research capacity and establishes a strong research base in Europe where the company has historically not been as active.
“In no way is this the only thing that we’re looking at or the only thing that we’re going to do,” O’Day said in an interview. “You can look at this like it’s the beginning.”
Gilead and Galapagos held talks about an expanded partnership prior to O’Day joining the company. He was briefed on those discussions after taking the top job and within the first couple of weeks, got to know the CEO of Galapagos better. Following those talks, the pair decided to being finalizing the agreement.
Jobs in Europe
This is a “science-driven deal,” Onno van de Stolpe, founder and chief executive officer of Galapagos, said in an interview. Gilead will be taking on more of the commercial side for Galapagos, helping the smaller company to focus on research. “We can now do more of what we’re good at.”
The money being invested beyond the equity stake will be used largely to double Galapagos’s R&D staff to 1,000 from 500 over an unspecified time, Van de Stolpe said. Those jobs will be added in Belgium, the Netherlands and France. “It’s massive funding -- we don’t have a detailed plan yet on how to spend it,” he said.
The pact includes a provision in which Gilead’s stake could rise to 29.9%, if Galapagos shareholders approve two warrants. The companies were already partners on an experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis. That drug, filgotinib, hit its main goal in a late-stage study in March, triggering the Belgian biotech company’s shares to surge by the most in six months.
Galapagos shares have risen 59% since the start of the year, compared with the 5.9% gain in Gilead’s stock.
O’Day had a reputation as a dealmaker while at Roche, likely one of the reasons he was selected for Gilead’s top job at a time when the company needs to look externally to drive growth. He said that in this case, the companies opted for a partnership-style deal rather than a full takeover because full mergers can often destroy innovation as research and executive teams disband. Roche’s deal philosophy is much the same with the Swiss giant opting to leave many its units independently managed, even if it owns them in full.
Gilead spent about $12 billion to buy Kite Pharma in 2017 for its research into a cutting-edge therapies known as CAR-T. While the treatments can prove near-miraculous for some patients, CAR-Ts have yet to become large sales drivers, falling far below the revenues Gilead needs to replace declining sales from its hepatitis-C franchise.
Gilead is not the only large company with fading blockbusters. In June, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) agreed to buy Allergan (NYSE:AGN) in a $63 billion megadeal in a bid to replace its bestselling Humira, the bestselling drug in the world.  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG). faced similar questions as the patent of its bestselling cancer drug aged before Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) agreed to buy it for $74 billion in January.

An investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department into uranium imports had constricted the uranium market and caused uncertainty in the past 18 months, the company said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a memorandum on Saturday he did not concur with the investigation that found uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security and ordered a deeper review by the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group.
""We therefore expect a more measured return to market activity in the near term and remain highly confident in the long-term price outlook for uranium,"" Yellow Cake Chief Executive Officer Andre Liebenberg said in a statement.
Yellow Cake has uranium holdings of nearly 10 million pounds for the period ended March 31.

Sales fell to 1.9 million light vehicles in January-June, the company said on Monday, from 2.18 million a year earlier. 
PSA, which has notched up successive sales and profit records under Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, is due to report full earnings for the period on July 24.
In Europe, its biggest market by far, PSA eked out a 0.3% gain in sales that lifted its share of an automotive market down 2.5% overall. The Opel-Vauxhall business acquired from General Motors (N:GM) in 2017 also gained ground in the region.
""Despite the decline of the global automotive markets for this first half, our commercial teams have managed to increase market shares in several countries,"" Tavares said in the company statement.
PSA recorded sharp declines almost everywhere else, however, with deliveries down a further 60.6% in China, where the group has suffered a protracted sales collapse at its joint ventures with local manufacturers Dongfeng and Changan.
Sales volumes were also down 29.3% in a contracting South American market and 68.4% in the Middle East-Africa region - punished by the group's forced withdrawal from Iran under threat of U.S. sanctions.
After posting a 7.7% operating margin for 2018, PSA's 4.5% group profitability goal for 2019-21 still looks conservative, with many investors expecting more.

602,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",Why Budweiser and Bankers Failed to Sell the King of IPOs,"(Bloomberg) -- For months, executives from Anheuser-Busch InBev NV raced to prepare for a listing of its Asian subsidiary, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd. It was to be this year’s biggest initial public offering and would surpass Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.’s $8.1 billion share sale.
The hope had been that the Belgian company’s leading position in the premium beer market in China -- with its millions of drinkers -- would justify a target to raise as much as $9.8 billion, for a valuation of $64 billion. But on Friday, AB InBev discovered that wasn’t enough to convince investors to splurge on the King of Beers, forcing it to dial back its ambitions and shelve plans for the mammoth IPO in Hong Kong.
AB InBev’s setback can be explained at least partly by shifting trends in China, where younger consumers are increasingly moving away from traditional beers toward higher-priced craft brews and cocktails. Meanwhile, competition in China is spiking after rival Heineken NV forged a blockbuster deal with a state-owned company. All that left many investors wary of buying into Budweiser’s richly valued IPO.
“We do feel that there are better places to be invested within beer, such as Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa) or Heineken,” Jefferies International analyst Ed Mundy told Bloomberg Television on July 12 before the company announced the suspension of the listing. Jefferies had estimated a valuation of closer to $45 billion.
AB InBev shares fell as much as 2.8% early Monday in Brussels.
In its statement Friday, the company said it wasn’t proceeding with the transaction partly due to “prevailing market conditions.” The company may explore options such as selling a minority stake in the Asian business, though there is no immediate plan for a deal, people familiar with the matter said. AB InBev declined to comment.
Bold Move
From the beginning, investment banks appeared to be overly emboldened by the promise of Asia’s beer boom. Shortly after AB InBev requested proposals last Christmas, one adviser pitched a valuation of $70 billion to $80 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Seeing the S&P 500 headed for a record high and the success of some IPOs in the U.S., the company and its lead bankers at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) decided to offer a bigger stake in the business and try to raise $8 billion to $10 billion, the people said. That’s up from earlier discussions about targeting $5 billion to $6 billion.
In the run-up to the pricing of the IPO last week, it became clear that demand from institutional funds didn’t meet the company’s expectations, the people said.
AB InBev then guided investors that it could price the sale at the low end of the marketed range of HK$40 to HK$47 a share. Hours before the announcement Friday afternoon in the U.S., advisers had considered cutting the IPO’s size and relaunching the offer in a bid to rescue the deal.
However, with several funds pushing to lower the price and threatening to pull orders at the last minute, AB InBev had no choice but to suspend the IPO, the people said.
Representatives for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
Cutting Debt
Proceeds from the listing would have allowed Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito to pay down part of AB InBev’s colossal borrowings. The brewer that owns Budweiser as well as Corona, Stella Artois and other brands is wrestling with more than $100 billion in debt, the majority of it taken on to finance its takeover of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc in 2016. Now Brito has to find other ways to manage that debt load.
The CEO must also contend with rising pressures in the Chinese market, one of the brewer’s most important countries and one that is key for growth in Asia. Beer accounted for about 30% of China’s total alcohol sales in 2015 but Euromonitor expects that to fall below 26% by 2023.
While AB InBev commands 43% of the premium market in China, that’s down from 47% in 2014, according to Euromonitor. At the same time, rival Carlsberg A/S increased its share from 9% to 14%.
Carlsberg has moved into 32 Chinese cities over the years and it plans to add five more during 2019, according to Graham Fewkes, the company’s executive vice president for Asia.
The brewer also markets Tuborg and super premium brands Grimbergen and 1664 Blanc in China. “Growth is going to come from selling higher price products to people that are a bit more curious about the beer they are drinking,” Fewkes said.
Heineken in April completed a $3.1 billion investment in the parent of China Resources Beer Holdings Co., China’s top brewer, and is licensing its brand to the state-backed company on a long-term basis. That deal gave the Dutch company access to an enormous distribution network in urban and rural segments of the country, and it reported shipments grew more than 10% in China in the first quarter of the year.
To counter a decline in its bigger volume brands, AB InBev has sought a foothold in the craft-beer market through the acquisition of Boxing Cat Brewery. Still, there are clear signs that competitors are chipping away at AB InBev’s dominance in the country’s pricier bars and restaurants.
Zhou Xinyu, a 21-year-old student in Shanghai, likes to drink beer from Tokyo-based Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. with sushi. She ranks Budweiser behind Heineken and beer from China’s Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. “Budweiser is the bitterest of the three,” she said.

The European Union’s Court of Justice ruled that part of Exxon’s natural gas processing plant in Germany should be classified as an electricity generator, a decision that could result in a cut to its allocation of free pollution rights. Since 2013, utilities have to buy permits to pump out carbon dioxide while other industries get some or all of theirs for free.
The June 20 ruling, if followed by EU governments, could mean about 3,000 factories that transfer heat or electricity to the public grid may no longer qualify for all of their allocated permits, according to analysts including Berenberg Bank’s Lawson Steele, who wrote a detailed report on the impact of the decision.
“The unnerving aspect of this ruling is that this has been happening since 2013, so there’s a retrospective angle,” said Mark Lewis, global head of sustainability research at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA’s asset management unit, who’s followed the market since it began. “It’s backfiring not just on Exxon. Many companies receiving free allowances for power stations located at factories.”
The ruling may drive up the cost of carbon, already trading at an 11-year high, depending on how nations react, said Bo Qin at BloombergNEF. And applying the ruling to previous years could have a significant impact, though the chance of that “appears to be very small,” said Trevor Sikorski, an Energy Aspects Ltd. analyst.
Exxon said it was too soon to comment on the ruling.
The European Commission wasn’t immediately available to comment on how the decision may change the way allowances are distributed.
The EU’s Emissions Trading System hands out or auctions pollution permits for more than 12,000 facilities owned by utilities and industries, as well as airlines. The court’s decision, which could take months to put into action, may impact the 2020 allocation of allowances if the affected supply isn’t returned to the market, said Berenberg’s Steele."
605,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>","China Stocks Recover as Earnings, Economic Data Boost Sentiment","(Bloomberg) -- China’s nervy stock market got a boost Monday after a handful of firms said earnings are improving, while data also showed the economy may be stabilizing.
The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.8% as of the mid-day break, rebounding from its worst week in two months. The ChiNext Index of smaller companies rallied 2.3%. Official data released Monday on factory output and retail sales growth beat estimates for June, while investment in the first half of the year accelerated. That’s even as China’s economy grew at the slowest pace since quarterly data began in 1992.
Investors are now looking to the reporting season for clues on how corporate China is holding up. While some fell short of expectations, with Han’s Laser Technology Industry Group Co. and Dong-E-E-Jiao Co. down by the daily limit, others including Beijing Lanxum Technology Co. and Guangzhou Shangpin Home Collection Co. surged after saying they were profitable in the first six half of 2019.
“Some ChiNext firms’ positive first-half earnings are helping stocks especially those with low valuations,” said Zhu Junchun, an analyst with Lianxun Securities Co. “The market may have priced in earnings expectations that are too high for some blue chips to deliver. It’s relatively easier for growth firms to record stronger-than-expected earnings.”
The rebound comes just as the imminent start of a new trading venue in Shanghai raised questions around whether the market was ready to absorb $5.4 billion in fresh supply. Throw in an economic slowdown, excessive large-cap valuations and selling from overseas funds, and Chinese shares were among the world’s worst performers since Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump agreed to resume trade talks.
Some 577 companies, including the tech board debutantes, have applied to list on the mainland this year, already twice last year’s total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The number of applicants jumped by nearly seven times year-on-year in June. A surge in new options tends to drag cash away from other stocks, and the 25 tech board companies are set to raise about 20% more than initially planned.
Foreign investors sold a combined 4 billion yuan ($580 million) of Chinese equities via the trading links with Shanghai and Shenzhen last week, the most since May. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management is among those selling emerging-market assets due to worries about the trade war.
Consumer staples have been the best performers in China over the past two weeks on bets domestic consumption will hold up. The rally has made some of the more popular stocks expensive on a price-to-earnings basis, a sign that the market may be peaking unless profit growth accelerates. Liquor makers Wuliangye Yibin Co. and Kweichow Moutai Co. are near the highest multiples in more than a year. Those two stocks slipped on Monday.
The surprise government takeover of Baoshang Bank Co. in May has had a ripple effect on lending conditions, making it more expensive for corporates to borrow. Investors are concerned that small- and mid-cap companies will see lower earnings because they have to pay more for funding, said Yan Kaiwen, analyst at China Fortune Securities.

606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",Australia's ASX Prepares for Negative Interest-Rate Trading,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s ASX Ltd. is testing its systems for the trading of negative interest rate products, underscoring how markets are preparing for the potential of quantitative easing in yet another Group-of-10 nation.
The exchange has made available external trial environments so market participants can test their own processes for interest rate futures prices that are greater than or equal to 100.00, according to a July 10 statement. The tests will run through to Aug. 9, it said.
Australia’s three-year bond yield slid below 1% for the first time in June, with the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting interest rates twice this year to counter slowing growth. While Governor Philip Lowe has said it’s unlikely that policy makers would need to implement negative rates, some economists have started flagging the possibility should growth stay below expectations.
“With interest rates globally moving further into negative territory, it’s just part of prudent management to do the testing,” said Prashant Newnaha, senior rates strategist at TD Securities Inc.
The amount of negative-yielding bonds globally have jumped 47% to more than $12 trillion this year as signs that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will ease spurred a bond rally. There are no Australian securities with yields below zero percent.
The RBA cut its benchmark cash rate to 1% this month, with Lowe signaling a willingness to ease further if needed. The 3-year bond yield dropped to a record low of 0.883% in June, and is hovering around the 1% mark.
“Due to the declining interest rate environment, ASX has been investigating the impact of zero and negative interest rates on all ASX interest rate products (futures and options over futures) and relevant ASX systems,” the exchange said in a statement.
The ASX24 trading platform currently restricts orders entered in interest rate futures products where prices are greater than or equal to 100.00, while option strike listings are also currently contained to under 100.00. According to its website, ASX’s A$47 trillion ($33 trillion) interest rate derivative market is the largest in Asia.

Investment banking and broking firm Jefferies said on Sunday that it appointed Slone as chairman of Asia, a role that will focus on the financial firm's major relationships for investment banking and trading throughout the region.
Earlier this year, Slone, Wood, and a host of other CLSA bankers, including its Chairman Tang Zhenyi, left the brokerage, which was bought by Chinese brokerage CITIC Securities (SS:600030) in 2013 for $1.3 billion.
The resignations resulted from CITIC's efforts to revamp CLSA's daily operations and differences over strategy, people with direct knowledge of the matter had said earlier.
Prior to joining Jefferies, Slone spent over three decades at CLSA, where he was their longstanding chairman and CEO and oversaw CLSA's global operations of broking, investment banking, asset management, research and sales.
Other former CLSA employees who have joined Jefferies include Wood, a top-ranked equity strategist in Asia during the last two decades, as its global head of equity strategy, and Desh Peramunetilleke as head of microstrategy product.
Slone, Wood and Peramunetilleke will be based in Hong Kong, Jefferies said.
Jefferies has also hired well-known Australian banking analyst Brian Johnson from rival CLSA, adding to more than two dozen others who have been poached from the Asia-focused broker, Australian media reported last month.
Jefferies' stepped-up Asia expansion comes at a time when some investment banks are looking to reduce costs in the cut-throat competitive equities sales and trading, and research businesses in the region.
The firm has recently hired 54 professionals across sales, trading, research and investment banking in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, it said in a statement.
""The significant hires in recent weeks across our firm's Asian platform represent the next stage of growth and commitment to our firm's continued global expansion,"" Jefferies' CEO Rich Handler and President Brian Friedman said."

The country’s GDP growth slowed to 6.2% year-on-year in the April-June period, data from the statistics bureau showed on Monday. The figure was in line with expectations but lower than first quarter’s 6.4% year-on-year growth.
Meanwhile, data also showed factory output rose 6.3% in June, while retail sales rose 9.8% during the month. Investment gained 5.8% in the first half of the year. All three figures were better than previously expected.
Chinese stocks fell immediately after the release of GDP data but rebounded after the other data came in better-than-expected.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.2%.
Citing an unnamed senior U.S. official, Reuters reported that the U.S. may grant licenses for companies to restart sales to Chinese telecommunication equipment maker Huawei in as little as two weeks.
The news came after the resumption of Sino-U.S. trade talks following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month in Japan.
The article also cited a Huawei spokesman who said ""the Entity list restrictions should be removed altogether, rather than have temporary licenses applied for US vendors. Huawei has been found guilty of no relevant wrongdoing and represents no cybersecurity risk to any country so the restrictions are unmerited.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. may approve licenses for companies to re-start new sales to Huawei in as little as two weeks, according to a senior U.S. official, in a sign President Donald Trump's recent effort to ease restrictions on the Chinese company could move forward quickly. 
Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, was added to a Commerce Department list in May that prohibits U.S. companies from supplying it with new American-made goods and services unless they obtain licenses that will likely be denied. 
But late last month, after meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump announced American firms could sell products to Huawei. And in recent days, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said licenses would be issued where there is no threat to national security.
Trump's reversal, and rapid implementation by the Commerce Department, suggests chip industry lobbying, coupled with Chinese political pressure, may well reignite U.S. technology sales to Huawei. 
Two U.S. chipmakers who supply Huawei told Reuters in recent days they would apply for more licenses after Ross's comments. They asked to remain anonymous. 
A customer response management company and a firm that simulates cross-sectional radar for Huawei are also likely to file applications in the coming days, according to Craig Ridgley, a trade compliance consultant in Washington.
Out of $70 billion that Huawei spent buying components in 2018, some $11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm (O:QCOM), Intel (O:INTC) and Micron Technology (O:MU). 
""Since there's no downside, companies are absolutely submitting applications, as required by the regulations,"" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official.
A Huawei spokesman said ""the Entity list restrictions should be removed altogether, rather than have temporary licenses applied for US vendors. Huawei has been found guilty of no relevant wrongdoing and represents no cybersecurity risk to any country so the restrictions are unmerited.""
U.S. companies can currently sell goods in order to maintain existing networks and provide software updates to existing Huawei handsets, but are prohibited from making new sales of American-made goods and services.
Furthermore, not all U.S. sales to Huawei hinge on government approvals of license requests. Some U.S. chipmakers sales to Huawei may not need licenses because their products could be beyond the scope of U.S. export controls since many are manufactured abroad with few U.S. components. 
U.S. officials have sought to clarify the new policy in recent weeks, saying they will allow sales of non-sensitive technology readily available abroad if national security is protected. But they have also reiterated that Huawei remains on the entity list, and relief would be temporary.
The  U.S. semiconductor industry has been lobbying for broader relief, arguing that U.S. security goals should be advanced in a way that does not undermine the ability to compete globally and retain technological leadership. Suppliers want to be allowed to provide customer service support for chips they build and sell overseas, or the approval to ship new American-made equipment to Huawei and its subsidiaries around the world.  
Still, it is unclear which products will be granted licenses. Some U.S. suppliers sought clarity at a conference the Commerce Department held in Washington this week. 
One manufacturer's representative was told by the senior U.S. official that licenses could be granted in two to four weeks at the conference on Thursday. 
The person, who did not want to be identified, said the official did not delineate the criteria for license approvals, but she came away believing they would be made on a case-by-case basis, at least at first, as the agency seeks to form more broad opinions.
When asked about the guidance from the senior official, a Commerce Department spokesman said the agency is ""currently evaluating all licenses and determining what is in the nation's best national security interest.""
The United States has pending cases against Huawei for allegedly stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. It also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.
Eric Hirschhorn, a former undersecretary of Commerce, said the problem for government officials now reviewing the licenses is that they don't know where the administration is going.

""The policy two minutes ago may not be the policy two minutes from now,"" Hirschhorn said.

The move follows a series of probes from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as Swiss and Brazilian prosecutors into the use of intermediaries by several trading houses.
The company will continue to use advisory consultants such as security advisers and risk analysts and technical operational service providers such as port and shipping agents, the spokesperson said.

The investment in Galapagos, which comes nearly four years after the firms partnered to develop a drug targeting inflammatory diseases, includes an upfront payment of $3.95 billion and a $1.1 billion equity investment from Gilead.
""Gilead gains exclusive access to all current and future compounds in Galapagos' rich pipeline while Galapagos is able to expand its research activities and build commercial infrastructure,"" Gilead Chief Executive Officer Daniel O'Day said in a statement. 
The U.S. drugmaker will pay 140.59 euros ($158.43) per new share in Galapagos to increase its stake to 22% from 12.3%. That represents a premium of nearly 10% to the close of Galapagos shares on Friday.
Galapagos said it would also seek shareholder approval to allow Gilead to further increase its ownership to up to 29.9%. After that, their agreement includes a 10-year standstill clause that would prevent Gilead from accumulating any additional stake.
In 2015, Gilead signed a deal worth more than $2 billion with Galapagos, which included a $725 million upfront payment for the development of filgotinib, as well as an equity stake in the European firm.
Filgotinib is an experimental compound being advanced for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease and Gilead intends to submit its new drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year.
Galapagos will now have greater involvement in filgotinib's global strategy and participate more broadly in the commercialization of the product in Europe, according to their statement on Sunday.
The companies will share future development costs for filgotinib equally, replacing the 80-20 cost split provided by the original agreement, they said.
Galapagos will use the proceeds to expand and speed up its research and development programs.
Gilead will nominate two people to Galapagos' board.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC), Centerview Partners and Lazard acted as financial advisers to Gilead while Moelis & Co and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Galapagos.

The Wall Street Journal reported the deal earlier on Sunday.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Storm Barry trudged through northwestern Louisiana on Sunday, weakening to a tropical depression but dropping up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain in some places to create life-threatening flood conditions along the Mississippi River.
Barry, which made landfall on Saturday as a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity and then quickly weakened to a tropical storm, was 20 miles (35 km) north-northeast of Shreveport with maximum sustained winds of 35 miles per hour (55 kph) by early Sunday evening.
Fears that Barry might devastate the low-lying city of New Orleans like Hurricane Katrina did in 2005 were unfounded, but rain in the forecast could still cause dangerous flooding into Monday, meteorologists said.
The National Hurricane Center said 3 to 5 inches (7.6-12.7 cm) of more rain was expected across south-central Louisiana, with isolated storm totals of 10 to 15 inches (25-38 cm) in some areas.
""This additional rainfall will lead to dangerous, life-threatening flooding,"" the NHC said in a bulletin.
The National Weather Service warned that tornadoes were possible across portions of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, western Alabama, eastern Arkansas and western Tennessee.
New Orleans saw light rain on Sunday, and churches and several businesses were open, including some on Tchoupitoulas Street along the flooded Mississippi River. Streets in the city's popular garden district were quieter than usual but some joggers and dogwalkers ventured out.
A concert by the Rolling Stones scheduled for Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which served as an emergency shelter during Katrina, was postponed until Monday because of the weather forecast, the venue said on its website.
The New Orleans Police Department tweeted on Sunday: ""HELLO @RollingStones — the @CityOfNOLA is ready to roll with you tomorrow! Thanks again for sticking around an extra day — we appreciate ya!""
Sixty-five miles (105 km) southeast of New Orleans in Plaquemines Parish, part of which lies below sea level, residents received mandatory evacuation orders ahead of Barry's impact.
Emmett Sylve, 74, said the storm had destroyed his trailer home after 4 feet (1.2 m)of water poured in ""like Niagara Falls.""
Sylve's cousin Elliott, 75, said he hoped the Federal Emergency Management Agency would help provide new housing for Emmett.
""We're all elderly people here, this is our property and we don't have anywhere to go,"" Elliot said. ""We don't have the resources to stay in a motel for seven or eight days.""
In New Orleans, the Mississippi River crested late on Friday at just under 17 feet (5.2 m), according to authorities, much lower than a prediction earlier in the week of 20 feet (6.1 m), near the height of the city's levees.
Barry has shut in 73%, or 1.38 million barrels per day (bpd), of crude oil production in the U.S.-regulated areas of the Gulf of Mexico, officials said on Sunday.

No deaths or injuries resulted from the blackout that stretched from West 30th Street to West 72nd Street, an area filled with tourist attractions and Broadway theaters.
A transformer explosion at West 49th Street cascaded into a widespread outage that cut power subways, homes and businesses.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city and Consolidation Edison Co. of New York, the city's main utility, ruled out a surge in usage as a factor for the blackout on Saturday.
Neither a cyber attack nor a terrorist act were to blame, de Blasio added at a press conference. ""Definite causes will take some time"" to figure out, he said.
Activity in the Times Square (NYSE:SQ) appeared back to normal on Sunday. Traffic and subways returned to their summer weekend flow.
Broadway theaters reopened after shows were canceled the evening before.
During Saturday's blackout, Broadway performers entertained on sidewalks to delighted crowds, while a few citizens directed cars and trucks after traffic lights went down.
Con Edison President Timothy Cawley assured that its electrical system will be able to handle a pickup in demand in air conditioning in the coming days. ""We are prepared to the end of the week,"" he said. ""We could still serve the system on the hottest day of the year.""

(Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said on Sunday it is extending for a fourth time cancellations of about 115 daily flights into early November due to the ongoing grounding of the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX jets.
The airline's decision was expected after the Federal Aviation Administration, which must reapprove the jets for flight following two fatal crashes, last month uncovered a new flaw that Boeing estimates will take until at least September to fix.
""American Airlines remains confident that impending software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing in coordination with our union partners, will lead to recertification of the aircraft this year,"" the airline said in a statement on Sunday.
American, the world's largest airline and the second largest MAX operator in the United States, most recently had planned to keep the MAX, which it used on most flights between New York's LaGuardia airport and Miami, off its schedule through Sept. 3. It has been substituting other aircraft for its busiest flights while canceling others and temporarily suspending direct flights between Oakland, California, and Dallas-Fort Worth.
Some analysts have said they do not expect the MAX jets to fly again before the end of the year.
American, with 24 737 MAX aircraft and dozens more on order, is scheduling without the jets through Nov. 2.
Among other U.S. MAX carriers, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has removed the aircraft from its scheduling through Oct. 1, and United Airlines Holdings (O:UAL) until Nov. 3. Southwest is the world's largest MAX operator.
The 737 MAX, which had been Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft thanks to its fuel-efficient engines and longer ranger, was grounded worldwide in March after an Ethiopian Airlines plane plunged to the ground soon after take-off, five months after a similar Lion Air fatal crash off the coast of Indonesia.
Boeing hopes a software upgrade and new pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed.
American, which is also grappling with cancellations related to a labor dispute with its mechanics, is due to report second-quarter results later this month, with an expected rise in unit revenues as capacity constraints mean its planes are flying fuller.
However, the airline cut its annual profit forecast in April, blaming an estimated $350 million hit from the MAX groundings.
American's chief executive, Doug Parker, has been among the most vocal supporters of the MAX aircraft, saying on June 12 that it was ""highly likely"" flights would resume by mid-August."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Shares in one of India's biggest home loan and property finance companies,  Dewan Housing Finance  Ltd (DHFL) (NS:DWNH), are expected to fall sharply on Monday after the lender reported dismal results and warned about its grim financial situation.
DHFL reported a net loss of 22.23 billion rupees ($324.3 million) for the quarter ended March 31, in a regulatory filing late on Saturday. It also said it had defaulted on the interest payments due on two non-convertible debentures.
""The share price would be impacted significantly. I expect it to be down around 10-15% when markets open as their business has been significantly affected,"" said Arun Kejriwal, founder of independent advisory firm Kejriwal Research.
The company's ability to raise funds has been substantially impaired and the business has been brought to a standstill with there being minimal/virtually no disbursements, DHFL said in the note accompanying the results.
""The most concerning thing in the result is that increased provisioning amount of 32.8 billion rupees ($478.5 million), which has suddenly come up in Q4FY19,"" said Hemindra Hazari, an independent banking analyst, adding this implies either a sudden asset deterioration or that stressed assets are finally getting recognized.
""This is not a great sign,"" said Hazari.
DHFL's results are the latest sign of growing stress in India's finance sectors as state-owned banks grapple with bad debts and a recent liquidity crunch in the shadow banking industry.
This, in turn, has hurt economic growth, which in the March quarter fell to its lowest level in more than four years, presenting a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently won a second term in office.
RESTRUCTURING PLAN
DHFL has said it is talking to bankers and other lenders on restructuring its borrowings, and is in discussions to sell its retail and wholesale portfolio.
The company will submit a resolution plan shortly, which may include extending the tenure of loans, converting debt into equity, seeking additional working capital and inducting a new management team and financial investors, sources who attended a meeting with its lenders on Thursday told Reuters.
""We are in constant touch with the DHFL management and we're confident that a resolution plan can be worked out in the coming days,"" said one of the bankers involved in the recovery process, requesting anonymity.
Still, investors say the company's dire warnings about its financial situation raising doubts around the ""ability of the company to continue as a going concern,"" will remain in focus when markets open on Monday.
""The losses are not surprising but the quantum is definitely surprising,"" S.P. Tulsian, an independent investment adviser told television channel CNBC TV18.
""I don't accept these arguments about the company finding a solution in the next couple of months as that seems unlikely,"" he said, noting that DHFL's management has been trying to sell assets for the last four to six months."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has told a tribunal the local auditing affiliate of international accounting group Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu is misreading a key federal law as the firm seeks to avoid a five-year ban on new business, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters on Sunday.
Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP is contesting the government's call for the ban on the auditor for its alleged involvement in a financial fraud.
The government has said it detected several violations of auditing standards by Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate while investigating fraud at IFIN, a unit of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, whose debt defaults last year triggered fears of a financial contagion. Both auditors deny wrongdoing.
Deloitte's filing showed it last month argued the government case should be dismissed because it came after the auditor's 10-year stint at IFIN ended. The last audit it did was for the fiscal year to March 2018.
The alleged fraud began to be exposed last autumn and Deloitte said the law only allowed such a ban to be imposed if the auditor was actively auditing the company at the time, and didn't allow the government to take into account the firm's work over previous years.
India's Ministry of Corporate Affairs has countered, saying the law can't be read in such a ""narrow and pedantic manner"", according to its June 28 tribunal filing, which has been reviewed by Reuters and is not public.
""A fraud that continues till date on account of errant past auditor ... can undoubtedly be covered"" under Indian law provisions, the government said in its 13-page filing, adding Deloitte was misreading and incorrectly interpreting the law.
The law was intended to ""weed out an errant auditor from practicing so that corporate democracy, transparency and the economy of the country is not destabilizing"", it added.
The case will next be heard on Monday at the National Company Law Tribunal in Mumbai.
""ORGANIZED CRIME""
A spokesman for Deloitte told Reuters on Sunday it had been advised the government's case was ""not maintainable"", declining to comment further. It has previously said ""it has been thorough and diligent"" in its duties as an auditor.
India detected auditing failures as part of its wide-ranging probe into alleged fraud and mismanagement at IFIN, which has also been investigated by several other agencies including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and the central bank.
The auditing firms gave clean audit reports and ""miserably failed to fulfill the duty entrusted to them,"" the government has alleged, saying the fraud at IFIN was ""nothing short of organized crime, actively aided and abetted by the statutory auditors"".
In its filing, the government also said that if Deloitte's interpretation of law was to be accepted, it would mean any auditor who commits fraud, but resigns before legal proceedings are initiated against it, can't be banned in the country.
The KPMG affiliate accused in the case, BSR & Associates, has also denied the allegations and said it performed IFIN's audit in accordance with the applicable auditing standards and legal framework. BSR audited IFIN alongside Deloitte in the year to March 2018, and then was the sole auditor for the 2018-19 year. It resigned days after the government filed the tribunal case last month.
Whichever way the Indian tribunal rules, the government's allegations have already cast a shadow on local operations of big foreign auditors, who audit many of the foreign companies in India, as well as large domestic firms.
""We are already seeing evidence of some of our global clients being spooked by this and the extent of the punishment being sought,"" said a senior partner with a global audit firm."

""At this time we don't see restraint - in fact, the opposite,"" Carsten Spohr told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper in the interview published on Sunday.
""In comparison to last year, already a record year, we're expecting passenger growth of about 4 percent, (Lufthansa unit) Swiss International Air Lines is also showing growth. The discussion of climate change is not leading to restraint with bookings. People want to fly.""
Media reports have suggested a ""Greta effect"" might curb demand for air travel, referring to the 16-year-old who has gained global attention for her efforts to convince people to reduce carbon-emitting activities.
On Saturday, a group of about 80 protesters staged a ""Flight Strike"" at Zurich Airport near the facilities of Swiss International Air Lines, singing songs, handing out leaflets, and encouraging people to pledge not to fly in 2020.
There were no arrests, and the demonstration dispersed without police intervention.
Spohr cited figures from the International Energy Agency showing air travel produces 2.8% of human-caused carbon dioxide.
He is frustrated that airlines are on the defensive over their contribution to climate-changing emissions.
""We haven't succeeded in explaining that air travel influences the world positively: We connect countries, economies and societies together,"" Spohr, a trained pilot, told the newspaper. ""Moreover, for years we've been able to reduce our per-passenger CO2 emissions.""
Spohr said flights offered by discount or budget airlines for just a few dollars were hurting the sector's image.
""They're making our industry the target of criticism and clogging up the airspace, because an artificial demand is being stimulated that wouldn't exist if there were realistic prices,"" he said.
""There should not be flights under 10 euros.""
He defended Lufthansa unit Eurowings offering flights for under 35 euros, citing the need to defend its home market.
Friends of the Earth estimates aviation emissions more than doubled between 1990 and 2016, while overall emissions fell by 43%. In Europe, low aviation taxes, a proliferation of budget airlines like easyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair (I:RYA) and the rise of Airbnb have spurred an air-travel boom.
Nations including the Netherlands and France are seeking to convince fellow European countries to end tax exemptions on jet fuel and plane tickets."
623,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2019 02:30AM ET</span>","Fed Primed to Cut Rates, But Still Debating Depth: Economy Week","(Bloomberg) -- The countdown to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision of July 31 is underway with investors debating whether policy makers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points or 50 basis points.
Chairman Jerome Powell studiously avoided committing himself and colleagues in either direction in congressional testimony last week.
In debate is whether officials believe the economy needs an “insurance cut” against the possibility of a slowdown, or a more aggressive move to counteract a serious deterioration that may already be underway.
“As Jay Powell made clear in his testimony and the minutes of the June meeting further emphasized -- weak factory conditions and slowing global growth are bigger motivators of Fed easing than below-target inflation,” said Bloomberg Economics’ Carl Riccadonna. “For this reason, the recent pickups in the CPI and PPI do not jeopardize the likelihood of the Fed trimming rates later this month -- and further still by year-end.”
Fed officials are set to go quiet ahead of their decision, but Powell will speak at a dinner in Paris on Tuesday.
He will then join a gathering of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers for a meeting north of the French capital at which the trade war and economic slowdown will likely top the agenda.
Here’s our weekly rundown of other key economic events:
U.S.
Among those speaking are Fed Bank of New York President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Monday and Thursday, Charlie Evans of Chicago on Wednesday and Raphael Bostic on Thursday. James Bullard of St. Louis steps up to the microphone on Friday as does Boston’s Eric Rosengren. They will have a decent amount of data to chew over. On Tuesday, retail sales data are expected to show some slowing in June, as is industrial production on Tuesday. On Friday the University of Michigan releases its survey of consumers. The Fed’s own Beige Book, a snapshot of economic performance around the country, is out on Wednesday.
Europe, Middle East and Africa
The G-7 officials will gather nearby Paris on Wednesday and Thursday. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks on Tuesday, ahead of data on inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday. As European Central Bank officials decided what to do next, Tuesday sees the publishing of the German ZEW survey and euro-area inflation comes the next day. Ukraine’s central bank meets on Thursday and may cut its 17.5% benchmark.
U.K. Pay Growth Probably Picked Up in May
South Africa’s central bank may lower its rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% on Thursday amid expectations for another year of near-stagnation in the economy. Zimbabwe’s inflation rate may have surpassed 100% in June and could worsen further after last month’s reintroduction of the Zimbabwean dollar last month. Turkey’s latest unemployment rate will be announced on Tuesday -- it was last reported above 14% in March, near the highest level since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power 16 years ago.
Asia
China’s data dump on Monday will probably show a weakening in the economy in the second quarter on the back of trade tensions. South Korea and Indonesia central banks will decide interest rates on Thursday, with the Fed’s dovish stance increasing the likelihood of a move. Indonesia may be more inclined to cut by 25 basis points next week, while the Bank of Korea may wait until August. Trade figures from India, Indonesia and Japan this week will give more clues on how the tariff war is playing out in the region. In Australia, the unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged, giving the central bank some breathing room after back-to-back rate cuts.
China GDP, GDP  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Bloomberg GDP Tracker
Latin America
Brazil’s 2019 growth estimates are set to fall for a 20th consecutive week in a central bank poll of economists due on Monday. In the previous survey, economists forecast GDP to expand a mere 0.82% this year. The following day, consumer price data is expected to show Argentina’s inflation cooled for a third straight month in June as the economy shows nascent signs of crawling out of recession. On Thursday, Chile’s central bank is seen keeping its key interest rate at 2.5% after a shocking 50 basis points cut in the previous meeting.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2019 12:24AM ET</span>","Blackout disrupts Manhattan, darkens Broadway theaters","By Maria Caspani and Robert MacMillan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wide swath of New York's Manhattan borough was plunged into darkness Saturday after a transformer explosion knocked out power to subways, stores and Broadway theaters, but the city's main utility said it had restored most power within hours.
No deaths or injuries were reported due to the blackout, which officials said began at 6:47 p.m. EDT (2247 GMT), and darkened a stretch of the city from West 42nd Street to West 72nd Street. The outage occurred 42 years to the day from a major 1970s blackout that sparked looting and rioting in the United States' most populous city.
""I just flew over the city and most of the lights are back on, that's clear. Not all of the lights are back on, that's also clear,"" New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference about five hours after the outage began. ""It is chaotic now on the West Side, certainly.""
By midnight, power had been restored to most of the customers who had lost it, said John McAvoy, chief executive of utility Con Edison [CENY.UL]. More than 73,000 homes and businesses lost power, officials said.
Shouts of celebration could be heard in parts of Manhattan as power was restored, bringing lights and air conditioners back to life.
The cause of the outage was unclear, McAvoy said, adding, ""it does not appear related to excessive load.""
A Reuters witness reported hearing an explosion on the Upper West Side around 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), and a city Fire Department spokesman said firefighters were on the scene of a transformer fire.
Sidewalks in Times Square (NYSE:SQ) that are usually crowded with tourists on a balmy summer Saturday night were overflowing as Broadway theaters canceled performances. The lights of nearby Radio City Music Hall were dark.
In an attempt to cheer up customers, the cast of the musical ""Come From Away"" performed a song in front of the stage door. Other musicals' cast members also staged street-side performances.
With traffic lights out, cars and taxis jammed intersections as emergency vehicles and fire engines with sirens blaring tried to pass. In some places, civilians stepped in to direct traffic, including one who employed a toy light saber.
New York has endured large-scale blackouts before, most recently following Superstorm Sandy in 2012 as well as the widespread 2003 blackout across the U.S. Northeast that left most of the city without power for a day.
A New York blackout that crippled the city during a heat wave on July 13, 1977, sparked rioting and looting. Power was not restored until the next day.
'ARE YOU OK?'
Memories of the violence during the 1977 blackout spooked some tourists visiting the city, including Dave and Dara Campbell, of Gilbert, Arizona.
""People from home were texting us, asking, 'Are you OK?'"" said Dara Campbell, 40.
Cuomo sent 100 State Police officers and some National Guard troops to help with traffic control.
As darkness fell just before 9 p.m. (0100 GMT), people on the Upper West Side had to use their mobile phone flashlights to negotiate normally brightly lit streets. There were reports of people trapped in building elevators without power.
Subways throughout the city were affected by the outage, with some lines skipping stations that lacked power and even lines in other boroughs diverted.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was in Iowa campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination when the outage struck, told CNN said he had spoken with the police commissioner and the deputy commissioner responsible for counterterrorism.
""From what we're seeing at this moment, this is simply a mechanical problem,"" de Blasio said.
With some stations and traffic lights dark, many residents and visitors alike took to the streets and walked, according to social media posts, many of which had the hashtag #blackoutnyc.
Emerging from a subway station next to Central Park, Jeff O'Malley, a consultant who lives in Manhattan, said he was stuck in a subway car for more than an hour.
""We were stuck for about 75 minutes,"" said O'Malley, 57. ""It's completely dark. People had to use the flashlights on their phones to see their way out."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. luxury department store operator Barneys New York Inc is exploring options that include a bankruptcy filing, as it struggles with high rents and changing consumer tastes, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.
The nearly 100-year-old retailer, known for its high-end designer collection, is working with law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP to prepare for a potential bankruptcy filing that could come in the coming weeks, one of the sources said.
Barneys has not yet made a final decision on whether or not to seek bankruptcy protection, and is weighing other possible solutions for addressing high rents that are straining its business, the sources cautioned. Filing for bankruptcy would be one option to deal with expensive leases, the sources said.
The retailer's flagship department store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan has weighed on its finances, one of the sources said. The sources asked not be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
""At Barneys New York, our customers remain our top priority and we are committed to providing them the excellent services, products, and experiences they have come to expect,"" the company said in a statement.
""We continue to work closely with all of our business partners to achieve the goals we’ve set together and maximize value. To that end, our board and management are actively evaluating opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and ensure the sustainable, long-term growth and success of our business,"" the company added.
Should it file for bankruptcy, Barneys would be one of the most high-profile victims of the downturn in retail, and underscore how even luxury department stores are not immune from fierce competition with e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Sears Holdings Inc, Toys ""R"" Us Inc and Gymboree Group Inc have also filed for bankruptcy in roughly the past year. 
In addition to its upscale department stores, Barneys operates Barneys Warehouse outlets, as well as Freds restaurants. In all, Barneys has 28 locations, according to its website. Its most prominent locations include Beverly Hills, California; Chicago; Seattle; Boston; San Francisco; and Las Vegas. 
Barneys made its name in the 1930s by placing women dressed in barrels outside beer halls in New York City, where they would hand out matchbooks advertising the store, according to the retailer's website.

The store, now known for exclusive apparel made by designers such as  Burberry  Group Plc (L:BRBY), began as a destination for middle-class families. It transitioned to luxury fashion in the 1960s.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump declined to issue quotas for domestic uranium production late on Friday and instead ordered a 90-day governmental review, a decision praised by U.S. nuclear power generators who fear curbs on fuel imports would boost costs. 
Trump said in a memorandum he did not concur with a U.S. Commerce Department investigation that found uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security.
While Trump said the department's findings ""raise significant concerns"", he ordered a deeper review by the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group, with input from several government agencies. ""A fuller analysis of national security considerations with respect to the entire nuclear fuel supply chain is necessary,"" the memorandum said.
The group will make ""recommendations to further enable domestic nuclear fuel production if needed,"" it said.
The U.S. nuclear power industry faces a rash of closures amid rising security costs and competition from plants that run on cheap natural gas.
Political factors likely weighed in Friday's decision, which analysts at ClearView Energy Partners said ""may be a harbinger of future White House willingness to intervene into other ...relevant energy policy issues"" in critical swing states ahead of the 2020 election. 
Pennsylvania, the fifth most populous U.S. state, has five nuclear power plants, for example. 
DECISION PRAISED BY NUCLEAR POWER COMPANIES
The United States sourced just 7% of its uranium domestically in 2017, with most of the rest coming from Canada, Australia and Russia, according to the Energy Information Administration.
U.S. uranium mining firms, as well as more than two dozen western state lawmakers, have argued that nuclear generators rely heavily on adversaries such as Russia, China and Kazakhstan for uranium supply from their state-owned companies, who flood the market.
Petitions from Colorado-based  Energy Fuels  Inc (A:UUUU) and Wyoming-based Ur-Energy Inc (A:URG) seek quotas requiring 25% of the U.S. uranium market be sourced domestically.
Last year, the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service approved the expansion of Energy Fuels’ La Sal and Daneros mines, the latter of which is located just outside the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.
Electric utility companies with nuclear power plants, including  Duke Energy  (N:DUK) and Entergy (N:ETR), fought hard against the miners' petitions, arguing that their costs would spike if they were forced to source uranium domestically.
A group of nuclear power generators, called the Ad Hoc Utilities Group, said it was pleased with Trump's decision. ""It is clear the Trump administration recognizes the enormous economic and resiliency benefits that the U.S. nuclear energy industry provides to Americans,"" the group said in a release.

Allahabad Bank said in a statement that it had told the Reserve Bank of India, the nation's central bank, that it had identified a fraud worth $259 million in Bhushan's accounts.
On July 6, state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) said it had reported an alleged fraud of $554.6 million in the steelmaker's accounts.
""It has been observed that the company has misappropriated bank funds, manipulated books of accounts to raise funds from consortium lender banks,"" Allahabad Bank said in its statement, adding that it had made provisions of about $131 million against the bank's exposure.
Bhushan Power and Steel, one of India's most indebted companies, was among the first 12 companies referred by the RBI to a bankruptcy court for a debt resolution process under India's new insolvency law.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government introduced new bankruptcy resolution rules in 2016 to help with faster resolution of bad loans, but litigation has tied down some big restructuring deals.
To revive the banking sector the Indian government has injected about $36 billion of taxpayers' money into the banks in the past five years and initiated an asset quality review by the central bank.
Only about 5% of the stressed assets of banks have so far been dealt with through the bankruptcy process.
Bhushan Power & Steel could not be immediately reached for comment on the latest allegation."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A World Bank arbitration court has ordered the Pakistani government pay damages of $5.8 billion to Tethyan Copper, a joint venture between Chile's  Antofagasta  Plc (L:ANTO) and Canada's Barrick Gold (TO:ABX), the Chilean miner said late on Friday.
Tethyan Copper discovered vast mineral wealth more than a decade ago in Reko Diq, at the foot of an extinct volcano near Pakistan's frontier with Iran and Afghanistan. The deposit was set to rank among the world's biggest untapped copper and gold mines.
The company said it had invested more than $220 million by the time Pakistan's government, in 2011, unexpectedly refused to grant them the mining lease needed to keep operating.
The World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled against Pakistan in 2017, but until now had yet to determine the damages owed to Tethyan.
Tethyan board chair William Hayes said in a statement the company was still ""willing to strike a deal with Pakistan,"" but added that ""it would continue protecting its commercial and legal interests until the dispute was over.""
The Reko Diq mine has become a test case for Prime Minister Imran Khan's ability to attract serious foreign investment to Pakistan as it struggles to stave off an economic crisis that has forced it to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout.
Pakistan's military sees Reko Diq as a strategic national asset and had taken a key role in its development amid the dispute with Antofagasta and Barrick, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this year."

Thai public prosecutor filed criminal charges in 2017 against Philip Morris Thailand for under-declaration of more than 780 entries of cigarettes that cleared Thai customs between 2002 and 2003.
In a second ruling since 2018, the WTO said on Friday that Thailand had not met obligations under the Customs Valuation Agreement, regarding the valuation of cigarettes imported by Philip Morris Thailand from Philip Morris subsidiaries in the Philippines and Indonesia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said late on Friday it was issuing final rules to suspend a 2016 Obama administration regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements.
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust a wide range of civil penalties to account for inflation and, in response, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under President Barack Obama issued rules to eventually raise fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of the required standards.
Automakers protested the hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually.
After a group of states and environmental groups filed suit, the Trump administration began the process of formally undoing the Obama regulation and first proposed the freeze in 2018.
In a statement late on Friday, NHTSA said it was faithfully following the intent of Congress to ensure the penalty rate was set at the level required by statute.
It expected this final rule to significantly cut the future burden on industry and consumers by up to $1 billion a year, it added.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) and others, had said it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually.
Late on Friday, Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the group, praised the decision, saying NHTSA's ""own model clearly shows the significant economic harm that such a dramatic and unjustified increase in penalties would have on auto manufacturers, workers, and ultimately consumers.""
The prior administration had ""failed to take into account the significant economic harm that would result,"" she added.
Automakers argued the increases would dramatically raise costs, since they would also boost the value of fuel economy credits that are used to meet requirements.
In September 2017, three environmental groups and some U.S. states including New York and California sued NHTSA for putting the Obama rules on hold.
Last year, the states said, ""If the penalty is not sufficiently high, automakers lack a vital incentive to manufacture fuel-efficient vehicles.""
Some automakers historically have paid fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements - including some luxury automakers like Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).
In February, Fiat Chrysler told Reuters it paid $77 million in U.S. civil penalties in 2018 for failing to meet 2016 model year fuel economy requirements.
Fiat Chrysler welcomed the decision.
It ""enables us to continue our significant investment plans in both our U.S. manufacturing footprint and new technologies required to maintain our trajectory of improved fuel-efficiency,"" the carmaker said in a statement late on Friday.
Environmental groups urge the administration to retain the increase, noting U.S. fuel economy fines have lost nearly 75% of their original value because the fines have only been increased once -- from $5 to $5.50 in 1997 -- in more than four decades.
The move comes as NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency are working to finalize a rewrite of the Obama administration's fuel efficiency requirements through 2026 in the coming months.
In August 2018, the administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements and stripping California of the right to set its own vehicle-emissions rules.
The final regulation faces a multi-year legal battle that could leave automakers in limbo about future emissions and fuel-efficiency requirements.
The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel-efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration's preferred option.
Last month, 17 major automakers urged a compromise ""midway"" between the Obama-era standards that require annual decreases of about 5% in emissions and the Trump administration's proposal.

Reuters reported in April that officials expect the final rule will include a small increase in yearly fuel-efficiency requirements.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2019 12:04AM ET</span>","Union Pacific, other freight co earnings eyed for tariff effects","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Results from two major U.S. railroads next week are likely to attract more scrutiny than usual as investors look for signs of how deeply U.S. President Donald Trump's multi-front trade war is affecting freight companies and the wider economy.
Among those reporting as the second quarter earnings season kicks off next week are  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) on Thursday and Kansas City Southern (N:KSU) on Friday, amid worries that new U.S. import tariffs threatened by the Trump administration could also herald weakening demand for goods movers, including truckers, container companies and package carriers. 
There is even talk of a ""freight recession"" and investors look to the transportation sector as a barometer of U.S. economic health.
The S&P 500 (SPX), which crossed the 3,000 mark for the first time this week, has seesawed between record highs and selloffs in recent months on increasing U.S.-China trade acrimony and concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown. 
""If these companies come out with reports that confirm people's concerns about tariffs and inventory build-up, that won't be good for the market,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. 
Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific operates a 32,000-route-mile rail network that includes the Los Angeles/Long Beach complex, a port responsible for most of the U.S.-China cargo flow. 
Tariffs have already affected the company's bottom line. In the first quarter, overall freight volume fell, hurt by a 7% reduction in grain carloads driven by reduced exports to China. 
In June, CEO Lance Fritz told Reuters the trade war is ""a significant threat"" to Union Pacific's outlook. 
Kansas City Southern is expected to report year-on-year earnings and revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, according to Refinitiv data. 
The company's U.S.-Mexico cross-border traffic contributes a large share of its revenue, and investors will be listening closely to the company's guidance for any mention of the tariffs on Mexican imports threatened by President Trump in late May.
Road and rail stocks have handily outperformed the broader market since Trump fired the trade war's opening salvo in January 2018. 
(Graphic: Road and rail stocks - https://tmsnrt.rs/2NSH9cx)
But that could be attributable in part to companies beefing up their inventories, which have been steadily on the rise as companies ""front load"" imports to stay ahead of potential tariff-related price hikes.
Shipping container volumes jumped in late 2018 ahead of threatened tariffs, with container imports spiking 13% in both October and December, followed by a weak first quarter, according to data provided by ACT Research. 
This was followed by a weak first quarter, when container volume plummeted as businesses drew down their bloated inventories and freight demand softened.
""U.S. freight volumes were down on both trucks and rails in the first half of 2019 – a freight recession,"" said Tim Donoyer, vice president of ACT Research in Columbus, Indiana.
The trend is well-illustrated by the Cass Shipments Index, which shows year-on-year U.S. freight volume has been on the decline since December.
(Graphic: Cass Shipments Index - https://tmsnrt.rs/32pE0UP)
Falling freight demand has been particularly hard on truckers, who account for approximately 70% of U.S. shipment tonnage. The Dow Jones U.S. Trucking Index (DJUSTK) has significantly underperformed the broader market this year, gaining 4.9% compared with the S&P 500's 19.4% advance.
ACT Research's index of truck carrier volumes has been in contraction territory since February, and the latest data shows May volumes hitting the lowest level in nearly three years.
JB Hunt Transport Services Inc (O:JBHT), a trucking company due to report on Monday, is now seen posting second quarter earnings growth of 1.7%, down from the 15.2% jump analysts expected just six months ago when the inventory build-up was in full-swing.
Package deliverers have perhaps the most exposure to the tariff dispute because of the international scope of their operations.
FedEx Inc (N:FDX), a global economic bellwether that has beefed up its international capacity by 19% since 2016, according to a Bernstein analysis, is beginning to feel the trade war's sting.
On June 25, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, but on its earnings call the company's chief financial officer Alan Graf warned ""our fiscal 2020 performance is being negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production.""
 United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), expected to report on July 24, is now seen posting earnings of $1.93 per share, down 0.5% from a year ago, and 5.4% lower than analysts expected in January.

""The key to this market is transportation stocks,"" Carlson added. ""The reports next week will provide a pretty nice window into how these companies are responding to tariffs.""

632,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 09:51PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators approve $5 billion Facebook settlement over privacy issues: source,"By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved a roughly $5 billion settlement with Facebook Inc this week over its investigation into the social media company's handling of user data, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.
The FTC has been investigating allegations Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the data sharing violated a 2011 consent agreement between Facebook and the regulator.
Investors cheered news of the deal and pushed Facebook shares up 1.8%, while several powerful Democratic lawmakers in Washington condemned the proposed penalty as inadequate.
The FTC is expected to include in the settlement other restrictions on how Facebook treats user privacy, according to the Wall Street Journal, which also said that the agency vote was along party lines, with three Republicans voting to approve it and two Democrats opposed.
The settlement would be the largest civil penalty ever paid to the agency.
The FTC and Facebook declined to comment.
Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and chair of a congressional antitrust panel, called the $5 billion penalty ""a Christmas present five months early.""
""This fine is a fraction of Facebook's annual revenue. It won't make them think twice about their responsibility to protect user data,"" he said.
Facebook's revenue for the first quarter of this year was $15.1 billion while its net income was $2.43 billion. It would have been higher, but Facebook set aside $3 billion for the FTC penalty.
While the deal resolves a major regulatory headache for Facebook, the Silicon Valley firm still faces further potential antitrust probes as the FTC and Justice Department undertake a wide-ranging review of competition among the biggest U.S. tech companies.
It is also facing public criticism from President Donald Trump and others about its planned cryptocurrency Libra over concerns about privacy and money laundering.
The Cambridge Analytica missteps, as well as anger over hate speech and misinformation on its platform, have also prompted calls from people ranging from presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren to a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, for the government to force the social media giant to sell Instagram, which it bought in 2012, and WhatsApp, purchased in 2014.
But the company's core business has proven resilient, as Facebook blew past earnings estimates in the past two quarters.
While details of the agreement are unknown, in a letter to the FTC earlier this year, Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Republican, told the agency that even a $5 billion civil penalty was too little and that top officials, potentially including founder Mark Zuckerberg, should be held personally responsible.
FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, has said the agency should hold executives responsible for violations of consent decrees if they participated in the violations. Chopra did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.
The settlement still needs to be finalized by the Justice Department's Civil Division and a final announcement could come as early as next week, the source said.
A source knowledgeable about the settlement negotiations had told Reuters in May any agreement would put Facebook under 20 years of oversight."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - France's  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) on Friday said it will no longer finance U.S. private prison operators, the first foreign bank to distance itself from a sector shunned by domestic peers amid controversy over Trump administration detention policies.
Company spokesman Ilias Catsaros told Reuters of the change in policy. The decision does not effect existing contractual agreements.
Banks have been under pressure to cut ties with the private prison industry since U.S. President Donald Trump’s restrictions on immigration raised concerns about detention center conditions. The centers account for about two-thirds of the people held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, S&P Global Ratings estimated last year.
BNP Paribas is one of several banks that have underwritten bonds or syndicated loans for at least one of the major private U.S. prison operators, CoreCivic Inc (N:CXW) and GEO Group Inc. (N:GEO) Last year lenders raised roughly $1.8 billion for CoreCivic and GEO Group, according to Refinitiv data.
Earlier this year, SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) made similar commitments to phase out lending to private prison companies.
Private prison operators have argued that activists mischaracterize the nature of their facilities, and called the decisions politically motivated. "

The announcement in a company tweet https:// came after President Donald Trump gave a 30-minute speech on trade at the plant, which is run by Derco, a unit of the F-35 fighter jet maker.
Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said the company planned to hire 18,000 people overall this year and gave much of the credit for the expansion to Trump, as she made remarks introducing the president.
""The main reason for that, Mr. President, is because of the pro-growth policies that you have put in place on tax reform and regulatory reform,"" she said.
In his remarks, Trump thanked Hewson for her decision to keep open a Sikorsky helicopter plant in Pennsylvania that had been slated for closure. Trump called Hewson's decision ""a beautiful favor"" and said, ""They’re really happy in Pennsylvania right now.""
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are expected to be critical to Trump's re-election effort next year.
Hewson, in an announcement on Wednesday, said she reversed course on Sikorsky ""at the request of President Trump.""
This week was not the first time that Lockheed has responded to pressure from Trump. Shortly before Trump took office in January 2017, Hewson said Lockheed was close to a deal to significantly lower the cost of the F-35, after Trump the prior month had said he was asking rival aerospace company Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co if it could offer a cheaper alternative to the fighter aircraft. [D-REUTERSNEWS-T004/I8855d940d9be11e6a1e9955aa2f1af39]
Trump has campaigned on rebuilding the manufacturing sector to create high-paying American manufacturing jobs, partly by pushing other countries for more favorable terms on trade.

Derco, which makes aircraft spare parts, also provides logistics and technical support for fixed-wing planes.

635,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 05:49PM ET</span>","Stocks – S&P Closes Above 3,000 as Wall Street's Rally on Rate Hopes Continues","Investing.com – The very merry July stock market rally bubbled along Friday with the major averages all setting new highs and the S&P 500 closing above 3,000 for the first time.
The S&P 500 closed up 0.46% after hitting a new high of 3,013.62 . The Dow industrials finished up 0.9% after its second 200-point gain in two days; Friday's gain was 244 points. The blue-chip index hit a new high of 27,333.79. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6% along with a new high of 8,246.
The rally was fueled by the intense belief the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its July 30-31 meeting. Lower rates boost the value of stocks and bonds.
For several weeks, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled a rate cut is coming. He told Congress twice this week the central bank stands ready to ""act as appropriate"" to support the economic expansion, now in its 10th year. Stocks have been rising as a result. His concern -- and the Fed's -- has been prompted by slowing business investment, slow wage growth and the Trump Administration's trade policies, particularly its trade battle with China.
Interest rates, in fact, moved slightly lower Friday, with the 10-Year Treasury dropping 0.3% to 2.113%. The yield has fallen more than 20% this year.
Oil prices moved up slightly on Friday, despite skepticism that the current rally may not last. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended up 1 cent at $60.21 a barrel. Brent Oil Futures settled up 20 cents to $66.72.
The stock rally was largely led by non-tech stocks, especially industrial stocks including Dow (NYSE:DOW),   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Boeing NYSE:BA).
Chip stocks moved higher, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 1.9%. Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also was a winner, up 2.7%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose 1.8% as The Wall Street Journal reported the Federal Trade Commission has approved a $5 billion fine over its investigation into the social media company's handling of user data. Shares were up another 0.2% after hours.
Pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks were lower, with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) slumping on a report that a federal grand jury is investigating if the company lied about the presence of asbestos in its talcum powder. J&J, Merck (NYSE:MRK) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) were the Dow losers.

SAO PAULO/Brasilia (Reuters) -  Belo Sun Mining Corp  (TO:BSX) said on Friday it had won a legal victory in its push to mine the country's largest undeveloped gold deposit in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, which has drawn criticism from environmentalists and indigenous advocates.
But the public prosecutor's office that is seeking to block the mine disagreed with that interpretation of the ruling.
Felicio Pontes, a federal prosecutor on the case, said the appeals court had merely rejected a request for a preliminary judgment and the merits of the case have yet to be judged.
No work can proceed on the mine in the meantime, he said, predicting that the court would rule in the case by November.
""We tried to force a preliminary decision by the court ... but it said no, it's better to wait for the judgment of the appeal,"" Pontes said.
""This ruling didn't change anything, the situation is stable.""
A representative for Belo Sun acknowledged that ""the decision is only temporary.""
Belo Sun said in its statement that the appeals court ruling indicated that the state of Para was the appropriate authority to grant an environmental license for the project. Prosecutors had argued that the mine needed a license from federal environmental agency Ibama, winning an initial judgment in a lower court.
The Canadian miner has already received state licensing for the project, adjacent to the massive Belo Monte hydroelectric dam on a tributary of the Amazon river.
If courts ultimately rule that Belo Sun must seek a federal license, it would likely delay the project for years.
Belo Sun shares fell 4.1% on the Toronto stock exchange, wiping out early gains.
The miner separately must still deliver a new study on the impact on nearby indigenous communities of the project
Brazilian nonprofit Instituto Socioambiental, which is documenting the impact of the Belo Monte dam on nearby tribes, has warned that the chemicals and mining waste involved in the Belo Sun project pose serious risks to natives' way of life.
Belo Sun's proposed mine in Volta Grande has 3.8 million ounces of gold in proven and probable reserves and is the country's largest undeveloped gold deposit, according to the company's website.
The company estimates the mine would produce 260,000 ounces of gold annually over the first 10 years of its roughly 17-year lifespan. That is equivalent to 5.2% of Brazil's annual production of gold, according to the latest statistics from mining regulator ANM."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - All three major indexes posted record closing highs on Friday as firm expectations for an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve continued to propel shares while investors awaited next week's kickoff of the corporate earnings season.
The S&P 500 closed above the 3,000 level for the first time, with the industrial (SPLRCI), consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and materials (SPLRCM) sectors each posting gains of at least 1%.
In his two-day testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy was still under threat from disappointing factory activity, tame inflation and a simmering trade war and that the central bank stood ready to ""act as appropriate.""
""Clearly his messaging was far more directive in terms of what the Fed is going to do at the next meeting than just a vague promise to keep the economic expansion intact,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""That has brought the market to new highs.""
With expectations for rate cuts in place, the focus is turning to the corporate earnings season as large U.S. banks, including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), are set to report next week.
Analysts estimate that S&P 500 companies will report a 0.4% dip in second-quarter earnings, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 243.95 points, or 0.9%, to 27,332.03, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 13.86 points, or 0.46%, to 3,013.77 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 48.10 points, or 0.59%, to 8,244.14.
For the week, the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow added 1.5% and the Nasdaq gained 1%.
Data for U.S. producer prices in June showed the smallest annual increase in producer inflation in nearly 2-1/2 years and a slowdown in underlying producer prices, which suggested that overall inflation could remain moderate for a while.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) shares gained 2.65% after the automaker and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) said they would join forces to develop autonomous and electric cars. 
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) shares slid 4.1% after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Justice Department is pursuing a criminal probe into whether the healthcare conglomerate lied about potential cancer risks of its talcum powder.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 04:06PM ET</span>",AB InBev Asia delays pricing world's largest IPO this year: sources,"By Julie Zhu, Joshua Franklin and Jessica DiNapoli
HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) said on Friday it will not proceed with the planned listing in Hong Kong of its Asia Pacific unit,  Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd  (HK:1876), in what would have been the world's biggest initial public offering of 2019.
The IPO was considered a barometer for future large share sales. AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, had aimed to sell as much as $9.8 billion in stock to raise raised much-needed funds for the company to cut its debt heavy burden. 
The canceled IPO is also a big setback to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which had hoped Budweiser's listing would help attract other high-profile international companies. 
AB InBev said the decision was due to ""several factors, including the prevailing market conditions."" The company's stock was down around 4% in after-market trading. 
The cancellation, against the backdrop of a protracted U.S.-China trade war, sets a downbeat tone for large Hong Kong listings.
Budweiser APAC, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, had received offers for shares within its targeted range from hedge funds and private wealth managers, but some large long-only U.S. investors, which are often prioritized in an IPO, made offers below the HK$40 per share level, people familiar with the matter said.
The shares were being sold in an indicative range of HK$40-HK$47,
IPOs on Hong Kong exchanges are only able to price up to 10% below the target range without regulatory approval if the risk is flagged in the prospectus. 
This was not sufficiently highlighted in the Budweiser filing so AB InBev held firm on the HK$40 price, meaning some U.S. investors trimmed the size of their orders, sources said. 
HIGHLY LEVERAGED PARENT
The company's executives and representatives from the deal's co-sponsors, JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), met in New York to discuss pricing after the books closed on Thursday.
People familiar with the issue said it was struggling to secure enough demand from long-term investors.
Typically investors put in orders for more shares than they actually expect to receive in an effort to ensure they get a good allocation. Deals where those investors end up with more than they expected often trade poorly to begin with. 
All the sources who spoke to Reuters did so on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
Budweiser APAC was seeking to raise between $8.3 billion and $9.8 billion through the float, much of which was to go toward paying down debt at its highly leveraged parent.
AB InBev has been working to reduce a debt pile of more than $100 billion that it built up with the purchase of nearest rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) in late 2016.
Trading had been set to begin on July 19.
AB InBev cut its dividend for 2018. It has said it will reduce its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to below 4 by the end of 2020 from 4.6 at the end of last year, saying it is not dependent on the Asian flotation. It puts the optimal ratio is 2.
AB InBev stock, which has rallied 36% this year, is still down 11% over the last 12 months. It fell 1.5% on Friday.
The company had positioned its Hong Kong listing as creating a champion in Asia-Pacific, where sales are growing as increasingly wealthy consumers turn to premium beer brands. Even at the low end of the price range, the IPO would surpass the $8.1 billion New York float of Uber (N:UBER) in May, the biggest so far this year, Refinitiv data shows.
The IPO was set to precede Alibaba's plans to raise as much as $20 billion through a Hong Kong listing.

Last month, logistics real estate developer  ESR Cayman Ltd  (HK:1821) shelved its Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.24 billion ""in light of the current market conditions.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile on Friday took a step toward building the first fiber-optic cable to directly connect South America and Asia, a project that has piqued the interest of China's Huawei [HWT.UL] and Japan's NEC (T:6701).
The Transportation and Telecommunications ministry said it signed a $3 million agreement with the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) to finance a feasibility study for the approximately 24,000-km (15,000-mile) trans-Pacific cable.
Chile will begin accepting bids for the study next week. The ministry said it expects results by June 2020, after which it will launch a new tender for the installation of the submarine cable.
Gloria Hutt Hesse, Chile's telecommunication's minister, said in a statement the cable ""would position the country as the gateway for the entry of data to the region and as an attractive location to establish data centers.""
Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador have all expressed interest in the cable, the ministry said.
Huawei and NEC submitted pre-feasibility studies for the cable in 2017, assessing potential routes across the Pacific Ocean.
President Sebastian Pinera met with Huawei executives on a visit to China in April. Huawei said Pinera had invited the company to participate in an upcoming government auction for the project.
Chile's call for proposals comes as the country works to entice Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), to install a data center in the South American nation.
Both Chile and Argentina are vying for Amazon's investment."

The FDA last month proposed the shorter timeline after the U.S. District Court for Maryland ruled in a lawsuit filed by anti-tobacco groups that the agency had exceeded its authority in allowing e-cigarettes to remain on the market until 2022 before companies applied for regulatory approval.
""I will impose a ten-month deadline for submissions and a one-year deadline for approval, as the FDA suggested,"" U.S. Judge Paul Grimm wrote in a court order on Friday.
Before last month, the agency had proposed makers of e-cigarettes have until August 2021 to submit a formal application to keep selling their products.
But the public health and anti-tobacco groups that originated the suit countered that e-cigarette and cigar makers submit applications within 120 days.
""Today's ruling is an important step forward for public health and validates FDA's commitment to accelerate review of these products, particularly the ones that are most attractive to youth,"" acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said.
Juul said in a statement that it was closely assessing the court's ruling, while adding that it was fully committed to the FDA's application process.

644,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 03:24PM ET</span>",StockBeat - J&J Falls as Justice Department Launches Probe Into Talc Cancer Claims,"Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson plunged Friday as the Justice Department reportedly launched a criminal investigation into whether the company lied about the possible cancer risks of its talcum powder. 
A grand jury in Washington is examining documents related to what company officials knew about any carcinogens in their products, Bloomberg reported. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fell nearly 5%. That was enough to subtract 46 points from the Dow on an otherwise bullish day.
The company said in a statement that it is cooperating with the previously announced DOJ investigation and that there are no new developments. It also reiterated its previous denials of wrongdoing.
With Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) already facing more than 13,000 talc-related lawsuits nationwide, the Justice Department probe will do little to ease investor fears the healthcare conglomerate could be on the hook to pay out hefty settlements to claimants, resulting in massive liabilities. 
Last month, a California jury ruled in favor of a plaintiff who claimed her use of the company’s talc powder caused a rare cancer. In May, the company was ordered to pay out $300 million in punitive damages to women who also claimed the company’s talc powder caused asbestos-linked cancer.
Reuters said last year that an examination of internal company memos and other documents found the Johnson & Johnson was aware of the presence of asbestos in its products from as early as 1971 but failed to disclose that fact to regulators or to the general public.
The company called the Reuters report “one-sided, false and inflammatory” and has continually denied its Baby Powder talc causes cancer, stressing that numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown that it is safe.
While Baby Powder only makes up a small portion of total revenue, it is a core brand.
Johnson and Johnson is up about 4% this year. The company is set to report quarterly performance on July 16. "
645,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 03:17PM ET</span>","Snap Rises as Goldman Praises Product, Monetization Efforts","Investing.com – Snap rose on Friday after Goldman Sachs upgraded its outlook on the social media company on expectations that efforts to improve its product and money-making approach would deliver growth.
Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Snap (NYSE:SNAP) to buy from neutral, sending the company’s share price nearly 1% higher.
“(W)e believe product improvements and feature additions are driving positive trends in user growth and engagement that, along with monetization improvement from ad tech initiatives, should drive upside to consensus estimates,” Goldman said in a note to clients.
Snap has been gaining favor among analysts after its user growth rebounded in the first quarter of the year as the company launched a revamped Android-based app earlier this year to bring the performance of the Android version up to par with the iOS app.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch) on Thursday raised its price target on Snap to $17 per share from $12 a share, citing third-party data showing second-quarter downloads were “near record levels.”
The bank also admitted that it had “underestimated the potential rebound in [Snap] user activity in 2019,” amid fears over competition from Instagram and execution challenges.
“Overall we anticipate improving user trends and revenue upside in 2Q, though we expect Snap to remain conservative in its outlook,” the bank said.
Snap, whose shares have rallied 71% year to date, is expected to report earnings on July 23, after market close."

Developing-nation central banks have a prime opportunity to lower rates without threatening their currencies or inflation, according to the New York-based money manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management. The Federal Reserve will probably cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the end of July, giving a further boost to risky assets, he told Bloomberg TV.
While emerging-market dollar bonds have been a winning trade to start the year, it’s time to allocate more to local currency notes, according to Caron. He singled out Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro’s signature pension overhaul is progressing through Congress and the central bank appears set to lower borrowing costs.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 11:59AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Petrobras eyes exit from Brazil bourse's good governance program - sources,"By Marta Nogueira and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras is considering an end to its participation in a program certifying good governance and limited political interference in state companies set up by the Sao Paulo stock exchange, two sources told Reuters.
Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco is pushing the possibility of exiting the Distinction in Governance Program for State-Run Firms, established by exchange operator B3 SA (SA:B3SA3), said the people familiar with deliberations, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.
They said Castello Branco believed the measures demanded by the program add little tangible value to the firm's compliance efforts and divert resources that could be better used.
In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras did not confirm the deliberations, although it said its continued participation in the program would depend on ""the best interests of the company and its shareholders, always seeking more efficiency without, however, reducing internal controls.""
Petrobras added that improvements to its compliance protocols have ""stood out"" in recent years and that many requirements of the B3 program are already part of Brazilian law, so leaving the program would not necessarily weaken the company's corporate governance. B3 declined to comment. 
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), as the firm is formally known, has spent years trying to recover from one of the world's biggest ever corporate graft scandals. 
A five-year-old corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, has uncovered billions of dollars of bribes and overpriced contracts between Petrobras and engineering firms – a key reason the stock exchange created the governance program in 2015.
""Naturally such a move could raise some concerns among shareholders and other interested parties,"" said Andriei Beber, a professor of corporate governance at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. ""I don't think it would have so much impact, but it could represent backsliding – and on something very dear to markets and especially minority investors.""
According to the sources, Castello Branco has said Petrobras should compare itself to other oil majors, rather than the other constituents of the program, which significantly differ from Petrobras in scale and industry.
One of the sources said the most important aspects of the program are already written into Petrobras bylaws.
In 2017, Petrobras celebrated its certification under the program as a sign of its commitment to improved governance. The program lays out higher standards of transparency, internal audits and apolitical leadership, including a requirement that at least 30 percent of board members be independent.
The Car Wash probe revealed a longstanding pattern of politically appointed managers at Petrobras offering inflated contracts to suppliers in exchange for political bribes – a practice eventually exposed at a range of Brazilian state firms.
Petrobras says it has cleaned up its act, thanks in part to a robust compliance program.
But the firm is still the target of active investigations, including a far-reaching probe of its commodities trading division, which has drawn the attention of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors in New York.
This month, the head of compliance at Petrobras, Rafael Gomes, resigned from his post, citing personal reasons. It was the second exit of a Petrobras compliance chief in just over a year. 

In addition to Petrobras, its fuel distribution unit  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA (SA:BRDT3), state lender Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) and its insurance unit BB Seguridade Participacoes SA (SA:BBSE3) and power companies Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (SA:ELET6) and Cia Paranaense de Energia SA (SA:CPLE6) have been certified by the Distinction in Governance Program for State-Run Firms.

The Dow rose as far as 27,234.24 points before paring gains a little to be up 0.4% by 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT). Meanwhile, the S&P 500 renewed its push above the 3,000 level to trade up 0.2% at 3,005.37, while the Nasdaq composite rose 21 points, or 0.3%. 
Investors expect the Fed to cut rates at its policy meeting in July, with Powell testifying before Congress that the central bank is worried about weak inflation and various ""uncertainties"" weighing on economic outlook. 
""Jerome Powell spoke in Washington D.C. on Wednesday and Thursday, and the take away message is the U.S. central bank is considering cutting interest rates, and that is helping stocks around the world,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in the U.K.
An increase in core inflation data did nothing to deter rate cut expectations. Neither did the release of slightly higher-than-expected producer price inflation in June.

The bank's ""reinvention"", which is expected to lead to 18,000 job cuts by 2022, includes the closure of all of its equities trading and cutting some parts of its fixed income operations.
Deutsche Bank's plans to shrink its ECM business, which involves raising money for corporate clients on the world's stock markets through IPOs and private placements, has left some bankers questioning how it can still compete.
Its franchise is already under pressure. In the first half of 2019, Deutsche Bank ranked 13th in the league table for global equity capital market deals, down from ninth place in the same period a year ago, Refinitiv data shows.
But in its home market, Deutsche Bank was third biggest in terms of fees in 2018, lagging its U.S. Wall Street rivals JP Morgan (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS), the data shows.
ECM league tables can be volatile given there are often large swings in IPO volumes from year to year, with revenues from such activities at investment banks already suffering from reduced issuance and fee pressure..
However, Deutsche Bank's ECM practice made up just 3% percent of its total investment banking revenue last year and sources said a fall in proceeds would not hit its bottom line.
Deutsche Bank has already axed a number of ECM banking roles in Asia, Europe and the United States since Chief Executive Christian Sewing announced his overhaul, sources said.
VANISHING UNICORNS?
Jason Cox, the Asia-Pacific head of equity capital markets was laid off and teams were disbanded in Japan, Australia and most of Asia, sources have previously said.
At least three members of the London team lost their jobs on Monday, sources said, and the roles of global head of ECM and global head of equity syndicate, responsible for researching and marketing IPOs, remain vacant.
And teams could gradually be reduced further, the sources told Reuters, with a likely knock-on effect.
""The very small ECM team that we will have globally after this will mean that we won't get senior roles in any of the IPOs,"" a senior Deutsche Bank investment banker in Asia said.
""So if a company in London or a unicorn in China is looking to do an IPO, they would not look at Deutsche as a lead, nor will we pitch for that role,"" the senior banker said, adding that the bank could still pitch for junior roles in some deals.
In the United States, it will continue to work on sectors that it deems strategic, a source close to Deutsche Bank said.
The underwriting role it secured in the IPO of U.S. electric bus maker Proterra, was helped by the bank's relationship with auto investors in Europe, another source said.
Over the past year Deutsche won global coordinator roles for IPOs including Volkswagen's truck unit Traton (F:8TRA) and luxury car maker  Aston Martin  (L:AML), and bookrunner roles in the IPOs of ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies (N:UBER).
It also has a global coordinator role on the IPO of brewing firm  Anheuser-Busch InBev  NV's (BR:ABI) Hong Kong arm Budweiser, which on Friday delayed pricing the flotation.
There are also more deals in prospect, with Deutsche Bank securing roles in up to 10 which should happen in the next 12 to 18 months in Europe, a third source said."
656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 10:14AM ET</span>",Snap’s Gender-Swap Filter Went Viral -- and So Did the Stock,"(Bloomberg) -- It only took six months and a basket of disguises for Wall Street to love  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). again.
Snap has seen a dramatic recovery over the past several months, with shares more than tripling off a record low in December to trade at their highest level in more than a year. While there have been a number of tailwinds supporting the social-media company, one key ingredient behind the turnaround is this: it now allows users to “swap faces” with others in photographs, with “lenses” or filters that can, for example, make men look like women or babies.
Those who are unfamiliar with the latest viral sensations may view such a feature as an unusual foundation to build an investment on. But Wall Street sees the early-May launch of the filters as a key factor behind improving user trends at the Snapchat app, which is in turn leading to more optimistic projections for Snap’s top- and bottom-lines.
“The timing of the filter appears to have driven a notable increase in engagement,” said Mark Kelley, an analyst at Nomura Instinet.
Snap rose as much as 4.3% on Friday, extending a four-day winning streak, after Goldman upgraded the stock to buy from neutral. The new Android app, games and viral lenses drove record user adoption in May, reversing prior trends, analyst Heath Terry wrote in a research note.
Wall Street’s expectations have been getting rosier, with MoffettNathanson writing that Snap was “on the verge of writing their own ‘Cinderella Story’.” Compared with six months ago, the consensus for Snap’s adjusted full-year loss has improved by about 25% while revenue expectations are up 5.4% over that period.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Thursday raised its revenue estimates on Snap for 2019 through 2021 and lifted its price target to $17 from $12. The firm expects user upside in the quarter. The comments came just two days after  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) lifted its own target for similar reasons. The shares are now trading at their highest level since March 2018, having more than tripled since December.
In a report dated July 10, Nomura’s Kelly cited data from Sensor Tower that showed 67% growth in Snapchat app downloads in the second quarter. That represents a dramatic turnaround from the first quarter, when downloads fell 5% on a year-over-year basis. According to SimilarWeb data cited by Nomura, traffic to Snapchat.com was up 4% in the second quarter, compared with the first-quarter’s 24% decline.
“The jump is a positive nod to Snap’s efforts to spur engagement and demonstrates the platform’s scale and sway, particularly with millennials,” wrote Jitendra Waral, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Snap will report second-quarter results on July 23. Analysts expect it to report an adjusted loss of 10 cents a share on revenue of $359.6 million. That represents revenue growth of 37% from a year ago. Analysts are also looking for 191 million daily active users in the quarter, compared with 190 million in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Beyond the engagement driven by the filter, Snap’s 2019 rally accelerated in February when its fourth-quarter results beat expectations and it pointed to a stabilizing user base. Additional gains came in April, when it announced a suite of new products and services, including a video-game business.
The gains have far outpaced Snap’s social-media rivals.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). is up more than 40% from its own December low, while  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). -- which dwarfs Snap in size and user base -- is up more than 60% from December.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has halted sales of a new book that the planemaker had commissioned for its 50th anniversary to avoid hampering the manufacturer's attempts to win a settlement in a bribery probe, two people familiar with the matter said.
The move is the latest sign of tension in Airbus as it nears the climax of a roughly $400 million, four-year internal probe carried out in support of an Anglo-French investigation into the use of intermediaries to win jetliner and other deals.
Airbus has already fired more than 100 people over ethics and compliance issues as its probe has progressed.
The book, ""Airbus: The First 50 Years"", written by former New York Times journalist Nicola Clark, charts the rise of Airbus against challenging odds to become a European rival to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and has a chapter focusing on the probe.
Sources said Airbus hoped to present its findings to the UK Serious Fraud Office and France's PNF police by the end of the year. By doing so, they said it would seek more leniency under a system of prosecution agreements that allows for heavy fines rather than charges that might bar it from public contracts.
The two people said Airbus halted the book's sales because it was concerned its official links to the publication could hamper talks with the authorities or discussions over other litigation as it seeks a fresh start under new management.
Airbus confirmed it had decided not to go ahead with the commissioned book, but denied any link to the bribery probe. It declined comment on the progress of the investigation itself.
""We continue to co-operate in full with the ongoing investigation,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""The investigation and the book are two separate topics"".
Clark told Reuters she was ""deeply disappointed with the very belated decision by Airbus to withdraw (the book)"".
UK-based publisher Urbane Publications declined to comment.
The book stems from an unusual initiative launched in 2016 under which Airbus granted Clark unprecedented access and full independence to give an unvarnished account of 50 years of industrial co-operation just as Europe's political unity wavers.
It was published on Amazon's Kindle service on May 29, half a century after Airbus was launched at a meeting of Franco-German founders including Roger Beteille, who died last month.
The book was quickly withdrawn from online sale and plans to distribute already-printed copies at the Paris Airshow in June were scrapped at the last minute, casting confusion over the company's 50th anniversary celebrations. 
But copies have been circulating and a review was published by Leeham News, a website covering the aviation industry.
Airbus said the version seen by the public was a draft. ""The draft wasn't consistent with our ambition for celebrating 50 years of pioneering progress,"" the Airbus spokesman said.

Clark said Airbus had not described the book as a draft before notifying her of the decision to withdraw it.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government has plans to raise as much as 3.25 trillion rupees ($47.4 billion) in the next five years by reducing its stakes in some large state-owned firms to 40%, two senior government officials told Reuters, in the nation's biggest privatization push in more than two decades.
Last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget announced that the government will look to reduce direct controlling stakes in some state-run firms on a case-by-case basis. 
The plan will open up a steady stream of state companies to greater private investment, and target the kind of annual divestment revenue that will be crucial to meet fiscal deficit targets.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration already sold government stakes in a host of companies to raise a record $40.92 billion in his first five-year term, nearly three times the divestment proceeds of $14.52 billion achieved by the Congress party government in 2009-2014. Modi was re-elected for a second-term in a landslide victory in April-May.
The government has identified a number of state-owned firms, including explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (NS:ONGC), oil refiner Indian Oil Corp (NS:IOC), gas transmitter  GAIL (India)  Ltd (NS:GAIL), power producers  NHPC  Ltd (NS:NHPC) and  NTPC  (NS:NTPC), miners  NMDC  Ltd (NS:NMDC) and  Coal India  (NS:COAL), and  Bharat Heavy Electricals  Ltd (NS:BHEL), said the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter.
""We have done a calculation on current prices and we could get 3.25 trillion rupees if we bring our stake down to 40% in government companies, excluding banks,"" one of the officials said.
The two officials, though, said the government is yet to gauge investor appetite for the state-owned companies and that the level of demand will be crucial to any timetable.
Analysts said the government would need to be flexible, especially given that a lot of the companies were in the resource sector and their prices would often depend on the volatility of commodities prices.
""The government should gauge investor interest and schedule an ideal timeframe that is in sync with the commodity cycle,"" said Satyadeep Jain, a global metals and mining equity consultant. 
Jain said the government should wait before selling stakes in companies such as Coal India as demand for its shares would be hurt by weak global coal prices. The country's largest iron-ore miner NMDC would be a better target for sale as its stock has been buoyant this year, he said.
New Delhi wants to reduce its holdings in such a way that the cumulative stake of the government and state-owned companies such as Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) would continue to be above 51%.
This year, the government is planning to put stakes in a group of companies into exchange traded funds, which would then be sold on public markets and raise at least 400 billion rupees, the officials said. The state's stakes in those companies would be cut to 51% in some cases.
The government has set a divestment target of 1.05 trillion rupees for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. 
It is in the process of identifying some power companies for merger with a view to cutting its stakes to 40%, one of the sources said.
The government is planning a complex holding structure for companies such as state-owned power firm SJVN Ltd (NS:SJVN), which would be bought by another power firm such as state-owned NTPC or NHPC, sources said.
Eventually, the officials say the government would like to see its shareholdings reduced to 26% in some companies if the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party gets a third term.
""That step will be real privatization,"" the second official said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - E.ON (DE:EONGn) is set to win EU antitrust approval to buy rival Innogy's (DE:IGY) network and retail assets after the German energy group sweetened its concessions to address competition concerns, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The deal is part of a bigger asset swap with Innogy's parent RWE (DE:RWEG) and will more than double E.ON's customers in Germany to nearly 14 million.
E.ON last month offered to sell part of its retail business in Hungary as well as Innogy's retail power and gas business in the Czech Republic with 1.6 million customers, after the European Commission voiced concerns that the deal may reduce competition.
The offer also included dropping 260,000 heating customers in Germany, as well as the right to operate 32 charging stations for electric cars along Germany's Autobahn motorway network.
E.ON subsequently improved its proposal for all three countries after the European Commission received feedback from rivals and customers, one of the sources said. The EU competition enforcer did not seek comments about the tweaks.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Sept. 20, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Milacron, which traces its history to 1860 as a screw shop, had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection of its businesses in 2009.

(Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) is selling a 60% stake in Kantar to private equity firm Bain Capital, valuing the data analytics business at about $4 billion and giving the British owner of agencies including Ogilvy and Wunderman Thompson funds to cut debt and rebuild.
WPP is restructuring following several profit warnings and the abrupt departure of its founder and former chief executive Martin Sorrell over alleged misconduct, which he denies.
Sorrell's replacement Mark Read said the Kantar sale, which WPP expects to lead to proceeds of about $3.1 billion after tax and continuing investment, created value for WPP shareholders.
""With a much stronger balance sheet and a return of approximately 8% of our current market value to shareholders planned, we are making good progress with our transformation,"" said Read, who is in the process of simplifying the group.
WPP's clients want it to integrate its agencies and digital capabilities to produce faster campaigns across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost.
WPP said it will use about 60% of the proceeds from Kantar to cut net debt to the low end of a targeted range of 1.5-1.75 times core earnings for 2020.
The rest of the money will be returned to shareholders, WPP said, adding the deal was subject to backing from investors and other regulatory and legal approvals.
Read said many leading private equity companies were interested in Kantar, which was launched by WPP in 1992 and offers insights into the views of customers and consumers in more than 100 countries, and WPP was very pleased to obtain a valuation of 8.2 times its 2018 earnings.
""Data is critical to WPP's clients and critical to WPP, but there's a growing number of sources of data,"" he told reporters, adding that clients cared most about whether WPP could use data to drive marketing programs, which it would continue to be able to do with Kantar after the deal.
Shares in WPP rose 0.5% to 961 pence on Friday.
""Kantar has the advantage of being relatively self-contained and so can be split off from the parent with minimal restructuring costs ... the proceeds of the sale will drop straight through to the balance sheet and shareholders pockets,"" Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said.
Luca Bassi, a London-based managing director at Bain, said there were opportunities to invest in Kantar's technology to expand its capabilities.
""Market research remains the cornerstone of business decision making,"" he told reporters. ""All over the world all companies and industry will require more data, and more solutions to analysis and interpret that data.""
SLIMMING DOWN
The stake sale comes months after WPP said it suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter underlying sales in North America as the loss of work from clients such as Ford took a toll.
WPP sold its minority stake in sports, entertainment and communications company Chime for 54.4 million pounds this month as it divests non-core assets to return to growth.
It will invest in new creative staff and reduce costs by cutting offices and jobs. It also sold post-production services provider The Farm Group to Los Angeles-based Picture Shop.
""With the balance sheet back in rude health, and complexity significantly reduced, WPP needs to focus on the technological and creative transformation that will be vital to its long term future in a rapidly changing industry,"" analyst Hyett said.
WPP said the deal and use of proceeds would be marginally dilutive to headline earnings per share in 2021."

VW and Ford said they were in ""exploratory talks"" about an alliance to develop self-driving and electric vehicles and to complement each other's global production and sales footprints. They are to announce details on Friday.
Volkswagen also plans to build a multi-brand production plant in Turkey, German trade magazine Automobilwoche said on Friday.
Ford already has a large plant in Golcuk, Turkey where it builds the Ford Transit van and a source told Reuters that Volkswagen intends to make use of Ford's production capacity in Turkey, to build a VW van.
As part of a broader deal set to be announced on Friday, VW will become an equal stakeholder in Ford's autonomous vehicles venture, the source said, marking the latest technology alliance among global carmakers seeking to develop self-driving cars.
Ford created Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC in 2018, pledging to invest $4 billion until 2023 and has sought outside investors to help share the spiraling cost of developing autonomous vehicles.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) last year joined forces with General Motors Co (N:GM) to develop autonomous vehicles by investing $2.75 billion in GM's Cruise Automation self-driving vehicle unit. 
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo has agreements with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) and Jaguar Land Rover to buy and equip vehicles with its self-driving systems.
Ford and VW said on Thursday they would announce further details about a global technology-sharing alliance agreement on Friday.
The collaboration could accelerate the deployment timetables of both carmakers, which have said they plan to put autonomous vehicles into operation in 2021.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) cut its profit forecast for the fourth time in 13 months on Friday, as it set aside more money to cover a regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions and vehicle recalls related to Takata airbags.
The German automaker is among a raft of blue-chip firms to issue a profit warning this week, adding to concerns about the severity of an economic slowdown, particularly in China where confidence has been hit by an ongoing trade war. 
The maker of Mercedes-Benz cars said it would post a second-quarter operating loss and that 2019 results would be ""significantly"" lower than last year, compared with its previous forecast for a broadly unchanged performance. 
It also blamed lower-than-predicted growth in automotive markets, as well as slower product ramp-ups that have affected availability this year.
Analysts said deteriorating cashflow would make it hard for Daimler to keep paying a high dividend. Philippe Houchois at Jefferies said Daimler's dividend would need to be cut to around 50 cents per share, down from 3.25 euros in 2018. 
The warning is the second since Ola Kaellenius took over from long-standing Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche in May. 
""In finance, some call it 'to throw in the kitchen sink' ... well Daimler just threw in the dining room table, the fridge and the polished silver,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note.
""Whether this is the final warning for the year remains to be seen."" 
Daimler shares fell as much as 4.5% to a six-month low of 44.54 euros. At 1110 GMT, the stock, which has dropped about 22% in the past three months, was down 0.8%.
German carmakers, among global leaders in diesel technology, have been caught in the crosshairs of courts and regulators after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to using engine control devices to cheat U.S. diesel emission tests.
Daimler's diesel pollution levels are being investigated by prosecutors in Stuttgart, Germany, where it is headquartered, as well as by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
The pressure to clean up combustion engines has come at a time when the industry has to invest heavily in electric and self-driving vehicles, cope with slowing growth in China, weak markets in Europe and a rise in global trade tensions.

Daimler said it expected to take an extra 1.6 billion euros hit related to ""ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures relating to Mercedes-Benz Diesel vehicles in various regions."" It did not give further details. 
It also said provisions related to an extended recall connected to Takata airbags would increase by around 1 billion euros, and a review of its Mercedes-Benz vans product portfolio would hit second-quarter earnings by 500 million euros.
The bankruptcy of Japanese airbag maker Takata has left some carmakers having to shoulder the cost of recalls. Ford (N:F) took a hit of $775 million in 2018 for Takata-related recalls in North America. 
A result of the extra costs, Daimler forecast a second-quarter loss before interest and taxes of 1.6 billion euros ($1.80 billion), compared with a 2.6 billion profit in the same period last year. 
Daimler also said its free cash flow for the second quarter would be below the same period last year, and that for the full- year it was no longer be expected to be above that of 2018. 
Daimler's warning came after auto suppliers Johnson Electric Holdings (HK:0179) and  Sensirion  (S:SENSI) slashed their earnings forecasts on Thursday, blaming a slowdown in car sales and pessimism about the prospects of a Chinese car sector recovery.
In May, German competitor BMW (DE:BMWG) warned on profits, citing higher than expected investments, while Volkswagen said the return on sales at its passenger cars division would come in at the lower end of its target.
Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars fell 7 percent in the first quarter in part due to manufacturing bottlenecks for the A-Class compact car in Aguascalientes, Mexico, the Mercedes-Benz Van in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Mercedes-Benz GLE sports utility vehicle in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

Steinhoff first flagged holes in its accounts in December 2017 -- the warning shot for an accounting fraud since put at over $7 billion -- shocking investors that had backed its transformation from a small South African outfit to a discount furniture retailer spanning four continents.
The owner of Mattress Firm Inc in the United States, Fantastic chains in Australia and Conforama in France said the loss from continuing operations came in at 356 million euros in the six-months ended March compared with a loss of 392 million euros a year earlier.
Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt (DE:SNHG), blamed the loss on the cost of advisors and professional fees as it cleans up its balance sheet.
Advisory fees for the period amounted to 82 million euros, which included 11 million euros for forensic investigation and technical accounting support, and 30 million euros for creditor adviser fees.
""While every effort is made to limit costs, we expect this to remain our reality for some time,"" the retailer said in its 97-page half-year unaudited report.
Net sales from continuing operations increased by 3% to 6.8 billion euros from 6.6 billion euros, with strong contributions from Pepkor Europe and Pepkor Africa.
At 1105 GMT, shares in Johannesburg-listed Steinhoff jumped 4.72%, while in Frankfurt they were up 8.9%.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares came within a whisker of posting their first weekly loss since May on Friday and the dollar was down for a third day running, as even stronger than expected U.S. inflation failed to shake bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
European shares ticked higher after a run of modest falls this week and as investors also digested an end-of-week blizzard of Chinese data. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.2% by midday in London.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day, and close to breaking a 5-week streak of gains. 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were up 0.2%. 
Data out of China showed that Beijing's exports fell in June as the United States ramped up trade pressure, while imports shrank more than expected, pointing to further strains on the world's second largest economy.

""The export data was really weak, and it's one signal that the trade war has started to bite Chinese exporters and that companies are starting to re-route their supply chains,"" said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank in Utrecht, Netherlands.
""European markets are waiting for a cue on what is happening between the United States and China on trade.""
The data comes after a string of disappointing economic reports from around the globe, which showed that the global economy suffered from a protracted U.S.-China trade war that forced major central banks to take a more accommodative stance.
China is also due to release second-quarter GDP figures on Monday which are expected to show the world's second-largest economy slowing to its weakest pace in at least 27 years.
Euro zone industrial production rising more than expected in May, offsetting declines in the past two months and defying gloomy forecasts caused by prolonged trade tensions.
The positive reading could undermine European Central Bank policymakers who favor more stimulus to counter weak growth and low inflation in the euro zone, although economists warn the improvement may only be temporary.
ECB policymakers gathering last month agreed on the need to be ready to provide more stimulus to the euro zone economy in an environment of ""heightened uncertainty"", official minutes of the meeting showed on Thursday.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was lower for a third straight day, down 0.1%. A stronger-than-expected reading of failed to shake convictions that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates at a policy meeting later this month. 
The core U.S. consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.3% in June, the largest increase since January 2018, data on Thursday showed. 
The reading pushed U.S. Treasury yields higher, but money markets still indicated one rate cut at the end of July and a cumulative 64 basis points in cuts by the end of 2019.
Comments by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans scheduled later on Friday and New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Monday will provide a chance to gauge how dovish the central bank is, said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""If these Fed officials are not as dovish as Powell, and if the New York Fed's manufacturing survey on Monday proves stronger than forecast, they could show that the dollar weakening in response to Powell's congressional testimony was overdone.""

672,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Expectations are low for bank earnings but investors say 'buy',"By Sinéad Carew and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Low interest rates and weak trading volume have pushed down Wall Street's second-quarter estimates for the biggest U.S. banks, yet investors still say they want in on the sector.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) kick off the second-quarter company earnings season with reports out Monday and Tuesday. On Thursday  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reports.
Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) growth for the S&P 500 bank index of 11%, down from 14.4% on Jan. 1. Revenue growth expectations have dropped to 1.6% from 3.4%, according to the average of estimates gathered by Refinitiv.
This is partly thanks to a flatter yield curve - the narrowing spread between short-term interest rates and long-term rates. On top of this, trading volumes fell in the quarter as many investors stayed on the sidelines due to volatility related to the U.S.-China trade war.
And looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates as soon as this month - a move that some analysts say could add more pressure to bank net interest margins, a closely watched measure of bank profitability which expands or contracts depending on the yield curve.
While lower interest rates make the cost of funding cheaper for most companies, they reduce banks' ability to charge up for its lending services.
""Right now there's just no catalyst for revenue growth. We're talking about an environment where rates are coming down which means net interest margins are under pressure,"" said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods based in New York. ""Things have to get worse before they get better. We haven't seen the worst yet in our view. We still expect rates to go lower putting further pressure on bank earnings.""
The dimming outlook has already diminished valuations with the bank index trading at about 10.2 times estimates for next 12 months earnings, compared with its average multiple of 12.4 for the last 10 years, according to Refinitiv data.
But some investors say revenue worries are overblown and that banks could make it out of the rate cycle better than expected. Further, the lower valuations also look attractive compared with the benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) 17.1 multiple.
The S&P bank index has risen 17.5% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has risen 19.7%.
""Because of the fact rates have been pushed lower and the yield curve continues to be flat, (banks are) somewhat unloved,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston referring to bank stocks.
""To me that makes an interesting investment and the catalyst for banks would be the continued loosening of regulations and a steepening of the yield curve.""
Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist Jim Paulsen also likes banks. He expects a steepening yield curve to help net interest margins.
Investors like Paulsen expect the yield curve to steepen if Fed rate cuts improve economic growth. Aaron Dunn, portfolio manager for large cap value at Eaton Vance in Boston, says investors have been too bearish on banks.
But he says it is important to be selective as valuations are not so compelling that he is ""pounding the table to buy."" For example, with JPMorgan's price-to-tangible book value ratio close to 2, Dunn would like ""much faster earnings growth to get behind it."" JPM is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.4% to $2.51 when it issues results on Tuesday, according to estimates gathered by Refinitiv.
In comparison, Dunn is ""very interested"" in Goldman Sachs which has a price-to-tangible book value ratio close to 1 and is expected to report an EPS decline of 16.5% to $5.
Bank executives have also downplayed the impact of interest rates in recent investor conferences. Citigroup said a 25-basis point rate shift would cut revenue by $50 million per quarter. Citi, one of the least rate sensitive banks of the pack, typically makes upwards of $70 billion in revenue annually.
Last month Wells Fargo executives said a steepening yield curve following a Fed rate cut would help its mortgage business.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), one of the most rate-sensitive banks, touted its ability to grow profit regardless of the economic environment, although it has admitted it may not grow as fast. Last quarter Bank of America, due to report results Wednesday, said it expects 3% net income growth for the year compared with 6% in 2018.
Still investors will be looking for signs of confidence from executives that banks can continue growing.
""Earnings aren't going to be great but everybody already knows that. What's the outlook for the back half of the year?"" said Eaton Vance's Dunn."

Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets were mostly higher after early trading in the region Friday, as reassuring economic data out of China helped to offset an earlier blow to confidence from German automaker  Daimler . 
Markets turned higher after figures showing that Chinese exports fell less than expected in June. New loans also came in slightly lower than expected, easing fears that the authorities were relying on an excessive buildup of credit to soften the impact of the trade war with the U.S. 
Further support came as industrial production data for the euro zone came in slightly stronger than expected.
Despite that - and despite multiple signals from the Federal Reserve about its intention to ease monetary policy in the near future - markets are on course to end the week lower. That's in sharp contrast to the U.S., where both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit new record highs on the back of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress.
As of 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.2% at 387.52, but still down 0.7% for the week. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.3% and the French CAC 40 led the way with a 0.5% gain. 
However, Germany's Dax lagged, flat on the day and down nearly 2% on the week after  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, announced yet another profit warning, its second in less than a month. The company said that its latest assessment of its legal liabilities due to the diesel emissions scandal, along with various issues affecting van sales, meant that it would report a loss of around 1.6 billion euros in the second quarter, and that full-year earnings would be significantly below last year's. The company had previously guided for 2019 profits to be broadly the same as last year's.
Daimler's shares fell 3% at the opening, testing a six-year low, but recovered on the Chinese data to be down only 1.0%. However, they remained the clear underperformer in the sector across Europe. 
There was more encouraging news from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which announced a $2.6 billion investment in Ford Motor's autonomous vehicle business Argo. The investment is the latest evidence of how the world's biggest auto groups are teaming up to share the costs of developing self-driving cars, one of the two mega-trends looming over the industry. VW's preferred shares rose 1.2% in early trading."

Apart from the quest to cut carbon emissions to curb global warming, the United Nations shipping agency is introducing tougher anti-pollution standards in the industry's biggest shake-up for decades.
BHP said ships fueled by LNG (liquefied natural gas) would eliminate NOx (nitrogen oxide) and SOx (sulfur oxide) emissions and, though not a zero-carbon solution, would bring a significant reduction in CO2 emissions until other options are available.
BHP, the world's biggest diversified miner, stands apart from others in the sector with its target of net zero emissions by the second half of the century, in line with U.N. carbon-cutting goals.
That is a huge challenge, especially if it includes emissions related to the group's vast amounts of coking coal and iron ore for steelmaking, as well as shipping of the material.
""We recognize we have a stewardship role, working with our customers, suppliers and others to influence emissions reductions across the full life cycle of our products,"" said Rashpal Bhatti, BHP's vice president for maritime and supply chain excellence.
BHP was ""fully supportive"" of the International Maritime Organization's decision to impose lower limits on sulfur levels in marine fuels, Bhatti added."

676,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 06:32AM ET</span>",Bonds Are Sliding and Analysts Are Struggling for an Explanation,"(Bloomberg) -- The global selloff in long-dated bonds is dividing opinion among traders and analysts. Some explain it as profit taking, others point to the stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data, and a few are flagging the possibility of a so-called reflation trade.
Stronger-than-forecast gains in U.S. consumer price indexes in June are being cited as an obvious answer, given the figures prompted rates traders to trim bets on how much easing is on the way from the Federal Reserve.
This explanation, though, doesn’t explain the out-performance on Thursday of two-year Treasuries. That tenor should have been more sensitive to the monetary policy outlook than longer-dated bonds. And it doesn’t explain why European bonds were sold even before the American CPI report.
Treasury 30-year bond yields jumped eight basis points on Thursday, the most since October, outpacing an increase of three basis points in two-year notes. Germany’s 30-year yields rose seven basis points on Thursday, while two-year yields were little changed.
Royal Bank of Canada pointed to a “slight reflation theme” amid expectations the euro area will benefit the most from global easing.
Mizuho Securities Co. was unequivocal in pinning Thursday’s action on reflation trades, in which investors buy riskier assets while selling bonds on expectations that monetary easing will accelerate growth and inflation.
Soft demand at a 30-year Treasury bond auction Thursday is consistent with this theory.
But the most straightforward explanation is profit taking following the best return in three years for for global bonds in the second quarter. Because futures have already priced in almost a 1% point rate reduction by the Fed before the end of next year, U.S. monetary policy alone may not extend the rally in Treasuries.
Asset managers have boosted their net long positions in Treasury 10-year note futures to 885,068 contracts from a year-to-date low of 676,213 contracts in April, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Franklin Templeton Investments Australia has exited its bullish positioning in the U.S. and Australian debt markets, said Andrew Canobi, director for fixed income in Melbourne.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Thomas Cook (L:TCG) is in talks on a 750 million pound ($941 million) bailout that will give its largest investor Fosun Tourism (HK:1992) control of the indebted British group's package-tour business, in a blow to other shareholders.
Shares in Thomas Cook dropped by more than 30% to their lowest level on record after news of the proposed deal, which would also give Club Med owner Fosun a minority interest in Thomas Cook's airline business.
""This comes at a cost, with a significant dilution for existing shareholders, many of whom have held the stock and supported the business for many years,"" Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said of the proposed deal.
""However, this proposal is the pragmatic and responsible solution to secure the future of the Thomas Cook business and brand and to preserve as much value as possible for all our stakeholders,"" Fankhauser added.
Fosun International (HK:0656), co-founded by billionaire Guo Guangchang and one of China's biggest conglomerates, has spent billions of dollars over the past decade buying healthcare, tourism and fashion companies in the United States and Europe.
""We are committed investors, with a proven track record of turning around iconic brands including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC,"" Hong Kong-listed Fosun, which already owns an 18% stake in Thomas Cook, told Reuters.
Thomas Cook said that the cash from the proposed deal, which would mark one of the most significant purchases of a British company by a Chinese group in years, would be enough for it to trade over the winter season and give it flexibility to invest.
The world's oldest travel company, which has been hit by fading demand for its package holidays, high debt and a hot 2018 summer in Europe, has also been weighing approaches for its airline business and Nordic operations.
Fankhauser said the sale process for the airline business was paused while Thomas Cook focused on the refinancing. ""It's too early to speculate on what will happen on the airline review,"" he said.
Other tour operators are also facing challenges and in May Anglo-German rival TUI (DE:TUIGn) reported deeper first-half losses due to airline overcapacity for Spain and the grounding of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes.
178-year-old Thomas Cook has seen its market value drop from around $4 billion when it made its debut on the London market in June 2007 to about $255 million before the bailout plan.
Its stock had more than halved in value so far this year after several profit warnings as weak demand led to increased promotional activity and earlier discounting than usual.
The British holiday company's tour business had 11 million customers in 2018 and produced 7.4 billion pounds in revenue. Its higher-margin airline business - which includes German holiday carrier Condor - made 3.5 billion pounds in revenue.
The company on Friday said summer bookings in its tour operations business were down 9%, while those at its airline business are down 3%, likely leading to operating profit in the second half of the year coming in lower than the year-ago period.

DEAL DETAILS
Thomas Cook's recapitalization proposal, which may comprise a capital injection and new financing facilities, comes a month after it said it was in talks with Fosun following a preliminary approach by the Chinese firm.
Fosun has been purchasing tourism assets including France's Club Med, as the industry is viewed as key to China's shift toward a more consumption-driven model of economic growth from an investment and export-led one.
But like its domestic peers including HNA Group, Fosun, China's largest privately held conglomerate, has faced increasing scrutiny from Beijing for debt-fuelled, big-ticket foreign deals in recent years.
It said earlier this year that it will adopt an asset-light strategy and run under management contracts the Club Med resorts it plans to launch in China and other countries.
The proposal, which Fosun said was subject to due diligence and further talks, envisions that a significant amount of its external bank and bond debt will be converted into equity."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's restrictions on certain tech exports to South Korea are deepening a decades-long feud over wartime forced labor and may make compromise harder as leaders in both countries appeal to their political bases. 
Japan's tighter export restrictions on three materials crucial for smartphone displays and microchips could hit tech giants, such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc, that supply chips to the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. They also underscore Japan's grip on a key link in the global supply chain.
Polling data on Friday showed 61% of South Koreans blamed the Japanese government for the current row and 67% were willing to boycott Japanese products.
""If Japan was trying to give South Korea a shock and force it to compromise, that was a mistake,"" said Masao Okonogi, a professor emeritus at Tokyo's Keio University, adding that growing anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea could make it harder for President Moon Jae-in to seek a solution. 
""This is becoming a crisis of the 1965 system,"" he said, referring to the year the two countries normalized diplomatic ties.
A Japanese foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters on Friday that tighter export curbs were not intended as retaliation over the wartime workers dispute. 
But Japan's trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, mentioned the wartime labor dispute as a cause of mistrust when he announced the curbs, and sources familiar with the Japanese government's position said the two issues were closely entangled.
""We want the Korean side to understand the scale of the anger on our side,"" one such source said. All of the sources familiar with the government's position did not wish to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Japan's export curbs came just ahead of a July 21 upper-house election that Abe needs to win big to keep alive his hopes of revising the pacifist constitution. 
Abe's ruling bloc is on track to win a solid majority, media surveys show, but must have a two-thirds ""super majority,"" including like-minded allies, to approve constitutional revisions.
A survey by the Japan News Network (JNN) released this week showed that 58% of voters backed the export curbs, compared with 24% who were opposed. But the top issues in the election are worries about the country's pension system and a sales tax increase. 
PLAYING TO THE BASE
Relations between Washington's two biggest Asian allies have long been plagued by memories of Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the peninsula and the war. Particularly thorny is the matter of ""comfort women,"" a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japanese wartime military brothels.
Many Japanese resent being urged to atone for misdeeds more than seven decades old, while many in South Korea doubt the sincerity of Tokyo's apologies.
The dispute worsened last year when South Korean courts ordered Japanese companies to compensate former conscripted laborers.
Japan says that the matter was settled by the 1965 treaty and that by demanding compensation, Seoul is violating international law. 
Abe appears to be playing to his conservative base, and Moon's need to court his own supporters means he is unlikely to back down, the experts said.
""Let's not forget that Moon is a populist leader ... A populist leader cannot afford to be humiliated and forced to change course,"" said Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Japan's Hosai International University.
For both Moon and Abe, Horvat added, resolving the dispute ""would make them statesmen but it might not win the next election.""
A Gallup poll released on Friday showed a slight dip in Moon's approval rating alongside strong public support for the South Korean position.
Complicating matters are media reports that hydrogen fluoride, one of the materials covered by the export curbs, was shipped to North Korea after being exported to the South. Hydrogen fluoride can be used in chemical weapons.
Seoul has angrily denounced the reports as groundless and on Friday called for an international investigation.
Japanese government officials have declined to comment, saying only there were ""inappropriate instances"" of South Korea's export controls.
Officials from the two sides were meeting in Tokyo on Friday, but Japan has said it was not thinking of withdrawing the curbs.
Japan might soften its tone slightly after the election, but is unlikely to remove the restrictions soon, a former senior Japanese diplomat said, adding that Abe has not faced major domestic criticism for his tough stance.
""They can meet many times, but I don't think a mutually acceptable solution will be found,"" said the ex-diplomat, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Nor is U.S. President Donald Trump's administration likely to try to ease friction between its two allies.

""The solution will be for the two governments to put their heads together,"" Ha Jong-moon, a professor at South Korea's Hanshin University. ""It would be good for the United States to help open the door to negotiations by setting the table, but I think it would be hard to expect that of them.""

Trump complained Thursday that China hasn’t boosted its purchases of U.S. farm products, a promise he claims he secured in a meeting with his counterpart Xi Jinping in June. But according to officials in Beijing familiar with the talks, no such agreement was made. China’s Commerce Ministry yesterday also indicated that in their view, substantial discussions have yet to restart even though both sides spoke on the phone.
China has started preparing to buy farm products, including gauging the prices of U.S. soybeans, but will not purchase large amounts until it sees concrete progress in the negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. Small purchases could happen before that, the person said.
Trump and Xi agreed to a tentative pause in raising tariffs after their meeting in Osaka, though varying readouts and vague comments from Trump have sown confusion about what was actually agreed on in the room. Major sticking points include when and by how much China will increase its imports of U.S. farm products, and how exactly the U.S. will ease trade restrictions on Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co.
China’s stance so far suggests that “the purchase of agricultural products is pegged to the entire deal being done,” said He Weiwen, a former commerce ministry official who is now a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. “It is not a case that China buys American products first to get a final deal, but rather that after a final deal is inked, China will make the purchases it agreed to.”
China has rejected a U.S. demand to increase agricultural purchases beyond the number Trump and Xi agreed to in Argentina last year, according to Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet. He was speaking after the June summit.
U.S. Department of Agriculture data indicate that China actually slowed its purchases of American agriculture products following the Osaka meeting. The nation bought 127,800 metric tons of U.S. soybeans last week, a 79% reduction from the previous week. Similarly, China bought just 76 tons of American pork, compared to 10,400 tons in June.
Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted late Thursday that the “achievement of Osaka summit is a China-U.S. consensus, not a unilateral commitment China made to the U.S. Hope the U.S. will lift all sanctions on Huawei soon and respect the principle of equality.”
Huawei Reprieve
Last week, an influential Chinese agricultural researcher said it’s unlikely Beijing will start purchasing large amounts of U.S. products anytime soon. Barriers include tit-for-tat tariffs that remain in place, as well as tensions over Huawei, according to Li Qiang, chairman and chief analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.
“The trade teams in the two nations will restart trade negotiations on a basis of equality and mutual respect, following the consensus agreed by their two state leaders in Osaka,” Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday at a regular briefing. Gao didn’t say when the negotiations would be held, but said he hoped the U.S. would implement its commitments with regards to Huawei.
When questioned last week about Trump’s claim in Japan that China had agreed to buy “tremendous” amounts of U.S. farm goods, Gao said that the two nations had large room to cooperate on agriculture, and hoped that a solution could be reached on the basis of equality.
“It seems the two sides are arm-wrestling about the basis on which they’ll resume talks, as well as when and where,” said Zhou Xiaoming, a former commerce ministry official and diplomat. “The U.S. shouldn’t expect that the text agreed before May will automatically become the basis for the new round of trade talks.”

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares came within a whisker of posting their first weekly loss since May on Friday and the dollar was down for a third day running, as even stronger than expected U.S. inflation failed to shake bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
European shares ticked higher after a run of modest falls this week and as investors also digested an end-of-week blizzard of Chinese data. The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.2% by midday in London.
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day, and close to breaking a 5-week streak of gains. 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were up 0.2%. 
Data out of China showed that Beijing's exports fell in June as the United States ramped up trade pressure, while imports shrank more than expected, pointing to further strains on the world's second largest economy.
(China trade: imports and exports (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GLOBAL-MARKETS/0H001QEHL78P/index.html)
""The export data was really weak, and it's one signal that the trade war has started to bite Chinese exporters and that companies are starting to re-route their supply chains,"" said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank in Utrecht, Netherlands.
""European markets are waiting for a cue on what is happening between the United States and China on trade.""
The data comes after a string of disappointing economic reports from around the globe, which showed that the global economy suffered from a protracted U.S.-China trade war that forced major central banks to take a more accommodative stance.
China is also due to release second-quarter GDP figures on Monday which are expected to show the world's second-largest economy slowing to its weakest pace in at least 27 years.
Euro zone industrial production rising more than expected in May, offsetting declines in the past two months and defying gloomy forecasts caused by prolonged trade tensions.
The positive reading could undermine European Central Bank policymakers who favor more stimulus to counter weak growth and low inflation in the euro zone, although economists warn the improvement may only be temporary.
ECB policymakers gathering last month agreed on the need to be ready to provide more stimulus to the euro zone economy in an environment of ""heightened uncertainty"", official minutes of the meeting showed on Thursday.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2%. 
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was lower for a third straight day, down 0.1%. A stronger-than-expected reading of failed to shake convictions that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates at a policy meeting later this month. 
The core U.S. consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.3% in June, the largest increase since January 2018, data on Thursday showed. 
The reading pushed U.S. Treasury yields higher, but money markets still indicated one rate cut at the end of July and a cumulative 64 basis points in cuts by the end of 2019.
Comments by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans scheduled later on Friday and New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Monday will provide a chance to gauge how dovish the central bank is, said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.
""If these Fed officials are not as dovish as Powell, and if the New York Fed's manufacturing survey on Monday proves stronger than forecast, they could show that the dollar weakening in response to Powell's congressional testimony was overdone."" 
Elsewhere in currencies, the euro (EUR=EBS) got a boost from a selloff in the German bond market, rising 0.1% to $1.1270.
Safe haven German government bonds were set for their biggest weekly selloff in nearly one-and-a-half years as signs of economic strength in the United States and parts of Europe suggested fears of a downturn may be overdone. 
Oil prices hovered near six-week highs and were on track for a weekly gain as U.S. oil producers in the Gulf of Mexico cut more than half their output because of a tropical storm and as tensions continued to simmer in the Middle East. 
Global benchmark Brent crude gained 0.24% to $66.68 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 0.03% to $60.22 a barrel.
Gold prices, dulled by the stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation data, regained their shine thanks to renewed trade worries and rate cut expectations. Spot gold last traded up 0.3% at $1,407.61 per ounce. 

Shanghai nickel prices recorded their strongest weekly gain since June 2018, as investors bet on the potential demand for the metal in the electric vehicle (EV) battery sector.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Expectations are low for bank earnings but investors say 'buy',"By Sinéad Carew and Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Low interest rates and weak trading volume have pushed down Wall Street's second-quarter estimates for the biggest U.S. banks, yet investors still say they want in on the sector.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) kick off the second-quarter company earnings season with reports out Monday and Tuesday. On Thursday  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reports.
Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) growth for the S&P 500 bank index of 11%, down from 14.4% on Jan. 1. Revenue growth expectations have dropped to 1.6% from 3.4%, according to the average of estimates gathered by Refinitiv.
This is partly thanks to a flatter yield curve - the narrowing spread between short-term interest rates and long-term rates. On top of this, trading volumes fell in the quarter as many investors stayed on the sidelines due to volatility related to the U.S.-China trade war.
And looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates as soon as this month - a move that some analysts say could add more pressure to bank net interest margins, a closely watched measure of bank profitability which expands or contracts depending on the yield curve.
While lower interest rates make the cost of funding cheaper for most companies, they reduce banks' ability to charge up for its lending services.
""Right now there's just no catalyst for revenue growth. We're talking about an environment where rates are coming down which means net interest margins are under pressure,"" said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods based in New York. ""Things have to get worse before they get better. We haven't seen the worst yet in our view. We still expect rates to go lower putting further pressure on bank earnings.""
The dimming outlook has already diminished valuations with the bank index trading at about 10.2 times estimates for next 12 months earnings, compared with its average multiple of 12.4 for the last 10 years, according to Refinitiv data.
But some investors say revenue worries are overblown and that banks could make it out of the rate cycle better than expected. Further, the lower valuations also look attractive compared with the benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) 17.1 multiple.
The S&P bank index has risen 17.5% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has risen 19.7%.
""Because of the fact rates have been pushed lower and the yield curve continues to be flat, (banks are) somewhat unloved,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston referring to bank stocks.
""To me that makes an interesting investment and the catalyst for banks would be the continued loosening of regulations and a steepening of the yield curve.""
Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist Jim Paulsen also likes banks. He expects a steepening yield curve to help net interest margins.
Investors like Paulsen expect the yield curve to steepen if Fed rate cuts improve economic growth. Aaron Dunn, portfolio manager for large cap value at Eaton Vance in Boston, says investors have been too bearish on banks.
But he says it is important to be selective as valuations are not so compelling that he is ""pounding the table to buy."" For example, with JPMorgan's price-to-tangible book value ratio close to 2, Dunn would like ""much faster earnings growth to get behind it."" JPM is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.4% to $2.51 when it issues results on Tuesday, according to estimates gathered by Refinitiv.
In comparison, Dunn is ""very interested"" in Goldman Sachs which has a price-to-tangible book value ratio close to 1 and is expected to report an EPS decline of 16.5% to $5.
Bank executives have also downplayed the impact of interest rates in recent investor conferences. Citigroup said a 25-basis point rate shift would cut revenue by $50 million per quarter. Citi, one of the least rate sensitive banks of the pack, typically makes upwards of $70 billion in revenue annually.
Last month Wells Fargo executives said a steepening yield curve following a Fed rate cut would help its mortgage business.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), one of the most rate-sensitive banks, touted its ability to grow profit regardless of the economic environment, although it has admitted it may not grow as fast. Last quarter Bank of America, due to report results Wednesday, said it expects 3% net income growth for the year compared with 6% in 2018.
Still investors will be looking for signs of confidence from executives that banks can continue growing.
""Earnings aren't going to be great but everybody already knows that. What's the outlook for the back half of the year?"" said Eaton Vance's Dunn."

Investing.com -- Europe's stock markets were mostly higher after early trading in the region Friday, as reassuring economic data out of China helped to offset an earlier blow to confidence from German automaker  Daimler . 
Markets turned higher after figures showing that Chinese exports fell less than expected in June. New loans also came in slightly lower than expected, easing fears that the authorities were relying on an excessive buildup of credit to soften the impact of the trade war with the U.S. 
Further support came as industrial production data for the euro zone came in slightly stronger than expected.
Despite that - and despite multiple signals from the Federal Reserve about its intention to ease monetary policy in the near future - markets are on course to end the week lower. That's in sharp contrast to the U.S., where both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hit new record highs on the back of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress.
As of 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.2% at 387.52, but still down 0.7% for the week. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.3% and the French CAC 40 led the way with a 0.5% gain. 
However, Germany's Dax lagged, flat on the day and down nearly 2% on the week after  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, announced yet another profit warning, its second in less than a month. The company said that its latest assessment of its legal liabilities due to the diesel emissions scandal, along with various issues affecting van sales, meant that it would report a loss of around 1.6 billion euros in the second quarter, and that full-year earnings would be significantly below last year's. The company had previously guided for 2019 profits to be broadly the same as last year's.
Daimler's shares fell 3% at the opening, testing a six-year low, but recovered on the Chinese data to be down only 1.0%. However, they remained the clear underperformer in the sector across Europe. 
There was more encouraging news from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which announced a $2.6 billion investment in Ford Motor's autonomous vehicle business Argo. The investment is the latest evidence of how the world's biggest auto groups are teaming up to share the costs of developing self-driving cars, one of the two mega-trends looming over the industry. VW's preferred shares rose 1.2% in early trading."

Apart from the quest to cut carbon emissions to curb global warming, the United Nations shipping agency is introducing tougher anti-pollution standards in the industry's biggest shake-up for decades.
BHP said ships fueled by LNG (liquefied natural gas) would eliminate NOx (nitrogen oxide) and SOx (sulfur oxide) emissions and, though not a zero-carbon solution, would bring a significant reduction in CO2 emissions until other options are available.
BHP, the world's biggest diversified miner, stands apart from others in the sector with its target of net zero emissions by the second half of the century, in line with U.N. carbon-cutting goals.
That is a huge challenge, especially if it includes emissions related to the group's vast amounts of coking coal and iron ore for steelmaking, as well as shipping of the material.
""We recognize we have a stewardship role, working with our customers, suppliers and others to influence emissions reductions across the full life cycle of our products,"" said Rashpal Bhatti, BHP's vice president for maritime and supply chain excellence.
BHP was ""fully supportive"" of the International Maritime Organization's decision to impose lower limits on sulfur levels in marine fuels, Bhatti added."

685,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 06:32AM ET</span>",Bonds Are Sliding and Analysts Are Struggling for an Explanation,"(Bloomberg) -- The global selloff in long-dated bonds is dividing opinion among traders and analysts. Some explain it as profit taking, others point to the stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data, and a few are flagging the possibility of a so-called reflation trade.
Stronger-than-forecast gains in U.S. consumer price indexes in June are being cited as an obvious answer, given the figures prompted rates traders to trim bets on how much easing is on the way from the Federal Reserve.
This explanation, though, doesn’t explain the out-performance on Thursday of two-year Treasuries. That tenor should have been more sensitive to the monetary policy outlook than longer-dated bonds. And it doesn’t explain why European bonds were sold even before the American CPI report.
Treasury 30-year bond yields jumped eight basis points on Thursday, the most since October, outpacing an increase of three basis points in two-year notes. Germany’s 30-year yields rose seven basis points on Thursday, while two-year yields were little changed.
Royal Bank of Canada pointed to a “slight reflation theme” amid expectations the euro area will benefit the most from global easing.
Mizuho Securities Co. was unequivocal in pinning Thursday’s action on reflation trades, in which investors buy riskier assets while selling bonds on expectations that monetary easing will accelerate growth and inflation.
Soft demand at a 30-year Treasury bond auction Thursday is consistent with this theory.
But the most straightforward explanation is profit taking following the best return in three years for for global bonds in the second quarter. Because futures have already priced in almost a 1% point rate reduction by the Fed before the end of next year, U.S. monetary policy alone may not extend the rally in Treasuries.
Asset managers have boosted their net long positions in Treasury 10-year note futures to 885,068 contracts from a year-to-date low of 676,213 contracts in April, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Franklin Templeton Investments Australia has exited its bullish positioning in the U.S. and Australian debt markets, said Andrew Canobi, director for fixed income in Melbourne.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Thomas Cook (L:TCG) is in talks on a 750 million pound ($941 million) bailout that will give its largest investor Fosun Tourism (HK:1992) control of the indebted British group's package-tour business, in a blow to other shareholders.
Shares in Thomas Cook dropped by more than 30% to their lowest level on record after news of the proposed deal, which would also give Club Med owner Fosun a minority interest in Thomas Cook's airline business.
""This comes at a cost, with a significant dilution for existing shareholders, many of whom have held the stock and supported the business for many years,"" Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said of the proposed deal.
""However, this proposal is the pragmatic and responsible solution to secure the future of the Thomas Cook business and brand and to preserve as much value as possible for all our stakeholders,"" Fankhauser added.
Fosun International (HK:0656), co-founded by billionaire Guo Guangchang and one of China's biggest conglomerates, has spent billions of dollars over the past decade buying healthcare, tourism and fashion companies in the United States and Europe.
""We are committed investors, with a proven track record of turning around iconic brands including Club Med and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC,"" Hong Kong-listed Fosun, which already owns an 18% stake in Thomas Cook, told Reuters.
Thomas Cook said that the cash from the proposed deal, which would mark one of the most significant purchases of a British company by a Chinese group in years, would be enough for it to trade over the winter season and give it flexibility to invest.
The world's oldest travel company, which has been hit by fading demand for its package holidays, high debt and a hot 2018 summer in Europe, has also been weighing approaches for its airline business and Nordic operations.
Fankhauser said the sale process for the airline business was paused while Thomas Cook focused on the refinancing. ""It's too early to speculate on what will happen on the airline review,"" he said.
Other tour operators are also facing challenges and in May Anglo-German rival TUI (DE:TUIGn) reported deeper first-half losses due to airline overcapacity for Spain and the grounding of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes.
178-year-old Thomas Cook has seen its market value drop from around $4 billion when it made its debut on the London market in June 2007 to about $255 million before the bailout plan.
Its stock had more than halved in value so far this year after several profit warnings as weak demand led to increased promotional activity and earlier discounting than usual.
The British holiday company's tour business had 11 million customers in 2018 and produced 7.4 billion pounds in revenue. Its higher-margin airline business - which includes German holiday carrier Condor - made 3.5 billion pounds in revenue.
The company on Friday said summer bookings in its tour operations business were down 9%, while those at its airline business are down 3%, likely leading to operating profit in the second half of the year coming in lower than the year-ago period.

DEAL DETAILS
Thomas Cook's recapitalization proposal, which may comprise a capital injection and new financing facilities, comes a month after it said it was in talks with Fosun following a preliminary approach by the Chinese firm.
Fosun has been purchasing tourism assets including France's Club Med, as the industry is viewed as key to China's shift toward a more consumption-driven model of economic growth from an investment and export-led one.
But like its domestic peers including HNA Group, Fosun, China's largest privately held conglomerate, has faced increasing scrutiny from Beijing for debt-fuelled, big-ticket foreign deals in recent years.
It said earlier this year that it will adopt an asset-light strategy and run under management contracts the Club Med resorts it plans to launch in China and other countries.
The proposal, which Fosun said was subject to due diligence and further talks, envisions that a significant amount of its external bank and bond debt will be converted into equity."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's restrictions on certain tech exports to South Korea are deepening a decades-long feud over wartime forced labor and may make compromise harder as leaders in both countries appeal to their political bases. 
Japan's tighter export restrictions on three materials crucial for smartphone displays and microchips could hit tech giants, such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc, that supply chips to the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. They also underscore Japan's grip on a key link in the global supply chain.
Polling data on Friday showed 61% of South Koreans blamed the Japanese government for the current row and 67% were willing to boycott Japanese products.
""If Japan was trying to give South Korea a shock and force it to compromise, that was a mistake,"" said Masao Okonogi, a professor emeritus at Tokyo's Keio University, adding that growing anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea could make it harder for President Moon Jae-in to seek a solution. 
""This is becoming a crisis of the 1965 system,"" he said, referring to the year the two countries normalized diplomatic ties.
A Japanese foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters on Friday that tighter export curbs were not intended as retaliation over the wartime workers dispute. 
But Japan's trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, mentioned the wartime labor dispute as a cause of mistrust when he announced the curbs, and sources familiar with the Japanese government's position said the two issues were closely entangled.
""We want the Korean side to understand the scale of the anger on our side,"" one such source said. All of the sources familiar with the government's position did not wish to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Japan's export curbs came just ahead of a July 21 upper-house election that Abe needs to win big to keep alive his hopes of revising the pacifist constitution. 
Abe's ruling bloc is on track to win a solid majority, media surveys show, but must have a two-thirds ""super majority,"" including like-minded allies, to approve constitutional revisions.
A survey by the Japan News Network (JNN) released this week showed that 58% of voters backed the export curbs, compared with 24% who were opposed. But the top issues in the election are worries about the country's pension system and a sales tax increase. 
PLAYING TO THE BASE
Relations between Washington's two biggest Asian allies have long been plagued by memories of Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the peninsula and the war. Particularly thorny is the matter of ""comfort women,"" a euphemism for girls and women forced to work in Japanese wartime military brothels.
Many Japanese resent being urged to atone for misdeeds more than seven decades old, while many in South Korea doubt the sincerity of Tokyo's apologies.
The dispute worsened last year when South Korean courts ordered Japanese companies to compensate former conscripted laborers.
Japan says that the matter was settled by the 1965 treaty and that by demanding compensation, Seoul is violating international law. 
Abe appears to be playing to his conservative base, and Moon's need to court his own supporters means he is unlikely to back down, the experts said.
""Let's not forget that Moon is a populist leader ... A populist leader cannot afford to be humiliated and forced to change course,"" said Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Japan's Hosai International University.
For both Moon and Abe, Horvat added, resolving the dispute ""would make them statesmen but it might not win the next election.""
A Gallup poll released on Friday showed a slight dip in Moon's approval rating alongside strong public support for the South Korean position.
Complicating matters are media reports that hydrogen fluoride, one of the materials covered by the export curbs, was shipped to North Korea after being exported to the South. Hydrogen fluoride can be used in chemical weapons.
Seoul has angrily denounced the reports as groundless and on Friday called for an international investigation.
Japanese government officials have declined to comment, saying only there were ""inappropriate instances"" of South Korea's export controls.
Officials from the two sides were meeting in Tokyo on Friday, but Japan has said it was not thinking of withdrawing the curbs.
Japan might soften its tone slightly after the election, but is unlikely to remove the restrictions soon, a former senior Japanese diplomat said, adding that Abe has not faced major domestic criticism for his tough stance.
""They can meet many times, but I don't think a mutually acceptable solution will be found,"" said the ex-diplomat, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Nor is U.S. President Donald Trump's administration likely to try to ease friction between its two allies.

""The solution will be for the two governments to put their heads together,"" Ha Jong-moon, a professor at South Korea's Hanshin University. ""It would be good for the United States to help open the door to negotiations by setting the table, but I think it would be hard to expect that of them.""

688,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>",Beijing Signals Talks at Early Stage as Trump Vents Frustration,"(Bloomberg) -- When it comes to Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, signs are growing that President Donald Trump won’t get what he wants anytime soon.
Trump complained Thursday that China hasn’t boosted its purchases of U.S. farm products, a promise he claims he secured in a meeting with his counterpart Xi Jinping in June. But according to officials in Beijing familiar with the talks, no such agreement was made. China’s Commerce Ministry yesterday also indicated that in their view, substantial discussions have yet to restart even though both sides spoke on the phone.
China has started preparing to buy farm products, including gauging the prices of U.S. soybeans, but will not purchase large amounts until it sees concrete progress in the negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. Small purchases could happen before that, the person said.
Trump and Xi agreed to a tentative pause in raising tariffs after their meeting in Osaka, though varying readouts and vague comments from Trump have sown confusion about what was actually agreed on in the room. Major sticking points include when and by how much China will increase its imports of U.S. farm products, and how exactly the U.S. will ease trade restrictions on Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co.
China’s stance so far suggests that “the purchase of agricultural products is pegged to the entire deal being done,” said He Weiwen, a former commerce ministry official who is now a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. “It is not a case that China buys American products first to get a final deal, but rather that after a final deal is inked, China will make the purchases it agreed to.”
China has rejected a U.S. demand to increase agricultural purchases beyond the number Trump and Xi agreed to in Argentina last year, according to Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet. He was speaking after the June summit.
U.S. Department of Agriculture data indicate that China actually slowed its purchases of American agriculture products following the Osaka meeting. The nation bought 127,800 metric tons of U.S. soybeans last week, a 79% reduction from the previous week. Similarly, China bought just 76 tons of American pork, compared to 10,400 tons in June.
Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted late Thursday that the “achievement of Osaka summit is a China-U.S. consensus, not a unilateral commitment China made to the U.S. Hope the U.S. will lift all sanctions on Huawei soon and respect the principle of equality.”
Huawei Reprieve
Last week, an influential Chinese agricultural researcher said it’s unlikely Beijing will start purchasing large amounts of U.S. products anytime soon. Barriers include tit-for-tat tariffs that remain in place, as well as tensions over Huawei, according to Li Qiang, chairman and chief analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.
“The trade teams in the two nations will restart trade negotiations on a basis of equality and mutual respect, following the consensus agreed by their two state leaders in Osaka,” Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday at a regular briefing. Gao didn’t say when the negotiations would be held, but said he hoped the U.S. would implement its commitments with regards to Huawei.
When questioned last week about Trump’s claim in Japan that China had agreed to buy “tremendous” amounts of U.S. farm goods, Gao said that the two nations had large room to cooperate on agriculture, and hoped that a solution could be reached on the basis of equality.
“It seems the two sides are arm-wrestling about the basis on which they’ll resume talks, as well as when and where,” said Zhou Xiaoming, a former commerce ministry official and diplomat. “The U.S. shouldn’t expect that the text agreed before May will automatically become the basis for the new round of trade talks.”

China's yuan-denominated exports rose 6.1% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, while imports increased 1.4%, customs data showed, which resulted in a trade surplus of 1.23 trillion yuan ($178.94 billion) for the first six months.
The data comes after a spate of disappointing economic reports from around the globe, which showed that the global economy suffered from a protracted U.S.-China trade war that forced major central banks to take a more accommodative stance.

690,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 04:19AM ET</span>",Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com -- Here's the three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
Wholesale Inflation on Tap
Wholesale inflation figures arrive Friday, a day after U.S. consumer prices topped economists’ expectations.
The Labor Department will issue the June producer price index (PPI) report at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). On average, economists expect that the PPI rose 0.1% last month with the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rising 0.2%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would bring year-over-year PPI growth to 1.6% and core PPI growth up 2.2%.
The PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.
Rig Counts on Tap
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which remains a notch below production records set in December 2018. 
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by 5 to 788.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 23 cents lower, or 0.4%, at $60.20 a barrel, as OPEC's forecast for slower crude demand next year exacerbated fears of a surplus in crude supplies, which would weigh on oil prices. 
China Trade Data in Focus
Traders will look to China’s June trade data for clues about the health of the world’s second largest economy, with both exports and imports forecast to show a decline. 
China’s exports are expected to have declined by 2.0% year-on-year, from 1.1% rise in May, while the decline in imports is forecast to have slowed to 4.5% following an 8.5% slump in May.
The faster fall in imports than exports is expected to widen the country’s trade surplus."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The gap in valuations of Japanese shares is at its widest since the dot-com crisis two decades ago and will likely stay that way until global trade tensions ease, analysts say.
The Nikkei share average (N225) has been stuck in a narrow trading range for months but, behind the lull in activity, a major polarization is taking place, analysts say.
""On average, Japanese share valuations are fairly cheap, but when you are stock-picking, many of the shares you would like are already quite expensive,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
""On the other hand, you have cheap shares but few investors will buy because they keep getting cheaper,"" he added.
A handful of stocks viewed as immune to the U.S.-China trade war and other trade disputes are very expensive.
As their share prices have soared, so has the price book-value ratio (PBR), a key metric used by investors. A higher ratio indicates the stock is potentially overvalued.
These stocks include cosmetics firm Shiseido (T:4911) with a PBR of 7.3, and drugmaker Chugai Pharmaceuticals (T:4519) at 5.2.  Recruit Holdings  (T:6098), which matches companies with potential employees, is among the services firms doing well in a sluggish economy. It has a PBR of 6.1.
(polarised stock market: https://tmsnrt.rs/32kOrZy)
Meanwhile, big banks and automakers, the traditional face of corporate Japan, have seen their PBRs fall, in some cases well below 1.0. That indicates the market believes the stock is not worth the total net assets of the company.
Honda Motor Co. (T:7267) and Nissan Motor Co. (T:7201) have seen their ratios fall to about 0.6, while Toyota Motor Corp. (T:7203) is trading at 1.0, near its record low.
The autos sector is trading at a PBR of 0.8 as investors worry about the impact of trade wars and game-changing technologies such as electric cars and automated driving.
The ratios for banks are even lower due to negative interest rates and fintech firms challenging traditional banking.
The top three banking groups -- Mitsubishi UFJ (T:8028), Sumitomo Mitsui (T:8316) and Mizuho (T:8411) -- are buried between 0.4 and 0.5, with banks as a whole trading at a record low PBR of about 0.4.
While stock markets always have winners and losers, the gap between them has reached historic levels, said Masahiro Suzuki, senior quants analyst at Daiwa Securities.
The coefficient of variation, a measure of the relative dispersion of PBRs, shows the gap among listed firms on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main board is at its widest point in almost two decades, he said.
(polarised market: https://tmsnrt.rs/32m6Ntm)
The PBR for Tokyo's main Topix index (TOPX) is about 1.2, above a record low of 0.9 in 2012 but still relatively low compared to international peers.
With few attractive investment opportunities, investors have stayed away from the Tokyo market this year.
Foreign and domestic investors have been net sellers of stocks so far this year, according to stock exchange data.
The few buyers are companies buying back their shares and the Bank of Japan, which plans to buy about 6 trillion yen of shares a year as part of a stimulus program. Outperforming stocks are fueled by the BOJ's massive purchases of ETFs which has reduced the share floats of popular companies, traders say.
(Japan business sentiment: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NW782S)
The polarized conditions are expected to linger as long as the U.S.-China trade war is unresolved.
""The pre-requisite for Japanese stocks to rise as a whole is to have the U.S. and China getting along with each other,"" said Pictet strategist Takatoshi Itoshima.
Daiwa's Suzuki said he expects U.S.-China trade relations to improve later this year, which would lead to a narrowing of the value gap as bargain hunters buy cheap ""value"" shares.
The polarization in stocks also reflects structural changes, such as digitization and the emergence of new business models, in global industries, said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities.
""When the economy is going through structural changes, the stock market tends to get polarized,"" he said.
""In 2000, people thought the internet will change everything. That was a bit premature, but now it is becoming a reality,"" he added."

695,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 02:41AM ET</span>","China considers limited support for petrol-electric hybrids in boon for Toyota, Honda","By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering re-classifying petrol-electric hybrid vehicles so they get more favorable treatment than all-petrol or diesel counterparts under clean car rules, making it easier for automakers to meet environment quotas and offer more choice.
Global hybrid leaders Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) would be among the biggest beneficiaries of such change, which could allow them to make more hybrids and less of the more costly all-electric vehicles, experts said, after reviewing the draft policy proposal published on Tuesday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
China has some of the world's strictest rules regarding the production of greenhouse gas-emitting vehicles, as it battles unhealthy levels of air pollution in its crowded cities.
Those rules have pushed both domestic and international automakers to spend billions of dollars on the development and production of so-called new-energy vehicles (NEVs), such as those powered solely by electricity and hydrogen fuel cells, as well as plug-in hybrids.
Under a system that kicked in this year, automakers in China are obliged to make up for a portion of the ""negative"" points they incur when they produce internal combustion engine vehicles with points won for producing NEVs.
Though more fuel-efficient than petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles, hybrids, introduced in 1997 with Toyota's Prius, are currently classed alongside those powered by fossil fuels.
In the draft proposal, hybrids would still be considered fossil-fuelled but re-classified as ""low fuel consumption passenger vehicles"". Significantly, the number of negative points incurred for making hybrids will be less than for traditional vehicles.
That could see more of those traditional vehicles replaced with hybrids, experts said, because when automakers produce hybrids, they would have to make up for fewer negative points.
The proposed change came as a surprise, some experts and industry officials said, because the government has never given any preferential treatment for hybrid technology. Previously, the government offered subsidies for, for instance, the purchase of all-electric cars.
""The new proposed policy is a roundabout way to promote hybrid cars,"" Cui Dongshu, secretary general of China Passenger Car Association, wrote in a social media post.
Hybrid cars sold in China include versions of Toyota's Corolla, Levin and Camry sedans, and versions of Honda's Accord and CR-V. Beijing-based spokesmen for both Japanese automakers declined to comment.
Local automaker GAC Motor (SS:601238), which makes hybrids in partnership with Toyota and Honda, said it ""keeps close attention to national policies and will actively respond to the promotion and development of relevant policies and standards."""

Harvest would increase its investment, included a $100 million investment from a JDI customer, Japan Display said. A source previously said that customer was Apple Inc.
The Japanese company said it planned to hold a shareholders meeting on Aug. 29 to formalize the bailout plan.
Apple's recent shift away from liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) has triggered a funding crunch for Japan Display, which depended on the U.S. smartphone maker for 60.6% of its revenue in the last financial year ended March.
Harvest has been leading a consortium to keep Japan Display afloat, but Taiwanese screen maker TPK Holding Co Ltd and financial firm CGL Group dropped out of the process in June.
Japan Display also said that Hong Kong-based activist investor Oasis Management, already part of the bailout consortium, has offered to extend more financing if currency fluctuations result in a shortfall."

FinEst Bay Area Development said it signed a memorandum of understanding with China Railway International Group, China Railway Engineering Company, China Communications Construction Company, and financier Touchstone Capital Partners.
""The partner companies are the largest in the world in their own fields of expertise,"" said Peter Vesterbacka, co-founder of Finest Bay Development company.
The new partners were needed as Finland and Estonia had limited resources in tunnel boring and high-speed train technologies, he said.
In March the project got a provisional 15 billion euros ($16.9 billion) from China's Touchstone Capital Partners. Roughly 12.5 billion euros will go into construction.
Beijing's Belt and Road initiative seeks to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, through a network along the lines of the old Silk Road as well as through an Arctic route.
Finland and Estonia have for years considered linking their capitals, which are divided by the Gulf of Finland. The tunnel would cut the travel time to 20 minutes from the two-hour ferry ride, conducted by thousands of people daily.
A 2017-published feasibility study commissioned by the two governments said the planned tunnel could open in 2040 but the builders said it could be built by the end of 2024, with some parts opening already before.
The project is yet to secure backing from the two governments."

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Singapore has cautioned wealth managers against aggressively marketing their services or making other efforts to woo clients to the city state by capitalizing on rival Hong Kong's political turmoil, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Officials from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made the request last month to wealth managers, including DBS (SI:DBSM) and a unit of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (SI:OCBC), the people said, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
The central bank told bankers it wanted to ensure wealth managers in Singapore were sensitive to the situation in Hong Kong and did not design campaigns specifically targeting business from Hong Kong, the people said.
The move comes as Hong Kong has been thrown into turmoil by a proposed extradition bill - declared dead this week by its CEO Carrie Lam - that for the first time would have allowed China to seek extraditions from the city, sparking demonstrations that attracted at least a million protesters. 
Some tycoons in the Chinese-controlled territory have moved funds, or considered doing so, given provisions in the bill that would have allowed China to potentially freeze funds or other assets in the city.
The unrest has also encouraged some wealth managers to choose to set up in Singapore after also considering Hong Kong, the main offshore hubs for wealth management in Asia, Reuters has reported.
When asked for a comment for this story, MAS referred to comments last month by its managing director, Ravi Menon, that there were no signs of ""any significant shift of business or funds"" from Hong Kong to Singapore. 
He had said that any upheaval in Hong Kong could actually be negative for Singapore.
It was not immediately clear how many banks had received the MAS guidance. Private banks routinely and legally help clients to move and manage their assets in different parts of the world.
""The message was that we shouldn't be taking undue advantage of what's going on in Hong Kong,"" a senior banking source said on condition of anonymity.
""We have to act responsibly and not launch campaigns to convince clients that this is a good time for them to move their assets,"" he said, adding he was not aware of any banks making a big push to get business from Hong Kong in the current climate.
""We are getting a lot of enquiries. What can we do if clients are looking to moving money here? We can't stop the flows,"" the Singapore-based banking source added. 
DBS and OCBC declined to comment.
OFFSHORE MOVE
Hong Kong and Singapore compete fiercely to be considered Asia's premier financial center. Global private banks including  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG), as well as Asian wealth managers have their regional operations in the two hubs.
The riches held by Hong Kong's tycoons have until now made the city the larger private wealth base, with 853 individuals worth more than $100 million - just over double the number in Singapore, according to a 2018 report from Credit Suisse.
Singaporean banks, including DBS and OCBC, have been rapidly expanding their businesses in Hong Kong and China over the past few years, and the Greater China region accounts for a significant portion of their revenue.
Like their global peers, Singaporean wealth managers also have Greater China desks in Singapore dedicated to clients in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and help them open bank accounts and set up family offices or trusts.
""The fact is that we are getting inquiries from clients in Hong Kong. They want to know how this will impact their assets and the Hong Kong markets,"" an industry executive said. 

""If they really want to move offshore, we have to help them with that,"" the executive added.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 11:34PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Walmart told U.S. government India e-commerce rules regressive, warned of trade impact","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) told the U.S. government privately in January that India's new investment rules for e-commerce were regressive and had the potential to hurt trade ties, a company document seen by Reuters showed.
The lobbying effort yielded no result at the time - India implemented the new rules from Feb. 1 - but the document underlines the level of concern at Walmart about the rules. Differences over e-commerce regulations have become one of the biggest issues in frayed trade ties between New Delhi and Washington.
""It came as a total surprise ... this is a major change and a regressive policy shift,"" Walmart's Senior Director for Global Government Affairs Sarah Thorn told the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in an e-mail on Jan. 7. 
Just months earlier, Walmart had invested $16 billion in Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, its biggest ever acquisition globally. 
In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, Walmart said it regularly offers input to the U.S. and Indian governments on policy issues and this was a ""past issue and Walmart and Flipkart are looking ahead"". 
""Walmart has had good consultations with the government of India,"" a company spokeswoman added.
The USTR did not respond to a request for comment.
In the January letter to the USTR, Walmart said it wanted a six-month delay in the implementation of the rules, but that did not happen. Washington did raise concerns about the policy with New Delhi, but India gave a non-committal response, an Indian trade ministry official told Reuters at the time.
Walmart's problems in India highlight the regulatory complications it faces as it restructures its international business to boost growth and online sales. Mexico's competition regulator recently blocked its acquisition of delivery app Cornershop, while in Britain it was stopped from merging its British arm Asda with rival Sainsbury's.
These issues, however, have failed to unnerve Walmart investors. Walmart shares have risen 21 percent, compared with a 19 percent increase for the S&P 500 since the start of the year.
NEW INDIA RULES
A USTR delegation led by Christopher Wilson, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, was to meet Indian officials in New Delhi on Friday to resume discussions on trade ties and the e-commerce issue was likely to be high on the agenda.
In its January representation, Walmart told the USTR that India's new policy wasn't good for global businesses, highlighting that its foreign direct investment would help Flipkart grow and result in ""significant"" tax revenues for New Delhi.
""Changing rules to hinder international business following major investments ... will have important implications for India FDI goals and add unnecessary pressure to trade discussions,"" Walmart said in its note. 
The new rules barred companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and also from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) removed thousands of products from its India website briefly in February as it initially struggled to comply with the new policy. Flipkart was forced to rework some of its vendor relationships, sources told Reuters at the time.
The policy, implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi months before his re-election in May, was seen aimed at winning the support of small Indian traders, who had long complained they were losing business due to the steep discounts offered by foreign e-commerce giants. 
""The action appears in every respect ... intended to placate Indian companies and local traders,"" Walmart told the USTR.
SMALL TRADERS VS BIG RETAILERS
Reuters obtained the two-page representation Walmart sent to the USTR through a Freedom of Information Act request first filed in January. The USTR in February provided a heavily-redacted version of the document, citing confidentiality reasons. In consultation with Walmart, it withdrew most of those redactions this week following an appeal from Reuters.
Although Reuters asked for both Amazon and Walmart's communications, the USTR responded saying it found only one e-mail with Walmart's representation between Dec. 22 and Jan. 28, the period for which the records were searched.
Since the policy has been announced, Indian oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries has repeatedly talked about its plans to diversify into e-commerce.
Walmart's document released to Reuters did not name Reliance, but the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company argued the policy discriminated against foreign firms, and not just in favor of small domestic players.
""The purported rationale of such regulations is to protect small retail players who are seen to be threatened,"" Walmart said, but added: ""This argument does not account for why there should be differentiated treatment between large foreign eCommerce companies, and large domestic companies.""
In the past six months, several Walmart executives have also weighed in publicly on India's new e-commerce policy, including Chief Executive Doug McMillon, who said in February the company was disappointed by the Indian government's decision.
""We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field,"" he said.
DEFENDING E-COMMERCE 
India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has said the government was committed to protecting small traders, but open to ironing out policy-related issues. Goyal said on Twitter on Wednesday he had met Walmart International's CEO, Judith McKenna, and discussed ways of boosting sales of Indian-made products.
In a closed-door meeting last month, however, Goyal warned both Flipkart and Amazon to comply with the new rules in letter and spirit, and questioned them on their discounting policies, Reuters has reported.
The Walmart spokeswoman on Thursday said that, in line with the company's commitment to India, it looked forward to contributing to the country's retail ecosystem. 
Amazon was not aware of Walmart's January representation to the USTR, according to a person with direct knowledge. The company in a statement said it continued to engage with New Delhi to enhance infrastructure and create jobs.
Walmart told the USTR in January that its unit Flipkart, as well as Amazon, had opened many new distribution centers over the past three years in India, creating thousands of jobs and greatly benefiting to consumers.

It warned of ""serious consequences"" if the new policy was implemented hastily. ""The lack of policy stability makes it very difficult for companies to continue planned investments, both in the eCommerce sector and beyond,"" Walmart wrote.

The value of VW's contribution to the collaboration is more than $2 billion, including about $1 billion invested, said two industry sources who requested anonymity discussing the deal. VW declined to comment. A Ford spokeswoman said the No. 2 U.S. automaker was in productive talks with the German company across a number of areas and more details would be provided on Friday. Ford created Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC in 2018, pledging to invest $4 billion until 2023. It has sought outside investors to help share the spiraling cost of developing autonomous vehicle technology. Pittsburgh-based Argo AI, a start-up bought by Ford in 2017, is part of that unit. Volkswagen and Ford have been discussing for months how to share the burdens of investing in future electric and autonomous vehicles. The apparent agreement between the global manufacturers is the latest sign of how pressure to cut carbon emissions and fend off challengers from the technology industry is driving consolidation among automakers.  Rather than continue developing their own, proprietary technology, automakers are sharing vehicle components and technologies. As with Ford and VW, much of this sharing is happening without outright takeovers and mergers. Honda Motor Co (T:7267) last year joined forces with General Motors Co (N:GM) to develop autonomous vehicles by investing $2.75 billion in GM's Cruise Automation self-driving vehicle unit. Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo has agreements with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) and Jaguar Land Rover to buy and equip vehicles with its self-driving systems. In February, Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) said they would pool resources on automated driving technology.  Fiat Chrysler in May made a merger proposal to France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) aimed at tackling the heavy costs of technological and regulatory changes in the industry, but ultimately abandoned the deal. Analysts at Citi said Ford licensing Volkswagen's MEB platform is a ""transformational"" step.  ""Not only does it likely further de-risk VW estimates in 2020 by guaranteeing some profits from electric vehicles next year, but also likely provides VW with an unassailable scale advantage in the market with it potentially producing around 400,000 battery electric vehicles in Europe next year,"" Citi analyst Angus Tweedie said in a note published on July 10.  VW signed a deal in March to develop a pickup truck using a Ford platform, and the carmakers have been in talks about extending the alliance to include autonomous driving and mobility services, as well as Ford's use of VW's MEB electric-vehicle platform.  
In June, Volkswagen ended its partnership with Aurora only days after the self-driving software start-up firm announced an alliance with Fiat Chrysler.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 10:31PM ET</span>",Make or break: second-quarter results will test Europe's confidence,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan, Josephine Mason and Danilo Masoni
LONDON (Reuters) - Second-quarter earnings in Europe could turn be a reality check for the stock market after its biggest rally in more than two decades.
European stocks (STOXX) have risen 15% so far this year, fueled by hopes for a U.S.-China trade truce and by a shift to dovish monetary policies at U.S. and European central banks.
Investors will now check the pulse of corporate Europe as the second-quarter results season gets under way. Europe's most valuable technology company, SAP (DE:SAPG), semiconductor company ASML (AS:ASML) and Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) are all due to report next week.
With valuations stretched in many sectors and signs that the gains are running out of steam -- the pan European STOXX 600 (STOXX) is set for its first weekly drop in six weeks -- positive earnings will be critical to sustain the rally, analysts, strategists and asset managers said.
With some growth and quality sectors ""priced for perfection"", investors may not be in a forgiving mood if results disappoint, said Barclays Capital equity strategist Emmanuel Cau.
""What I fear is we have more companies saying, well, we got through the first half but we have got no idea what's happening in the second half,"" said Neil Dwane, global strategist and portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors.
""And then the market is going to say 'Blimey! Why am I all the way up here if I can't see the rolling hills of 11% earnings growth in the next 12 months'.""
Companies listed in Europe benchmark STOXX 600 will report earnings growth of 0.8% for the quarter, according to the most recent consensus compiled by I/B/E/S Refinitiv.
That marks an improvement from the first quarter, when earnings fell 2%, but it's a big decline from the same quarter of last year, when earnings rose 9.7%.
It's also down from growth of more than 3.6% expected for the quarter two months ago. In the past week alone, 1 percentage point has been cut from the consensus.
A warning this week from BASF (DE:BASFn) sent shivers through stocks, underscoring concern about the region's corporate health amid worries about an economic slowdown and damage from the prolonged U.S.-China trade conflict.
Companies in defensive and growth business, from consumer staples to technology have been investor favorites during the rate euphoria, but they look particularly vulnerable. Cyclical stocks like autos and banks already reflect a grim outlook.

OUTPERFORMING U.S.
There is a silver lining. For the first time since late 2017, European companies will outperform their U.S. counterparts, which are expected to show an earnings contraction. A lot of that stems from skewed year-on-year comparisons after the White House introduced hefty tax cuts.
Europe's economy has also started surprising to the upside, while the U.S. economy has underwhelmed, according to Citigroup analysis.
(Graphic: Citi: https://tmsnrt.rs/32kqnWL)
But otherwise things have been increasingly downbeat. Heading into the earnings, 3.5 times more companies have been making negative announcements than positive for the second quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2016, according to Cau.
""Q2 earnings are unlikely to impress, and despite lower expectations, stocks may not all be immune to disappointment,"" he said.
Aside from BASF, airlines from Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) to Ryanair (I:RYA), German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and chipmaker Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) have all warned of weaker-than-expected results.
After a brief hiatus in May, analysts have resumed cutting earnings forecasts even as stock markets have rallied. Expectations for full-year growth are dimming as well -- the consensus is 4.1%, the lowest since 2016 and half the levels forecast at the start of the year.

CAPEX AND OUTLOOKS
Aside from headline numbers, investors will also be keeping tabs on capital expenditure plans for signs that the protracted U.S.-China trade conflict and worries about trade threats spreading to Europe are curbing spending.
""We find there are very clear spillovers from Chinese economic activity toward (developed market) capex,"" said Elga Bartsch, head of macro research at BlackRock.
Even with the reduced expectations for the second quarter, don't rule out bad surprises in the second half.
""We're likely to witness more warnings in the later part of the year than during the second-quarter reporting season,"", said Vincent Manuel, chief investment officer at wealth manager CA Indosuez."

Occidental avoided its own shareholder vote on the deal by securing a controversial $10 billion financing agreement with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), which allowed it to raise the cash portion of its offer.
While an Anadarko holders' vote for the proposed deal is very likely, the price has angered several Occidental investors, including billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who has called for a special meeting to replace four Occidental directors. 
Icahn’s demand for Occidental seats seeks to influence the pace and scale of its future asset sales. He has attacked the Anadarko deal as “hugely overpriced” and criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub’s agreements with Berkshire Hathaway and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) that are designed to help finance the purchase.
Anadarko holders would receive about $73.46 for each of their shares, a 57% premium over the stock's closing stock price on April 11, the day before Anadarko said it had a merger agreement with  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX); Chevron was later outmaneuvered by Occidental. Anadarko closed at $71.98 on Thursday.
With Anadarko's nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, Occidental would command 1.64 million acres of prime drilling and gain access to fields in Colorado and Wyoming. 

Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko's non-U.S. oil properties to focus on shale. She also must absorb or sell Anadarko's U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore properties, where it is the third-largest oil producer by volume.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 09:32PM ET</span>",Property speculators hope for investment paradise in southwest China,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
XISHUANGBANNA, China (Reuters) - A bus came to a halt amid a tropical rainforest not far from China's border with Myanmar, dropping off about 30 investors on a property tour, some with children in tow. 
Their objective: to snap up a piece of China's hottest real estate.
Hostesses led the visitors down a winding path hemmed in by frangipani, palm and banana trees. A stone Bodhisattva in lotus position announced their arrival at the showflat. 
One of the investors was already on a video call, trying to persuade a friend to buy in. Another praised the curative powers of Xishuangbanna's temperate weather. Others remarked that the summer lull would be an excellent time for discounts. 
The river town in the hills of Yunnan province has seen a 40% surge in new home prices in June compared with a year earlier, ranking fifth among China's 338 biggest cities, according to private property data provider Qingdao Cityre Estate Data. 
With amber sunsets, fresh air and a tongue-twister of a name, Xishuangbanna is seen as a sort of new Shangri-la for property investors - and a respite from tightly wound markets elsewhere in China. 
Real estate in eastern and southern cities is under a policy lockdown that has suppressed big price gains since 2017. Central China is slowing after hitting dizzying heights, while the sparsely populated north and west draw only the bravest of speculators. 
But Xishuangbanna, thousands of miles from Beijing and Shanghai, ticks many boxes for profit-driven investors. Besides lush landscapes, it has few restrictions on home purchases. 
And for the price of a bathroom in Beijing or Shenzhen, investors can get an apartment with a view of the Lancang River. 
Ma Mao, 40, a businessman from the northern coal hub of Shanxi, was one of many property investors who have settled in Xishuangbanna.
""I bought some homes in 2017 when I first came here for 4,000 yuan ($581) per square meter, and now prices have risen to more than 10,000 yuan,"" said Ma, who moved with his wife and three children two years ago. He now runs a real estate agency.
Big-name developers like Ping An Real Estate Co, Dalian Wanda Group,  Sunac  China Holdings Ltd (HK:1918), and Agile Group Holdings (HK:3383) have all rushed to build to homes there. 
The town's skyline along the Lancang, known as the Mekong in its lower course, is lined with soaring towers of steel and glass. Luxury villas built on wooden stilts stretch far into the rainforest. 
Many investors are also betting on Xishuangbanna's location in the Belt and Road network spearheaded by President Xi Jinping. 
About 30 miles from China's border with Myanmar and Laos, the town of 1 million people stands to gain from increased trade and investment flowing to and from Southeast Asia. 
Developers have spared no effort in marketing the town. Posters in a showroom of an  Agile Property  project showed a high-speed railway map and planned routes from Xishuangbanna to Bangkok (6 hours) and even Singapore (10 hours). 
Property investors are also piling into other Yunnan cities such as Tengchong and Ruili. In neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the port cities of Fangchenggang and Beihai are seen as strategic places to buy, as they are maritime nodes on the Belt and Road network. 
In January-April, home transactions in Yunnan and Guangxi rose 13.9% and 9.8% by floor area from same period last year, respectively, putting them among the four best-performing regions in China, according to data from provincial statistics departments. 
OUTSIDE SPECULATORS
New home prices in Xishuangbanna averaged 11,300 yuan ($1,641) per square meter as of the end of June, according to Cityre Estate Data, similar to prices in provincial capitals in central China.
Ma bought 240 units late last year for more than 80 million yuan ($11.6 million). He plans to develop them into holiday suites this year for elderly vacationers. 
""I sold my apartments in Shanxi in late 2017 when prices peaked, and invested in Xishuangbanna at the same time when the market has not yet taken off,"" said Ma, smiling. 
Xishuangbanna really took off in mid-2018 when it became an alternative to China's resort island of Hainan, where tough measures in April 2018 restricted non-residents from buying homes. 
Li Keyi, a 28-year old law clerk from Xiamen, said her parents are selling properties in the coastal city to invest in Nanning in Guangxi.
Other investors are so-called elderly ""migratory birds"" from the north looking to spend winters in the south. 
Li Shuhua, 53, who was on the property tour, flew into Xishuangbanna after traveling in Turkey. 
The Hebei native had already bought one 108-square-metre apartment as a seasonal vacation home, paying 1.14 million yuan in full. 
She had joined the tour to look at a project developed by Sunac on behalf of her younger sister, who has never been to Xishuangbanna but whom Li persuaded to invest there. 
SETBACKS
But it is not paradise. A Shanxi investor surnamed Yang said a mosquito was all it took to dissuade her from buying. 
Yang's husband was bitten on the second night of their visit and suffered a severe allergic reaction. There was no 24-hour pharmacy near their hotel.
Like two other Shanxi couples on the tour, Yang and her husband scrapped their Xishuangbanna investment plan.
And some people who have already invested, like Ma, have run into problems. 
Ma said he and five of his friends signed a 200 million yuan contract for 71 villas developed by Ping An Real Estate last year. He said they had already paid 100 million yuan.
The project was scheduled for completion last month, but Ping An suspended construction for eight months, resuming work only recently. The company did not comment on why construction paused.
Ma said the developer would not sign formal contracts for 45 of the units he bought and did not return the deposits. Ping An told Reuters it had taken back some units because the buyers had not met payment deadlines, a claim Ma denied.
The project will be finished by April 2020, the company said.

""This has totally messed up my plan, and is putting massive cash-flow pressure on me,"" Ma said.

705,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Tech Firms Cozy Up to China Despite Trade Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- In a packed ballroom in Beijing’s national convention center, the executive from a major technology company laid out ambitious plans for the future of artificial intelligence in China. He explained how customized semiconductors would help power everything from autonomous cars to voice-activated industrial machines.
Only this wasn’t a state-backed enterprise. This was  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., the largest U.S. chipmaker.
The company’s AI chief, Naveen Rao, pledged to work closely, “engineer to engineer,"" on cutting-edge technology with the 7,000 people that attended Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).’s annual developers conference last week. Intel was the top sponsor of the event.
Rao made no mention of politics, though his overwhelming support of Baidu, a Chinese national tech champion, sent a powerful message: Even as U.S. and Chinese leaders are locked in a fierce battle over technological supremacy, companies like Intel remain big backers of China’s tech industry because they rely on the country for significant contributions of revenue, production chains and even talent.
Intel made 27% of its revenue in China last year, more than in the U.S. or any other market, but it’s fighting to hold on to customers there that it spent decades cultivating. Like many American multinationals with large businesses in the country, Intel is walking a fine line between holding on to that lucrative market and keeping in Washington’s good graces. Neutrality is becoming a tougher stance to maintain.
""There’s been a psychotic break” in what some leaders in the U.S. government want and what American businesses want, said Josh Dorfman, founder of One Thousand Million, a China-focused consultancy and think tank based in Dallas. ""Unlike in China, U.S. companies aren’t beholden to the country and are not obligated in any way, shape, or form to be patriotic. They want to make money.""
An Intel spokesman said the company remains engaged with Chinese customers that aren’t on the U.S.’s list of those it sees as a security threat. China is a substantial market for Intel and it has no intention of pulling out now.
Intel isn’t alone. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). is heavily dependent on China not only for the manufacture of Mac computers and iPhones but it’s also a major consumer market, accounting for about 20% of sales. Even as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs that would hit Apple products, the California-based company was making plans to shift production of its new Mac Pro computer to China, sending a clear signal of support.
While some companies are considering moving part of their production out of the country, many others are making gestures of goodwill. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. last week pledged to invest $1.2 billion in China to upgrade logistics distribution centers. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. is in negotiations to sell 100 jetliners to Chinese airlines in one of its largest-ever deals, Bloomberg News reported. And last month, 600 U.S. companies and trade groups signed a letter to Trump warning of tariff-related hits to their businesses.
IBM’s Greater China group chairman Liming Chen said that the escalation of China-U.S. trade frictions has created a ""confusing environment"" for businesses. He outlined International Business Machine Corp.’s long relationship with China, dating back to its products first entering the country in the 1920s, and formally establishing a Shanghai office in 1936.
""  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) has participated in the rapid development of China over the past 40 years, while China has also nourished IBM,"" he wrote in a post on WeChat in June, calling the country an ""indispensable part of our global strategy map.""
The U.S.-China trade war is anchored in competition to dominate the next generation of wireless networks and other technologies as much as politics. The Trump administration worries that American companies in search of profits could actually help China’s tech industry eclipse U.S. prowess in sensitive areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, lambasted Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. in March for Google’s AI work in China, which he alleged ""indirectly benefits the Chinese military."" Trump repeated the critique in a subsequent tweet, questioning the Google parent’s loyalties. Google has said it doesn’t work with China’s military.
The same nationalistic fervor is partly behind the Commerce Department’s May prohibition on selling American components to Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies Co. Despite Trump’s recent pledge to ease restrictions, Huawei remains on America’s so-called entities list and U.S. firms must apply for special licenses to sell parts to the company.
That hasn’t stopped chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). from feverishly trying to find ways to keep supplying the company, one of its largest customers. The U.S. semiconductor industry also lobbied the Trump administration to loosen restrictions on Huawei.
Still, American tech companies are facing a new global reality. They may no longer be able to overlook geopolitics in favor of profits. China may not be the growth savior it once was.
Tech companies ""must now live in a world where their Chinese business partners and global value chains at any given day could blow up,"" said James Lewis, director of the tech and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank. “Trump might have backed off Huawei for now but next week it could be something different and any of these companies are fair game.”
Lewis, who previously served as the U.S. Commerce Department’s lead for national security and espionage concerns related to high-technology trade with China, said Chinese firms are also racing to become less reliant on the very American firms bending over backwards to keep their business.
Splitting the two economies won’t be easy. Research, development, manufacturing and talent in the U.S. and China are still very much interconnected.
""Innovation by American companies is fueled by access to the Chinese market,"" said Samm Sacks, cybersecurity policy and China digital economy fellow at think tank New America, in Congressional testimony in May.
For Intel’s AI chief, collaboration with China helps the company to build better products and bring new technology to market fast.
“I’m proud of the strong and growing partnership between Intel and Baidu,” Intel’s Rao said in Beijing, after greeting developers with a hearty “nihao.” “By working together to advance AI, Baidu and Intel are helping to usher in a world where AI is ubiquitous.”

Nike, which said the expansion is expected to generate more than 500 full-time jobs, made no mention of the loss of the $1 million incentive in its statement on the new facility.
Nike responded to a request for comment with a referral to its statement announcing the new plant.
Last week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, withdrew the incentive for Nike to build the plant after the world's largest sportswear maker canceled the release of a sneaker featuring a colonial-era version of the American flag, which critics say reflects links to slavery.
Nike last week said it canceled the sneaker because it was concerned that it ""could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation's patriotic holiday.""
The Beaverton, Oregon-based company is one of a slew of retailers that have faced major backlash over products that draw criticism for being racially insensitive. In December, Prada pulled products accused of depicting blackface. 
Arizona officials said financial incentives previously withdrawn have not been reinstated.

Nike said that building renovations will begin later this summer and production of Nike Air soles is expected to start in early 2020.

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has reassigned the head of its next airplane project to run the troubled 737 program, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Thursday, as the grounding of its 737 MAX in the wake of two accidents commands the U.S. planemaker's full attention.
Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, stressed in the memo that the so-called new mid-market airplane (NMA) project would remain as a program.
But the management shakeup marks a shift in the U.S. planemaker's immediate focus toward getting its best-selling 737 MAX, the jet that was grounded after two crashes killed nearly 350 people in the span of five months, back in the air and generating cash.
Boeing's 737 program manager, Eric Lindblad, will retire in a matter of weeks after roughly 12 months on the job, McAllister told employees in the memo. Lindblad, a respected engineer who had also run the 777X wide-body program, has been with Boeing for about 34 years and had mentioned retiring last year, McAllister said.
Taking Lindblad's place as the lead of the 737 program and the Renton, Washington, factory will be Mark Jenks, who has been leading Boeing's potential new mid-market airplane project, McAllister said.
Jenks faces daunting challenges, including untangling a backlog of undelivered planes, getting production back on course for planned output increases, and finishing development of the 737 MAX 10, the largest Boeing single-aisle jet, sources said.
The stakes are high as the 737 is the backbone of Boeing's profits and must generate cash for new projects like the NMA.
Described as a ""quiet, get-on-and-do-it"" engineer, Jenks spent half of his 36-year Boeing career on the 787 and an earlier alternative that was never launched, the Sonic Cruiser.
Boeing has been running its 737 supply chain at different speeds to keep it ""hot"" or ready to resume full-rate production as soon as possible after the crisis ends, posing logistical problems last seen on such a scale when the 787 Dreamliner was ramping up.
NMA DELAYED
Mike Sinnett, Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president of product development and future airplane development, will assume the role of vice president for NMA in addition to his current role, the memo said. Sinnett, who originally led preliminary work on the NMA, has been seen a figurehead of the program.
""Let me be clear - the NMA team will continue to operate as a program, and I am looking forward to Mike's leadership in this important effort,"" McAllister said in the memo.
In naming Jenks and Sinnett to run marquee projects at such a crucial time, McAllister is choosing two of Boeing's most high-profile engineers.
Jenks is among those credited with turning around the 787 Dreamliner program, and his appointment on the NMA was seen as key to putting the potential twin-aisle aircraft on a path to a rapid launch.
But industry sources say the launch of the NMA has been delayed by the 737 MAX crisis. The NMA program, if it goes ahead, will most likely not be launched before spring or summer of next year, the sources said.
It was the second management reshuffle in four months. In March, Boeing said John Hamilton, formerly both vice president and chief engineer in Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division, will focus solely on the role of chief engineer.
At the same time, Boeing said Lynne Hopper - who previously led Test & Evaluation in Boeing's Engineering, Test & Technology group - had been named vice president of engineering for Commercial Airplanes."

The investigation found that National Grid's Brooklyn Union Gas Company (KEDNY) and KeySpan Gas East Corp (KEDLI) failed to inspect work completed by its contractors during construction at sufficient intervals and allowed work to be completed by inspectors who were not properly qualified to do the work.
The commission has ordered the two utilities to provide explanation on why it should not commence a penalty action against them.

Filorga's anti-aging skin care products are sold in over 60 countries, with its largest markets being France, Italy, Spain and Greater China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two leading U.S. uranium mining companies say they are prepared to quickly ramp up production if President Donald Trump approves their request for curbs on imports this week.
Trump is expected to decide as soon as Friday on the petitions from Colorado-based  Energy Fuels  Inc (A:UUUU) and Wyoming-based Ur-Energy Inc (A:URG) - which seek quotas requiring 25% of the U.S. uranium market be sourced domestically - after reviewing recommendations from the Commerce Department in April.
Two sources familiar with the matter said the White House was weighing three options, including taking no action, delaying a decision for six months, and requiring utilities to purchase 5% of their uranium from domestic mines each year - rising 5 points per year until it reaches 25%.
The United States sourced just 7% of its uranium domestically in 2017, with most of the rest coming from Canada, Australia and Russia, according to the Energy Information Administration.
""If we get a positive determination out of the president, our company is going to start doing things immediately,"" said Mark Chalmers, president of Energy Fuels, in an interview this week.
The company could lift production to “between 2.5 to 3 million pounds per year” under the right conditions, said Chief Operating Officer Paul Goranson, who was also in the interview, from just under 1 million pounds in 2018.
UR-Energy, meanwhile, could ramp up production at its existing Lost Creek mine in Wyoming to 1 million pounds per year of yellowcake (U3O8) and start up its Shirley Basin project ""relatively quickly"" said John Cash, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs.
Ur-Energy recovered 375,000 pounds in 2018.
The companies have both won key federal permits over the last two years that could help them lift output.
Last year, the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service approved the expansion of Energy Fuels’ La Sal and Daneros mines, the latter of which is located just outside the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.
The BLM in March also approved Ur-Energy's application to double the surface area of its Lost Creek mine in Wyoming and is reviewing final permitting for the Shirley Basin surface uranium mine that operated until the 1990s.
The Ad Hoc Utilities group, representing utilities with nuclear power plants, opposes the proposed 25% quota, saying it would add $500 million to $800 million in annual costs for the industry.
Environmental groups and some Native American tribes also oppose support for the uranium industry out of concern mining would harm water supplies."
715,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 04:37PM ET</span>",White House kills rule aimed at ending Medicare drug rebates,"By Caroline Humer and Bryan Pietsch
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday scrapped one of its most ambitious proposals for lowering prescription medicine prices, backing down from a policy aimed at health insurers and raising the possibility of new measures focused on drugmakers. 
The abandoned proposal would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients.
The decision represents a new setback to U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to deliver on a pledge to lower drug prices for consumers before the November, 2020 election, when Republicans want to capitalize on voter concern over high healthcare costs. 
It allows companies like  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), which negotiate rebates with drugmakers on behalf of the government's Medicare program, to continue to benefit from those discounts. 
Shares of Cigna rose 9%, CVS gained 5% and UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) was up 6%. 
Pharmaceutical company shares fell, with Merck & Co off 4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co down 3% and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) off 2%.
Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said Trump was likely refocusing his reform efforts on the pharmaceutical companies themselves.
""There are still many headwinds for the supply chain, but... pharma and biotech seem to have drawn the ire of the administration more recently,"" said Coldwell, noting the industry's successful legal challenge of a rule that would have required drugmakers to include list prices in TV ads for their medicines.
""Shelving the rebate reform initiative, which pharma strongly supported, feels like payback,"" Coldwell added.
The White House first floated the idea of ending the rebates last year as part of a drug pricing ""blueprint"" aimed at bringing down costs.
Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have also seized on drug pricing as a key issue for the 2020 elections. Legislators, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are pushing for new laws to allow the government to negotiate drug prices directly with manufacturers. 
A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the rule was too costly and could have hurt chances for bipartisan legislation.
“The decision was made that... it was not prudent to go forward with the rule right now, that it would be too disruptive, that the risk was probably too high, and that it might upset a legislative deal, which is our primary focus,"" he said.
The rebate rule would have forced companies like Cigna and CVS either to forgo the discounts or pass them onto Medicare patients enrolled in their health insurance plans and drug plans.
They argued that such a change would force them to raise monthly premiums and had been pressing the administration to consider its impact on Medicare, which includes people aged 65 and older and the disabled, and instead focus on drugmakers.
""Only drug manufacturers have the power to set drug prices. We believe that the key to lowering drug costs is to enact policies that encourage greater competition,"" JC Scott, chief executive of industry lobbyist Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said in a statement.
PhRMA, the main pharmaceutical industry lobby group, disagreed, saying in a statement that the move ended the only government proposal that would have provided immediate savings at the pharmacy counter for patients.
'UNINTENDED WINDFALL PROFITS' FOR DRUGMAKERS 
The Trump administration is considering a proposed rule that aims to bring some U.S. drug prices in the Medicare program in line with lower prices paid by other countries.
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Thursday that Americans overpay for medicines, subsidizing socialist European systems. Most European countries pay for citizens' healthcare and directly negotiate drug prices.
Azar also said that he and Trump are working on allowing the importation of cheaper drugs from other countries, a move Trump has endorsed but which drugmakers have long opposed.
The rebate rule was estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to cost the government $177 billion over the next 10 years. The CBO also said it was likely drugmakers would not cut their prices because of the rule.
The government had hoped that by eliminating rebates of 15 percent to 30 percent, or more, of a drug's listed price, the prices would fall.
JP Morgan analyst Gary Taylor said in a note that political momentum had been building against the rebate rule ""due to the perceived unintended windfall profits that might have accrued to pharmaceutical manufacturers."" 
Politico first reported the planned scrapping of the rebate rule on Thursday and the White House confirmed the decision to Reuters. 
""Based on careful analysis and thorough consideration, the President has decided to withdraw the rebate rule,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed statement.

In recent weeks, Politico and other publications reported that the White House and Azar had disagreed over the rule. Azar said on Thursday that he planned to stay in his job as long as Trump wanted him there.

JPMorgan upgraded its investment rating on Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WW) to neutral from underweight and raised its price target on the stock to $22 from $17, sending the stock more than 7% higher. 
""We believe that steps taken to redirect the marketing message to dieting have worked to stabilize recruitment trends,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote in a note to clients.
The health and wellness company saw its stock tumble nearly 30% on Feb. 26 after its fourth-quarter results and guidance fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, prompting downgrades from a slew of analysts. The stock had already been falling badly from a 52-week high of $96.47 reached in July 2018. It bottomed at $16.71 on May 31 and is 42% since.
Still, the shares are down 42% for 2019.
Weight Watchers (NASDAQ:WW) is down 42% so far this year.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>",Wall Street banks bailing on troubled U.S. farm sector,"By P.J. Huffstutter and Jason Lange
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the wake of the U.S. housing meltdown of the late 2000s, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) hunted for new ways to expand its loan business beyond the troubled mortgage sector. 
The nation's largest bank found enticing new opportunities in the rural Midwest - lending to U.S. farmers who had plenty of income and collateral as prices for grain and farmland surged.
JPMorgan grew its farm-loan portfolio by 76 percent, to $1.1 billion, between 2008 and 2015, according to year-end figures, as other Wall Street players piled into the sector. Total U.S. farm debt is on track to rise to $427 billion this year, up from an inflation-adjusted $317 billion a decade earlier and approaching levels seen in the 1980s farm crisis, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
But now - after years of falling farm income and an intensifying U.S.-China trade war - JPMorgan and other Wall Street banks are heading for the exits, according to a Reuters analysis of the farm-loan holdings they reported to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
The agricultural loan portfolios of the nation's top 30 banks fell by $3.9 billion, to $18.3 billion, between their peak in December 2015 and March 2019, the analysis showed. That's a 17.5% decline. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2X4BNz9 )
Reuters identified the largest banks by their quarterly filings of loan performance metrics with the FDIC and grouped together banks owned by the same holding company. The banks were ranked by total assets in the first quarter of this year.
The retreat from agricultural lending by the nation's biggest banks, which has not been previously reported, comes as shrinking cash flow is pushing some farmers to retire early and others to declare bankruptcy, according to farm economists, legal experts, and a review of hundreds of lawsuits filed in federal and state courts.
Sales of many U.S. farm products - including soybeans, the nation's most valuable agricultural export - have fallen sharply since China and Mexico last year imposed tariffs in retaliation for U.S. duties on their goods. The trade-war losses further strained an agricultural economy already reeling from years over global oversupply and low commodity prices.
Chapter 12 federal court filings, a type of bankruptcy protection largely for small farmers, increased from 361 filings in 2014 to 498 in 2018, according to federal court records.
""My phone is ringing constantly. It's all farmers,"" said Minneapolis-St. Paul area bankruptcy attorney Barbara May. ""Their banks are calling in the loans and cutting them off.""
Surveys show demand for farm credit continues to grow, particularly among Midwest grain and soybean producers, said regulators at the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City. U.S. farmers rely on loans to buy or refinance land and to pay for operational expenses such as equipment, seeds and pesticides. 
Fewer loan options can threaten a farm's survival, particularly in an era when farm incomes have been cut nearly in half since 2013. 
Gordon Giese, a 66-year-old dairy and corn farmer in Mayville, Wisconsin, last year was forced to sell most of his cows, his farmhouse and about one-third of his land to clear his farm's debt. Now, his wife works 16-hour shifts at a local nursing home to help pay bills. 
Giese and two of his sons tried and failed to get a line of credit for the farm.
""If you have any signs of trouble, the banks don’t want to work with you,"" said Giese, whose experience echoes dozens of other farmers interviewed by Reuters. ""I don’t want to get out of farming, but we might be forced to.""
Michelle Bowman, a governor at the U.S. Federal Reserve, told an agricultural banking conference in March that the sharp decline in farm incomes was a ""troubling echo"" of the 1980s farm crisis, when falling crop and land prices, amid rising debt, lead to mass loan defaults and foreclosures.
JPMorgan Chase's FDIC-insured units pared $245 million, or 22%, of their farm-loan holdings between the end of 2015 and March 31 of this year. 
JPMorgan Chase did not dispute Reuters' findings but said it has not ""strategically reduced"" its exposure to the farm sector. The bank said in a statement that it has a broader definition of agricultural lending than the FDIC. In addition to farmers, the bank includes processors, food companies and other related business.

FEDERAL BACKING FOR SMALLER BANKS
The decline in farm lending by the big banks has come despite ongoing growth in the farm-loan portfolios of the wider banking industry and in the government-sponsored Farm Credit System. But overall growth has slowed considerably, which banking experts called a sign that all lenders are growing more cautious about the sector.
The four-quarter growth rate for farm loans at all FDIC-insured banks, which supply about half of all farm credit, slowed from 6.4% in December 2015 to 3.9% in March 2019. Growth in holdings of comparable farm loans in the Farm Credit System has also slowed.
Many smaller, rural banks are more dependent on their farm lending portfolios than the national banks because they have few other options for lending in their communities. As farming towns have seen populations shrink, so have the number of businesses, said Curt Everson, president of the South Dakota Bankers Association.
""All you have are farmers and companies that work with, sell to or buy from farmers,"" Everson said.
As the perils have grown, some smaller banks have turned to the federal government for protection, tapping a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that guarantees up to 95% of a loan as a way to help rural and community banks lend to higher-risk farmers.
Big Wall Street banks have steadily trimmed their farm portfolios since 2015 after boosting their lending in the sector in the wake of the financial crisis.
 Capital One  Financial Corp’s (N:COF) farm-loan holdings at FDIC-insured units fell 33% between the end of 2015 and March 2019. U.S. Bancorp’s (N:USB) shrunk by 25%. 
Capital One Financial Corp did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. Bancorp declined to comment.
The agricultural loan holdings at BB&T Corp (N:BBT) have fallen 29% since peaking in the summer of 2016 at $1.2 billion. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (N:PNC) - which ran full-page ads in farm trade magazines promoting “access to credit” during the run-up – has cut its farm loans by 12% since 2015.
BB&T said in a statement that the decline in its agricultural lending portfolio ""is largely due to aggressive terms and pricing"" offered by competitors and its ""conservative and disciplined"" approach to risk.
PNC said its farm-loan growth is being held back by customers who are wary of taking new debt, along with increased competition from the Farm Credit System.
LOAN DEMAND STILL RISING
Lenders are avoiding mounting risks in a category that is not core to their business, said Curt Hudnutt, head of rural banking for Rabobank North America, a major farm lender and subsidiary of Dutch financial giant Rabobank Group.
In March of this year, FDIC-insured banks reported that 1.53% of their farm loans were at least 90 days past due or had stopped accruing interest because the lender has doubts it will be repaid. This so-called noncurrent rate had doubled from 0.74% at the end of 2015. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2X3hbac ) 
The noncurrent rates were far higher on the farm loans of some big Wall Street banks. Bank of America Corp's noncurrent rate for farm loans at its FDIC-insured units has surged to 4.1% from 0.6% at the end of 2015. Meanwhile, the bank has cut the value of its farm-loan portfolio by about a quarter over the same period, from $3.32 billion to $2.47 billion, according to the most recent FDIC data.
Bank of America (N:BAC) declined to comment on the data or its lending decisions.
For PNC Financial Services, the noncurrent rate was nearly 6% as of the end of March. It cut its farm-loan portfolio to $278.4 million, down from $317.3 million at the end of 2015.
David Oppedahl, senior business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the banking community is increasingly aware of how many farmers are struggling.

“They don’t want to be the ones caught holding bad loans,” he said.

FRANKFURT/BOSTON (Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp has invested more than rivals in its push for corporate change so far this year and there has been an increasing focus among activist investors on German companies.
Elliott, Paul Singer's $35 billion hedge fund, committed $3.4 billion in new capital in the first six months of 2019, data on the sector compiled by Lazard show, outpacing Carl Icahn who spent $2.8 billion.
Elliott has investments in pharmaceutical and life sciences company Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and software firm SAP (DE:SAPG), reflecting the rise in activism directed at corporate Germany.
""Two years ago, many German corporates did not think about activists. Now we are getting more and more calls from management teams and supervisory boards. There's a real awakening, a dramatic shift,"" said Richard Thomas, who leads Lazard's European shareholder advisory practice.
Alongside SAP and Bayer, Elliott has holdings in Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), Uniper (DE:UN01) and Gea (DE:G1AG).
""All have been situations where there were opportunities for improvement and questions being asked about what the company can do to create value for all stakeholders,"" Franck Tuil, Elliott's senior portfolio manager, told Reuters.
""What has changed is that now managers have started to listen. We like to get the board to endorse us,"" he said.
Institutional shareholders were increasingly seeing the value of engaging with activist investors in Germany, said Louis Barbier from Squarewell Partners, which surveyed asset managers.
""The state of governance at German companies is not strong. They have for a long time been very reluctant to engage with investors,"" he told Reuters.
Some German firms have been shifting strategy before activists take a stake.  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said the industrial group would split after saying he had turned down an offer from activists to help with restructuring.
Others are embracing activists. Bayer and Elliott sent coordinated statements on a change in the German firm's litigation strategy and SAP CEO Bill McDermott has called Elliott a ""fantastic"" investor.
Corporate consultancy Alix Partners said activists launched at least 26 campaigns at German groups in 2016 to 2018, although advisers say many campaigns go under the radar.
But some firms still oppose the intervention. Ulrich Lehner accused Elliott and European activist investor Cevian of ""psychoterror"" when he quit as Thyssenkrupp chairman last year. The firm was later split along the lines pushed by activists.
Elliott had 171 investment professionals focusing on its targets, while Cevian had 30 with that focus at the end of the first quarter.
Elsewhere in Europe, the top 10 U.S.-based activist investors have also stepped up activities.
Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management disclosed a position in British plumbing products distributor Ferguson (L:FERG) in June.
But the reaction by the national authorities in some parts of Europe, such as France, is not always welcoming.
""In France, our Pernod (PA:PERP) campaign immediately drew comments from the Finance Ministry about the dangers of activists,"" said Elliott's Tuil. ""In Germany, all voices are welcome."""

Others are embracing activists. Bayer and Elliott sent coordinated statements on a change in the German firm's litigation strategy and SAP CEO Bill McDermott has called Elliott a ""fantastic"" investor.
Corporate consultancy Alix Partners said activists launched at least 26 campaigns at German groups in 2016 to 2018, although advisers say many campaigns go under the radar.
But some firms still oppose the intervention. Ulrich Lehner accused Elliott and European activist investor Cevian of ""psychoterror"" when he quit as Thyssenkrupp chairman last year. The firm was later split along the lines pushed by activists.
Elliott had 171 investment professionals focusing on its targets, while Cevian had 30 with that focus at the end of the first quarter.
Elsewhere in Europe, the top 10 U.S.-based activist investors have also stepped up activities.
Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management disclosed a position in British plumbing products distributor Ferguson (L:FERG) in June.
But the reaction by the national authorities in some parts of Europe, such as France, is not always welcoming.

""In France, our Pernod (PA:PERP) campaign immediately drew comments from the Finance Ministry about the dangers of activists,"" said Elliott's Tuil. ""In Germany, all voices are welcome.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French telecoms operator Orange (PA:ORAN) has offered to pay compensation to victims and relatives after a series of suicides and attempted suicides at the company in the late 2000s, on the last day of a two-month trial of former bosses over the deaths.
Ex-CEO Didier Lombard, six other former executives and the company itself are accused of moral harassment in the first case of its kind on this scale in France, setting a potential precedent for large businesses.
Between April 2008 and June 2010, prosecutors listed 18 suicides and 13 suicide attempts by employees of Orange, still called  France Telecom  at the time, when the company was engaged in deep restructuring after its privatization.
The deaths shocked the nation and raised uncomfortable questions over corporate culture.
Orange's secretary general, Nicolas Guerin, told the court the company was anticipating requests by victims and their relatives for financial compensation and that it was ready to address them. 
""We recognize that the transformation of France Telecom led to individual sufferings, which the company, alas, wasn't always able to prevent,"" he said. ""In some cases, these sufferings can be addressed through damages.""
Central to the case is a plan under which the telecoms operator aimed to cut its workforce by 22,000 and redeploy 10,000 workers between 2006 and 2010. Prosecutors believe this plan triggered the wave of suicides.
Lombard, who denied any wrongdoing, faces one year of jail and a fine of 15,000 euros if convicted.
The presiding judge estimated that claims for compensation so far amounted to about 2 million euros ($2.25 million). But this sum could go up, depending on the number of claims. 
Orange's unions have asked for a compensation process and the CFE-OGC union has suggested the accused former executives pay the compensation out of their own pockets.

The Paris court is expected to give its verdict on Dec. 20.

The sources declined to say what the new deadline would be.
T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including to sell the prepaid brand Boost, to gain merger approval, but they still need a green light from the U.S. Department of Justice. The department's antitrust staff recommended the agency block the deal.
The companies are in talks with Dish to hammer out the Boost sale in order to win over the department.
The parties are haggling over restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future, with T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
The Justice Department has indicated that it wants the new competitor to be strong enough to compete with the industry giants, which would be  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ), AT&T Inc (N:T) and T-Mobile if this merger goes through.
The Federal Communications Commission's chief has given his blessing to the merger in principle and is expected to circulate a formal order within weeks.
In an unusual move, state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in June to ask a judge to stop the proposed merger, arguing that the deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually."

Homebuilders are being held back by a “series of factors,” including higher materials costs, a skilled-labor shortage and President Donald Trump’s immigration and tariffs policies, Powell said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday.
“What we hear from the homebuilders is that it’s a series of factors that are really holding them back and driving and challenging affordability,” Powell said in response to a question by Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota.
Powell said that tougher immigration policies may be in part to blame for the difficulty in finding workers, and tariffs also drive up costs.
“Material costs too have gone up, and some of that is tariffs, for sure,” he said. “The homebuilders feel almost like they’ve been hit by a perfect storm.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Thursday said he sees a 50-50 chance of averting U.S. auto tariffs, and that it will likely take weeks or months to resolve at least some of the thorny trade disputes clouding U.S.-European relations.
Altmaier told reporters he had a constructive meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and both sides agreed it was important to work out their differences over a range of issues, including aircraft subsidies, car imports and the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
""We agreed that we must work on a solution,"" Altmaier said. ""We may perhaps have a chance to come to solutions in the coming weeks, clearly before the end of the year.""
Altmaier said his top priorities were averting U.S. tariffs on European cars imported into the United States, and resolving a 15-year-old row over government subsidies to U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) and Europe's Airbus.
He said German carmakers already build many cars in the United States, and German firms have created over 700,000 jobs in the United States, but they were reluctant to invest more given the uncertainties caused by the current trade tensions.
""Both sides have an interest in avoiding an escalation and finding reasonable solutions that can create a win-win situation,"" he said. ""We need reliability and the ability to plan, because only then will German firms be ready to invest in the United States to be able to supply world markets.""
Asked how he viewed the chances of averting a 25% tariff on auto imports from Europe, Altmaier said, ""I think we have a 50-50 chance. We will be able to avoid punitive tariffs if we can find reasonable, viable solutions that are in the interest of both sides.""
Altmaier said he and Lighthizer also discussed a longstanding dispute over government subsidies to Boeing and Airbus, but said he could not predict if a settlement could be reached. 
On Wednesday, Altmaier had said he would be in favor of eliminating all government subsidies for aircraft production.
The WTO has found that both Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR), the world's two largest planemakers, have received billions of dollars of harmful or illegal government subsidies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-aircraft-wto/wto-says-us-failed-to-halt-state-tax-subsidy-for-boeing-idUSKCN1R923B to gain advantage in the global market.
The United States and EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs, with Washington first in line to seek tariffs under the WTO timetable.
The WTO arbitrator is due to decide as early as next week how much of the $11.2 billion in tariffs proposed by Washington can be applied. Altmaier said the WTO was expected to rule several months later on possible EU tariffs.
The EU this month said it was open to talks with Washington in the dispute, but no formal talks have begun, according to sources familiar with the issue.
""I hope that we can solve the problems between Airbus and Boeing so that we don't see a repeat of what's happened in the coming 10 to 15 years,"" he said.
But he cautioned against expecting any instant solutions on the aircraft subsidies, or the other disagreements between the United States and Europe.

""We have a lot of work to do and it will certainly take several weeks and months before we have any concrete results,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO) will start selling cannabidiol (CBD)-infused personal care products in the United States later this year, entering a market that has seen booming demand among the apparel retailer's core younger customers.
The retailer will sell CBD-infused lotions, muscle balms and aromatherapy products developed and supplied by Green Growth Brands Inc (CD:GGB), the Toronto-headquartered cannabis company said on Thursday.
The products will appeal directly to American Eagle's mainly millennial audience as they view CBD as the next big trend in lifestyle focused on health, analysts told Reuters.
CBD is a non-psychoactive chemical found in cannabis plants that is known to ease anxiety and other ills without causing a high.
""American Eagle's image is about positive messaging and wellness, so it's not shocking that they would have CBD-infused products,"" Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said.
""The products complement their brand and customers.""
The market for cannabis-based personal care products is getting increasingly crowded, with a number of companies including French luxury goods maker LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Sephora beauty chain and ULTA Beauty Inc (O:ULTA) already selling such products.
However, the regulatory environment around CBD products is still cloudy, with many major retailers refusing to stock items made with the cannabis derivative until it is made legal at the federal level.
Companies such as American Eagle will have to tread carefully due to a possible threat of a crackdown on the cannabis industry by the federal government, A Line Partners analyst Gabriela Santaniello said.
That has not stopped cannabis companies from developing their products and finding new retail partners as demand continues to grow.
This is the third major wholesale deal for Green Growth since the passage of the U.S. farm bill in December that legalized the cultivation and sale of hemp, a cannabis plant different from marijuana.
Green Growth said American Eagle is expected to start sales of the products in nearly 500 stores and on its website in October.
The addition of CBD products on American Eagle's store shelves could bring in curious younger customers, Santaniello said. ""In terms of how its going to drive the top-line, It'll have a halo effect.""
American Eagle shares have fallen 14% this year owing to a disappointing profit forecast in March and trade tensions weighing on the retail sector."
728,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Verizon sought buyers for Yahoo Finance - sources,"By Angela Moon and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc earlier this year looked for buyers for Yahoo Finance, one of the most popular internet destinations for financial news and portfolio management tools, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week.
While the U.S. wireless carrier never launched an official sales process, it quietly solicited interest in Yahoo Finance even as it was revamping its media division, previously named Oath and recently renamed Verizon Media.
The company ended its search recently, said the sources, who declined to be named because the talks were private.
Yahoo has emerged as the centerpiece of Verizon Media's plans to rescue the once-dominant collection of internet assets which has been in decline since the late 2000s.
""We do not comment on rumors and speculation,"" Verizon Media said in a statement on Thursday. ""Yahoo Finance is integral to Verizon Media's growth strategy. We continue to invest in the expansion of live programming, audio programming and the recently launched Yahoo Finance Premium product.""
Yahoo and AOL are the two large brands within Verizon Media, which also owns news publication HuffPost, technology news sites Techcrunch and Engadget, as well as social media site Tumblr.
Despite the epic erosion of usage and value of Verizon Media's businesses, Yahoo Finance has remained a bright spot. It was the most visited site in the business and finance news category in May, beating out Forbes and CNBC, and it has attracted over 100 million global monthly visitors on average this year, according to data from media analytics company comScore.
A separate source with direct knowledge of Verizon's plans said the company is seeking to acquire more media assets to bolster its portfolio and Yahoo Finance's business.
The source said Verizon had received unsolicited interest in Yahoo Finance but did not entertain the conversations.
Verizon Media has struggled with declining usage and revenue growth. Last year, Verizon wrote down the value of its media assets by $4.6 billion.
Verizon spent a combined $9.2 billion to buy AOL and Yahoo in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Former Verizon Media Chief Executive Tim Armstrong had explored options for the media group, including buying it out from Verizon, news website The Information reported last year.
Yahoo was a pioneer of the internet era in the 1990s. At its peak, the company's market value in the late 1990s was more than $125 billion. AOL's combined market value the day after it announced a $165 billion offer to buy Time Warner in 2000 was over $340 billion.
Walt Piecyk, an analyst who covers Verizon for research firm BTIG, said Verizon is focused on its wireless business and the media division has become an afterthought since Hans Vestberg was named Verizon's chief executive officer last year.
""Whatever Verizon is able to sell (Yahoo Finance) for will not move the needle for the business,"" he said.
It is unclear how much Verizon was hoping to reap from a sale of Yahoo Finance. Other news-publication deals could provide a benchmark for valuation. German digital publisher Axel Springer bought the 88% it did not already own of New York-based news publication Business Insider in 2015, in a deal that valued Business Insider at $442 million.
Last month, Yahoo Finance launched a premium subscription that offers advanced portfolio tools, research reports and investment ideas for $50 per month."

(Reuters) - J. Crew Group Inc has hired investment banks to prepare for an initial public offering of its Madewell apparel business, as the U.S. clothing chain seeks ways to revive its fortunes, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
The move comes three months after J. Crew said it would explore an IPO of the division. The New York-based company is seeking to shore up its strained finances, amid competition from e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), as well as brick-and-mortar retailers.
J. Crew has enlisted Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) as the lead underwriters for an IPO of Madewell expected sometime after the U.S. Labor Day holiday in September, the sources said.
The retailer has a debt load of roughly $1.7 billion. It expects Madewell, known for its denim clothing, to be valued by the stock market at significantly more than that, the sources added. J. Crew will not sell down its entire holding in Madewell right away, according to one of the sources.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the details of the IPO preparations are confidential. 
Representatives for J. Crew, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment or had no immediate comment.
J. Crew was taken private in 2011 by private equity firms TPG and Leonard Green & Partners LP in a $3 billion leveraged buyout. The private equity firms declined to comment.
In April, J. Crew said it was exploring alternatives for reducing debt and restoring profitability, and named operations chief Michael J. Nicholson interim CEO.
It had enlisted restructuring advisers at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, the law firm that helped negotiate a previous debt workout for the company and steered department store operator Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) through bankruptcy, Reuters reported in March.
Madewell has experienced rapid growth, and makes up about 20% of the company's overall revenue, according to regulatory filings. 
A slew of U.S. apparel retailers in recent months have carved out divisions to bring overall business back to life.
In February, Gap Inc (N:GPS) announced plans to separate its better-performing Old Navy business into a publicly traded company.
The Madewell IPO would also cap a run of listings among major jeans brands this year, including  Levi Strauss & Co  (N:LEVI). Denim is undergoing a revival following years of athleisure dominating casual wear."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House Judiciary Committee on Thursday voted to authorize subpoenas for a dozen witnesses including President Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. 
The vote gives panel Chairman Jerrold Nadler discretion on whether to subpoena current and former Trump advisers such as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, as part of a broad corruption and obstruction of justice probe of the Trump presidency.
""These include government officials who worked, or continue to work, in close proximity to the president,"" Nadler said at a meeting to consider the subpoenas. ""We will not rest until we obtain their testimony and documents.""
The committee also authorized subpoenas for documents and testimony connected with Trump's immigration policies, including family separation and detention and ""zero tolerance"" for migrants. 
The move comes as Democrats who control the House of Representatives prepare to escalate their scrutiny of the Trump presidency, with public testimony from former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on July 17 and a vote next week to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas.
Republicans dismissed the committee's action as a partisan fishing expedition against Trump and a bid to heal political rifts within House Democratic ranks. ""That's all today's episode is about. It sure isn't about oversight. It's simply about politics,"" said Representative Doug Collins, the Judiciary Committee's top Republican.
Nadler's committee, which could launch an impeachment inquiry if it uncovered evidence of presidential misconduct, is pursuing actions and events described in Mueller's 448-page report on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller found insufficient evidence to show that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia despite numerous contacts between campaign officials and Moscow. He also did not find that the president obstructed justice, but said specifically that the evidence did not exonerate Trump. 
In addition to Kushner, Sessions and Kelly, the committee authorized subpoenas for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and others.
The subpoena list also includes David Pecker, chief executive of American Media Inc [AMRCM.UL], which publishes the National Enquirer, for testimony about hush money payments made during the campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Trump.
Thursday's proceedings drew fresh criticism from Trump in a pair of tweets. 
""Now the Democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with Robert Mueller, and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing. How many bites at the apple do they get before working on Border Loopholes and Asylum,"" the president wrote on Twitter. 
""Enough already, go back to work! I won, unanimously, the big Emoluments case yesterday!"" Trump wrote, citing Wednesday's U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissal of a lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia accusing him of violating anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution. The judicial panel found that the state and district lacked legal standing to bring the case.
Trump and his administration have sought to stymie committee investigators by directing former Trump aides, including former White House Counsel Don McGahn, not to cooperate with Congress. 

The Judiciary Committee is expected soon to file a key lawsuit against McGahn as early as next week over his refusal to testify before the panel in May.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Wall Street watchdog to boost transparency about using 'cooperation' for penalty reductions,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog on Thursday said it plans to be more transparent about its process for determining when a securities brokerage qualifies for a reduced penalty in exchange for so-called ""extraordinary cooperation.""
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said settlements it reaches with brokerages for regulatory violations will include more explanation about why FINRA deemed the cooperation to be ""extraordinary"" and what type of credit the regulator applied to reduce the sanction.
The change, published in a regulatory notice, is the latest effort by a U.S. financial regulator to highlight cooperation programs, which they say are central to their enforcement efforts.
FINRA's updated guidance comes as other U.S. financial regulators, including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are ramping up their cooperation programs to enhance their enforcement efforts.
By offering reduced penalties to firms and individuals who self-report lapses and cooperate in probes, CFTC enforcement chief James McDonald has spurred executives to lead his team to other misconduct and offenders.
Brokerages that run afoul of FINRA regulations can qualify for leniency by bringing the misconduct to FINRA's attention, voluntarily implementing corrective measures and giving ""substantial assistance"" to FINRA during its investigation, among other measures, FINRA said.
FINRA, which announced its ""extraordinary cooperation"" program in 2008, revised its guidance about the program on Thursday to clarify some questions that later arose in the industry after FINRA adopted additional rules.
Those rule changes, including one that requires brokerages to report conclusions about legal and conduct violations that surface during internal reviews, triggered questions about whether brokerages could still receive credit for self-reporting misconduct, the regulator said."

TURIN, Italy (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) plans to spend 700 million euros ($788 million) to take the Fiat 500 electric as the carmaker moves on from its failed $35 billion bid to merge with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA), a pioneer in electric vehicles.
FCA (MI:FCHA) chief operating officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Pietro Gorlier, announced the Italian-American company's biggest single bet on an electric vehicle at its Mirafiori plant in Turin, northern Italy on Thursday.
FCA's investment is part of a plan announced last year to spend 5 billion euros in Italy up to 2021.
Gorlier told reporters that FCA had started building the new production line at Mirafiori to turn out 80,000 of the new 500 BEV, its first battery electric vehicle to be marketed in Europe.
The original 500 model, launched by Fiat in the late 1950s and known affectionately as the ""Cinquecento"", quickly become a symbol of Italian urban design.
Mirafiori's 3,500 workers are hoping the new electric mini-car will revive a plant which LMC Automotive estimates is running below 10% of its capacity this year.
Workers in Fiat's home town are also betting on the hybrid version of Maserati's Levante SUV, on which production is expected to start next year, to help boost their working hours.
An early version of the electric 500 has been produced in the United States to comply with local authority rules on zero-emission cars. But former CEO Sergio Marchionne asked customers not to buy the car in 2014 as FCA was losing money on it, and said he hoped to sell the smallest number possible. 
Production of the newly-engineered 500 BEV will start in the second quarter of 2020, with room to expand later, Gorlier said.
The 500 BEV will compete in the upmarket small car segment with BMW's (DE:BMWG) Mini. The German company said this week the new electric version of its compact car would start to reach customers from spring next year.
In abandoning its merger offer for Renault, FCA blamed French politics for scuttling what would have been a landmark deal to create the world's third-biggest automaker.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian cotton producers in the state of Mato Grosso on Thursday sued  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), seeking to cancel the chemical company's patent protection for its Bollgard II RR Flex genetically modified cotton seed, according to a statement sent to Reuters.
The farmers, hoping to regain $151 million in royalty payments, claim the genetically modified seed does not constitute a de facto technological innovation, according to the statement issued by the Mato Grosso Cotton Producers Association (AMPA). The lawsuit also names Brazil's national patents office as a defendant.
Mato Grosso soybean farmers used a similar argument when they sued in Brazil to cancel patent rights over the widely used Intacta RR2 PRO seed.
Sidney Pereira de Souza Jr., the attorney representing the farmers, confirmed that they were suing Bayer and the patent office, but would not comment further.
Valor Econômico newspaper was first to report on the farmers' litigation plans on Thursday.
In a statement, Bayer said it had not been formally notified of any patent dispute related to the Bollgard II RR Flex technology. Bayer noted that this cotton seed technology was quickly adopted by Brazilian cotton growers, and was the most used in Mato Grosso.
AMPA said it will request a refund of $151 million worth of royalties that Mato Grosso farmers have already paid for use of the technology.
""If the patent cancellation request is granted, aside from getting the refund, the cotton farmers will save $240 per hectare in the coming harvests,"" the statement said alluding to the royalties related to the seed.
Bollgard II RR Flex combines resistance to insects and weed-killers. The technology was developed by U.S.-based  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), a company taken over by Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn) in a $63 billion transaction.
No binding ruling has been issued in relation to the Intacta patent dispute, a Bayer spokeswoman said by telephone."

Jill McDonald, clothing, home & beauty managing director, is leaving the business after less than two years in the job, M&S said on Thursday. Group CEO Steve Rowe will take over the leadership of the division directly in the near term, it added.
""The business now needs to move on at pace to address long-standing issues in our clothing and home supply chain around availability and flow of product,"" said Rowe.
""Given the importance of this task to M&S I will be overseeing this program directly.""
Rowe did praise McDonald for strengthening the clothing team, improving the quality and style of product and setting a clear direction for the business to attract a younger family age customer.
McDonald joined M&S in October 2017 to take on one of the biggest jobs in British fashion, having previously been the chief executive of bicycles and car parts company Halfords (L:HFD). Her appointment raised questions from some because she had no clothing retail experience.
After several failed relaunches over the past decade, the jury is out on whether the 135-year-old M&S can rise to the challenges posed by fast-fashion chains such as Zara and H&M in its clothing business.
M&S set out its latest turnaround plan shortly after
retail veteran Archie Norman became chairman in September 2017 to work alongside Rowe, who became CEO in 2016 and has been with the company three decades.
In May M&S reported a third straight drop in annual profit and its shares are down 30% from a year ago.
McDonald was a Rowe hire. On appointment he highlighted her ""fantastic customer insight"" and a wealth of operational, retail and leadership experience developed at Halfords and fast-food giant McDonald's.
M&S' clothing and home like-for-like sales fell 1.6% in its 2018-19 year.
NOTABLE BY OMISSION
At the group's annual meeting on Tuesday Rowe said it had been a ""troubled year"" for the clothing and home business.
He said M&S had developed a strong team in clothing, name checking 2018 hires Jill Stanton, women's and kid's director, and Wes Taylor, the menswear director for bringing over 60 years clothing experience to the business.
However, McDonald's name was notable by omission from Rowe's
speech.
The CEO said that while M&S had improved its clothing ranges in terms of fit, style and value for money it still had significant issues with availability.
""I think here we've done much of the hard work on style and fit and it's the process that we need to change,"" Rowe said.
""Further work (is needed) on getting size ratios correct, making sure we reduce the number of lines we’re running so we can buy deeper, concentrating on the big lines that we’re famous for across the UK,"" he said.
Rowe forecast an improvement by the autumn.
Industry publication Drapers reported in June that Topshop fashion director Maddy Evans was leaving the company to join M&S in a senior buying role. M&S declined to comment on that report."

PARIS (Reuters) - The United States plans to extend the lifespans of existing nuclear reactors and support new technologies as it seeks to revive an industry seen as crucial to its energy security, a senior U.S. official said on Thursday.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette told an International Energy Agency conference on nuclear and hydrogen in Paris that both technologies were crucial for reducing carbon emissions and boosting energy security.
The U.S. nuclear industry has been in the doldrums for years because of competition from cheap natural gas and falling costs wind and solar power costs.
Several nuclear plants have closed while a project to build two reactors in South Carolina was abandoned in 2017 with the reactors half-built and billions of dollars in sunk costs.
""We believe strongly that a strong domestic nuclear energy (industry), enabled by our existing fleet and enhanced by game-changing advanced nuclear technologies is critical to our nation's energy security, our national security, our environmental sustainability...,"" Brouillete said.
The U.S. department of energy (DOE) agrees with the IEA that extending the life of existing reactors is perhaps the most competitive way to produce low-carbon electricity, he said. The DOE was working to help extend the license for the existing fleet out to eighty years, he added.
The United States has nearly 100 nuclear reactors in operation, which produced about 20% of total electrical output in 2018, World Nuclear Association data show.
Most U.S. reactors already have seen their license extended to 60 years from 40 years.
LESS WASTE
In France, where state-controlled utility EDF (PA:EDF) is the world's largest nuclear operator with a fleet of 58 reactors, nuclear regulator ASN is looking into allowing reactor lifespan extensions but has not made a decision yet.
Brouillete said the U.S. industry was working on several new nuclear technologies and his department strongly supported the development of new technologies, in particular small modular reactors and micro-reactors.
""Looking forward to the next generation of nuclear power, there are nearly 50 innovative US companies that are actively working on new advanced reactor designs and we are excited about the potential that they bring to produce more energy with less waste,"" he said.
This year, the department has awarded over $125 million to public-private partnership projects for advanced nuclear reactor technologies.
Brouillette said the United States was also working on developing hydrogen technology, notably through its ""H2@Scale"" initiative, which explores the potential for large-scale production and use of hydrogen.
Government data show that the United States currently produces about 10 million metric tons of hydrogen per year, 95% of which is via energy-intensive steam reforming which takes hydrogen out of natural gas but produces carbon as waste.
Governments and companies worldwide are experimenting with producing hydrogen via electrolysis, which runs electric power through water to separate hydrogen from oxygen.
Hydrogen can be used to power cars and trucks, but so far most carmakers prefer electrical engines and batteries to hydrogen."

The social media giant plans to build a digital currency, raising concerns among global regulators that it could quickly become systemic given Facebook's huge cross-border reach.
But Carney said many issues needed addressing first, such as anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls, and managing and safekeeping the assets underpinning Libra.
""If you are a systemic payment system, you have to be on all the time. You can't have teething issues, you can't have people losing money out of their wallets,"" Carney said.
""This is not learning on the job stuff, it's got to be rock solid right from the start or it's not going to start."" Carney told a news conference.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that serious concerns need to be addressed before Libra could launch, highlighting the global regulatory hurdles.
Libra would be a type of ""stablecoin"", backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities.
""There are over 50 stablecoins on the market, and many are yet to prove that they are in fact, ‘stable’,"" the BoE's bi-annual Financial Stability Report published on Thursday said.
Carney said regulators recognized that Libra was trying to solve a series of issues like domestic and cross-border payments being too slow and expensive."

(Reuters) - Reckitt Benckiser has agreed to pay up to $1.4 billion to end U.S. federal investigations into the marketing of an opioid addiction treatment by its former business Indivior, lifting a cloud that has been hanging over the British company for years.
While the settlement is significantly higher than the $400 million that the consumer goods group had set aside to cover the cost of the investigations, analysts said it could allow the company's new chief executive to focus on a turnaround plan.
Shares in Reckitt Benckiser (RB), whose products range from Mucinex cold medicine and Lysol cleaners, rose as much as 3.3% in early Thursday trading. 
""As new CEO Laxman Narasimhan steps in (effective Sept. 1), this clarifies the legal environment for RB and should allow the new management to focus on the RB 2.0 transformation,"" JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note.
In an effort to regain investor confidence after setbacks including a safety scandal in South Korea, a failed product launch and a cyber attack, RB's outgoing boss Rakesh Kapoor launched a plan to split the group into two business units – one for health and one for hygiene and home products. 
But investors feared the U.S. investigations could hinder the company's transformation. 
""(The deal) gives the new CEO one less problem to worry about,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) senior analyst Laith Khalaf said.
However, the settlement marks the largest payout so far by any drug company involved in what U.S. President Donald Trump has called the country's epidemic of opioid addiction. The next largest one was for $600 million and was paid in 2007 by Purdue Pharma, the maker of the blockbuster opioid drug, OxyContin. 
While welcoming the settlement, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said the cost could limit new CEO Narasimhan's ability to undertaken much-needed investment in RB's brands.
""The danger is that Narasimhan will be operating with one hand tied behind his back, he said.

INDIVIOR SOARS
RB said its agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission resolved investigations into a business that it demerged in 2014.
Indivior has been charged in the United States with illegally increasing prescriptions for opioid addiction treatment Suboxone by deceiving doctors and healthcare benefit programmes into believing its film version was safer and less susceptible to abuse than similar drugs.
Suboxone is itself a form of opioid. 
The indictment said Indivior's wrongdoing began before it was spun out of RB, although RB was not charged.
""While RB has acted lawfully at all times and expressly denies all allegations that it engaged in any wrongful conduct, after careful consideration, the board of RB determined that the agreement is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,"" RB said in a statement.
Separately on Thursday, Indivior said it had no new information to provide on its legal proceedings with the U.S. Department of Justice, which are separate from RB.
Indivior also raised its full-year profit and revenue guidance after Suboxone lost market share at a slower pace than expected, sending its shares 35% higher.
Every day, more than 130 people die in the United States after overdosing on opioids, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Drug overdose deaths rose from 8,048 in 1999 to 47,600 in 2017. 
RB said it would increase its provision related to the investigations to $1.5 billion to cover both the cost of the settlement and ""any remaining litigation exposures.""

The company said the settlement would be funded through existing borrowing facilities and cash generation.

The news comes after the bank announced plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in a 7.4-billion-euro ($8.34 billion) restructuring program.
Deutsche Bank's work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2 billion in 2014 as concerns about the fund's management and financials had begun to circulate, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. 
Prosecutors are mainly looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the paper said. 
She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions clients at Deutsche Bank, where she was involved with further 1MDB dealings, it added. 
In an emailed statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries about the fund. 
""As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, 1MDB made 'material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials' in connection with 1MDB's transactions with the bank,"" the bank told Reuters.
""This is consistent with the bank's own findings in this matter,"" it added. 
A U.S. DoJ civil asset-forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.
Tan left Deutsche Bank last year, after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier the Justice Department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added. 
A representative of insurance company FWD Group, Tan's current employer, said the company and Tan declined to comment.

Seven consecutive days of gains have boosted the e-commerce giant’s market value to $993 billion as of Wednesday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A gain of less than 1% for the stock would push the market capitalization above the 13-figure mark. The shares closed that gap on Thursday morning, climbing 0.4% in early trading before U.S. markets opened -- a move that would push the market value to nearly $998 billion.
Amazon has added about $119 billion in market value since the end of May. Nearly half of those gains have come in the past seven days, which comprises Amazon’s longest string of advances since Sept. 4.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). is currently the only company with a market value above $1 trillion.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) sees the momentum behind 6.5% quarterly revenue growth continuing throughout the year, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said, citing strong domestic demand that led the No. 2 U.S. carrier to lift its full-year profit forecast.
Atlanta-based Delta is the first of the four U.S. major airlines to report second-quarter earnings, which investors are scouring for signs of weakening consumer demand and the impact of supply constraints due to the three-month grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX. Delta on Thursday reported a 39.3% rise in quarterly profit as it benefited from higher fares and flying fuller planes.
Delta does not operate the MAX, which remains grounded following two fatal crashes, allowing it to avoid fleet headaches that have plagued North American MAX carriers, including Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV),  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL), while picking up passengers that rivals did not have enough aircraft to fly.
Bastian said the MAX grounding had a ""marginal benefit"" on second-quarter results, but attributed the real growth driver to demand strength and higher premium ticket prices.
""We had five of the top 10 revenue days in our history just within our last 30 days and we see that momentum continuing to grow throughout the year,"" Bastian said in a telephone interview. 
""I don't think it's as much the MAX as Delta that's driving that,"" he said.
As a result, Delta lifted its full-year profit forecast to between $6.75 and $7.25 per share from a previous range of $6 to $7 per share.
Supply constraints related to the 737 MAX are expected to help second-quarter unit revenues, a closely watched measurement of revenues per available seat mile, across the sector, even for MAX operators. For Delta, adjusted unit revenues rose 3.8% in the quarter, driven by growth in both leisure and corporate travel.
Strong U.S. air travel demand is expected to continue in the coming months, though going forward the company is closely watching volatile fuel prices and global economic development, Bastian said.
He said Delta, which is seeking to grow internationally, remains committed to investing around $100 million to acquire about 10% of ailing Italian flag carrier Alitalia [CAITLA.UL], which the Italian government is trying to rescue for the third time.
Delta continues to vet potential partners alongside Alitalia and the Italian government, Bastian said, noting: ""I think Alitalia has a promising future with the right ownership structure in place.""
Infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) is seen as a possible investor in Alitalia, alongside Ferrovie dello Stato. 
Delta's net income rose to $1.44 billion, or $2.21 per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $1.04 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. 
On an adjusted basis, the airline earned $2.35 per share for the quarter. Analysts on average expected a profit of $2.28 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total operating revenue rose 6.5% to $12.54 billion.

754,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 07:18AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Reckitt, Indivior Surge as Opioid Cloud Lifts","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The opioid shadow hanging over U.K.-based health and consumer group   Reckitt Benckiser   (LON:RB) lifted Thursday as the company announced it would settle all federal U.S. claims against it for $1.4 billion.
Reckitt was up 2.6% by 4:45 AM ET (0845 GMT) on the news, easily outperforming a broader U.K. market in which the FTSE 100 was up only 0.2%, as well as other European markets which were all tending higher after numerous signals from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday that a cut in U.S. interest rates is likely at the end of the month.
The settlement is eye-catchingly high – more than double the $600 million fine paid by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma in 2007, which was until today the highest single payment to come out of the U.S. opioid scandal. But from Reckitt’s point of view, it’s a price worth paying to insulate it from any further costs that may arise if and when its former pharmaceutical unit Indivior – which was indicted in April on federal charges of fraudulent marketing for its anti-addiction product Suboxone - comes to trial.
“It avoids the cost, uncertainty, and distraction associated with continued investigations, litigation, and potential for an indictment at a time of significant transformation under RB 2.0 and during a CEO transition,” Reckitt summed up.
Shares in Indivior (LON:INDV), which was wholly spun off from Reckitt in 2014, also surged on Thursday, albeit for different reasons.
It raised its outlook for both revenue and earnings this year - thanks to a strong performance by Suboxone film.
Indivior’s shares, which had lost over 90% in the last year as its legal problems in the U.S. became clear, rose over 35% initially, but trimmed those gains to trade 27% higher by mid-morning."

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece lost a fight to set a lower excise tax on two traditional spirits tsipouro and tsikoudia versus imported products after Europe's top court on Thursday backed the European Commission's view that such preferential treatment would breach EU laws.
Athens upset the EU executive after it introduced excise duties on tsipouro and tsikoudia, which is made in Crete, at half the rate from that levied on imported alcoholic beverages.
Small or so-called two-day distillers of the two beverages also enjoyed a super-reduced rate of around 6%. Both spirits, which are made from grapes, have protected designation of origin labels, an EU designation to promote and protect the names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs
The Commission said the lower taxes indirectly protected tsipouro and tsikoudia from competition from similar imported products.
It took legal action against Greece at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) in February 2017.
ECJ judges agreed with the Commission, saying that the lower duties were contrary to EU laws.

The news is the latest to signal weaker global industrial activity and ripples from a trade war that has already forced China's Geely (HK:0175) Swiss engineering company ABB (S:ABBN) Germany's Aumann (DE:AAGG) and chemicals giant BASF (DE:BASFn), to warn of turbulence ahead.
Hong Kong-based Johnson Electric, which makes micro-motors and electric power steering systems, said it expects profit for the six months ending September 30, 2019 to be ""substantially lower"" because of a significant decline in light vehicle production and an ""especially depressed"" market in China.
Sales of automotive products in Asia fell 15% and sales of industry products fell 19% in the quarter, the company said.
Johnson also blamed the impact of higher tarriffs and geopolitical uncertainties weighing on demand in other consumer and industrial markets.
Last month, China reported the worst-ever monthly vehicles sales drop, exacerbating concerns over the country's economic slowdown as the world's largest car market saw demand fall for the 11th consecutive month.
In a research note, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts said another ""tough"" second quarter was expected for auto suppliers as global production continued to be ""very negative"" in the second quarter.
""Recovery not in sight,"" the analysts said.
NO SIGN OF RECOVERY
Switzerland's Sensirion cut its revenue forecast for 2019 (to 160-170 million Swiss francs, down from 175-190 million Swiss francs previously. The company cut its adjusted EBITDA margin to 9-12% from 15-16% previously.
""The current crisis in the automotive industry, the significantly weaker than expected global industrial production as well as the continuing global trade disputes negatively impact demand in all end markets,"" Sensirion said.
""In contrast to the assessment at the beginning of the year, we do not see any signals from our customers pointing to the originally expected recovery in the second half of 2019,"" Sensirion further said.
That comes after Germany's Aumann on Wednesday said it expects full-year revenues to fall by up to 17% rather than rise. Earnings before interest and taxes are expected to fall to around 22 million this year, down from 29.3 million in 2018.
Aumann shares fell sharply on Thursday after the company - which makes machines to manufacture electric cars components - said its order intake in the first half of the year was disappointing after carmakers postponed orders.
On Monday, Geely said net profit in the first half of 2019 had dropped by 40% due to a greater-than-expected fall in China car sales."
761,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>","France Sticks to Tax on Facebook, Google After U.S. Trade Threat","(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
France won’t back off from its planned tax on companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google even after the U.S. suggested it may use trade tools against the levy.
The French Senate is set to pass a bill on Thursday to impose a 3% levy on global tech companies with at least 750 million euros ($845 million) in worldwide revenue and digital sales totaling 25 million euros in France. The U.S. said Wednesday that it will examine whether the tax would hurt its tech firms, using the so-called 301 investigation, the same tool President Donald Trump deployed to impose tariffs on Chinese goods because of the country’s alleged theft of intellectual property.
France said the digital tax is in keeping with international rules, and that it won’t accept the use of trade tools to try to thwart it.
“I deeply believe that between allies we can and must resolve our differences in ways other than with threats,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a speech in the Senate. “France is a sovereign state that decides its tax measures with sovereignty and will continue to take sovereign tax decisions.”
A broad, European Union-wide digital tax failed to garner a consensus in the 28-nation bloc this year, which has led several countries, including the U.K., Spain, Austria and Italy, to consider implementing their own version of the levy. France had pushed hard for a region-wide tax on tech companies’ revenue from digital advertising, user data sales and the like -- the so-called GAFA tax (after Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)).
Le Maire said he spoke to U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin Wednesday and noted that it’s the first time in the history of relations between the two countries that Washington has opened a 301 investigation against France.
Trade Tensions
The likely passage of the tax bill and the U.S. investigation threaten to further strain trans-Atlantic ties as the two sides prepare to negotiate a limited trade agreement on industrial goods. The French government has in the past asked the U.S. to work with Europe at the OECD for a “fair digital tax.”
The U.S. said its Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have as long as a year to examine whether the plan would hurt U.S. technology firms, and suggest remedies.
The U.S. is concerned that the tax “unfairly targets American companies,” Lighthizer said in a statement announcing the action on Wednesday. “The president has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.”
The U.S. can levy tariffs specifically on products from France even though it is a member of the EU, said Douglas Heffner, a international trade litigator at law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath. Under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the president has authority to impose tariffs or take other restrictive measures if it’s determined that a foreign country’s trading rules are damaging to U.S. businesses.
G7 Meeting
“The U.S. can be very creative,” Heffner said. “They don’t have to just go after digital products. They can go after products where they have leverage.”
The move would come as talks on a limited trans-Atlantic trade agreement on industrial goods have progressed slowly because the U.S. and EU are at odds over whether to include agriculture in any final agreement. France is the country most adamantly opposed to making any agriculture concessions. Trump’s threat to impose a tariff of as much as 25% on European car exports has cast a cloud over the negotiations as well.
Finance ministers and central bankers at a Group of Seven meeting in Chantilly, France, next week will discuss international taxation and competition and the digital economy."
762,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 11, 2019 06:07AM ET</span>","If This Really Is a Fed Easing Cycle, Where Are Markets Headed?","(Bloomberg) -- Treasury two-year yields may slide to 1% by the end of 2020 as the Federal Reserve makes a succession of interest-rate cuts to support growth,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). says. The dollar is set to slide in that scenario, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.
“We’re at a point where we’re weighing whether the Fed will cut for insurance or if they’re entering a period of structural, cyclical downturn in interest rates -- I’m leaning more towards the latter,” said Shyam Devani, senior technical strategist at Citigroup in Singapore. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see two-year yields dropping to 1% by the end of next year.”
Citi is forecasting the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by 25 basis points this month and potentially cut another two times by year-end. “Inflation expectations remain low, we have a global slowdown in growth and commodity prices remain weak,” he said. “The Fed could cut well into next year.”
Traders are pricing in about 75 basis points of easing by year-end after Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish testimony to Congress on Wednesday, when he cited slowing global expansion and trade tensions as threats to the U.S. economy. The Treasury two-year yield was three basis points lower at 1.80% in London trading after sliding eight basis points on Wednesday.
Pimco’s View
Whether the dollar is poised for a prolonged decline depends on how the central bank positions its July move -- especially if it’s the beginning of a cycle, said Erin Browne, a managing director and portfolio manager at Pimco in Newport Beach, California.
“What really matters is, is this an insurance cut or a sustained move lower?” she said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. “If it’s a sustained move lower, I think the curve steepens fairly significantly from here and we could start to see the dollar really roll over.”
The dollar would be particularly vulnerable against the euro and potentially the yen should the Fed embark on a series of rate cuts, Browne said. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2% on Thursday, extending its decline to 1.6% from this year’s high set in May.
Powell’s remarks not only failed to push back against the rate cut that’s fully priced in for July, they boosted the rate-cut narrative, Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York, wrote in a research note.
A 50 basis-point cut in July is a real possibility, though a 25 basis-point move is likely to be the compromise policy outcome, he said.

Treasury yield curve may flatten ahead of Fed’s July meeting as markets are already more than fully priced for an “insurance” rate cut. “I’m biased toward some flattening” in the 2-10 year part of the U.S. yield curve, said Eugene Leow, rates strategist in Singapore

Systemic risk buffers have been applied in some other EU economies. The central bank said in May that, for Ireland, the aim would be to add resilience against ""tail risks"" - economic shocks unlikely to occur but which would have a significant impact on the economy and financial system if they did.
Then Central Bank Governor Philip Lane said the main such risk facing Ireland - leaving aside Brexit - is its high dependence on multinational firms and that if there were a persistent shock to that sector, the cumulative economic decline ""would dwarf a normal cyclical recession""."

""The Commission directs Vitol to show cause why it should not be required to disgorge unjust profits of $1,227,143, plus interest,"" the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) wrote in an Order to Show Cause.
The FERC alleges that Vitol and an employee purposefully sold physical power at a loss in the market run by the California Independent System Operator.

Vitol's U.S. subsidiary said it ""regrets the FERC’s decision to issue an Order to Show Cause against it and denies all of FERC’s allegations.""
In the order filed on July 10, the FERC states the alleged manipulation took place in 2013. Vitol has 30 days to respond."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nordea's (HE:NDAFI) Swedish pension fund moved 22 billion Swedish crowns ($2.34 billion) into investments with a lower carbon footprint and strict sustainability criteria in the first half of the year, saying the move was its biggest asset shift.
A number of institutional investors, including Sweden's national pension funds, have started to divest from fossil fuel companies due to the risk their assets will become stranded as the cost of renewable energy falls.
Investors have also ratcheted up the pressure on governments with those managing over $34 trillion in assets, nearly half the world's invested capital, demanding urgent action when leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies met last month.
Nordea Liv & Pension Sverige, which managed 131 billion crowns as of the end of 2018, said on Thursday it had moved funds out of carbon-intensive sectors during the first half, cutting its portfolio's carbon footprint by about 50%.
The shift related mainly to listed equities and to some extent also fixed income, Peter Sandahl, sustainability manager at Nordea Liv & Pension Sverige, a pension and life insurance subsidiary of Nordic lender Nordea, told Reuters.
""The shift is part of a broader strategy on climate and sustainability and also of how we view and manage risk and long-term returns. We can also see an increased customer demand for more sustainable pension products,"" he said via email.
""We are humble about the fact that we are on a learning journey where we need to work ... across the industry to develop standards and models that can help us in this transition, and create transparency toward customers and stakeholders,"" he said.
The fund has a goal that all its investments together should not contribute to global warming exceeding 1.5C, in line with the Paris Agreement.
It had last year shifted 7 billion crowns of investment from carbon-intensive sectors to companies it deemed to be at the forefront of integrating sustainability in their operations.
Sandahl said shifts made in 2018 and 2019 meant that a vast majority of the fund's listed equity exposure was now in low-carbon footprint and sustainable investments and about 40% of its total assets managed was in this area."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose, global bond yields fell and the dollar weakened after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell bolstered expectations the Fed would cut U.S. interest rates soon.
The pan-European STOXX 600 climbed 0.2% after losing 1.4% over the past four sessions. Germany's DAX futures rose and Britain's FTSE futures gained 0.3%. The oil and gas sector as well as defensive stocks led the gains.
In his first day of testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Powell confirmed the U.S. economy was still under threat from disappointing factory activity, tame inflation and a simmering trade war, and said the Fed stood ready to ""act as appropriate"".
""Powell's statement confirmed we are going in the direction of a cutting cycle,"" said Charles Zerah, a fund manager at Carmignac. ""The main question now is, are investors pricing too much in terms of rate cuts by year end? The way you see equity markets behaving, risk is that what markets are pricing could lead to disappointment.""
The Europe gains follow healthy rises in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan rose 1%. Japan's Nikkei added 0.5%.
U.S. futures pointed to a stronger opening for Wall Street as well with E-Minis for the S&P500 at 0.2%.
U.S. stocks ended higher on Wednesday and the S&P 500 briefly crossed 3,000 points for the first time following Powell's remarks.
Some questioned how much momentum there was behind the latest rally.
""We are in the camp and have been all year, and arguably wrongly, that the Fed becoming more dovish and cutting rates is not good for risk assets,"" said Neil Dwane, global strategist and portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors. Nine of 12 Fed rate cutting cycles had not stopped a recession, he noted.
""Given we are in the longest expansion and have only had rates lifted to 2.5%, for me it begs the question, is a soft landing possible?""
A strong June U.S. jobs report earlier this month heightened expectations the Fed was more likely to cut by 25 basis points than by 50. But Powell's cautious stance helped fuel bets on heftier easing at its next policy meeting on July 30-31.
The chance of a 50 bps cut rose to 27.6% from 3.3% on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Minutes from the Fed's last meeting, in mid-June, however, showed some policymakers felt there was not yet a strong case for easing.
The rate cut prospects also weighed on the dollar. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies slipped 0.2% to 96.929, extending losses for a second straight session after reaching a three-week peak on Tuesday.
The dollar was down 0.4% at 108.03 yen, forced off a six-week high of 108.990 the previous day. It was still some distance from a six-month trough of 106.780 set on June 25. The euro nudged up 0.23% to $1.1275.
In fixed-income markets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 2.037% after dropping on Wednesday from a three-week high of 2.113%.
Euro zone government bond yields also fell. Germany's 10-year government bond yield dropped to minus 0.32% on expectations that monetary easing in the euro zone will not be far behind the Fed.
In commodities, U.S. crude oil futures climbed to a six-week high as oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated before a storm, while an incident with a British tanker in the Middle East highlighted ongoing tensions in the region.
U.S. crude oil futures gained 42 cents to trade at $60.84 per barrel. Brent crude futures rose 47 cents to $67.48.
Spot gold gained to $1,426 an ounce, its highest since July 3, on the reinforced expectations for a Fed rate cut.

Tarek el-Molla also told Reuters that total monthly payments by Egypt to foreign oil companies stood at $700 million.
Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI),  BP  (L:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Italian energy group Edison (MI:EDNn) have dominated energy exploration work in Egypt in recent years.
Arrears to foreign oil companies piled up after the 2011 uprising that forced long-ruling President Hosni Mubarak to step down, reaching $6.3 billion in the 2011-12 fiscal year.
But they have been declining since 2014 as Egypt sought to become a regional energy hub.
Egypt owed foreign oil companies $2.4 billion in June 2017.
Molla said he hoped that the remaining arrears would be paid soon, but gave no specific time.
Cairo has pledged not to accumulate more arrears, part of its drive to draw new foreign investment to an energy sector that is attracting interest following several major gas discoveries."

While strong U.S. jobs data last week had investors trimming bets of a 50 basis points cut in interest rates by the Fed in July, Powell's remarks saw interest rate futures pricing in greater odds of an aggressive rate cut this month.
The pan-European stocks benchmark (STOXX) rose 0.2% after accumulating losses of 1.4% over the last four sessions. The release of Powell's prepared remarks had lifted stocks briefly into the black on Wednesday, but they closed lower.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air's (OL:NWC) Bjoern Kjos stepped down on Thursday as chief executive of the airline he co-founded and turned into Europe's third-biggest budget carrier by passenger numbers.
Chief Financial Officer Geir Karlsen will act as interim CEO while the company recruits a permanent, new CEO. Kjos, who is 72, will have a new role as an adviser to the chairman.
The airline has shaken up the long-haul market with cut-price transatlantic fares, but its rapid expansion has left it with hefty losses and high debts and it had to raise 3 billion crowns ($350 million) from shareholders earlier this year.
""I am way overdue,"" Kjos, laughing, told a news conference, announcing his plans to quit the top job. A former fighter pilot, Kjos helped to expand what was a tiny Norwegian airline housed in pre-fabricated barracks on the edge of Oslo airport.
""Bjorn has been the driving force behind the business – the big question now is whether Norwegian Air can maintain momentum as he takes a less active role,"" Bernstein said in a note to clients.
The airline also said it expected its 18 grounded Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft to return to service in October, compared with its previous view that they would return to service in August.
The jets have been grounded worldwide since March following two fatal crashes and Norwegian Air has said the disruption could scupper its plans to return to profitability this year.
The company, which was set up in 1993, reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations on Thursday.
Its net profit came in at 82.8 million Norwegian crowns ($9.7 million), down from 300.3 million in the same period last year, but ahead of the average forecast of 76.2 million from five analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
Its shares traded 2% higher at 0723 GMT.
The company cut its target for passenger carrying capacity growth to 0-5%, compared with the previous guidance for 5-10%.
It said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR), excluding ""other"" losses or gains for items such as foreign currency contracts and forward fuel contracts, were expected to reach 6–7 billion crowns in 2019, up from 3.2 billion in 2018."

“We’re at a point where we’re weighing whether the Fed will cut for insurance or if they’re entering a period of structural, cyclical downturn in interest rates -- I’m leaning more towards the latter,” said Shyam Devani, senior technical strategist in Singapore. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see two-year yields dropping to 1% by the end of next year.”
Citigroup is forecasting the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by 25 basis points this month and potentially cut another two times by year-end. “Inflation expectations remain low, we have a global slowdown in growth and commodity prices remain weak,” Devani said. “The Fed could cut well into next year.”
Traders increased bets on how much the Fed will cut rates to bolster U.S. growth following Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish testimony to Congress on Wednesday. Markets are now pricing in about 75 basis points of easing by year-end after Powell cited slowing global expansion and trade tensions as threats to the U.S. economy.

The preference for quality has been apparent for a while now in everything from U.S. shares and high-yield debt to emerging-market equities and credit, Goldman strategists Lotfi Karoui and Caesar Maasry wrote in a note Wednesday. Despite expensive valuations, it is not yet time to rotate back into lower-quality assets, they said.
“We see plenty of reasons why the ‘bid for quality’ will remain strong,” the strategists wrote. “For U.S. equity and credit markets, these include pressures on margin growth, and the lack of fundamental upside for over-leveraged and often secularly challenged firms.”
In emerging markets, a more positive view on low-quality stocks would require improved economic data, but so far in 2019 it has been mixed, they said.
Goldman has company from the likes of Pacific Investment Management Co. and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA in recommending quality shares in the current market environment. The calls come as the composition of what classifies as quality evolves -- Invesco Ltd. recently noted that almost 30% of its quality-based exchange-traded fund is comprised of technology companies.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Beijing-based unit of S&P Global on Thursday became the first international credit rating agency to rate a domestic issuer in China, a long-awaited step in the development of the country's $13 trillion bond market.
Chinese bond investors hope that ratings by international agencies will help to shake up domestic counterparts which assign relatively safe AA ratings to the vast majority of issuers, and have come under regulatory fire for operational violations.
S&P Global (China) Ratings said it assigned a AAA issuer credit rating to ICBC Financial Leasing Co, with a stable outlook. The AAA rating, S&P's highest, reflects an issuer's ""extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments"", the agency says.
S&P said a mismatch in the durations of ICBC Financial Leasing's assets and debt presented some liquidity risk, but diverse funding sources and liquidity support from parent Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (SS:601398) made the risks ""manageable"".
ICBC Financial Leasing (ICBCFL) describes itself as a leading leasing firm in China, involved in leasing aircraft, ships and industrial equipment. Its four outstanding bonds in China's interbank market are worth a total of 10 billion yuan ($1.46 billion), according to Refinitiv data.
The company also has a AAA long-term issuer credit rating from domestic agency China Lianhe Credit Rating Co.
S&P, along with Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, previously assigned ratings for ICBCFL's overseas debt issues.
Thursday's rating follows S&P's approval by the People's Bank of China in January to enter the domestic credit rating market, the first time a foreign rating agency received a license to rate domestic bonds. S&P Global (China) Ratings is wholly owned by S&P Global Inc (N:SPGI).
Fitch, which has established a domestic entity, and Moody's have also applied for licenses.
Josh Sheng, chief investment officer at Shanghai Tongshengtonghui Asset Management, said domestic investors needed time to understand foreign agencies' ratings.
""Mutual acceptance will take place gradually,"" he said."

SEOUL/DETROIT (Reuters) - South Korean electric vehicle (EV) battery maker LG Chem is considering building a second U.S. factory, three people familiar with the matter said, accelerating a race to add capacity to meet growing global demand for green vehicles.
LG Chem, one of the leading EV battery makers in the world that counts General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) among its customers, is weighing investing about 2 trillion won ($1.70 billion) in the plant that could begin production in 2022, one of the people said. Kentucky and Tennessee are among the candidates for the plant's site, the person said.
A decision on the plant's site is expected to be made by the end of this month, another person said.
Automakers are pushing ahead with billions of dollars in investments in electric vehicles to meet global regulatory requirements. A new plant by LG Chem would come as South Korean companies have stepped up U.S. investments, moves that have been praised by U.S. President Donald Trump.
LG Chem's new factory would primarily supply to Volvo, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and potentially to Hyundai Motor, GM and Volkswagen, one of the people said.
LG Chem, the most valuable company of the LG conglomerate, said in a statement issued to Reuters it is reviewing various ways to meet its global clients' orders, but there are no concrete plans at the moment. The sources declined to be named as the plan is confidential.
A second U.S. plant would come amid a growing rivalry between LG Chem and crosstown rival SK Innovation, which recently broke ground on its $1 billion U.S. EV battery plant to primarily supply to Volkswagen.
Earlier this year, LG Chem sued SK Innovation in the United States for alleged theft of trade secrets by hiring its former employees.
“We are currently pursuing another production base,” LG Chem's new CEO Shin Hak Cheol told reporters this week, without elaborating on the country. 
Electric vehicle sales are projected to reach 1.28 million vehicles by 2026 in the United States alone, compared with less than 200,000 in 2018, according to market researcher IHS Markit.
TRUMP AND MOON 
Trump praised U.S. investments by SK, Lotte Group and other South Korean conglomerates and raised hopes that Korean companies will continue to expand in the United States.
""Thank you very much. Congratulations. It’s a great job,"" he said during his meeting with South Korean business leaders in Seoul on June 30. The participants included group holding company LG Corp's Vice Chairman Kwon Young Soo.
LG Chem, the battery supplier for GM's Bolt, currently operates an EV battery plant in Michigan. LG Chem also has production bases in South Korea, China and Poland.
It drew attention during the groundbreaking of its first U.S. production facility in 2010, when former President Barack Obama traveled to Michigan for the event. 
LG Chem is also being wooed by the government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in to build a new domestic factory to create jobs - one of Moon's top priorities. 

CEO Shin said LG Chem is in talks to build a production facility for cathode materials used in EV batteries in the southeastern city of Gumi in South Korea, but details have not been finalised.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three of Australia's biggest banks will have to set aside an additional A$500 million ($348 million) each until they have strengthened risk management and reimbursed customers for wrongly charged fees, the prudential regulator said on Thursday.
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) - the country's second, third and fourth-largest lenders - had been informed in writing of the additional capital requirements, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) said.
""Australia's major banks are well-capitalised and financially sound, but improvements in the management of non-financial risks are needed,"" APRA Chair Wayne Byres said in a statement.
""This will require a real focus on the root causes of the issues that have been identified, including complexity, unclear accountabilities, weak incentives and cultures that have been too accepting of long-standing gaps.""
Australia's largest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), was slapped with an additional A$1 billion capital requirement last year after it was accused of thousands of breaches of anti-money laundering protocols.
APRA then asked dozens of other financial services companies to report on their own their risk assessment systems, which it said on Thursday confirmed that ""many of the issues"" identified in its inquiry into the money-laundering scandal were ""not unique to CBA"".
The companies' self-assessments showed that ""they have fallen short in a number of areas, and APRA is therefore raising their regulatory capital requirements until weaknesses have been fully remediated,"" Byres said.
APRA added that it may impose more capital requirements on the sector without specifying which company.
""We acknowledge the need to improve non-financial risk management and oversight and we are working to resolve the issues raised,"" Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer said in a statement.
The new capital requirement would cut Westpac's common equity tier 1 capital by about 0.16 percentage points, the company added.

The Kyoto-based company said the new device would launch on Sept. 20 at a suggested retail price of 19,980 yen, or $199.99, compared with $299 for the Nintendo Switch.
Nintendo shares had risen on media reports earlier this year of a low-cost version of the Switch console, only to be battered after management appeared to dampen such speculation over the past few months.
In mid-morning trade, Nintendo's shares were up 3.6%, while the benchmark Nikkei average (N225) was flat.
""A lower-priced version should stimulate demand,"" Jefferies
analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note to clients.
He said the new device directly targets the 75 million owners of Nintendo's 3DS hand-held device, and that ""this lower-priced version should add fuel to fire as this price-point directly targets those"" owners."

The formerly state-owned firm said on Wednesday it had found 22,000 cases of double-charging for at least six months between 2016 and 2018 as sales staff failed to cancel old policies when customers signed new contracts. Its policies are sold at sister company Japan Post Co's post offices.
At a news conference on Wednesday, Japan Post Co President Kunio Yokoyama said the firm would lower its sales targets beyond August in view of the misconduct.
Japan Post Insurance said in a statement on Wednesday it would put in place measures to improve its sales practices. It also plans to announce the results of an internal investigation by year-end, while looking into setting up a third-party committee to investigate.
Japanese government spokesman Kotaro Nogami said the Financial Services Agency was looking into the issue.
Japan Post Insurance, 64% owned by Japan Post Holdings Co (T:6178), was down 6.15% at 1,800 yen in mid-afternoon trade, earlier hitting as low as 1,786 yen, the lowest since it went public in 2015."

Investigators, who have spent years examining  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s lucrative dealings with the fund, are now taking a closer look at a former Goldman executive who later worked at the German bank, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential inquiry. U.S. authorities haven’t accused Deutsche Bank or the former employee of wrongdoing.
The inquiry aims to determine whether Deutsche Bank might have violated foreign-corruption or anti-money-laundering laws as it helped 1MDB raise $1.2 billion in 2014, the Wall Street Journal said in an earlier report Wednesday. Tim Leissner, another ex-Goldman executive who pleaded guilty last year for his role in the scandal, has been helping with the Deutsche Bank examination, the paper said, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.
“Deutsche Bank has cooperated fully with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that have made inquiries relating to 1MDB,” the Frankfurt-based company said in an emailed statement. It pointed to asset-forfeiture documents previously filed by the Justice Department indicating 1MDB misled Deutsche Bank during transactions. “This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter,” the firm said in the statement.
Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.
Probes into 1MDB have mainly focused on more than $6 billion the fund raised in 2012 and 2013 with help from Goldman Sachs, which reaped almost $600 million in fees. The New York-based bank, which has said it’s cooperating with related investigations, has portrayed Leissner as a rogue employee who circumvented its internal controls. The Justice Department now expects to start negotiating with Goldman Sachs soon to potentially resolve a criminal probe, the Journal wrote.
“We do anticipate getting into active discussions with Goldman, at this point, in the near future,” it cited Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski as saying in an interview. He declined to comment on other aspects of the 1MDB case.
Overhaul Effort
The investigation of Deutsche Bank is emerging just as the lender makes its most dramatic effort yet to overhaul its business after a decade in which it paid more than $18 billion in fines and other legal costs.
In recent years, regulators and prosecutors have raided the bank’s headquarters, subpoenaed documents and grilled executives in dozens of probes on three continents. This week, the company said it will cut a fifth of its 91,000-person workforce and exit some business lines as it seeks to improve profitability.
Deutsche Bank previously fielded questions from authorities in Singapore examining possible ties between the former executive who worked at both Goldman Sachs and the German bank and fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, people with knowledge of the situation said last year. U.S. prosecutors have portrayed Low as the mastermind behind the scandal surrounding 1MDB, though he has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Leissner, Goldman’s former head of Southeast Asia, pleaded guilty last year to U.S. charges that he conspired to launder money and violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As part of the deal, he agreed to forfeit $43.7 million and admitted to bribing officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates to get bond deals for Goldman Sachs.

This comes as New Zealand looks to increase regulatory oversight of its banking sector after Australian counterparts came under fire for widespread misconduct exposed by a year-long Royal Commission inquiry into the sector.
The commission said it is seeking return of costs and statutory damages to affected borrowers.
""This case is important for clarifying the scope of lender liability to borrowers, in a situation where thousands of customers were not provided with initial disclosure required under the law,"" Commission Chair Anna Rawlings said.
A Westpac spokesman said the lender had discovered in March last year that disclosure documents had not been sent to 19,365 new credit card customers due to an error during a systems upgrade and had ""proactively notified the Commerce Commission"".
""We also refunded fees and interest charges to customers who were in default, and have made changes to make sure this issue is not repeated,"" the spokesman told Reuters in an email, declining to comment further as the case is before the courts.
The watchdog's statement said Westpac had reported last year its failure to disclose key details to 19,000 personal credit card customers when they first took out their credit card between May 2017 and March 2018.
New Zealand shares of Westpac, also the No.2 lender in neighboring Australia, fell as much as 1.2% compared with a broader benchmark (NZ50) which was 0.2% higher. Westpac shares in Australia (AX:WBC) were trading flat."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's corporate regulator threatened on Thursday to prosecute some of the country's largest banks over their sales earlier this decade of consumer insurance products that it said had harmed customers.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said in a report that consumer credit insurance products, which cover credit card debts or loans when a person loses their job, falls sick or gets injured, had ""consistently failed consumers"".
It said a seven-year review of the sales practices and products of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA),  Citigroup  (N:C), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and eight other lenders had showed they ""caused consumers harm"" and were ""extremely poor value for money"".
""We are deeply troubled by the findings in our report, and the stories they tell of unfair practices occurring within Australia's largest and most well-known financial institutions,"" ASIC Commissioner Sean Hughes said in a statement.
""An inevitable consequence of these widespread failings and mis-selling practices will involve ASIC taking significant enforcement action against some of the entities named in our report,"" Hughes added.
The regulator's report and threat of action follows over A$100 million ($69.58 million) in remediation made to over 300,000 consumers and revelations at a powerful inquiry that banks were aware of the problems for years but continued selling the products.
Representatives from CBA, ANZ and Citi did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
ASIC said its investigation, for the period 2011 to 2018, found insurance sold to cover credit card debts had paid only 11 cents for every dollar that consumers spent in premiums.
It said the report found that the products were sold to people that were ineligible to claim their policy, for example, due to unemployment. It also found that telephone sales staff used high-pressure selling tactics, and that consumers were given poor personal advice to buy the policies.
ASIC threatened to intervene to get the products banned and said it would investigate ""suspected misconduct of several entities involved in the CCI product market"" and would take public action against the culprits."

""At the request of President Trump, I took another look at our decision to close the Coatesville, PA, facility and have decided to keep it open while we pursue additional work,"" Lockheed Martin quoted CEO Marillyn Hewson as saying.
Trump applauded the decision in a tweet, saying, ""We are very proud of Pennsylvania and the people who work there. Thank you to Lockheed Martin, one of the USA's truly great companies!""
The F-35 fighter manufacturer had announced plans to close the plant, which does ""completion work"" for Sikorsky's S-92 and S-76D helicopters, citing a multi-year slump in the rotorcraft industry. The plant employs about 465 employees.
""We look forward to working with the government and PA Congressional delegation to find more work for this facility,"" the company said.
Republican Pennsylvania Senator Patrick Toomey said in a statement that Lockheed's decision provided short-term certainty for workers at the plant who had expected to either lose their jobs or be re-located later this year. 
Fellow Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat, was skeptical about the announcement, however, saying he was concerned about the lack of a specific plan.
U.S. automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) has been under pressure for months from President Trump over the fate of an idled assembly plant in northeast Ohio which it has since announced it will sell.

The stock will join the blue chip gauge on Aug. 1, replacing Chiyoda Corp., which is being demoted to the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s second section after reporting liabilities in excess of its assets.
“This was a surprise to everyone I spoke to after the close yesterday,” analyst Travis Lundy wrote in a note on Smartkarma. Lundy estimates 27 million shares of Bandai Namco will need to be bought as funds tracking the Nikkei 225 seek to match its weightings. That may equal about one-third of the “net available to sell,” given the possibly limited desire among individual and foreign investors to dump the stock now.
Quantitative analysts at brokers including Nomura Securities Co. and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. had expected DMG Mori Co. to be chosen, as it is in the capital goods sector like Chiyoda. The Nikkei often picks a stock from the same industry in cases of replacement. DMG Mori’s stock dropped 9.7%.
Bandai Namco makes games for Nintendo Co (T:7974).’s Switch console, among other platforms. Demand may rise following Nintendo’s announcement Wednesday of a cheaper version of the Switch. Bandai Namco is also active in mobile games, which may be poised for improved growth in the second half of this year, Bloomberg Intelligence says.

PUEBLA, Mexico (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rolled the last Beetle off the assembly line on Wednesday, the end of the road for a car that ran from Nazi Germany through hippie counterculture but failed to navigate a swerve in consumer tastes toward SUVs.
Serenaded by a mariachi band and surrounded by proud factory workers, the final units of the retro, rounded compact were celebrated at a VW plant in Mexico's central Puebla state more than 80 years after the model was introduced in Germany. 
The Puebla factory, which already produces VW's Tiguan SUV, will make the Tarek SUV in place of the Beetle starting in late 2020, Volkswagen de Mexico Chief Executive Steffen Reiche said. The bigger vehicles are more popular in the United States, the main export market for the Mexico factory.
The last Beetles will be sold on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in a move symbolizing the company's embrace of the future, Reiche said. 
""Today is the last day. It has been very emotional,"" he said. The current design was the third version of the Beetle after two earlier cancellations and revivals of the marque. 
The ""bug,"" as the Beetle was nicknamed, debuted in 1938 as an affordable vehicle commissioned by Adolf Hitler to promote car ownership among Germans. 
With its funky design and inexpensive price, the car became a success story over subsequent decades and was one of the top-selling models of all time as well as the best-selling import in the United States in the 1960s, according to auto publications.
In the 1960s, the Beetle was a small-is-beautiful icon of the postwar Baby Boom generation. The 1968 movie ""The Love Bug,"" which featured a zany anthropomorphic vehicle, stoked Beetle fever.

Despite its place in popular culture, sales of the Beetle have been lackluster in recent years. The German automaker announced in September that the Beetle would go extinct.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 08:51PM ET</span>",Domestic airfares soar in Indonesia despite government price cap,"By Jamie Freed and Cindy Silviana
SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - When Resti Novita Sari booked to fly from Jakarta to her hometown of Padang to visit family for the Eid holiday, airfares were 40% to 60% higher than she had paid in previous years.
""It made me think twice about buying airplane tickets,"" she said, adding that she eventually paid 1.7 million rupiah ($120.48) each way for the short flight from the island of Java to Sumatra.
Soaring domestic ticket prices in the world's fifth-biggest domestic aviation market, now a duopoly, led the government in May to order Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) and Lion Air to lower fares.
But caps and floors on airfares in the vast archipelago nation have not stopped a surge in average ticket prices.
Carriers have slashed domestic seat capacity by 15% from March to October, according to data from the air travel intelligence company OAG, putting the country on track for the first annual decline in passenger traffic since 2014 - and pushing up fares.
That has stifled the domestic hospitality industry, data shows, with hotel occupancy rates down as much as 30% in the country's east.
Now Indonesia's anti-monopoly agency, KPPU, is investigating whether Garuda and Lion are behaving like a cartel, as well as looking into Garuda's operational control of Sriwijaya Air, the country's third-largest airline group, commissioner Guntur Saragih said on Monday.
""We believe there is price setting,"" he said, adding that the agency plans to say next week whether it will take the airlines to court.
The maximum fine for price setting is 25 billion rupiah per party per case. Garuda and Lion did not respond to requests to comment on the allegations.
Airlines have stopped selling deeply discounted fares on many domestic routes and are instead selling most tickets at or near the maximum limit, according to industry sources and airline information.
Passenger yields, which measure what each flier pays per kilometer, a proxy for average fares, rose 43% in the five months ended May 31 in Garuda's domestic operation and were up 94% at Sriwijaya Air in the same period, according to Garuda data.
""We wanted to optimize capacity,"" Garuda Finance Director Fuad Rizal told Reuters, declining to comment further. The data showed that despite the capacity cut, its planes were on average less full than the previous year.
DUOPOLY
The high cost of flights has broader consequences for the Indonesian economy, which expanded by 5.07% in the first quarter, missing expectations.
At the country's largest airport, Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta International, domestic traffic fell 22% in the first four months of the year to the lowest level since 2011, according to government statistics.
Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of Indonesia's Hotel and Restaurants Association, said hotel occupancy rates were down 10% to 30% - depending on region - for the first six months of 2019.
""It is due to the expensive domestic ticket prices,"" he said. ""I understand regulators and government have tried to press to adjust the price. But it is not working, because two big airlines, Garuda and Lion, dominate the Indonesian market.""
When Garuda took over operational control of Sriwijaya in November, its share of the Indonesian market rose to 48%, compared with Lion's 47%, according to OAG data.
Ari Askhara took over as Garuda's CEO in September 2018, setting a new strategy of capacity cuts and price increases. The airline reported a $19.7 million profit in the quarter that ended March 31, up from a $64.3 million loss the prior year, including a 12% rise in revenue.
Lion Air, a private company, does not disclose financial information.
But squeezing customers too much could result in stronger competition from AirAsia Indonesia Tbk PT (JK:CMPP). The AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) offshoot has a domestic market share of just 2.4% but is planning to add five planes this year, for a total of 30, to accommodate 20% passenger growth.
""We want to expand as much as we can,"" AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes said of the Indonesian market at a recent event in Jakarta.
RESHAPED FARES
Government pricing regulations can distort the market for seats, which typically sell for higher prices at times of peak demand and lower prices in quieter periods, said Andrew Herdman of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
For example, Garuda is allowed to charge a maximum base fare of 1.167 million rupiah each way, excluding taxes and fees, on the popular Jakarta-Surabaya route, down 15% percent from the previous cap, according to the regulations.
Garuda is now pricing all Jakarta-Surabaya tickets at the exactly the maximum base fare for any time of day or day of the week, according to Reuters checks of its website. The same is true for other routes, including Jakarta-Bali and Jakarta-Padang.
Garuda Corporate Secretary Ikhsan Rosan said the airline would not sell tickets below cost, which averages 800,000 rupiah per flight. He declined to provide any details of discounted fares.
Lion Air's online offerings, as checked by Reuters, was more variable. None of the lowest-priced promotional fares was available on the Lion flights, but prices were often slightly below the fare caps at peak times and even lower at times of less demand.
A Lion Air spokesman said the carrier always complied with pricing regulations.
But travelers are feeling the pinch.
Alan Perwiranda, who works at a palm oil company, used to fly regularly from Ketapang to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo for short breaks.
He said the price of the 40-minute turboprop flight has nearly doubled to 700,000 to 800,000 rupiah.
""I have started to limit my travel because the tickets are really expensive,"" Perwiranda said. ""I think what the government is doing is not helpful at all. Everything is just discourse and there is no concrete evidence of any change."""

789,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 08:02PM ET</span>",German minister to meet with Lighthizer on aircraft subsidies issue Thursday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he would meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday to discuss efforts to settle a dispute over subsidies to U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR).
Speaking later at a think tank event, Altmaier said he would be open to eliminating all government subsidies to Airbus, as long as the United States was willing to do the same with Boeing.
""I could perfectly go along with ... we will no longer provide any subsidies on both sides. Then it is just competition and nothing else,"" he told an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund.
The World Trade Organization has found that both Boeing and Airbus, the world's two largest planemakers, have received billions of dollars of harmful or illegal government subsidies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-aircraft-wto/wto-says-us-failed-to-halt-state-tax-subsidy-for-boeing-idUSKCN1R923B to gain advantage in the global market.
The United States and the European Union have threatened to impose billions of dollars of tariffs on each other, with Washington first in line to seek tariffs under the WTO timetable.
""In our view it is in the interest of both sides to avoid these tit-for-tit tariffs,"" Altmaier told reporters earlier in the day.
The EU last week said it remained open to negotiations to settle the disputes ""provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome.""
Washington had signaled its openness last month to working on an enforceable mechanism to govern government subsidies for aircraft production, a move that could pave the way for resolving a dispute which has taken up thousands of pages of rulings over the last nearly 15 years.
Altmaier told reporters he had a ""productive and constructive"" meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and the two sides discussed how to reduce global tensions, ease trade disputes and maintain jobs in both Germany and the United States. He is due to meet with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday.
Altmaier said it was positive that trade tensions between Europe and the United States had not spiked over the past year, since European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to start talks. He said he thought it was possible to avoid escalation by tackling each of the many disputes on the table one by one.
Altmaier said he and Mnuchin discussed a range of issues including possibly boosting liquefied natural gas exports from the United States to Europe, sanctions against Iran and other countries, and prospects for intensifying cooperation on the issue of Ukraine and gas transfers.
""We are in the middle of intensive discussions. For me, the Americans remain partners and friends despite our disagreements,"" he said.
Altmaier cited great concern about recent developments in Iran and said Europe and the United States should work together to find ways to deescalate the situation.
All parties share an interest in ensuring that Iran returns to upholding the spirit and the letter of the 2015 nuclear agreement, he said. ""Nothing else makes sense. Nothing else is in the interest of international stability,"" he said. 
European powers accused Iran on Tuesday of ""pursuing activities inconsistent with its commitments"" under the deal and called for an urgent meeting of the parties to the agreement to discuss Tehran's compliance.

Britain, Germany, France, Russia, China and Iran are the remaining parties to the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was abandoned by the United States last year.

790,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>","Ryanair says Boeing eyes MAX flights by October, cites 2020 growth risk","By Tim Hepher
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The boss of Europe's Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) warned on Wednesday the impact of the prolonged grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX on the airline's growth plans may start to spill over to next summer if the airplane is not flying again by November.
Europe's largest budget carrier needs up to eight months to take delivery of some 50 newly built planes left at the factory by the grounding crisis, so it may have to trim its capacity growth plans for summer 2020 if 737 MAX flights have not resumed by November, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters.
""Boeing are telling us at the moment they expect to be back flying by the end of September,"" O'Leary said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of the European airlines lobby A4E, which he also chairs.
""I think it will fly before the end of this year. I am not sure they will meet the end of September date, but I take comfort from the fact that it seems that now the American, European, Brazilian and Canadian regulators are working together,"" he added.
In May, O'Leary predicted a return to service by July but the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has since reported a new potential safety risk that it says must be addressed first.
""We are continuing to engage with global regulators and providing information to them as we work towards the safe return to service for the MAX,"" a Boeing spokesman said by email.
Boeing's top-selling jet was grounded in March in the wake of crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia which killed 346 people. The planemaker is working on a software fix that people familiar with the matter have said Boeing hopes to present to regulators in September.
""The challenge for us is that we need to see the plane back flying by the end of September, October, November at the latest, so as not to disrupt our growth for the summer of 2020,"" O'Leary said.
Ryanair can take delivery of no more than six to eight planes a month because of the complexity of the delivery process and the availability of trained MAX pilots. 
""PRESSURE"" ON BOEING AFTER IAG DEAL
O'Leary also responded to a surprise move by British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) to buy 200 MAX jets at what analysts say must have been very attractive prices as the grounding drags on.
He described the preliminary order, which gave the 737 MAX a boost at last month's Paris Airshow, as a ""great move"" by IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh, even though at this stage the deal is only a letter of intent (LOI).
""Let's see what happens with that. I suspect it certainly puts more pressure on Airbus. And we, as a result of IAG’s LOI, are putting much more pressure on Boeing.""
Ryanair benefits from a clause in its contract guaranteeing it lower prices than its competitors, echoing a similar arrangement for Southwest in the United States, analysts say.
Asked whether Ryanair could take advantage of the IAG deal to expand its order for 135 MAX on even better terms, O'Leary said any new deal would be unlikely during the grounding but could be up for discussion once the jet was back in service.
""You could do that in September or October this year when the aircraft is back flying. We will stick close to Boeing on it and we are also talking to Airbus about the possibility of aircraft for Laudamotion.""
O'Leary told Reuters in March, shortly before the second crash that triggered a worldwide grounding of the 737 MAX 8 and 9 models, that Ryanair was interested in Boeing's larger 737 MAX 10 ""at the right price"" as well as at least 100 Airbus (PA:AIR) A321 for recently acquired Austrian unit Laudamotion.

O'Leary said in May Ryanair was also talking to Boeing about compensation for the grounding, but that it had to be determined whether this would be paid in cash or as lower aircraft prices.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Efforts by Thailand's central bank to talk down a spike in auto loans amid wider concerns about household debt have sent a chill across the country's car dealers, which are struggling to source finance for new customers.
Although the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has taken no policy action yet, analysts say the mere prospect of car loan curbs has been enough to tighten the finance spigot to domestic buyers.
While that may take some of the heat out of auto finance, the sudden deceleration threatens car makers, dealers and the wider sector, which has been one of few growth drivers against a backdrop of declining exports and sluggish investment.
""Our car sales in April and May fell by 50%,"" said Sumete Patchuttorn, managing director of Mazda Mahachai.
""Finance firms are more cautious about lending now,"" he said, adding that about 60%-70% of his clients' loan requests were rejected this year, up from 30% in the previous year. More than 80% of car buyers rely on loans.
The car industry accounts for about a tenth of gross domestic product in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy. Bank of Ayudhya said car sales contributed 0.4 percentage point to last year's 4.1% economic growth. 
(GRAPHIC - Thailand's domestic car sales & car exports: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YqH4NU) 
Although roughly half the cars are made for export, that part of the sector has also been declining.
""A slowdown in car sales this year will also drag down consumption,"" said Naris Sathapholdeja, head of TMB Analytics, adding car sales contributed a fifth to last year's 4.6% growth in consumption. He sees GDP growth of 3% this year, with consumption up 3.5%. 
Worried that car loans were driving household debt to one of the highest levels in Asia - at about 80% of GDP - the central bank said in April it had started monitoring car loans and considering loan standards since the beginning of the year.
Of particular concern for the central bank is the fact that car loans have the highest delinquency rate among consumer debt products, with 6.9% of them between one- and three-months overdue at the end of March. 
Analysts said possible central bank curbs could include debt service ratios for borrowers or downpayments required on car purchases.
Those possibilities alone were enough to knock annual car sales growth from nearly 20% in 2018, its fastest since 2012, to 3.7% year-on-year in May, its slowest since May 2017.
In turn, on-year growth in auto loan volumes has slowed to 11.4% in the first quarter from 12.6% in 2018, the fastest in six years.

The research unit of Kasikornbank said car sales might contract as much as 6% this year if the BOT required a downpayment of 25% on car purchases. 
The Federation of Thai Industries expects car sales to rise just 2.4%, said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesman of the FTI's automotive industry division.
""The market has been stagnant this year,"" said Phanumast Rungkakulnuwat, chief executive officer of Autocorp Holding, which sells Honda cars (T:7267). Last year its sales grew 10%. 
The BOT predicts GDP growth of just 3.3% this year. Thailand has lagged regional peers for years and is forecast to grow more slowly than any country in Southeast Asia except Singapore.

Paul Smith, executive vice president of Salesforce UK, said Brexit was adding to business uncertainty at the same time as companies were grappling with unprecedented levels of technological change.
""There's no doubt the economy is changing as new technologies emerge,"" he said on Thursday.
""As business leaders, it's clear that we need to do more to show people how reskilling and gaining new tech qualifications, often with free courses and accessible tools, is easier than many think.""
The tech sector has continued to flourish in Britain since the vote to leave the European Union three years ago, despite concerns about future easy access to EU workers.
The terms and timing of Britain's departure from the trading bloc still remains unclear.
Tech companies based in London attracted a record 2.56 billion pounds ($3.26 billion) in venture capital in the first six months of 2019, more than twice as much as those in Berlin, the Mayor of London's investment agency said last month.
The research by Salesforce found that 54% of business leaders planned to invest more to develop their own tech talent, with the same proportion looking to train older generations in new technology and 51% intending to do more to increase the skills of people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Salesforce, which has its own digital learning platform called Trailhead, partnered with Censuswide to poll 1,000 business leaders for the survey."

(Reuters) - The family of the former owners of a Cuban bank seized by Fidel Castro's government nearly six decades ago sued  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) for approximately $792 million, saying the French bank owes damages for circumventing U.S. sanctions against Cuba.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Miami, 14 grandchildren of Carlos and Pura Nuñez, who once owned Banco Nuñez, want to hold Societe Generale liable under U.S. law for doing business with Cuba's central bank, which nationalized Banco Nuñez and other lenders in 1960.
A lawyer for the plaintiffs said he believed the case was the first against a bank that allegedly ""trafficked"" in property expropriated by the Castro regime, since the Trump administration said in April it would begin letting U.S. nationals sue companies for such conduct.
""Victims of the Cuban regime who had their property confiscated now have a vehicle to get justice,"" Javier Lopez, the lawyer, said in an interview. ""We have multiple financial institutions that we're looking to target.""
Societe Generale did not immediately respond to requests for comment after market hours.
The lawsuit was filed eight months after Societe Generale agreed to pay $1.34 billion and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to settle U.S. and New York regulatory charges that it handled billions of dollars of transactions related to Cuba and other countries under U.S. sanctions.
According to the plaintiffs, Societe Generale generated hundreds of millions of dollars of fees by lending money to and processing transactions for Banco Nacional de Cuba from 2000 to 2010.
The plaintiffs said they own a claim to 10.5% of the equity in Banco Nacional de Cuba, roughly the percentage that Banco Nuñez represented when it was seized.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs at Kozyak Tropin & Throckmorton based the $792 million damages estimate on Banco Nuñez's $7.8 million worth at the time, plus 6% annual interest and triple damages under the Helms-Burton Act, a 1996 federal law.
The right to sue under that law had been suspended for 23 years because of opposition from the international community and concern that U.S. courts could be overrun by lawsuits.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the lifting of that suspension in April, to boost pressure on Havana to end Cuban support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shares in Brazilian electronics retailer Via Varejo (SA:VVAR3) have soared more than 30% this month with investors betting on the industry experience of the Klein family, which recently re-acquired control of the company.
Michael Klein and his family boosted their stake in Via Varejo to 27% last month in an auction, resulting in Klein, whose father had founded appliance retailer brand Casas Bahias in the 1950s, being elected as chairman of the board.
The family sold its ownership of that company to retailer GPA SA (SA:PCAR4) in 2009 and it became part of Via Varejo. GPA had struggled to find a buyer for the money-losing company for two years.
Via Varejo shares closed at 6.73 reais on Wednesday, down 0.3% but still up 35% since Klein was elected chairman on June 26. The shares have also gained a third over the last month, making them the top gainers on Brazil's Bovespa index.
""What is happening is a result of Klein,"" said fund manager André Lion at Ibiuna Investimentos, a Via Varejo shareholder.
""With the changes he is making, the appointment of people who know the retail sector and are completely dedicated to the company, it is reasonable to predict the company will improve a lot.""
Last week, Joao Luiz Braga, a partner at XP Asset Management, Brazil's largest retail brokerage, told a crowd of 8,000 investors, managers and clients that Via Varejo was the largest position in most of its funds, while acknowledging risks related to the execution of the turnaround.
Some investors also said they expected Brazilian interest rate cuts to help spur consumer demand and benefit Via Varejo and other retailers. The central bank's weekly FOCUS survey of economists is predicting the benchmark Selic interest rate to be cut from 6.5% currently to 5.5% by the end of the year.
But fund manager Werner Roger, founding partner of Trigono Capital, said he saw no fundamental changes despite Via Varejo's hiring of a high-profile executive from online retailer Magazine Luiza SA (SA:MGLU3).
In a note, analysts at investment bank BTG Pactual acknowledged the experience of incoming executives but cited risks and competition in the sector.
""Considering the risks of execution, we prefer to stay out of the way when it comes to Via Varejo, maintaining our 'neutral' rating until we see clearer signs of the operation recovering,"" the note said."
795,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 05:41PM ET</span>","Privatization to dominate capital markets, M&A in Brazil this year","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The sale of state-owned assets is expected to drive M&A transactions and share offerings volume in Brazil in the second half of the year, bankers and investors said, after a slower-than-expected first half.
As court injunctions delayed asset sales by oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) and discussion of pension reform dragged on in Congress, the volume of mergers and acquisitions in the first half of the year fell 19% to $20.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
But state-controlled companies faced less hurdles to selling stakes in companies already listed, and the volume of share offerings rose 45% in the first half to 8.6 billion reais ($2.25 billion). It was the best first half of the year since 2013.
After Brazil's Supreme Court finally cleared the way for Brazil's largest deal this year, the sale by Petrobras of gas pipeline network TAG to France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) for $8.6 billion, banks expect the volume of privatization-related M&A to grow. The next one on the block is fuel distribution unit  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA (SA:BRDT3), which will be privatized through a share offering by the end of the month.
""We are expecting a new round of infrastructure auctions that may include licenses to operate airports, railroads and highways"", said Hans Lin, head of investment banking in Brazil at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The approval of pension reform by Congress is expected to unlock strategic moves by Brazilian companies that were waiting for a clearer outlook for the economy.
""We expect private M&A activity to rise more sharply next year, as the transactions take around nine months between initial talks and announcements,"" said Eduardo Miras, head of investment banking in Brazil at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). Citi is leading the M&A advisory ranking so far this year with five deals announced, totaling $10.2 billion.
One of the few recent private deals announced is the proposed merger between food processors BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) and Marfrig Global Foods SA (SA:MRFG3). Miras expects more deals on the power industry in the second half.
Alessandro Zema, country head of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Brazil and also head of its investment banking unit, also noticed more activity in private mandates recently, and expects new deals in retail, following recent acquisitions of e-commerce Netshoes and appliance retailer  Via Varejo SA  (SA:VVAR3).
""Industries more directly affected by the recession, such as retail and consumer products, also had lower M&A activity,"" Zema said. ""We believe this is going to change with a better outlook for the economy.""
Zema also pointed out that some Brazilian companies in good shape are looking for targets outside the country as a way to balance risks. Last month, Natura Cosmeticos SA (SA:NATU3) acquired  Avon Products  Inc. (N:AVP).
Another driver for future M&A activity is the fast growth of start-ups in the country, which has become a main target of investors such as Japan's Softbank (T:9434). Softbank has raised a $5 billion fund for Latin America.
EQUITIES
Much of the growth in share offerings' volume was led by state-controlled banks Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil, which sold their stakes in Petrobras and power company Neoenergia SA , respectively. Caixa also sold a stake in the reinsurer  IRB Brasil Resseguros  SA (SA:IRBR3), owned by a fund managed by the bank.
Many follow-ons in the pipeline for the coming months also involve divestments by the government or state-owned companies, totaling at least 30 billion reais. This list includes follow-ons by Banco do Brasil, Alupar Investimento SA (SA:ALUP11), Petrobras Distribuidora SA (SA:BRDT3) and IRB, besides an IPO by insurance company Caixa Seguridade.
Despite high volumes in share offerings, only two companies dared an initial public offering so far: sporting goods retailer Centauro and Neoenergia SA.
""IPO´s market would resume on a relevant scale once foreign equity investors massively return to Brazil,"" said Cristiano Guimaraes, Itau BBA's managing director. ""Their return will largely depend on the approval of a significant pension reform.""

Labor, Inflation, Powell Testimony in Spotlight
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be in the spotlight again Thursday, after hinting on Wednesday the central bank likely will roll out rate cuts at its next meeting later this month.
Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee.
On the economic data front, inflation and jobless claims data will be in the spotlight. Both reports are due at 8.30 am ET.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 6. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims to decline to 220,000 from 221,000 previously.
Inflation will take on added attention as a slower pace of price increases may reignite investor expectations for more aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.
Economists expect the core consumer price index  rose 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in May.
Delta Kicks Off Earnings for Airlines
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is set to report earnings before the market open Thursday, with investors anticipating good second-quarter results from the airline amid soaring demand for air travel.
Delta is expected to benefit from the customer spillover from competitors and partners who have been affected by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, said Cowen & Co.
Ahead of the results, the airline last week said it expected revenue per available seat mile would be at the upper end of its previous range, up around 3.5% for the quarter.
Delta is forecast to report earnings of $2.24 a share on revenue of $12.46 billion, according to estimates from Investing.com. Earnings would be up nearly 25% from a year ago with revenue up 5.6%. The shares are up 19.2% this year.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 07:56PM ET</span>","Ryanair says Boeing eyes MAX flights by October, cites 2020 growth risk","By Tim Hepher
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The boss of Europe's Ryanair Holdings (I:RYA) warned on Wednesday the impact of the prolonged grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX on the airline's growth plans may start to spill over to next summer if the airplane is not flying again by November.
Europe's largest budget carrier needs up to eight months to take delivery of some 50 newly built planes left at the factory by the grounding crisis, so it may have to trim its capacity growth plans for summer 2020 if 737 MAX flights have not resumed by November, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters.
""Boeing are telling us at the moment they expect to be back flying by the end of September,"" O'Leary said in an interview on the sidelines of a meeting of the European airlines lobby A4E, which he also chairs.
""I think it will fly before the end of this year. I am not sure they will meet the end of September date, but I take comfort from the fact that it seems that now the American, European, Brazilian and Canadian regulators are working together,"" he added.
In May, O'Leary predicted a return to service by July but the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has since reported a new potential safety risk that it says must be addressed first.
""We are continuing to engage with global regulators and providing information to them as we work towards the safe return to service for the MAX,"" a Boeing spokesman said by email.
Boeing's top-selling jet was grounded in March in the wake of crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia which killed 346 people. The planemaker is working on a software fix that people familiar with the matter have said Boeing hopes to present to regulators in September.
""The challenge for us is that we need to see the plane back flying by the end of September, October, November at the latest, so as not to disrupt our growth for the summer of 2020,"" O'Leary said.
Ryanair can take delivery of no more than six to eight planes a month because of the complexity of the delivery process and the availability of trained MAX pilots. 
""PRESSURE"" ON BOEING AFTER IAG DEAL
O'Leary also responded to a surprise move by British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) to buy 200 MAX jets at what analysts say must have been very attractive prices as the grounding drags on.
He described the preliminary order, which gave the 737 MAX a boost at last month's Paris Airshow, as a ""great move"" by IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh, even though at this stage the deal is only a letter of intent (LOI).
""Let's see what happens with that. I suspect it certainly puts more pressure on Airbus. And we, as a result of IAG’s LOI, are putting much more pressure on Boeing.""
Ryanair benefits from a clause in its contract guaranteeing it lower prices than its competitors, echoing a similar arrangement for Southwest in the United States, analysts say.
Asked whether Ryanair could take advantage of the IAG deal to expand its order for 135 MAX on even better terms, O'Leary said any new deal would be unlikely during the grounding but could be up for discussion once the jet was back in service.
""You could do that in September or October this year when the aircraft is back flying. We will stick close to Boeing on it and we are also talking to Airbus about the possibility of aircraft for Laudamotion.""
O'Leary told Reuters in March, shortly before the second crash that triggered a worldwide grounding of the 737 MAX 8 and 9 models, that Ryanair was interested in Boeing's larger 737 MAX 10 ""at the right price"" as well as at least 100 Airbus (PA:AIR) A321 for recently acquired Austrian unit Laudamotion.

O'Leary said in May Ryanair was also talking to Boeing about compensation for the grounding, but that it had to be determined whether this would be paid in cash or as lower aircraft prices.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 07:54PM ET</span>",Thailand's cooling car sales may shift economy into lower gear,"By Orathai Sriring and Satawasin Staporncharnchai
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Efforts by Thailand's central bank to talk down a spike in auto loans amid wider concerns about household debt have sent a chill across the country's car dealers, which are struggling to source finance for new customers.
Although the Bank of Thailand (BOT) has taken no policy action yet, analysts say the mere prospect of car loan curbs has been enough to tighten the finance spigot to domestic buyers.
While that may take some of the heat out of auto finance, the sudden deceleration threatens car makers, dealers and the wider sector, which has been one of few growth drivers against a backdrop of declining exports and sluggish investment.
""Our car sales in April and May fell by 50%,"" said Sumete Patchuttorn, managing director of Mazda Mahachai.
""Finance firms are more cautious about lending now,"" he said, adding that about 60%-70% of his clients' loan requests were rejected this year, up from 30% in the previous year. More than 80% of car buyers rely on loans.
The car industry accounts for about a tenth of gross domestic product in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy. Bank of Ayudhya said car sales contributed 0.4 percentage point to last year's 4.1% economic growth. 
(GRAPHIC - Thailand's domestic car sales & car exports: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YqH4NU) 
Although roughly half the cars are made for export, that part of the sector has also been declining.
""A slowdown in car sales this year will also drag down consumption,"" said Naris Sathapholdeja, head of TMB Analytics, adding car sales contributed a fifth to last year's 4.6% growth in consumption. He sees GDP growth of 3% this year, with consumption up 3.5%. 
Worried that car loans were driving household debt to one of the highest levels in Asia - at about 80% of GDP - the central bank said in April it had started monitoring car loans and considering loan standards since the beginning of the year.
Of particular concern for the central bank is the fact that car loans have the highest delinquency rate among consumer debt products, with 6.9% of them between one- and three-months overdue at the end of March. 
Analysts said possible central bank curbs could include debt service ratios for borrowers or downpayments required on car purchases.
Those possibilities alone were enough to knock annual car sales growth from nearly 20% in 2018, its fastest since 2012, to 3.7% year-on-year in May, its slowest since May 2017.
In turn, on-year growth in auto loan volumes has slowed to 11.4% in the first quarter from 12.6% in 2018, the fastest in six years. 
(GRAPHIC - Thailand's household debt vs regional peers: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Gii44D) 
The research unit of Kasikornbank said car sales might contract as much as 6% this year if the BOT required a downpayment of 25% on car purchases. 
The Federation of Thai Industries expects car sales to rise just 2.4%, said Surapong Paisitpattanapong, spokesman of the FTI's automotive industry division.
""The market has been stagnant this year,"" said Phanumast Rungkakulnuwat, chief executive officer of Autocorp Holding, which sells Honda cars (T:7267). Last year its sales grew 10%. 
The BOT predicts GDP growth of just 3.3% this year. Thailand has lagged regional peers for years and is forecast to grow more slowly than any country in Southeast Asia except Singapore.

(Reuters) - The family of the former owners of a Cuban bank seized by Fidel Castro's government nearly six decades ago sued  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) for approximately $792 million, saying the French bank owes damages for circumventing U.S. sanctions against Cuba.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Miami, 14 grandchildren of Carlos and Pura Nuñez, who once owned Banco Nuñez, want to hold Societe Generale liable under U.S. law for doing business with Cuba's central bank, which nationalized Banco Nuñez and other lenders in 1960.
A lawyer for the plaintiffs said he believed the case was the first against a bank that allegedly ""trafficked"" in property expropriated by the Castro regime, since the Trump administration said in April it would begin letting U.S. nationals sue companies for such conduct.
""Victims of the Cuban regime who had their property confiscated now have a vehicle to get justice,"" Javier Lopez, the lawyer, said in an interview. ""We have multiple financial institutions that we're looking to target.""
Societe Generale did not immediately respond to requests for comment after market hours.
The lawsuit was filed eight months after Societe Generale agreed to pay $1.34 billion and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to settle U.S. and New York regulatory charges that it handled billions of dollars of transactions related to Cuba and other countries under U.S. sanctions.
According to the plaintiffs, Societe Generale generated hundreds of millions of dollars of fees by lending money to and processing transactions for Banco Nacional de Cuba from 2000 to 2010.
The plaintiffs said they own a claim to 10.5% of the equity in Banco Nacional de Cuba, roughly the percentage that Banco Nuñez represented when it was seized.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs at Kozyak Tropin & Throckmorton based the $792 million damages estimate on Banco Nuñez's $7.8 million worth at the time, plus 6% annual interest and triple damages under the Helms-Burton Act, a 1996 federal law.
The right to sue under that law had been suspended for 23 years because of opposition from the international community and concern that U.S. courts could be overrun by lawsuits.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the lifting of that suspension in April, to boost pressure on Havana to end Cuban support for Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 05:56PM ET</span>",Brazil retailer Via Varejo shares soar following change of control,"By Paula Laier
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shares in Brazilian electronics retailer Via Varejo (SA:VVAR3) have soared more than 30% this month with investors betting on the industry experience of the Klein family, which recently re-acquired control of the company.
Michael Klein and his family boosted their stake in Via Varejo to 27% last month in an auction, resulting in Klein, whose father had founded appliance retailer brand Casas Bahias in the 1950s, being elected as chairman of the board.
The family sold its ownership of that company to retailer GPA SA (SA:PCAR4) in 2009 and it became part of Via Varejo. GPA had struggled to find a buyer for the money-losing company for two years.
Via Varejo shares closed at 6.73 reais on Wednesday, down 0.3% but still up 35% since Klein was elected chairman on June 26. The shares have also gained a third over the last month, making them the top gainers on Brazil's Bovespa index.
""What is happening is a result of Klein,"" said fund manager André Lion at Ibiuna Investimentos, a Via Varejo shareholder.
""With the changes he is making, the appointment of people who know the retail sector and are completely dedicated to the company, it is reasonable to predict the company will improve a lot.""
Last week, Joao Luiz Braga, a partner at XP Asset Management, Brazil's largest retail brokerage, told a crowd of 8,000 investors, managers and clients that Via Varejo was the largest position in most of its funds, while acknowledging risks related to the execution of the turnaround.
Some investors also said they expected Brazilian interest rate cuts to help spur consumer demand and benefit Via Varejo and other retailers. The central bank's weekly FOCUS survey of economists is predicting the benchmark Selic interest rate to be cut from 6.5% currently to 5.5% by the end of the year.
But fund manager Werner Roger, founding partner of Trigono Capital, said he saw no fundamental changes despite Via Varejo's hiring of a high-profile executive from online retailer Magazine Luiza SA (SA:MGLU3).
In a note, analysts at investment bank BTG Pactual acknowledged the experience of incoming executives but cited risks and competition in the sector.
""Considering the risks of execution, we prefer to stay out of the way when it comes to Via Varejo, maintaining our 'neutral' rating until we see clearer signs of the operation recovering,"" the note said."
804,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 05:41PM ET</span>","Privatization to dominate capital markets, M&A in Brazil this year","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The sale of state-owned assets is expected to drive M&A transactions and share offerings volume in Brazil in the second half of the year, bankers and investors said, after a slower-than-expected first half.
As court injunctions delayed asset sales by oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) and discussion of pension reform dragged on in Congress, the volume of mergers and acquisitions in the first half of the year fell 19% to $20.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
But state-controlled companies faced less hurdles to selling stakes in companies already listed, and the volume of share offerings rose 45% in the first half to 8.6 billion reais ($2.25 billion). It was the best first half of the year since 2013.
After Brazil's Supreme Court finally cleared the way for Brazil's largest deal this year, the sale by Petrobras of gas pipeline network TAG to France's Engie SA (PA:ENGIE) for $8.6 billion, banks expect the volume of privatization-related M&A to grow. The next one on the block is fuel distribution unit  Petrobras Distribuidora  SA (SA:BRDT3), which will be privatized through a share offering by the end of the month.
""We are expecting a new round of infrastructure auctions that may include licenses to operate airports, railroads and highways"", said Hans Lin, head of investment banking in Brazil at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The approval of pension reform by Congress is expected to unlock strategic moves by Brazilian companies that were waiting for a clearer outlook for the economy.
""We expect private M&A activity to rise more sharply next year, as the transactions take around nine months between initial talks and announcements,"" said Eduardo Miras, head of investment banking in Brazil at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). Citi is leading the M&A advisory ranking so far this year with five deals announced, totaling $10.2 billion.
One of the few recent private deals announced is the proposed merger between food processors BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) and Marfrig Global Foods SA (SA:MRFG3). Miras expects more deals on the power industry in the second half.
Alessandro Zema, country head of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Brazil and also head of its investment banking unit, also noticed more activity in private mandates recently, and expects new deals in retail, following recent acquisitions of e-commerce Netshoes and appliance retailer  Via Varejo SA  (SA:VVAR3).
""Industries more directly affected by the recession, such as retail and consumer products, also had lower M&A activity,"" Zema said. ""We believe this is going to change with a better outlook for the economy.""
Zema also pointed out that some Brazilian companies in good shape are looking for targets outside the country as a way to balance risks. Last month, Natura Cosmeticos SA (SA:NATU3) acquired  Avon Products  Inc. (N:AVP).
Another driver for future M&A activity is the fast growth of start-ups in the country, which has become a main target of investors such as Japan's Softbank (T:9434). Softbank has raised a $5 billion fund for Latin America.
EQUITIES
Much of the growth in share offerings' volume was led by state-controlled banks Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil, which sold their stakes in Petrobras and power company Neoenergia SA , respectively. Caixa also sold a stake in the reinsurer  IRB Brasil Resseguros  SA (SA:IRBR3), owned by a fund managed by the bank.
Many follow-ons in the pipeline for the coming months also involve divestments by the government or state-owned companies, totaling at least 30 billion reais. This list includes follow-ons by Banco do Brasil, Alupar Investimento SA (SA:ALUP11), Petrobras Distribuidora SA (SA:BRDT3) and IRB, besides an IPO by insurance company Caixa Seguridade.
Despite high volumes in share offerings, only two companies dared an initial public offering so far: sporting goods retailer Centauro and Neoenergia SA.
""IPO´s market would resume on a relevant scale once foreign equity investors massively return to Brazil,"" said Cristiano Guimaraes, Itau BBA's managing director. ""Their return will largely depend on the approval of a significant pension reform.""

Labor, Inflation, Powell Testimony in Spotlight
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be in the spotlight again Thursday, after hinting on Wednesday the central bank likely will roll out rate cuts at its next meeting later this month.
Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee.
On the economic data front, inflation and jobless claims data will be in the spotlight. Both reports are due at 8.30 am ET.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended July 6. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims to decline to 220,000 from 221,000 previously.
Inflation will take on added attention as a slower pace of price increases may reignite investor expectations for more aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.
Economists expect the core consumer price index  rose 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in May.
Delta Kicks Off Earnings for Airlines
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is set to report earnings before the market open Thursday, with investors anticipating good second-quarter results from the airline amid soaring demand for air travel.
Delta is expected to benefit from the customer spillover from competitors and partners who have been affected by the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, said Cowen & Co.
Ahead of the results, the airline last week said it expected revenue per available seat mile would be at the upper end of its previous range, up around 3.5% for the quarter.
Delta is forecast to report earnings of $2.24 a share on revenue of $12.46 billion, according to estimates from Investing.com. Earnings would be up nearly 25% from a year ago with revenue up 5.6%. The shares are up 19.2% this year.
United Airlines parent United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and   American Airlines Group   (NASDAQ:AAL) are due to report earnings in the coming weeks.
OPEC Monthly Report
Following Wednesday's oil-price surge on a bullish inventory report from the Energy Information Agency, traders will look to a monthly OPEC report on key developments shaping oil markets, including world oil demand and supply as well as the oil market balance.
Many fear the slowing pace of global growth may dent demand and force a surplus in world crude supplies, pressuring oil prices.

808,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",VW Says Goodbye to Beetle at Mexico Plant Making Room for SUV,"(Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s “Love Bug” has been squashed by the SUV boom.
The German automaker marked the end of production of the iconic Beetle at its plant in Puebla, Mexico, on Wednesday and wasted no time talking about what will take its place: a compact sport utility vehicle likely to be called Tarek. It’ll be a beefed-up version of a model sold in China named Tharu.
“We’ll adapt the Chinese model for this market,” Steffen Reiche, chief executive officer of VW’s Mexico business, said during an event at the Puebla plant. “Our version will be the stronger one, the rougher one compared to the Chinese one.”
Demand for the Beetle and other hatchbacks has been crushed by years of low gasoline prices and the American consumer’s appetite shifting toward SUVs and pickups. Trucks have been capturing record share of the U.S. market, prompting automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. to drop many of the passenger car models from their lineups.
Production of VW’s new compact SUV will begin at Puebla in 2020, with the model reaching U.S. dealerships in 2021.
VW announced the plans about a month after Mexico became the first country to ratify the overhauled North American free-trade deal known as the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA. The accord requires that 75% of vehicle content be sourced from North America to cross borders tariff-free.
The rules represent a “big challenge” for VW, whose regional content is now at 64%, Reiche said.
VW’s Puebla plant also builds the Jetta sedan and Tiguan SUV. Reiche said the very last edition of the Beetle will be sold online through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)."
809,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Hits Highs as Powell Hints Rate Cut Is Ahead,"Investing.com – Stocks rallied Wednesday and hit new highs after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured lawmakers the central bank will do what it can to sustain the economic expansion.
The Fed will ""act as appropriate,"" Powell told the House Financial Service Committee in the first of two days of testimony about the state of the economy. It is a phrase he has used often in the last few months because he and the Fed are worried about the domestic economy and slowing business investment, trade disputes and other issues affecting global economic health. 
But it was music to investors' ears. The NASDAQ Composite surged 0.75%, hitting new closing and intraday highs. The S&P 500 jumped at the open, briefly topping 3,300 for the first time before dropping back to a 0.45% gain and just under its July 3 close of 2,995.82 The Dow Jones industrials added 0.3%, also reaching a new intraday high of 26,983, up 200 points from the day before. But then the blue chips slid back.
The stock rally was accompanied by a 4.5% jump in oil prices, which was partly due to worries that storms in the Gulf of Mexico will shut down offshore production wells. The Gulf produces about 17% of U.S. crude oil. West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark U.S. oil, finished up $2.60 to $60.43 a barrel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, added $2.85 to $67.01. WTI is up 33% this year, while Brent is up nearly 25%. 
Gold, meanwhile, moved solidly above $1,400 an ounce, finishing at $1,212.50 an ounce, and palladium shot up toward $1,600 an ounce.
But the big question of the day was if the Fed believes it needs to cut interest rates. And Powell offered many reasons that seemed to suggest a rate cut is coming at its July 30-31 meeting. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitoring tool suggests the Fed will cut its key federal funds rate to 2%-2.25% from 2.25-2.5%. And maybe another rate cut in the fall.
Rates have been coming down as global economic worries -- most prominently the U.S.-China trade dispute and tensions in the Middle East -- grabbed investor attention. But Wednesday, longer term rates were higher. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up to 2.07% from 2.06% as investors shed bonds for stocks. The 10-year yield is still off 23% this year.
The market was led by energy stocks, thanks to the boost in oil prices.   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) was the Dow leader with a 1.7% gain.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) added 1.4%.
Communications services, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also were market leaders, along with tech stocks. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were all up 1%. 
After hours, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) rose 3.5% after earnings beat estimates. 
Winners and losers in the S&P 500
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), data-storage company  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) and healthcare technology manufacturer  Align Technology  (NASDAQ:ALGN) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day.
 Hanesbrands  (NYSE:HBI), life-insurance company  Unum Group  (NYSE:UNM) and equipment distributor WW Grainger (NYSE:GWW) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers. "

The Montreal-based plane and train maker said in a statement that two existing contracts in the province are slated to wind down and the plant has no new trains to build. 
Discussions in the spring between Bombardier and the Ontario government for a C$28 billion ($21.42 billion) provincial transit expansion plan are ongoing, said a statement from Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, which represents workers at the Bombardier plant in Thunder Bay. 
While the talks have generated some hopes of saving the plant, they have not yet resulted in any firm orders.
Bombardier has been winning work and expanding its rail car manufacturing in the United States, including the June announcement of a new facility in California that will assemble rail cars for San Francisco's rapid transit system by year-end. 
Rail passenger car companies awarded federally funded contracts for rolling stock in the United States will be required to complete 70% of the order with American content next year, putting pressure on manufacturers to build in the country. 
By contrast, a provincial rule in Ontario requires rolling stock orders to have only 25% Canadian content.
""When you compare that to the American content, it's not enough,"" said Dominic Pasqualino, president of the union local which represents workers at the Bombardier plant.
""I've got a parking lot full of vehicles now. And each car represents a family,"" he said by phone.
Ontario transportation agency Metrolinx, which expects to complete its order for 291 Bombardier bi-level commuter coaches in February 2020, began ""discussions with Bombardier some time ago to order more coaches,"" the agency's chief executive, Phil Verster, said in an emailed statement.

News of the layoffs were first reported by Canadian Press on Tuesday, citing a government source.

811,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 04:11PM ET</span>","Hot tech sector, Wall Street drive record Manhattan leasing","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A boom on Wall Street and a thriving technology sector have pushed the unemployment rate in Manhattan to record lows and propelled office leasing activity to its best first six months of a year in a quarter century, brokerage data shows.
The new leasing of office space rose to 18.3 million square feet in the first six months of 2019, the first time since 1994 at the mid-year point total leases exceeded 18 million square feet, according to data from Cushman & Wakefield.
New leasing activity jumped 21.5% in the second quarter from the year-earlier period to 10.0 million square feet.
Venture capital is pouring into Manhattan, lifting rents in the chic Flatiron section and other areas of the city and driving start-ups into a Garment district increasingly awash in fast-casual dining options, said Zach Aarons, co-founder and partner at venture capital firm MetaProp. 
""More tech firms are coming into this neighborhood in what seems like every single week,"" said Aarons, whose firm in May launched its third ""proptech"" fund that hopes to raise $100 million, according to regulatory filings.
""There's certainly more venture capital than ever before coming into this space, more strategic capital,"" he said.
Technology firms with a presence in Manhattan are expanding.  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) is negotiating 1 million square feet or more in the new Hudson Yards district on the city's far West Side, Crain's New York Business reported two weeks ago.
Companies are on the move as the city's biggest construction boom in decades has spurred relocations to the Hudson Yards and $100 million office tower makeovers on Avenue of the Americas and elsewhere in the city attract new tenants.
""It's almost like a chess game,"" said Richard Persichetti, lead researcher for greater New York City at brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Plc (N:CWK), referring to how leasing activity occurs.
""Because of new supply you've seen a flight to new development. But we've also seen a flight to better quality,"" he said.
New construction and renovated office space already built or planned will add about 45 million square feet of office space in Manhattan in the decade ending 2023, Cushman estimates. 
When a tenant moves out it draws interest from others, with buildings that are better managed with greater amenities benefiting from the migration, Persichetti said. 
Deals involving large spaces drove leasing, a sign of corporate migration as leases of 100,000 square feet or larger accounted for 37.4% of activity in the first six months, with 13 large leases signed in the second quarter, Cushman's data shows.
The growth in leasing activity is noteworthy because companies are utilizing less space as office densification continues and actual usage declines as a workforce that is connected to mobile devices requires less time at the office.
Manhattan is booming as the U.S. economy enters its 11th year of expansion and non-seasonally adjusted unemployment on the island slid to a record low of 3.3% in April, according to New York State's Department of Labor.
Professional and business services added 16,400 jobs in the 12 months ended May, Labor Department data shows, while investment banking and brokerage hiring added 1,500 jobs. 

The new supply has pressured vacancy rates and helped lift the subletting of space to a nine-year high of 8.7 million square feet, or about one-fifth of total available space. It is the highest subletting percentage since 2010, Cushman said.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 03:51PM ET</span>",U.S. money market assets increased in latest week: iMoneyNet,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. money market fund assets rose to their highest level since late 2009, as investors poured more cash into these low-risk accounts even while major Wall Street indexes reached record peaks on hopes for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, a private report released on Wednesday showed.
Total money fund assets jumped $41.12 billion to $3.234 trillion in the week ended July 9, a level not seen since Dec. 22, 2009, the Money Fund Report said on Wednesday.
Total fund assets have grown for 11 consecutive weeks, increasing by about $224 billion during the current stretch.
For some cautious investors, earning about a 2% yield with almost no risk has been more compelling than buying more junk bonds and stocks, which have produced the double-digit total returns in the first half of 2019.
The average yield on taxable money funds is comparable to the yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR).
A softening global economy and trade conflicts have stoked the inflows into money funds, analysts said.
""It's the fear. It's a conservative way to deal with risks out there,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. 
Taxable money market fund assets increased by $39.58 billion to $3.095 trillion, the highest level since Aug. 11, 2009, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
Tax-free money fund assets rose by $1.54 billion to $139.40 billion. 
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds rose to 2.02% from 2.00% the week before. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds was unchanged at 29 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds dropped to 1.15% from 1.43%, which was its highest since early May. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds shortened by one day to 28 days.

The company increased deliveries by 51.1% to 95,200 cars during the three months ending June 30, compared with the first quarter, beating its previous record of 90,700 deliveries set in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The all-important Model 3, the company’s biggest seller, saw deliveries of 77,550 during the quarter, topping analysts’ estimates of 74,100, with some on Wall Street hailing the update as a step in the right direction for the electric automaker.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is down about 29% for the year so far, after its shares nosedived on the back string of negative analysts’ comments following a weak first quarter. 
Tesla is a stock that lately has defined volatility. It was up as much as 81% for the year when it peaked at $387 in June 2017. It's off nearly 39% since. But the stock appeared to bottom on June 3 at $176.99 and has risen about 33% from that low."

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The government of Colombian President Ivan Duque is finalizing a plan to sell off public stakes in low-profit companies, expecting to generate more than $1.9 billion a year for more lucrative investments, a finance ministry official told Reuters.
Different state entities in Colombia, from large government ministries to small state agencies, own stakes collectively worth some $25 billion in more than 100 companies, both public and privately-owned, according to a finance ministry document.
But Cesar Arias, the ministry's director of public credit, said many of the investments deliver tiny yields and the funds invested in them could be harnessed to bolster strategic sectors such as infrastructure, clean energy, education and health care.
""The idea isn't to use those resources to finance current account spending by the state, but rather to use them for more profitable investments,"" Arias said in an interview Tuesday.
""It's a strategy that seeks to secure resources needed to maintain public investment at optimal levels,"" he said.
The state, however, will only be able to disinvest in companies when its stake is less than 49 percent, according to a draft decree that adheres to guidelines approved by Congress.
That means large companies such as state-owned oil company EcoPetrol SA (CN:ECO) and electricity, telecomms and infrastructure company ISA (CN:ISA) will be off limits.
This year alone, the government expects to receive 6 billion pesos ($1.86 billion) from the plan. ""That doesn't mean every year will be like that. There will be years with more operations and years with less,"" Arias said.
But on average, Arias said the state should be able to free up funds equal to 0.6 to 0.7% of gross domestic product per year, or about $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion.
The finance ministry will receive feedback on the draft decree - published on its website July 4 - in coming days before passing it. In the meantime, it is analyzing which stakes the state should offload first and where to direct the funds from selling them.
Arias said it was too early to identify companies the government would like to invest in, but added that details would be included in the proposed budget for 2020 that the government will send to Congress in coming weeks.
""There are sectors that are very obvious - education, health, infrastructure...public works for regions, clean and renewable energy,"" Arias said. ""All those sectors that are flagship priorities for his administration, that's where the resources will go."""
815,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 02:29PM ET</span>",Europe should brace for U.S. tariffs on several fronts: German official,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European Union member states should brace for U.S. tariffs on several fronts in the coming months, a senior German official said late on Tuesday, following meetings with U.S. officials and lawmakers in Washington.
Peter Beyer, a German lawmaker and Germany's transatlantic coordinator, said there was continued U.S. interest in dialogue with Europe, but the Trump administration appeared poised to impose tariffs over disputes about aircraft subsidies, the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline and European car imports.
President Donald Trump said in May some imported vehicles and parts posed a national security threat https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-tariffs-usa/trump-declares-some-auto-imports-pose-national-security-threat-idUSKCN1SN1FY, but postponed a decision for as long as six months on imposing tariffs on European and Japanese auto imports to allow time for trade talks with both partners. 
European officials fear that Trump will now turn his attention to Europe, after brokering a truce in a protracted trade battle with China. 
""These are difficult discussions in a difficult international environment,"" Germany Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said after a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington.
He said the exchange with Mnuchin was ""productive and constructive,"" focusing on reducing global tensions, easing trade disputes and keeping jobs in both countries.
Beyer, who met with officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's office and the White House, as well as U.S. lawmakers, said the car tariffs were likely in mid-November, given growing U.S. impatience with the European Union and its refusal to include agriculture in broader trade talks.
""When it comes to the car tariffs, I unfortunately think they are more likely than not to be imposed in mid-November. There is quite a lot of impatience on the U.S. side. But that also requires us on the European side to be strong and unified.""
Beyer said the U.S. government appeared interested in resolving disputes between the United States and the EU before the World Trade Organization (WTO) over aircraft subsidies, but was unlikely to refrain from imposing tariffs in the interim.
""The WTO arbitrator decision is expected soon, as early as next week. I fully expect the Trump administration to impose tariffs. The U.S. side feels entitled to impose the tariffs and I believe they will, in any case,"" he said.
The WTO has found that both U.S.-based Boeing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-aircraft-wto/wto-says-us-failed-to-halt-state-tax-subsidy-for-boeing-idUSKCN1R923B (N:BA) and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), the world's two largest planemakers, have received billions of dollars of harmful or illegal government subsidies https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-aircraft-wto/wto-says-us-failed-to-halt-state-tax-subsidy-for-boeing-idUSKCN1R923B to gain advantage in the global jet business. 
The United States and EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs, with Washington first in line to seek tariffs under the WTO timetable.
The WTO arbitrator is due to decide how much of the $11.2 billion in tariffs proposed by Washington can be applied.
Altmaier said he would discuss efforts to settle the dispute with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday, adding, ""In our view it is in the interest of both sides to avoid these tit-for-tit tariffs,"" he told reporters.
The EU this month said it was open to talks with Washington in the dispute, but no formal talks have begun, according to sources familiar with the issue.
Beyer said he told U.S. officials that he did not view imposing tariffs ahead of any such settlement talks ""as a great way to build confidence in that process.""
European companies could also face sanctions as early as August or September over U.S. objections about Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gazprom-nordstream-usa/trump-considering-sanctions-over-russias-nord-stream-2-natgas-pipeline-idUSKCN1TD267, Beyer said. 
The 760-mile (1,225-km) pipeline project to ship gas from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany has drawn U.S. objections on security grounds and divided the European Union.
Nord Stream 2 is led by Russian state gas producer Gazprom (MM:GAZP), with 50% of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper (DE:UN01) and BASF's (DE:BASFn) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell (L:RDSa), Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV) and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE).
U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in May said a sanctions bill https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gazprom-nordstream-usa/trump-considering-sanctions-over-russias-nord-stream-2-natgas-pipeline-idUSKCN1TD267 putting onerous restrictions on companies involved in the project would come in the ""not too distant future."" Washington fears the pipeline will increase the European Union's reliance on Russian gas.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 02:08PM ET</span>",Europe airlines brace for another summer of air traffic delays,"By Tim Hepher and Conor Humphries
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The heads of some of Europe's largest airlines hit back on Wednesday against efforts to discourage Europeans from flying, arguing the industry was making huge strides in cutting its carbon footprint and that there was no shame in air travel. 
The share prices of Europe's largest airlines fell this week when France announced a tax on air travel, the latest move by an EU government to discourage flying, which activists say is a major contributor to climate change.
""We are sensitive to the criticism that we are getting a free ride on the environment because frankly it is not true,"" Ryanair (I:RYA) chief executive Michael O'Leary told a press conference in Brussels. 
""We have a very good case to push back against these NGOs like the flight shame movement because actually this is an industry that is performing remarkably well and meeting its obligations towards a greener, cleaner planet,"" he said. 
O'Leary was speaking as chairman of lobby group A4E (Airlines for Europe), which includes the continent's largest airline groups, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG). 
The group argues that aviation has roughly halved the carbon footprint per flight over the past three decades and is spending billions of euros in more fuel efficient aircraft and investing in less damaging aviation fuel technologies. 
O'Leary said his airline paid over 500 million euros of environmental taxes on a fuel bill of 2 billion euros last year, equivalent to around 4 euros per passenger. 
""We are paying on behalf of our customers a penal level of aviation taxes and these taxes are continuing to rise,"" he said. 
The industry's image has been damaged in recent months by the rise of the Swedish-born anti-flying movement and the concept of ""flight shame.""
Commercial flying accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions today but without concrete steps, that number will rise as global air travel increases.
The aviation industry has set out a four-pronged plan to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and halve net emissions from 2005 levels by 2050.
But airline leaders acknowledge they have struggled to articulate their plans in a way that resonates with the public.
""I am not ashamed to be in this industry,"" said IAG chief executive Willie Walsh at the same briefing. ""This is an industry that has a good story to tell, we just need people who are prepared to listen to understand the facts."" 
Walsh, who like O'Leary is from Ireland, said people living on islands and in countries at the periphery of Europe often had no real alternative to flying and that taxes could undermine the competitiveness of these regions. 

A4E is also lobbying for the reform of the continent's air traffic control system, something it says could immediately reduce carbon emissions from the industry in Europe by 10%.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 02:07PM ET</span>","Major grain traders face one-two punch from U.S. floods, trade war","By Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Severe U.S. weather likely dented earnings for large grain companies including Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd for a second straight quarter, adding to headwinds from a still-unresolved U.S.-China trade war, analysts and economists said.
ADM and Bunge, as well as peers Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], known as the ABCD quartet of global grain trading giants, faced processing-plant downtime, rail and barge shipping delays and other supply uncertainty this spring as historic floods ravaged the central United States.
The weather woes are heaping more pain on the battered U.S. agricultural sector already hard-hit by a years-long crop supply glut and the U.S.-China trade war now entering its second year. The tariffs China imposed on soybean exports from the United States in retaliation for U.S. duties on Chinese goods curbed shipments of the most valuable U.S. export crop.
The excessive rains and flooding could also have a lasting impact on the grain merchants, whose latest round of quarterly earnings will start this week. ADM and Cargill are viewed as particularly vulnerable due to their outsized U.S. footprints. Reduced U.S. corn and soybean plantings will likely cut available crop supplies in the United States, potentially driving up raw material costs and squeezing margins.
""They thrive on volumes and margins and both of those are going to be depressed in the coming year with the bushels being smaller and the margins likely not being there,"" said Kevin McNew, chief economist with Farmers Business Network. ""Export business is just going to fall off the cliff, especially for corn.""
The U.S. corn crop was more affected by floods than soybeans, because soy can be planted later in the season.
WEAKER RESULTS
The first of the companies scheduled to report is privately held Cargill, which announces fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.
The results will cover the March-to-May period, when flooding disrupted grain movement, including export shipments, and the year's second ""bomb cyclone"" blizzard temporarily shuttered at least six Cargill grain handling facilities and a beef processing plant.
Cargill and ADM both own barge companies that haul grain and other products on the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Grain barge movement so far this year is down about 37% from a year ago, according to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data, due largely to prolonged river closures triggered by floods.
Cargill is expected to report weaker results compared with the very strong earnings of the year-ago quarter, due partly to expected lower profit in its origination and processing unit, said Bill Densmore, senior director of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings.
Bunge and ADM will follow, with second-quarter results covering April, May and June scheduled for release on July 31 and Aug. 1, respectively. Privately held Louis Dreyfus is expected to issue interim first-half results in the autumn.
Shares of publicly traded ADM and Bunge are hovering just above three-year lows notched this spring as mounting concerns about U.S. plantings and trade fueled investor nervousness.
UNEVEN IMPACTS
With its concentration of assets in the United States and its large U.S. ethanol business, ADM was likely hit harder by adverse U.S. weather than Bunge, analysts said.
ADM cited poor U.S. weather for a nearly $60 million drop in operating profit in its first quarter and warned in April that lingering weather impacts would cut second-quarter earnings by $20 million to $30 million. Some analysts expect ADM to post as large a hit to second-quarter earnings as in the first quarter as adverse weather stretched through the spring season.
""ADM's first-quarter estimate of $50-60 million seems like a good starting point"" for the second-quarter impact, said Seth Goldstein, analyst with Morningstar.
ADM's soy processing, ethanol and sweeteners and starches units may post lower margins, and smaller corn and soybean crops will hurt its grain origination business, said Heather Jones, founder and senior analyst with Heather Jones Research LLC.
The price of corn, the most common feedstock for U.S. ethanol makers, has surged as U.S. farmers struggled to plant the 2019 crop due to a historically soggy spring. Cash corn premiums in parts of the eastern Midwest, where planting delays were most acute, are at a six-year high. Soybean prices hit a one-year top last week.
""Bunge is less exposed, but higher bean costs would squeeze soy crush margins in the U.S.,"" Jones said. Bunge is the world's largest soybean processor."

In June, 12% of buyers faced competition compared with 52% a year earlier, according to an analysis by brokerage Redfin of offers written by its agents. While San Francisco is the most competitive market, the share of listings that got multiple offers fell to 28% from 65%.
Home sales started slipping toward the end of last year after rising mortgage rates put purchases out of reach for many would-be buyers, especially in coastal markets where prices had soared. Borrowing costs have since dropped, bringing out more buyers, but the recovery has been slow to kick in.
San Jose, in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, has seen the country’s most dramatic comedown. Only 6% of offers faced competition in June, half the national rate. A year earlier, it was 74%.
Properties in the area are “staying on the market longer, and more sellers dropping prices than either of the last two years,” Redfin agent Stella Phua said in a statement. “The only homes that are getting multiple offers now are the ones in the best locations, great condition, and priced lower than similar homes in the neighborhood.”

The chairman of the Public Investment Corp. will instead be chosen from members of a 14-strong interim board announced by the finance ministry on Wednesday, which includes union representatives for the first time. The makeup of the board is a temporary arrangement lasting from Friday through July of next year, as a judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of PIC wrongdoing is set to present findings this month.
The new board has its work cut out. The Pretoria-based manager of more than 2 trillion rand ($142 billion) is running several internal probes on key employees and has its third chief executive officer in six months. That’s on top of the ongoing inquiry, which is this week hearing from Daniel Matjila, the ex-CEO accused by several witnesses of approving questionable deals. He denies the allegations.

The previous set of board members offered to resign in early February, saying the PIC had entered a “state of paralysis” following misconduct claims against some directors. They offered to stay on until a new board was appointed.
New directors include Ivan Fredericks, general manager of labor group the Public Servants Association of South Africa. Bloomberg News reported in May that the new board would have an independent chairman and union representation. Another prominent new board member is Maria Ramos, a former director general of the National Treasury and CEO of lender Absa Group Ltd. until earlier this year.
The break from the practice of appointing the deputy finance minister as the PIC chairman is probably an attempt to reduce opportunities for corruption, according to Ralph Mathekga, an analyst and author of books on South African politics.

“When you impose a chairperson of the board it disrupts the normal chain of accountability,” Mathekga said by phone on Wednesday. “Empowering the board to choose its own chairperson is more to indicate to them that they will be in the hot seat if things go wrong.”
At about the time the previous board resigned, the PIC started a forensic investigation into allegations of wrongdoing made by an anonymous whistle-blower against three directors. In the past year, half of the PIC’s executive committee have been suspended or resigned.
In January, a former board member told the commission of inquiry that the money manager would be better off without the deputy finance minister in the role because it inadvertently leads to the perception of political interference.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",American Airlines raises forecast for key revenue measure,"(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc on Wednesday raised its estimate for second-quarter unit revenue as the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's MAX jets left the No. 1 U.S. carrier with fewer aircraft in service, allowing it to fly fuller planes.
The company's shares rose 3% in early trading and also lifted the stocks of other airlines, providing some relief to a sector that has been battered by thousands of flight cancellations and reschedules in the wake of the grounding.
The company, however, said its second-quarter pretax profit would be reduced by about $185 million because it canceled over 7,000 flights in the quarter.
American Airlines, which has already pulled the MAX off its flying schedule through Sept. 3, had in April cut its annual profit forecast, blaming an estimated $350 million hit from the groundings.
The company, which has the second-biggest fleet of MAX aircraft in the United States with 24 jets, now expects unit revenue, a measure that compares sales to flight capacity, to increase between 3% and 4% percent in the quarter ended June, compared with its earlier forecast of a rise of between 1% and 3%. The airline also raised its forecast for quarterly pre-tax margin, excluding certain items, to a range of 8.5% to 9.5%, from 7% to 9%. Analysts have said non-MAX operators such as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) are expected to do much better this year as they would benefit from reduced supply levels in the form of higher load factors and fares. Last week, Delta said its expects its quarterly numbers to be at high end of its previous forecast, helped by ""strong demand"" in the United States. 
Delta will report its second-quarter results on Thursday. American Airlines and smaller rival Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, which is the world's biggest MAX operator with 34 jets, are expected to report results later this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday voted 3-2 to auction a key band of underused 2.5 GHz spectrum to help advance next-generation 5G wireless networks and scrap requirements that it be used for education.
The mid-band spectrum was reserved in the 1960s for what is now known as the Educational Broadband Service. Sprint Corp (N:S) uses leased spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band in its existing 4G network and 5G network that it is being rolled out.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission was taking ""a major step toward freeing up critical mid-band spectrum for 5G. At long last, we remove the burdensome restrictions on this band, allowing incumbents greater flexibility in their use of the spectrum and introduce a spectrum auction that will ensure that this public resource is finally devoted to its highest-valued use.""
Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said the Republican majority was collapsing ""this spectrum into an overlay auction system that structurally advantages a single nationwide carrier.""
She added the ""order turns its back on the schools and educational institutions that have made the 2.5 GHz band their home since 1962... and reverts to uninspired and stale commercial spectrum policy.""
Pai said last year the FCC was seeking to ensure that existing users would retain spectrum, give some entities a chance to obtain new licenses ""and then auctioning off the remaining white spaces.""
Sprint's spectrum is a key part of Sprint and T-Mobile
US Inc's (O:TMUS) proposed $26 billion tie-up and 5G plan.
The U.S. Education Department in a June 7 letter told the FCC it should maintain an ""educational use requirement"" for that spectrum and suggested setting aside revenue from license sales to help students who lack the internet access required to do their homework.
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said the order ""frees the spectrum from the misguided choices of FCCs past"" and relies on ""market forces"" to ""quickly and fully rationalize the spectrum for 5G. This means mid-band for 5G today.""
The U.S. Education Department in a June 7 letter told the
FCC it should maintain an ""educational use requirement"" for that spectrum and suggested setting aside revenue from license sales to help students who lack internet access required to complete homework.
The FCC also voted Wednesday to establish procedures for forthcoming auctions of high-band spectrum, which it said would be the largest-ever U.S. spectrum auction. Bidding is set to start in December."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said on Wednesday it will build a new sport utility vehicle at a $1.6 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama rather than produce Corolla cars.
The largest Japanese automaker announced in January 2018 would build the factory in Alabama with Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261). Toyota, which said the shift was due to ""a growing consumer appetite for light trucks and SUVs,"" still expects to start production in 2021.
Last week, the company said U.S. Corolla sales fell 5% in the first six months to 152,868, while overall Toyota car sales fell 8%. Its U.S. SUV sales only fell 1% over the same period.
In recent years, American vehicle buyers have dramatically shifted away from cars to crossovers, SUVs and pickup trucks.
Still, U.S. auto industry sales have been declining, and there is some concern the new plant could exacerbate overcapacity and pressure vehicle prices. U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2.2% in the first half of 2019.
Toyota will continue to build Corolla cars at its Mississippi plant. Mazda said previously it would build a new SUV at the joint venture plant that will assemble up to 300,000 vehicles annually.
The plant is on a 2,500-acre site about 14 miles from Toyota’s engine plant in Huntsville, Alabama.
Among U.S. states, Alabama is already the fifth largest producer of cars and light trucks. The state has more than 150 major auto suppliers and 57,000 automotive manufacturing jobs.
Early in 2017, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized Toyota and threatened hefty tariffs against the Japanese automaker if it built its Corolla sedan for the U.S. market in Mexico.
Toyota said in October 2017 it would shift production of Corollas from Canada to the new venture rather than Guanajuato, and would build Tacoma pickups in Mexico instead.
Toyota will now rely on its Mississippi plant and Japan for Corolla production, a spokesman said.

Powell said that the ""uncertainties"" around trade policy and sub-target inflation are continuing to weigh on the outlook for the U.S. economy, and he repeated earlier assurances that the Fed would act ""appropriately"" to sustain the current economic expansion, the longest on record.
Powell indicated that the U.S.'s current trade policy had had a negative effect on many of the economies with which the U.S. does business, creating a circular threat to domestic activity.
“Economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy,"" he said. ""Moreover, a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit.”
The remarks cemented expectations for a 25 basis-point cut in the Fed funds rate at the Fed's policy meeting on July 30-31. That would be the first Fed rate cut for a decade.
Semiconductor companies were among the most conspicuous gainers, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 2.0% while Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 1.6%, while Micron (NASDAQ:MU) rose 4.6% and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 1.0%

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shareholders will quiz Chief Executive Christian Sewing on how he plans to deliver on revenue growth targets during a global roadshow to win their backing for a 7.4 billion euro ($8.4 billion) 'reinvention' of the lender.
Shares in Germany's biggest bank were up 1.3% at 1452 GMT on Wednesday, clawing back some of a near 10% fall, the biggest two-day drop in almost three years, since it detailed a sweeping overhaul involving 18,000 job cuts on Sunday.
The revamp also includes the creation of a 'bad bank' to house billions of euros of costly trading positions and relieve pressure on Deutsche Bank's stretched balance sheet.
Some investors told Reuters they doubted these moves, along with scrapping Deutsche Bank's global equities division, would be enough to turn around its flagging fortunes in the face of intense competition and low interest rates.
Hendrik Leber, a fund manager with Acatis, said the effort was five years too late and that the bank had missed the opportunity to return to a pre-eminent position in Europe.
""I wish they would be even more radical,"" he said. ""I wish they would move two steps ahead instead of just one.""
Deutsche Bank said it was targeting an 8% return on tangible equity (ROTE) by 2022 but flagged ""significant uncertainty"" that it would break even in 2020.
Others investors said they were worried Deutsche Bank would backtrack on a pledge not to tap shareholders for additional cash, particularly in view of its capital constraints.
""The revenue growth targets are difficult to believe,"" one fund manager said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""DB hasn't managed to grow revenues for several years now - why that will change after the impact of a big restructuring remains unclear.""
'DIFFERENT THIS TIME'
Deutsche Bank's management is also expected to meet staff rattled by the proposed changes and the sudden departure of colleagues who vacated desks across three continents on Monday.
The bank is quitting its entire presence in some Asian markets but has so far kept the finer details of layoffs in the United States, Germany and other parts of Europe under wraps.
Deutsche Bank was criticized by members of the public and financial sector commentators on social media when upmarket tailors were seen leaving its London offices after a suit fitting with senior managers, on the same day hundreds of staff were fired.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Wednesday.
Sewing on Monday told analysts that while his restructuring plan may sound familiar to those who have followed Deutsche Bank's previous attempts to overhaul its sprawling business, this restructuring was not the same.
""It is different this time. We are different.""
Sewing plans to invest a quarter of his 820,000 euro fixed salary in the bank's shares, which hit a record low last month, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The cost of insuring exposure to Deutsche Bank's debt through 5-year credit defaults swaps (CDS) held flat at 71 basis points (bps) compared with 64 bps at Friday's close, indicative data from IHS Markit showed."

The biggest U.S. bank by assets launched its robo-adviser on Wednesday with a minimum account balance of $2,500 and an annual fee of 0.35%, or 35 basis points, of assets.
You Invest Head Jed Laskowitz said that during the year they spent testing the product with a select group of employees and bank clients, customers frequently said that lack of funds was a major reason they did not invest.
""We wanted to get the minimums to as low as possible,"" said Laskowitz. ""We hope to get to below $1,000 next year.""
The low-cost investment platform matches customers with portfolios of the bank's exchange traded funds (ETFs) based on their risk tolerance and financial priorities. Customers pay an annual fee and receive rebates for any fees associated with the ETFs.
The robo-adviser tool is an offshoot of You Invest, a self-directed investment platform the bank launched 10 months ago.
Laskowitz did not say how many clients or assets You Invest has gathered so far. He said that 90% of its customers are first-time investors and that two-thirds of the assets on the platform are new to the bank."

Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said the U.S. software group had secured a prime position in Oxford Circus, central London, where its three-floor flagship could be seen by about 86 million shoppers and tourists every year.
He said the shop, which is located minutes away from Apple's (O:AAPL) original London store, had been designed for everybody from young gaming fans and students who wanted to polish their LinkedIn profile to small business users of Office and cloud services.
""We really think of our stores as the physical manifestation of our brand,"" he said in an interview.
The store will include a gaming lounge, an augmented reality experience and an area for business technology.
Gaming fans will be able to sit in a real McLaren Senna racing car and play Forza Motorsport 7 using the steering wheel and pedals as a Xbox controller. They will also be able to play upcoming titles like Gears 5 at the site. 
Microsoft will offer 200,000 hours of free workshops to schools, community groups and people who want to gain digital skills in the next 12 months across its stores worldwide, it said. 
Microsoft UK Chief Executive Cindy Rose said the store reinforced the company's commitment to digital skills. 
""We do feel that there's a digital skills shortage in the UK and we've made public commitments around AI apprenticeships and technology apprenticeships exposing children to coding,"" she said in an interview. ""We'd like to expose around 3 million kids to coding by next year."" 
Staff in the store will collectively speak 45 different languages, including three associates who are fluent in British Sign Language. 
""They speak Arabic to Urdu,"" Capossela said. ""So no matter who you are, no matter what walk of life you come from, this is a welcome place for you.""

(Reuters) - Activist research group Anonymous Analytics has turned its attention to the cannabis industry, initiating a buy rating on  Turning Point Brands Inc  (N:TPB) in a report on Wednesday.
The group, which holds shares in Turning Point Brands, called it ""a highly profitable, but woefully under-covered and under-valued company"" with a network of 1.5 million online customers and 155,000 stores.
The company, which sells periphery products including rolling papers, chewing tobacco and vapes, is covered by only two analysts, the group said.
""As its CBD (Cannabidiol) story gains awareness, we expect substantial market interest,"" the report said. ""Investors are thirsty for an established, profitable and non-speculative company in the cannabis space. TPB is it.""
Anonymous Analytics, which describes itself as a ""faction"" of the global Anonymous activist movement, first gained attention earlier this decade by exposing irregularities at several Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies, accusing them of misleading investors, while also selling the stocks short.
The group is part of a broader community of activist investors and research firms that focus on a small number of stocks which includes Muddy Waters' Carson Block and Andrew Left of Citron Research.
Anonymous Analytics has a target price of $118 per share on Turning Point Brands, whose shares closed at $52.02 on Tuesday.
""Most cannabis companies trading at nosebleed valuations are loss-making start-ups that are still trying to build out their distribution infrastructure and compliance,"" its report said.
""TPB already has the distribution, has a profitable core business with a proven management team, and has the regulatory background. If TPB traded at even a fraction of the valuation of other cannabis names, the stock would double overnight.""
The group said the largest CBD pureplay is Charlotte’s Web Holdings (TO:CWEB), which has its products in only 6,000 stores but is valued at $2 billion.
""The cannabis industry is currently in its Wild West phase filled with both excesses and real potential,"" Anonymous Analytics said in an email to Reuters. ""It’s threading that path that’s going to be interesting, and for the most part, we think there will be a lot of companies that blow up. There will also be a few companies like TPB that can capitalize on legalization. We’re gonna be on the lookout for both."""
843,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 09:46AM ET</span>",Workers at Chilean Walmart retailers strike over wages,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - As many as 17,000 workers at Walmart´s largest union in Chile walked off the job early Wednesday morning, demanding better salaries after negotiations over a new labor contract broke down earlier this week, the union's president said.
The strike was expected to shut down more than one-quarter of the approximately 400 stores that Walmart Inc (N:WMT) operates in Chile, some of them under the popular grocery store franchise Lider.
""We haven´t reached an agreement. We did make some advances, but they weren´t enough to seal a deal of the magnitude the company has in mind,"" Juan Moreno, president of Lider´s Inter-Company Union (SIL), said in a statement.
Union leaders said the key sticking point was a salary increase. As automation in stores has increasingly replaced workers, unionized workers demanded the company boost salaries by 4 percent. Walmart Chile has offered 3 percent, Moreno said.
The U.S. retail giant said in a statement late Wednesday night that it had offered a ""robust"" contract offer that addressed key points, including the salary increase, though it did not specify how much the company had offered to raise pay.
The strike would primarily affect stores under the franchise SuperBodega aCuenta, and, to a lesser extent, Express, Lider and Ekono, according to the statement.
The company said it would begin informing customers about alternative shopping venues on Wednesday amid the shutdown."

Since Fed officials met in June, “it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook,” Powell said in prepared remarks to U.S. lawmakers Wednesday. “Inflation pressures remain muted.”
The Fed chief’s semiannual testimony supports the market view that the central bank is preparing to reduce borrowing costs at its July 30-31 meeting, despite a strong June jobs report. His remarks come amid mounting pressure from President Donald Trump to cut rates.
Powell opened his testimony by embracing the central bank’s mandates for maximum employment and stable prices as well as its “independence,” noting that it comes comes with a need for transparency and accountability.
Crosscurrents
He carefully explained the reasons why the policy committee has shifted its views this year, and noted that “crosscurrents have reemerged, creating greater uncertainty.” Despite a current trade war truce with China, Powell continued to stress downside risks to the outlook.
“Uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months,” Powell said in the text of his remarks. “Economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy. Moreover, a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit.”
He noted that policy makers are carefully monitoring developments including the risk that weak readings on inflation could be “even more persistent than we currently anticipate.”
The hearing before the House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. in Washington.
In addition, Powell pointed to a slowdown in business investment, decelerating global growth, and declines in housing investment and manufacturing output.
Investor Expectations
The statement released after the last meeting also cited rising “uncertainties’’ and “muted’’ inflation in its shift toward a rate-cutting bias last month. Some analysts say the case for a cut is intact even after the Trump Administration dialed down its trade war with China and the June employment report showed payroll gains climbed a solid 224,000 last month.
Investors expect a quarter point reduction this month, according to pricing in interest-rate futures contracts. Recent U.S. economic data have been mixed but analysts cite a variety of indicators the Fed could point to supporting a cut. A gross domestic product tracking indicator from the Atlanta Fed suggests second quarter economic growth slowed significantly.
Powell noted that while the labor market remains healthy, gains have been uneven for many Americans, citing unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics that remain well above the rates for whites and Asians. Income inequality has become a rallying cry for Democratic candidates as the 2020 presidential race kicks off.
The Fed chief gave lawmakers a list of troubling economic issues that would be better solved by fiscal policy rather than by the central bank. Finding ways to boost productivity “should remain a high national priority,” he said.
Trump Attacks
Powell is testifying before the House, and again before the Senate on Thursday, as Trump has relentlessly attacked him.
“Blew it!’’ Trump tweeted June 24 after the Fed left rates on hold the week before, comparing it to “a stubborn child.’’ If the Fed “knew what it was doing” it would cut rates, the president told reporters Sunday.
Trump announced his intentions to nominate two potentially dovish members to the Fed last week, either of whom might be a Fed chair pick for Trump when Powell’s term ends in 2022, assuming the president wins reelection next year.
One is Christopher Waller, research director at the St. Louis Fed. Trump’s other pick is Judy Shelton, who has a record as a hard money advocate but tweeted after the announcement that she “will strive to support the U.S. pro-growth economic agenda with the appropriate monetary policy.”

846,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 08:31AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank looks to boost wealth management as part of reinvention,"By Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - With other parts of its business facing hefty cuts,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) wants to expand its European operations handling the assets of rich clients and take market share from rivals after staunching the outflow of assets.
Hiring new client relationship managers and perhaps making acquisitions in a few years' time can help fuel growth, said Claudio de Sanctis, head of wealth management Europe and chief executive of Deutsche Bank (Switzerland) Ltd.
The division is targeting entrepreneurs and rich families in core countries such as Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain as well as largely untapped markets in eastern Europe.
Wealth management is seen as a growth area after a major restructuring announced on Sunday by Germany's largest bank that will chop 18,000 jobs and scale back its investment banking operations.
""It is not necessarily known but we already are among the biggest wealth managers in Europe in terms of assets. That will be helpful in terms of being credible with European entrepreneurs,"" de Sanctis said in an interview.
Deutsche Bank said last month it planned to hire 300 more relationship and investment mangers for its wealth management (WM) business by 2021.
The business accounted for about 7% of the bank's 25 billion euros ($28 billion) in revenue in 2018.
""The bank has said it wants to focus on areas where we can compete and where we can win, and we think in wealth management that is the case,"" Christian Nolting, Chief Investment Officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, told Reuters in a separate briefing.
COMPETITIVE SECTOR
Wealth management is attractive to banks as it requires less capital and its earnings tend to be less cyclical than other parts of the business.
But it is also highly competitive. Swiss banks UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are already big players, while upstart fintech companies are also trying to make inroads.
Deutsche Bank's wealth management business has lost assets in Europe of late amid negative headlines over the bank's struggles. This year, however, flows in Europe were ""definitely positive"", said de Sanctis, himself the former head of private banking in Europe for Credit Suisse.
Attracting new relationship managers tends to boost assets as some of their clients make the switch as well. Acquisitions could also be on the cards, albeit not immediately.
""In principle, my view would be in the next two to three years we prove the organic case, which is very substantial. When we have that credibility then -- given that WM is important and Europe is core -- then we will look at potentially doing acquisitions,"" de Sanctis said.
Eastern European countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania seem attractive as well.
""We have a very good corporate banking presence in these countries locally. However, we haven't been very active on the wealth management side there – it is a full potential to be exploited. For now, it makes sense to do it on a cross-border basis, and Luxembourg will be the hub."" 
Nolting sees no issues in hiring to fuel Deutsche Bank's wealth management push despite the job cuts that dominated headlines this week.
""Relationship managers coming over to us see this as an opportunity. Otherwise they wouldn't come,"" he said.
""They consider our investment process and our discretionary performance, because if they want to bring clients over they need to ensure that they have a very interesting and well-working platform to be able to deliver. And that is the case.""

CEO Nick Read, who took the top job in October, will give up about 972,000 shares, worth 1.28 million pounds ($1.60 million) at Wednesday's share price.
After the cut, he will be awarded 3.89 million shares in the 2020 incentive plan, worth 5.1 million pounds, the company said.
Chief Financial Officer Margherita Della Valle will receive 2.37 million shares under the plan, worth 3.12 million pounds,  Vodafone  said.
Vodafone's shares have fallen 19% since former CFO Read became CEO in October 2018, and are down 44% since the start of last year.
The company has struggled in markets like Spain and Italy, with high costs for mobile spectrum in Germany, and with the expensive acquisition of cable assets from Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA).
The pressure on the company's balance sheet forced Read to cut the dividend in May for the first time, six months after he said the payout was safe.
Vodafone will face investors later this month at its annual general meeting.
Its remuneration report has been approved by 96-97% of the votes cast in recent years.
Institutional shareholder advisory group ISS, however, has recommended a vote against the group's latest remuneration report.

848,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 08:21AM ET</span>",Walmart’s Supplier Says Chinese Factories in ‘Desperate’ State,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest supplier of consumer goods says China’s factories are getting “urgent and desperate” as worried U.S. retailers accelerate a move out of the country amid heightened trade tensions.
China will see more factory shutdowns as the trade war that’s roiled the global supply chain exacerbates an exodus, said Spencer Fung, chief executive officer of Li & Fung Ltd. The company, which designs, sources and transports consumer goods from Asia for some of the world’s biggest retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), is being pushed by American clients to shift production out of China.
“U.S. clients are definitely very, very worried,” Fung said in an interview with Bloomberg. “Everyone is making razor-thin margins already and most people have a huge percentage in China. So if the biggest source increases the price by 25%, they are worried,” he said, referring to the scale of tariffs threatened on all Chinese imports to the U.S. by President Donald Trump.
Though Fung didn’t specify Walmart by name, the U.S. retailer is the company’s second-biggest customer after Kohl’s, accounting for 7.6% of revenue, according to Bloomberg data. A spokeswoman for Walmart declined to comment.
Seismic Shift
Because of its position as middleman connecting American retail giants to low-cost Asian factories, Li & Fung has a unique, ground-level perspective of the seismic shifts taking place around the world due to the trade war. Although the U.S. and China have resumed talks on a deal, there are growing signs that the global supply chain, long reliant on China as the factory to the world, is being permanently transformed. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has said it’s reviewing its global supply chain, while others including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are reportedly doing the same.
“Nobody’s investing, nobody’s buying. The trade war is causing people to stop investment because they don’t know where to put the money,” the Silicon Valley-trained CEO said. “Many people put the money into Vietnam with one tweet,” he said, referring to Trump’s habit of announcing American trade policy over the social media tool.
The Hong Kong-based supply chain and logistics provider, which relies heavily on trade between the world’s two biggest economies to make its fortune, will see China’s contribution to its total sourcing fall from 59% in 2015 to less than half this year for the first time.
‘Completely Full’
While Chinese factories suffer, manufacturers in other Asian hubs become beneficiaries -- up to a point. American retailers have already taken up all the manufacturing capacity in Vietnam in their rush out of China, said Fung, highlighting the lack of scale that prevents other destinations from fully substituting for China’s manufacturing might.
“Vietnam, for example, is full, completely full,” he said. “There’s no extra capacity for the U.S. companies to get in.”
Chinese factories, meanwhile, are lowering asking prices in their desperation, creating an opportunity for European and Japanese consumer brands. Li & Fung is advising its non-U.S. clients to move in and take advantage of the mature supply chain and lower costs.
“It is a buying opportunity for European and non-U.S. retailers,” Fung said, “In China, there are a lot of factories with less and less orders. They’re offering actually pretty good prices to anybody.”
Li & Fung, which started its trading business 113 years ago, has seen a steep profit decline in the last five years as the rise of e-commerce platforms like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Amazon cut out the middleman, and its retail clients faced waves of store closures. Fung said that core operating profit will continue to decline this year, but he stressed that he’s “seeing the bottom.”
The company’s shares, which fell 71% last year, climbed 2.7% in Hong Kong trading Wednesday, breaking a six-day losing streak.
Fung, whose great-grandfather Fung Pak-Liu established the company in 1906, sees the havoc currently being wreaked in the established global supply chain as an opportunity for Li & Fung’s re-emergence. Its 50-country sourcing network means it can nimbly shift out of China as clients desire, and its investment in technology like 3D virtual sampling will cut costs and save time, he said.
The company is at the tail-end of a three-year restructuring plan that simplified its structure through divesting non-core businesses and streamlining operations.
“It’s like you’re flying a plane, you’re losing altitude,” said Fung. “But now one after another, I see the indicators turning green. I can actually see that the altitude loss is reducing and we’re actually pulling that plane back up.”

“A strong policy response is necessary to guard against risks of a further, sharper loss of economic momentum,” Morgan Stanley economists led by Chetan Ahya wrote in a note. Risks remain skewed to the downside and a significant hit to growth could emerge if financial conditions tighten, pushing corporate credit risks to the fore, they warned.
The call cuts against both the bigger-than-expected gain in payrolls for June, and the retreat in Treasuries it produced as traders pared back bets on an outsize rate cut at the Fed’s July 30-31 meeting.
“We continue to expect a quick and front-loaded adjustment” by policy makers to protect against downside risks, the Morgan Stanley team wrote. That means a 50 basis point cut this month, they wrote.
They made the call just before Chairman Jerome Powell delivers two days of testimony on the economic outlook and takes lawmakers questions at Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Traders will be watching for any sign Powell is prepared to validate market expectations of easing; recent bets suggest 64 basis points of cuts this year, down from around 80 basis points two weeks back.
“We expect the policy-easing cycle to move into full swing and expect a stronger policy response from central banks than what markets and consensus currently expect,” the Morgan Stanley economists wrote. They said they see greater odds of the European Central Bank restarting quantitative easing than the consensus view."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank (T:9434) has led a $231 million new financing round for Brazilian lending platform Creditas, valuing it at $750 million and funding a future expansion to other Latin American countries, Sergio Furio, the founder of Creditas, said.
The move could boost competition in the Brazilian banking sector, in which the country's top five banks hold 82% of total assets.
""While there is huge demand for consumer lending in Brazil, the market is inefficient,"" Akshay Naheta, managing partner of SoftBank Investment Advisers, adviser to the Vision Fund, said in a statement. SoftBank's Vision Fund is one of the entities investing in Creditas.
Part of the proceeds will be used to expand elsewhere in Latin America, starting by offering asset-backed credit in Mexico later this year. In Mexico, domestic credit provided by the financial sector equals 54.5% of gross domestic product, far below the 114% in Brazil, according to the World Bank.
Founded in 2012 by Furio, a Spanish ex-consultant who is now the lender's chief executive, Creditas has specialized in loans which, because they are secured by assets like homes and autos, carry lower interest rates than traditional bank loans.
The proceeds of the SoftBank investment will be used to expand Creditas' product portfolio, improve its technology and increase headcount, Furio said in an interview.
Creditas will also start to offer payroll loans, a market nearly untouched by big banks, and finance auto and home purchases, Furio said, as well as related services.
""In the future, loans will be more than money, they will be part of a full solution offered to clients,"" he said, such as providing loans for home remodeling projects as well as offering advice for such projects.
Furio said the lending platform's revenues are likely to expand 30-fold by 2021, but did not disclose the figures.
SoftBank Vision Fund and SoftBank Group Corp are primarily investing in Creditas, but the stake of the latter in Creditas is expected to be transferred to SoftBank's newly created SoftBank Latin America Fund.
Vostok Emerging Finance, Santander (MC:SAN) InnoVentures and Amadeus Capital, which were already investors in Creditas, are participating in the funding round alongside SoftBank.
Creditas so far has raised $314 million in four financing rounds, which also include investors Kaszek Ventures, Quona's Accion Frontier Fund, Redpoint eVentures, QED Investors, Naspers Fintech, International Finance Corporation and Endeavor's Catalyst Fund."

854,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>",UK watchdog says all top accountants fail audit quality test,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - All of Britain's leading accounting firms have failed to hit quality targets set by their regulator for auditing company books for the second year in a row, with Grant Thornton and PwC singled out to join KPMG under tougher supervision.
The damning review from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) will pile pressure on the government to implement a proposed sector shake-up prompted by corporate failures at builder Carillion, retailer BHS and an accounting scandal at cafe chain Patisserie Valerie.
The FRC said EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC, known as the Big Four, and BDO, Grant Thornton and Mazars from the next tier down, all failed to hit a target that 90% of audits reviewed by the regulator were good or required only limited improvements.
Only 75% of the sample of audits from among Britain's 350 top listed companies for the year ending December 2017 met the 90% target overall as accountants failed to challenge information clients gave to them, the FRC said.
There was no overall improvement on last year's findings when all audits reviewed failed to meet the 90% target. 
""At a time when the future of the audit sector is under the microscope, the latest audit quality results are not acceptable,"" said Stephen Haddrill, the FRC's chief executive.
Radical reform of the sector was proposed last December to rebuild public trust in audit, including replacing the FRC, described by lawmakers as toothless, with a more powerful watchdog.
Haddrill and his chair Win Bischoff are being replaced.
The bulk of the top 350 listed firms would have two auditors in a bid to improve audit quality, but this depends on Grant Thornton, BDO and Mazars winning the confidence of blue chip companies.
The timing of reform is unclear given it needs legislation to implement and parliament is focused on Britain's protracted departure from the European Union.
The ICAEW, a professional accounting body, said audit faces a ""watershed moment"" and the government should implement reform without delay.
The new watchdog should apply ""fresh thinking"" to improving audit quality and not be constrained by targets and methods bequeathed to it by the FRC, the ICAEW said.
British Business Minister Greg Clark told a parliamentary committee last month there would be a public consultation on a ""proportionate package of reforms"" to improve audit quality and maintain Britain's global status as a center of audit expertise.
FAILING TO CHALLENGE
The FRC said it found cases in all seven firms where auditors failed to challenge management sufficiently, a ""recurring finding"" for several years.
The watchdog said it would raise its target to 100% from 90% for reviews of audits starting from June 2019 financial statement year-ends as having any below standard audits was unacceptable.
Only half of Grant Thornton's sample audits were assessed as good, down from 75% in 2018, the FRC said. More than a quarter of its audits reviewed in the past five years needed significant improvement.
""The FRC has therefore increased its scrutiny of Grant Thornton,"" the watchdog said. It will review a larger number of the firm's audits in the coming year.
Both Grant Thornton, which audited Patisserie Valerie, and PwC, auditor of BHS, had already announced steps to bolster audit activities in anticipation of the FRC findings.
Grant Thornton said the FRC report showed that the entire profession must improve the quality of its work and that Grant Thornton is no exception.
The deterioration from 84% to 65% in PwC's results was also ""unsatisfactory"" and the FRC will ""scrutinize closely"" how PwC implements its improvement plan.
""While results at KPMG have improved, the firm remains subject to increased FRC scrutiny,"" the watchdog said. This will continue until KPMG, which audited Carillion, has demonstrated a sustained improvement in audit quality.
The FRC said 84% of Deloitte's audits met the required standard, up from 76% last year, with EY at 78%, up from 67% in 2018.

But 40% of Mazars' reviewed audits failed to meet the target, worse than in 2018, while 12.5% of BDO's sample audits were below the acceptable standard, unchanged from last year.

855,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",StockBeat - FTSE Dodges a Bullet as GDP Rebounds in May,"By Geoffrey Smith

Investing.com -- U.K. stocks dodged a bullet Wednesday, as a dump of economic data added little to recent impressions of a broad economic slowdown.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that gross domestic product bounced back in May by 0.3%, after a sharp fall in April. The rebound was driven mainly by auto production: the country’s carmakers had moved up their usual annual maintenance periods to April in order to avoid over-producing in a month that was expected to be the first after the U.K. had left the European Union.

Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, noted that the rebound in car production was only “partial”. Manufacturing output rose 1.4% in May, having fallen 4.2% a month earlier.

The ONS said that GDP may still decline on a quarterly basis, unless the expansion continues in June. Business surveys for June suggest that’s unlikely, given that the manufacturing and construction PMIs both fell further into contraction territory, while the services PMI only remained a whisker above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
“There has been a longer-term slowdown in the often-dominant services sector since summer 2018,” Kent-Smith said.

The services sector took a blow this week with the loss of thousands of jobs at Deutsche Bank's U.K. operations, a development driven largely by factors other than Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% by 04:45 AM ET (0845), as was the broader FTSE 250. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was also down 0.2%, with traders trimming positions ahead of key testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Economists are still cautious on the outlook for the U.K. for the next six months.

“(Any) Growth will continue to be choppy through the rest of the year with inventories likely to be built up again ahead of a possible no deal Oct. 31 EU exit, before being unwound as the can is likely kicked down the road yet again,” ING’s chief international economist James Knightley said via Twitter. “Bad news for business (and) consumer confidence.”
In a televised debate on Tuesday evening, the two men vying to be the U.K.’s next Prime Minister had both claimed to be “confident” about leaving the EU on Oct. 31, although the bookmakers’ favorite Boris Johnson, who has affected a harder line on Brexit than his rival Jeremy Hunt, refused to say categorically whether he would resign as Prime Minister if that didn’t happen – implicitly giving him the wiggle room to postpone Brexit again."
856,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>","The $280,000 lab-grown burger could be a more palatable $10 in two years","(This July 9 story corrects to change company name to Biotech Foods in paragraph five.)
By Andrés González and Silke Koltrowitz
MADRID/ZURICH (Reuters) - Lab-grown meat, first introduced to the world six years ago in the form of a $280,000 hamburger, could hit supermarket shelves at $10 a patty within two years, European start-ups told Reuters.
Consumers concerned about climate change, animal welfare and their own health are fueling interest in so-called clean meat, with the number of associated business start-ups climbing from four at the end of 2016 to more than two dozen two years later, according to the Good Food Institute market researcher.
Plant-based meat alternatives are also booming. Shares in Beyond Meat (O:BYND) have more than tripled in price since its initial public offering in May. Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods each sell 100% plant-based meat alternatives to retailers and fast food chains across the United States.
And cultured meat grown from animal cells could be next on the mainstream menu, with producers eyeing regulatory approval as they improve the technology and reduce costs.
It was Dutch start-up Mosa Meat's co-founder Mark Post who created the first ""cultured"" beef hamburger in 2013 at a cost of 250,000 euros ($280,400), funded by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) co-founder Sergey Brin, but Mosa Meat and Spain's Biotech Foods say that production costs have fallen dramatically since then.
""The burger was this expensive in 2013 because back then it was novel science and we were producing at very small scale. Once production is scaled up, we project the cost of producing a hamburger will be around 9 euros,"" a Mosa Meat spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that it could ultimately become even cheaper than a conventional hamburger.
PRICE PARITY
Biotech Foods co-founder Mercedes Vila also highlighted the importance of moving from lab to factory.
""Our goal is to reach production scale and have regulatory approval by 2021,"" Vila said.
She said the average cost of producing a kilogram of cultured meat is now about 100 euros, significantly below the $800 cited a year ago by Future Meat Technologies, an Israeli biotech company that has received funding from U.S. meat processor  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN).
Biotech Foods, Mosa Meat and Higher Steaks, a London-based competitor also contacted by Reuters, have yet to file applications for EU approval because they are still working to improve their growth serum. 
To make cultured meat, stem cells from the muscle of an animal are placed in a culture medium that is then put in a bioreactor - similar to those used for fermentation of beer and yogurt - to support growth of new strands of muscle tissue.
Liz Specht, associate director at the Good Food Institute market research firm that focuses on meat alternatives, said in a white paper this year that it was likely that cell-based meat would achieve price parity with conventional meat once production is on an industrial scale.
Specht identified the cell culture medium as the most significant cost driver and said it was possible to produce it without animal-derived components and at much lower prices.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
Proponents of this new technology say it's the only environmentally sustainable way to satisfy meat demand that the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization expects to double between 2000 and 2050.
But John Lynch, an environmental scientist at the University of Oxford, said it remains unclear whether scalable lab-grown meat production can really convert energy and nutrients into meat more efficiently than conventional meat production.
""Some studies have suggested that cultured meat may require less of a 'feed' source than conventional livestock production, but require more energy. If this is the case, then their impact on the climate will depend on where this energy comes from,"" he said.
Interest in the category has ensured start-ups have had ample access to funding. 
Biotech Foods' Vila said the company had sufficient funds up to 2021, the year it hopes to generate its first revenue, thanks to a capital injection from an unidentified investor.
Mosa Meat has meat processors Bell Food Group (S:BELL) and Merck KGaA's (DE:MRCG) venture capital arm M Ventures among its investors.

In May food and agriculture group Cargill announced it had invested in cultured meat company Aleph Farms.

858,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 03:19AM ET</span>","U.S. Says Huawei Still Blacklisted, Except When It’s Not","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. said it would grant licenses allowing companies to export goods to Huawei Technologies Co. but won’t remove the Chinese technology giant from an export blacklist, as talks between the world’s two biggest economies resumed.
The Department of Commerce will “issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,” though Huawei will continue to face export controls, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday in Washington.
The move clarifies President Donald Trump’s remarks that he would allow U.S. companies to resume supplying some of their products to Huawei, after meeting his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Osaka, Japan last month. Top negotiators from both countries talked by phone on Tuesday for the first time since the two leaders agreed to a tentative truce.
“Within those confines we will try to make sure that we don’t just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms,” said Ross. “Huawei itself remains on the Entity List, and the announcement does not change the scope of items requiring licenses from the Commerce Department, nor the presumption of denial.”
Like Trump and other high-level U.S. officials, Ross did not specify a time frame or elaborate on what constitutes a national security threat. The Entity List is often reserved for rogue regimes and their associated companies as a way to prevent U.S.-origin items from flowing to them.
Even before Trump’s Osaka announcement, a number of American suppliers including Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). had already resumed selling certain products to Huawei after concluding there are legal ways to bypass the ban.
The chipmakers are taking advantage of certain exceptions to the U.S. export restrictions. If less than 25% of the technology in a chip originates in the U.S., for example, then it may not be covered by the ban, under current rules.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 02:43AM ET</span>",Democrat overseeing U.S. Census funding would block form reprint for citizenship question,"By Makini Brice and Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge in New York on Tuesday denied the U.S. Department of Justice's request to shake up the legal team that was handling cases on the 2020 Census, adding another hurdle to the Trump administration's bid to put a contentious citizenship question on the survey.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman said in a court order the 11th-hour request to change lawyers handling the case is ""patently deficient"" and provides no ""satisfactory reasons.""
The department attempted to change the team of lawyers after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 27 against the first attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to add the citizenship question, calling the rationale ""contrived."" (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-census/trump-fumes-as-supreme-court-blocks-census-citizenship-question-idUSKCN1TS1BL)
But the Supreme Court left open the possibility that the question could be added if the government provided a different rationale.
The Justice Department filed court papers on Monday announcing the new lawyers, but attorneys for New York and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) contested the substitutions.
""Defendants provide no reasons, let alone ‘satisfactory reasons,’ for the substitution of counsel,” Furman wrote in his order. 
The judge added that the Justice Department has looming deadlines to respond to motions that plaintiffs have filed, including a request to prohibit the administration from modifying the census to add the question. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the judge's order.
The printing of the decennial population survey is already underway. In January, the government awarded R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, a $114 million contract, including printing more than 600 million documents to be mailed to more than 130 million households.
An ACLU official said in response to Furman's order that the department ""owes the public and the courts an explanation for its unprecedented substitution of the entire legal team.""
""The Trump administration is acting like it has something to hide, and we won’t rest until we know the truth,"" ACLU Voting Rights Project Director Dale Ho said in a statement.
The judge said the department may petition the court again to swap lawyers, but each request must be accompanied by a ""signed and sworn affidavit"" explaining the rationale.
The Supreme Court ruled after states and civil rights groups fought the Trump administration for trying to add the question, saying it was a Republican ploy to scare immigrants into not participating and leading to a population undercount in heavily Democratic areas.
Trump and his supporters say it makes sense to know how many non-citizens are living in the United States. The Republican's hard line policies on immigration have punctuated his presidency and 2020 re-election campaign. 
After the June 27 ruling, it appeared as though the administration was conceding defeat, with Justice Department lawyers saying the census would be printed without the question.
But the very next day, Trump appeared to contradict them on Twitter, saying he was still moving forward to try and include it. 
Shortly after that, the Justice Department said it was still searching for a legal a path forward to include it.
To date, the Justice Department has not offered details on what that may entail.
Trump has said he was considering an executive order (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census/trump-presses-for-contentious-census-citizenship-question-despite-legal-uncertainty-idUSKCN1U01LG) to add the question. The U.S. Constitution specifically assigns the job of overseeing the census to Congress, limiting the authority of the president over it.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who was appointed by Trump, told reporters while in South Carolina on Monday that ""over the next day or two, you'll see what approach we're taking and I think it does provide a pathway for getting the question on the census.""
Meanwhile on Tuesday, a U.S. House Democrat who oversees funding for the U.S. Census Bureau said he would not support money being spent to reprint forms if the Trump administration won court approval to include the citizenship question.
""Amending the form could potentially cost hundreds of millions of additional taxpayer dollars,"" Representative José Serrano, who chairs the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a statement.
Serrano said he has ""no intention of allowing this flagrant waste of money,"" urging Trump to give up his fight to add a question about citizenship.

The U.S. Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, which did not immediately comment on Serrano's statement.

By Jeff Mason and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese trade officials held a ""constructive"" phone conversation on Tuesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said, marking a new round of talks after the world's two largest economies agreed to a truce in a year-long trade war.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and Commerce Minister Zhong Shan on Tuesday in a further effort to resolve outstanding trade disputes between the countries, a U.S. official said earlier in an emailed statement.
Kudlow said the talks ""went well"" and were constructive. He said the two sides were talking about a face-to-face meeting, but warned that there was not a magic way to reach what has so far been an elusive deal.
""There are no miracles here,"" Kudlow told reporters at the White House. ""There was headway last winter and spring, then it stopped. Hopefully we can pick up where we left off, but I don't know that yet.""
China's Commerce Ministry said in a short statement that the two sides had ""exchanged views on implementing the consensus of the two countries' leaders at the Osaka meeting"". It gave no other details.
The United States and China agreed during a Group of 20 nations summit in Japan last month to resume discussions, easing fears of an escalation. After meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20, U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to suspend a new round of tariffs on $300 billion worth of imported Chinese consumer goods while the two sides resumed negotiations. 
Trade talks stalled in May after China backed away from commitments it had made to secure legal changes to its system, according to U.S. officials. 
Kudlow's comments suggested it was still unclear whether the two sides would resume work from the draft text agreed before that pull-back, as U.S. officials want, or whether they will use a different starting point. 
A face-to-face meeting between the two negotiating teams would be a good thing and could take place in Beijing, Kudlow said, but no details were available yet.
""Both sides will continue these talks as appropriate,"" the separate U.S. official said in an email, declining to provide details on what was discussed and the next steps for talks.
The negotiations picked up after a two-month hiatus, but a year since a tit-for-tat tariff battle began between the two countries. Washington wants Beijing to address what U.S. officials see as decades of unfair and illegal trading practices. 
Trump said in Osaka that China would restart large purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities, and the United States would ease some export restrictions on Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies.
""President Xi is expected, we hope in return for our accommodations, to move immediately, quickly, while the talks are going on, on the agriculture (purchases),"" Kudlow said on Tuesday at an event hosted by CNBC. ""That's very, very important.""
He also said relaxed U.S. government restrictions on Huawei could help the technology giant but would only be in place for a limited time.
Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, later told reporters there was no specific timeline for the agricultural buys, or for reaching an agreement. ""No timeline. Quality not speed,"" he added.
Three sources familiar with the state of the talks said the Chinese side did not make firm commitments for immediate purchases. It's unclear that the two sides' differences have narrowed, even as the discussions resume.

BEIJING (Reuters) -  Maoyan Entertainment  (HK:1896), China's leading movie-ticketing platform, said it would boost investment in the domestic film industry and deepen its partnership with Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), as it works to halt a downturn at cinemas.
The comments come as box office revenue this year lags that of last year. To reverse the trend, cinemas are pinning hopes on domestic movies, Chief Executive Zheng Zhihao told Reuters.
""Whether the full-year revenue will be in line with that of last year or even exceed, it remains to be seen,"" Zheng said in a recent interview.
Box office revenue slumped 2.7% in the first half of 2019, showed data from Maoyan, while the number of movie-goers fell 10%. Analysts noted the downturn coincided with a slowdown in domestic consumption at a time when a trade dispute with the United States threatens to impact an already softer economy.
Unlike in countries such as the United States, most Chinese movie-goers secure seats by buying tickets online from dealers such as Maoyan and Taopiaopiao, backed by  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
However, the ticketing market is approaching saturation and so Maoyan aims to expand further in content investment and distribution, Zheng said.
""Over the years we have built up our strength in ticketing, distribution and media, and now we have newly created capital for maneuverability,"" Zheng said.
He also said Maoyan has begun a strategic alliance with gaming and social media firm Tencent, giving it access to resources from group firms such as Tencent Pictures, Tencent Video, Tencent Investment and  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (N:TME).
As well as Tencent, Maoyan is also backed by online delivery company  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690).
DISCIPLINED MARKET
Some blockbuster movies have been delayed due to amendments needed to gain approval for wider screening, with sensitivities particularly high ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. One such title, ""The Eight Hundred"", is a patriotic World War Two epic focusing not on the Communist Party but on its civil war adversary, the Kuomingtang.
The government is also working to eliminate aspects of the entertainment business deemed at odds with Communist Party values. Action taken includes a cap on artists' salaries and, in an extreme case, a tax evasion fine of $1.62 billion on A-list actress Fan Bingbing.
""I don't think we can talk about any industry without the context of the country,"" Zheng said. ""I believe in a more disciplined market environment, the industry will enjoy long-term development."""

“We can’t see an easy resolution unless the U.S. attempts to negotiate a resolution,” said Mobius, who set up Mobius Capital Partners LLP last year after three decades at Franklin Templeton Investments. “Technology firms will thus continue to be vulnerable and investors will need to be selective and undertake extensive research to determine which companies and sectors are most vulnerable.”
Korean companies should find alternative suppliers for the key materials crucial for production of memory-chips that Japan has imposed exports restrictions on, Mobius said in an email interview, without mentioning names. “It won’t be easy, but it can be done.”

The current spat between the two countries over issues during Japan’s colonial rule decades ago comes as a new generation of Japanese people “resent being blamed for the transgressions of their ancestors against Korea,” said Mobius. Koreans dislike Japan’s “reluctance to recognize past transgressions.”
Shares of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., the world’s largest memory-chip maker, dropped 4% this month as Japan’s government tightened restrictions on exports of semiconductor materials to South Korea.

Cebu Air Inc. climbed to 87 pesos, rebounding from a record slump on Tuesday. The company’s shares plummeted 38% to 58 pesos in the last few minutes of trading yesterday, triggered by a misplaced order during the Philippine Stock Exchange’s no-cancel period. The stock had closed at 93.4 pesos on Monday.
“It was a trader error,” a representative at Quality Investment & Securities Corp., which executed the trade, said by phone. “Our brokerage wasn’t meaning to sell Cebu Air shares.”
Cebu Air CEO Lance Gokongwei said Tuesday in a text message that the share price drop was likely a fat-finger trade and the price would recover Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Philippine Stock Exchange declined to comment.
According to Regina Capital Development Corp. analyst Rens Cruz, the fat-finger error opened up an opportunity for some investors to reenter the market at a reduced price. “There is also a lot of incentive to bring prices back up in the next few days” since the trading error trapped other shareholders in the 90-peso range, he said.
Cebu Air, which last month ordered 31 Airbus SE aircraft worth $6.8 billion to meet its goal to have an all-new fleet in five years, will likely nearly double its profit this year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

865,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>","The ‘Fed Put’ Party Will Be Spoiled by Bad Earnings, UBS Warns","(Bloomberg) -- Investors banking on the “Fed Put” keeping the equity rally going should be getting worried about the direction of earnings growth, according to UBS Group AG.
A decline in forward earnings growth for S&P 500 Index members below 0% would likely bring an end to the “bad news is good news” dynamic that’s helped propel the year’s stock rally, strategist Francois Trahan wrote in a note Tuesday. History shows the bullish effect from expectations of Federal Reserve stimulus ended after growth turned negative, he said.
Twelve-month estimated earnings growth for the S&P 500 Index has slumped from over 20% late last year to just 3% currently, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“In the last 20 years, ‘rate-cut rallies’ have proven to be short-lived as market multiples expanded temporarily but eventually started to compress again in the face of weaker leading indicators,” Trahan wrote. “In 2001 and 2007 the ‘Fed Put’ ended when S&P 500 earnings growth fell to 0%.”
U.S. stocks have surged to record highs this year despite concerns over slowing global growth and the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions. Investors are betting Fed stimulus can avert a U.S. downturn, and traders have priced in more than two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of the year.
Trahan sees similarities between markets now and those of 2001 and 2007, when investor sentiment also saw revivals thanks to Fed easing.
“Then, as now, the equity market ignored negative economic developments for a time as investors hoped that bad data would entice the Fed to add more stimulus,” he said. “Eventually, however, the equity market returned to ‘normal’ and began to respond negatively once again to disappointing economic news.”"

“It is under discussion,” Kudlow told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. “Chevron has done a great job. They have a long and illustrious tradition as you may know in Venezuela.”
Chevron is the only remaining U.S. oil major in Venezuela and wants to extend a waiver that is due to expire on July 27 to continue its joint venture with state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
The U.S. has refused to recognize Nicolas Maduro as the country’s president after an election last year. Financial sanctions have become its main tool for depriving the Venezuelan leader of cash and pressuring the military to turn against him. Oil purchases from Venezuela have become complicated since the U.S. expanded its sanctions regimen to include any business done with PDVSA, as the national oil company is known. Other companies, including Spain’s Repsol (MC:REP) SA and Italy’s Eni SpA, continue to do business with Venezuela.
Chevron only got about 42,000 barrels of oil a day from its Venezuelan affiliate in 2018, roughly 1% of the company’s global output, but the country is home to the world’s largest oil reserves and is a potential bounty for oil companies if Maduro were to leave office.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 08:01PM ET</span>",U.S. government to provide licenses for sales to Huawei if national security protected,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell goods to China's Huawei where there is no threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday, leaving industry observers unsure about which products will pass muster.
Seeking to revive trade talks with China, President Donald Trump announced last month that American companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker. 
Trump's comments came after the United States placed Huawei on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. U.S. parts and components generally cannot be sold to those on the list without special licenses.
While American chipmakers welcomed Trump's announcement, many industry and government officials were confused about the new policy.
Speaking at a conference in Washington, Ross affirmed that Huawei would remain on the Entity List, meaning winning licenses would require overcoming a presumption of denial, and said the scope of items requiring licenses would not change. However, he opened the door to some approvals. 
""To implement the president's G20 summit directive two weeks ago, Commerce will issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,"" Ross said, referring to Trump's announcement at the meeting of world leaders in Japan. 
""Within those confines, we will try to make sure that we don't just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms,"" he said. 
After Huawei was added to the Entity List, the semiconductor industry lobbied the U.S. government to be allowed to sell nonsensitive items that Huawei could easily buy abroad, arguing that a blanket ban would harm American companies.
Industry observers said Ross' comments lacked the clarity and relief many hoped for after Trump's announcement.
""The actual policy, of what is not going to endanger U.S. security, is not clear,"" Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said. ""The only way that industry can determine the line is by submitting (license) applications and knowing what types will be approved and which types will be denied.""
Separately, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told an event hosted by CNBC that relaxed U.S. government restrictions on Huawei could help the technology giant but would only be in place for a limited time.
He said U.S. government purchases of Huawei parts, components or systems would remain off-limits, as would any transactions involving 5G, but the licensing requirements had been relaxed for so-called general merchandise that involved ""no national security influences or consequences.""
That meant some chip companies would be permitted to sell to Huawei, on a limited basis, items generally available on the global market, including from vendors in South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, he said.
""We are opening that up for a limited time period,"" Kudlow said. ""So that's important and, I guess, does provide some relief to Huawei."" He did not specify how long the relaxed licensing guidelines would be in effect.
Speaking at the same conference as Ross, Nazak Nikakhtar, Commerce's assistant secretary for industry and analysis and nominee to lead the department's Bureau of Industry and Security, said the agency hoped to have decisions soon on export license requests from companies seeking to sell to Huawei. 
The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.
It also has launched a lobbying effort to persuade U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.
TENACIOUS PURSUIT OF AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY
Shortly after Huawei was added to the Entity List, the Commerce Department issued a temporary general license allowing the company to buy equipment to maintain existing networks and provide software updates to existing Huawei handsets. That license expires on Aug. 19, but may be extended. 
Any further relief granted on Huawei's entity listing still may not spell the end of troubles for the company. In May, Trump signed an executive order barring U.S. firms from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk.
The move, which required the Commerce Department to draw up an enforcement plan, was seen as paving the way to ban U.S. companies from buying from Huawei, at a time when U.S. wireless carriers are looking for partners as they roll out 5G networks. 
On Tuesday, Ross said Commerce would issue an ""interim final rule"" in mid-October to implement the executive order. Interim final rules go into effect immediately, even as they seek public comment that could be used to modify regulations going forward. 
The United States has engaged Beijing in a tit-for-tat trade war over accusations that China steals American intellectual property (IP) and forces U.S. companies to transfer their technology to Chinese firms to gain access to markets.

The United States last year passed a law that required Commerce to draft new rules to beef up oversight of certain foundational technology sales abroad. Commerce will ""very soon"" seek formal comment on that rulemaking, Nikakhtar said.

The culture ministry said in the letter dated July 5 that it was surprised to find one chair in the Dolls by Raw Edges collection by the Paris-based fashion house featured the designs of Mexican artists in Hidalgo.
""We feel obliged to ask, in a respectful manner, if for the elaboration of the chair mentioned you sought and, in this case, worked together with the community and its artists,"" the letter said.
The French fashion house owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH) said in a statement: ""We are currently in a relationship with artisans of Tenango de Doria in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, with the perspective of collaborating together to produce this collection.""
It is the second time in less than a month that the Mexican government sent such a letter. In June, it questioned the fashion house founded by Venezuela-born designer Carolina Herrera for ""cultural appropriation"" of indigenous patterns.
Fashion designers have a history of incorporating indigenous patterns into their works but the extent to which they have done so without acknowledging their origins or fairly compensating communities has become a point of contention.
Mexico's ruling leftist National Regeneration Movement has been planning legislation to protect indigenous communities from plagiarism and having their work used by others without receiving fair compensation."

873,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 06:17PM ET</span>",Rice group set to take control of EQT board in proxy contest: source,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David French
BOSTON (Reuters) - Brothers Toby and Derek Rice are on course to win control of EQT Corp's board of directors two years after having sold their own company, Rice Energy, to the natural gas producer, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Enough votes have been cast for the Rice brothers to defeat EQT's slate of directors and take over the board in what has become the most prominent fight for control of a board since Starboard Value waged and won its proxy contest at Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI) in 2014, the sources said.
Two sources said that the pair is expected to have won seven seats on the 12-member board.
Representatives for EQT and the Rice brothers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
At stake is control of the largest natural gas producer in the United States. The Rice group has waged an eight-month campaign against the current EQT board and management, claiming they have mismanaged the company since its 2017 takeover of Rice Energy. 
Investors can vote until EQT's annual meeting begins in Pittsburgh at 8 a.m. on Wednesday. But with big investors ranging from T.Rowe Price to the California Teachers Retirement System pension fund having already thrown their support to the brothers, sources say their win is all but assured. 
Toby and Derek Rice, two of the three brothers who sold Rice Energy to EQT in 2017, have been frustrated with operations at EQT and decided their only recourse was to press ahead with a proxy contest and plans to push for Toby to replace Robert McNally as EQT's chief executive officer.
Toby Rice told Reuters last month that he needs more influence on the board to create changes like cutting costs and bringing in new executives for key parts of the business after EQT let most of Rice Energy's senior management go after the merger.
EQT's stock price tumbled nearly 59% since the Rice merger was completed, sparking worry among big investors and at least one influential proxy advisory firm.
Besides T.Rowe Price, investors D.E. Shaw and Kensico Capital Management as well as Elliott Management have publicly said they are backing the brothers, giving them more than 21% of the vote.
CalSTRS, whose votes often carry clout with other investors, reported on its website that it cast its vote for the brothers' slate and for five current board members who were unopposed.
Similarly proxy advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services threw its weight behind the Rice group. 
Besides Toby, the slate includes Daniel Rice, a third brother, who was the CEO of Rice Energy and is a current EQT board member, plus other executives with industry experience.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 05:36PM ET</span>","China's Centurium Capital raises over $2 billion from GIC, Temasek, others","By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Centurium Capital, a big backer of domestic startup Luckin Coffee, said it has raised more than $2 billion in its debut fund, giving the private equity firm more firepower to cut deals involving the world's second-largest economy.
The firm, co-founded by the former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific, David Li, said in a statement on Wednesday that Centurium Capital Partners 2018 L.P. raised the sum in U.S. dollars.
The fund secured strong interest from global investors, known as limited partners (LPs), such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and funds-of-funds, it said.
Investors in the fund include Singapore's GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL] and Temasek Holdings (TEM.UL), Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, China Investment Corp (CIC) and U.S. pension fund Washington State Investment Board, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Centurium and Temasek declined to comment. All the other investors didn't respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. dollar fund will help Centurium invest in Chinese firms that use overseas structures such as variable-interest entities.
Centurium joins several China-focused private equity and venture capital managers who raised $17.3 billion in dollar-denominated funds in the first half of the year, versus $13 billion over the same period last year, according to data provider Preqin.
Launched in March 2018, Centurium's maiden fund reached the first close of nearly $1 billion three months later and has beaten the $1.5 billion and $1.98 billion fundraising targets since then.
BESPOKE SOLUTIONS
Beijing-based Centurium was set up in early 2017 by Li and two other partners. Li had worked with Warburg Pincus for 14 years and led several investments for the U.S. buyout firm in China, including in top car rental service provider CAR Inc.
""After helping several entrepreneurs fulfill their entrepreneurial dream for so many years, I also have my dream of launching our own (investment) firm,"" Li told Reuters.
Centurium primarily seeks control and significant minority investment opportunities across China's consumer, services and healthcare sectors where it looks to boost operational efficiency and tackle structural deficiencies.
""The Chinese business environment nowadays needs a new generation of investors that combine the global PE best practice and local experience,"" Li said.
""Instead of being a pure capital provider, firms like Centurium can better integrate with local markets and be more efficient and responsive to provide bespoke local solutions to new challenges and opportunities faced by Chinese entrepreneurs.""
Centurium began to gain recognition last year when it made a big bet on Luckin Coffee, the Chinese challenger to  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). It invested about $180 million in Luckin in the startup's first two fundraising rounds.
Li said that Centurium has invested about 40% of the capital raised in the debut fund in five firms in China and aims to fully deploy the fund by the end of next year.
Besides Luckin, Centurium's portfolio firms include Keking, an online logistics services provider, China Biologic Products, a biopharmaceutical firm which makes and sells plasma products, and online education platform Happy Kids Education."

Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, will start two days of testimony before Congress on Wednesday, and what everyone wants is a sense of whether the Fed really will cut interest rates this month.
As a result, the S&P 500 finished the day up 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrials were off 0.1%, and the Nasdaq rose a semi-healthy 0.5%.

Home-accessories retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) reports results after Wednesday's close. The shares have had a roller-coaster ride this year to end the second quarter up 1% on the year. The shares fell 49% in 2018. 
But big tech had a good day with gains for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Oil prices were up slightly on the day, and gold futures nudged barely higher. The 10-year Treasury yield yield finished at 2.061%, up 1.3%.
Powell's testimony will offer the first chance investors have had to hear his thinking after last week's June jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by a surprising 224,000, larger than the expected 160,000. The report threw into question whether the domestic economy is slowing down, as the Fed has suggested for the last few months.

879,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
Powell Takes the Stand, Fed Minutes 
Federal Reserve Jerome Powell is set to get his two-day testimony on Capitol Hill underway on Wednesday at 10:00 am ET.
Powell’s semiannual monetary policy report to the House Financial Services Committee will be closely watched to see whether the Fed chairman will attempt to rein in expectations for aggressive Fed easing following the better-than-expected jobs report seen last week. 
Investors expect the Fed to cut rates later this month, but hopes for an aggressive 50 basis points cut have faded. 
Further insight into the central bank's thinking on monetary policy likely will also show up in the release of the Fed's minutes from its July meeting, where officials voted to keep rates steady, but opened the door to a possible rate cut amid worries over increasing uncertainties about the outlook on inflation and economic growth. 
The minutes are due at 2:00 p.m. ET. 
Bed, Bath & Beyond Earnings on Tap
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is set to release earnings before the market closes on Wednesday, with many investors desperate for signs that the retailer has made a positive start for the year.
The company is expected to report earnings of 8 cents a share on revenue of $2.58 billion. 
As well as its earnings, the retailer’s comps will likely be closely watched, with some suggesting that flat or modestly positive comps results for the quarter would prove a sign of progress. Shares were off 0.4% on Tuesday. They're up 1.1% this year, but that's after 50% increase in the first quarter and a 31.6% decline in the second quarter.
EIA Crude Inventory Data Eyed
The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly petroleum report due Wednesday, with many eager to see whether the three-week run of inventory drawdowns can continue.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 3.567 million barrels for the week ended July 5.
Crude oil futures climbed 17 cents to settle at $57.83 a barrel.
U.S. weekly production, which remain near record highs of 12.2 million barrels a day, will likely also garner attention."

(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) said on Tuesday it has closed its $34 billion acquisition of software company Red Hat Inc (N:RHT), as it looks to ramp up its cloud computing business.
Underscoring the drive into high-margin businesses,  IBM  in October agreed to buy Red Hat, the company’s biggest acquisition in its more than 100-year history.
Ginni Rometty, IBM chief executive since 2012, has steered the company toward faster-growing segments such as cloud, software and services and away from traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.
In an interview, Rometty said the deal was driven by what its customers wanted and helping companies ""move mission-critical work"" to the cloud, offering a variety of hybrid public and private clouds. ""We have all the critical parts,"" she said.
Customers want hybrid cloud applications because they ""look at their IT and they say, 'Look I can't just throw it all out and rebuild it'"" and instead want a mix of public and private cloud applications ""with one platform across it.""
Rometty cited as examples major IBM cloud customers like  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said in a statement the company has been ""working with both IBM and Red Hat for years"" and said the combined firm ""will be an essential part of our digital transformation.""
The company, which won approval for the purchase from U.S. regulators in May and European Union regulators in late June, agreed to pay $190 a share for Red Hat, representing a 63 percent premium.
Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software and an alternative to proprietary software made by  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT). IBM has faced years of revenue declines as it transitions from its legacy computer hardware business into new technology products and services.
Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and his management team will remain in place. Whitehurst will join IBM’s senior management team and report to Rometty.
IBM will maintain Red Hat’s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, and its facilities, brands and practices, and said it will operate as a distinct unit within IBM. Rometty said no job or cost cuts are planned at Red Hat.
IBM closed down 0.9 percent at $139.33.
The companies said IBM and Red Hat will offer ""a next-generation hybrid multicloud platform"" that will be ""based on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes.""
IBM’s cloud strategy has focused on helping companies stitch together multiple cloud platforms rather than compete head-on with ""hyperscale"" cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN); Microsoft; and Alphabet Inc’s Google (O:GOOGL).
IBM said Red Hat will continue ""to build and expand its partnerships, including those with major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).""
Since 2013, IBM’s cloud revenue as a percentage of total revenue has grown sixfold to 25 percent. In the 12 months through the first quarter of 2019, cloud revenue exceeded $19 billion.

Red Hat is expected to contribute approximately two points of compound annual revenue growth over a five-year period, IBM said.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 04:18PM ET</span>",Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic plans to go public by end-2019,"By Ankit Ajmera and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - British billionaire Richard Branson will take Virgin Galactic public by year-end, giving it the much-needed funds to take on Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin in the race to space.
The company will list its shares as part of a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which will also take a 49% stake in Virgin Galactic for about $800 million, a source who worked on the deal told Reuters.
The SPAC deal allows Virgin Galactic to go public sooner, compared with a traditional initial public offering, which the company might have considered in six to nine months following its first commercial flight, the source said.
They were working on this deal for the best part of nine months, according to the source.
Branson founded space ventures like Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit to cash in on burgeoning demand for space travel and launch services for a boom in the number of smaller satellites. 
The traditional launch services market has been long dominated by industry stalwarts such as United Launch Alliance - a partnership between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT).
But since its early days, Branson's ambitious timeline for taking customers into space has suffered delays and setbacks.
In February, the company took a step closer to its goal of suborbital flights for space tourists when its rocket plane soared to the edge of space with a test passenger for the first time.
Rival Blue Origin has launched its New Shepard rocket to space, but its trips have not yet carried humans. SpaceX last year named Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as its first passenger on a voyage around the moon, tentatively scheduled for 2023.
Hundreds of people from 60 countries, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber, have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin's suborbital flights. Some of Virgin Galactic's ticket holders have been waiting over 14 years for their trip.
A 90-minute flight, which allows passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, costs about $250,000.
The cost is expected to come down ""dramatically"" over the next decade as space travel becomes more accessible to common people, Branson told CNBC on Tuesday.
""I think we can do it a lot quicker than aviation did it.""
Virgin's current reservations represent about $80 million in total collected deposits and $120 million of potential revenue.
Social Capital Hedosophia's chief executive officer, Chamath Palihapitiya, who is investing $100 million as part of the deal, will become chairman of the combined company.
""By embarking on this new chapter, at this advanced point in Virgin Galactic's development, we can open space to more investors and in doing so, open space to thousands of new astronauts,"" Branson said in a statement.
With the acquisition, Social Capital is pulling off perhaps the highest profile SPAC deal to date. A SPAC uses proceeds from an IPO, together with borrowed funds, to acquire companies that are usually privately held. Investors in the SPAC IPO do not know in advance which company a SPAC will buy, although many outline in advance the sectors they want to be active in.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) advised Social Capital Hedosophia, while M Klein and Co, LionTree Advisors and Perella Weinberg Partners advised Virgin.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Airtel Africa listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange on Tuesday in a 1.36 trillion naira ($4.4 bln) flotation turning the telecoms company into the bourse's third-largest stock by market value.
Airtel Africa's shares climbed 10% from their listing price of 363 naira after the float went live. Some 100,000 shares traded at Tuesday's debut, helping the main stock index (NGSEINDEX) recover from a seven-week low.
The company, owned 68.3% by India's  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI), offered shares in its African unit two weeks ago via a London IPO and said it would dual list in Nigeria, its biggest market in Africa.
Airtel Africa, which operates across 14 African countries, had planned to list last week but the bourse postponed the cross-border listing to allow the telecoms firm to meet its listing requirements.
Airtel's listing comes after main rival, South Africa's MTN (J:MTNJ), listed its Nigerian unit (LG:MTNN) in Lagos in May in a $6.5 billion float that made it the second-largest stock on the bourse by market value.
It also becomes the second company to list in London and Lagos following an IPO by oil firm  Seplat  (LG:SEPLAT) (L:SEPL).
Airtel Africa's existing shareholders include Singapore's Temasek (TEM.UL), Japan's SoftBank (T:9434), Singtel and U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus.
The local bourse has said Airtel shares registered in Britain may be moved from the London market to Nigeria subject to approval by the custodians in London and foreign exchange rules in Nigeria. But Airtel shares registered in Nigeria cannot be moved to London, it said."
883,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:51PM ET</span>",Auditor to company owned by metals tycoon Gupta quit over asset value,"By Tom Bergin
(Reuters) - The auditor of a small company owned by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta resigned saying it could not agree with the valuation of assets, according to a letter filed with the UK corporate register, Companies House.
MHA MacIntyre Hudson said it was stepping down as auditor of Liberty Precision Tubes Ltd., which manufactures steel tubes, after failing to agree the extent to which the value of ""tangible fixed assets"" should be impaired, or the estimated value reduced, in the firm’s accounts for the year to the end of March 2018.  
The only tangible fixed assets listed in the accounts are plant and equipment.
""Our assessment of the impairment was significantly greater than the Company's assessment,"" said the letter, which was dated May 30 and made publicly available by Companies House in recent days.
The accounting firm didn't specify the gap between it and the company's assessment but said that the tube maker's profits for the year and net assets weren't affected.
The steel tube maker is a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty House Group, part of the GFG Alliance conglomerate that manages the industrial, finance and metals investments of the Gupta family.
Spokespeople for GFG, Liberty House Group and Liberty Precision Tubes were not immediately available for comment.
Liberty Precision Tubes had revenues of 24.7 million pounds ($30.8 million) for the year ended March 2018, the latest publicly-available accounts show. GFG has annual revenues in excess of $10 billion.
MHA MacIntyre Hudson, a mid-sized audit firm based in London, declined to comment. The financial year to the end of March 2018 would have been MHA MacIntyre Hudson's first time auditing the tube maker, accounts show.
GFG has grown rapidly in recent years, buying often troubled metals manufacturing facilities, including in the UK, Australia and the United States. To help fund acquisitions, GFG has raised billions of dollars via bond deals.
Concerns over bonds issued by GFG Alliance related to a biodiesel-fuelled power generating business prompted a whistle blower at Swiss asset manager GAM Holding AG to alert UK financial regulators, as previously reported by Reuters.
In February 2016, Liberty House Group purchased the assets of Caparo Precision Tubes Ltd, which had fallen into administration, for 2.3 million pounds, according to publicly-available financial statements.
That included paying 1.3 million for plant and equipment, which were revalued upon purchase and ascribed a value of 24.9 million pounds, according to company financial statements.
The auditor, in the letter, didn't say whether the amount it assessed the assets should have been written down by was greater than the 2.1 million-pound impairment that was recorded in the tube maker’s 2018 accounts, which were filed with Companies House last month after being audited by another firm, London-based King & King.
King & King was not immediately available for comment."

Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, will start two days of testimony before Congress on Wednesday, and what everyone wants is a sense of whether the Fed really will cut interest rates this month.
As a result, the S&P 500 finished the day up 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrials were off 0.1%, and the Nasdaq rose a semi-healthy 0.5%.
The issue for the S&P 500 and the Dow was that a lot of big stocks that had hit recent highs were pulling back, including   Verizon Communications   (NYSE:VZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
Soft-drink-and-soda maker PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) shares slipped on the day after second-quarter results were better than expected. 
Home-accessories retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) reports results after Wednesday's close. The shares have had a roller-coaster ride this year to end the second quarter up 1% on the year. The shares fell 49% in 2018. 
But big tech had a good day with gains for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Oil prices were up slightly on the day, and gold futures nudged barely higher. The 10-year Treasury yield yield finished at 2.061%, up 1.3%.
Powell's testimony will offer the first chance investors have had to hear his thinking after last week's June jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by a surprising 224,000, larger than the expected 160,000. The report threw into question whether the domestic economy is slowing down, as the Fed has suggested for the last few months.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Centurium Capital, a big backer of domestic startup Luckin Coffee, said it has raised more than $2 billion in its debut fund, giving the private equity firm more firepower to cut deals involving the world's second-largest economy. 
The firm, co-founded by the former head of Warburg Pincus Asia Pacific, David Li, said in a statement on Wednesday that Centurium Capital Partners 2018 L.P. raised the sum in U.S. dollars.
The fund secured strong interest from global investors, known as limited partners (LPs), such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and funds-of-funds, it said.
Investors in the fund include Singapore's GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL] and Temasek Holdings (TEM.UL), Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, China Investment Corp (CIC) and U.S. pension fund Washington State Investment Board, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Centurium and Temasek declined to comment. All the other investors didn't respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. dollar fund will help Centurium invest in Chinese firms that use overseas structures such as variable-interest entities.
Centurium joins several China-focused private equity and venture capital managers who raised $17.3 billion in dollar-denominated funds in the first half of the year, versus $13 billion over the same period last year, according to data provider Preqin. 
Launched in March 2018, Centurium's maiden fund reached the first close of nearly $1 billion three months later and has beaten the $1.5 billion and $1.98 billion fundraising targets since then. 
BESPOKE SOLUTIONS 
Beijing-based Centurium was set up in early 2017 by Li and two other partners. Li had worked with Warburg Pincus for 14 years and led several investments for the U.S. buyout firm in China, including in top car rental service provider CAR Inc. 
""After helping several entrepreneurs fulfill their entrepreneurial dream for so many years, I also have my dream of launching our own (investment) firm,"" Li told Reuters.
Centurium primarily seeks control and significant minority investment opportunities across China's consumer, services and healthcare sectors where it looks to boost operational efficiency and tackle structural deficiencies.
""The Chinese business environment nowadays needs a new generation of investors that combine the global PE best practice and local experience,"" Li said.
""Instead of being a pure capital provider, firms like Centurium can better integrate with local markets and be more efficient and responsive to provide bespoke local solutions to new challenges and opportunities faced by Chinese entrepreneurs.""
Centurium began to gain recognition last year when it made a big bet on Luckin Coffee, the Chinese challenger to  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). It invested about $180 million in Luckin in the startup's first two fundraising rounds. 
Li said that Centurium has invested about 40% of the capital raised in the debut fund in five firms in China and aims to fully deploy the fund by the end of next year.

Besides Luckin, Centurium's portfolio firms include Keking, an online logistics services provider, China Biologic Products, a biopharmaceutical firm which makes and sells plasma products, and online education platform Happy Kids Education.

888,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow. 
Powell Takes the Stand, Fed Minutes 
Federal Reserve Jerome Powell is set to get his two-day testimony on Capitol Hill underway on Wednesday at 10:00 am ET.
Powell’s semiannual monetary policy report to the House Financial Services Committee will be closely watched to see whether the Fed chairman will attempt to rein in expectations for aggressive Fed easing following the better-than-expected jobs report seen last week. 
Investors expect the Fed to cut rates later this month, but hopes for an aggressive 50 basis points cut have faded. 
Further insight into the central bank's thinking on monetary policy likely will also show up in the release of the Fed's minutes from its July meeting, where officials voted to keep rates steady, but opened the door to a possible rate cut amid worries over increasing uncertainties about the outlook on inflation and economic growth. 
The minutes are due at 2:00 p.m. ET. 
Bed, Bath & Beyond Earnings on Tap
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is set to release earnings before the market closes on Wednesday, with many investors desperate for signs that the retailer has made a positive start for the year.
The company is expected to report earnings of 8 cents a share on revenue of $2.58 billion. 
As well as its earnings, the retailer’s comps will likely be closely watched, with some suggesting that flat or modestly positive comps results for the quarter would prove a sign of progress. Shares were off 0.4% on Tuesday. They're up 1.1% this year, but that's after 50% increase in the first quarter and a 31.6% decline in the second quarter.
EIA Crude Inventory Data Eyed
The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly petroleum report due Wednesday, with many eager to see whether the three-week run of inventory drawdowns can continue.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 3.567 million barrels for the week ended July 5.
Crude oil futures climbed 17 cents to settle at $57.83 a barrel.
U.S. weekly production, which remain near record highs of 12.2 million barrels a day, will likely also garner attention."

(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) said on Tuesday it has closed its $34 billion acquisition of software company Red Hat Inc (N:RHT), as it looks to ramp up its cloud computing business.
Underscoring the drive into high-margin businesses,  IBM  in October agreed to buy Red Hat, the company’s biggest acquisition in its more than 100-year history.
Ginni Rometty, IBM chief executive since 2012, has steered the company toward faster-growing segments such as cloud, software and services and away from traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.
In an interview, Rometty said the deal was driven by what its customers wanted and helping companies ""move mission-critical work"" to the cloud, offering a variety of hybrid public and private clouds. ""We have all the critical parts,"" she said.
Customers want hybrid cloud applications because they ""look at their IT and they say, 'Look I can't just throw it all out and rebuild it'"" and instead want a mix of public and private cloud applications ""with one platform across it.""
Rometty cited as examples major IBM cloud customers like  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said in a statement the company has been ""working with both IBM and Red Hat for years"" and said the combined firm ""will be an essential part of our digital transformation.""
The company, which won approval for the purchase from U.S. regulators in May and European Union regulators in late June, agreed to pay $190 a share for Red Hat, representing a 63 percent premium.
Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software and an alternative to proprietary software made by  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT). IBM has faced years of revenue declines as it transitions from its legacy computer hardware business into new technology products and services.
Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and his management team will remain in place. Whitehurst will join IBM’s senior management team and report to Rometty.
IBM will maintain Red Hat’s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, and its facilities, brands and practices, and said it will operate as a distinct unit within IBM. Rometty said no job or cost cuts are planned at Red Hat.
IBM closed down 0.9 percent at $139.33.
The companies said IBM and Red Hat will offer ""a next-generation hybrid multicloud platform"" that will be ""based on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes.""
IBM’s cloud strategy has focused on helping companies stitch together multiple cloud platforms rather than compete head-on with ""hyperscale"" cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN); Microsoft; and Alphabet Inc’s Google (O:GOOGL).
IBM said Red Hat will continue ""to build and expand its partnerships, including those with major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).""
Since 2013, IBM’s cloud revenue as a percentage of total revenue has grown sixfold to 25 percent. In the 12 months through the first quarter of 2019, cloud revenue exceeded $19 billion.

Red Hat is expected to contribute approximately two points of compound annual revenue growth over a five-year period, IBM said.

(Reuters) - The auditor of a small company owned by metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta resigned saying it could not agree with the valuation of assets, according to a letter filed with the UK corporate register, Companies House.
MHA MacIntyre Hudson said it was stepping down as auditor of Liberty Precision Tubes Ltd., which manufactures steel tubes, after failing to agree the extent to which the value of ""tangible fixed assets"" should be impaired, or the estimated value reduced, in the firm’s accounts for the year to the end of March 2018.  
The only tangible fixed assets listed in the accounts are plant and equipment.
""Our assessment of the impairment was significantly greater than the Company's assessment,"" said the letter, which was dated May 30 and made publicly available by Companies House in recent days.
The accounting firm didn't specify the gap between it and the company's assessment but said that the tube maker's profits for the year and net assets weren't affected.
The steel tube maker is a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty House Group, part of the GFG Alliance conglomerate that manages the industrial, finance and metals investments of the Gupta family.
Spokespeople for GFG, Liberty House Group and Liberty Precision Tubes were not immediately available for comment.
Liberty Precision Tubes had revenues of 24.7 million pounds ($30.8 million) for the year ended March 2018, the latest publicly-available accounts show. GFG has annual revenues in excess of $10 billion.
MHA MacIntyre Hudson, a mid-sized audit firm based in London, declined to comment. The financial year to the end of March 2018 would have been MHA MacIntyre Hudson's first time auditing the tube maker, accounts show.
GFG has grown rapidly in recent years, buying often troubled metals manufacturing facilities, including in the UK, Australia and the United States. To help fund acquisitions, GFG has raised billions of dollars via bond deals.
Concerns over bonds issued by GFG Alliance related to a biodiesel-fuelled power generating business prompted a whistle blower at Swiss asset manager GAM Holding AG to alert UK financial regulators, as previously reported by Reuters.
In February 2016, Liberty House Group purchased the assets of Caparo Precision Tubes Ltd, which had fallen into administration, for 2.3 million pounds, according to publicly-available financial statements.
That included paying 1.3 million for plant and equipment, which were revalued upon purchase and ascribed a value of 24.9 million pounds, according to company financial statements.
The auditor, in the letter, didn't say whether the amount it assessed the assets should have been written down by was greater than the 2.1 million-pound impairment that was recorded in the tube maker’s 2018 accounts, which were filed with Companies House last month after being audited by another firm, London-based King & King.
King & King was not immediately available for comment."

Airbus (PA:AIR) said it delivered 389 aircraft in the first half, confirming a figure first reported by Reuters on Friday.
Boeing (N:BA) reported a 37% drop in deliveries for the first half on Tuesday, due to the grounding of its best-selling jet in the wake of two fatal crashes.
Reuters reported last week that the first-half total of 389 aircraft would put Airbus on course to beat Boeing in 2019 but leave it with a record production task in the second half amid continued industrial snags at a Hamburg plant.
Les Echos reported on Monday that Airbus was shaving an internal delivery target, while maintaining its published guidance of 880-890 aircraft for 2019.
Airbus posted 88 net orders for the first half, easily outpacing Boeing which had a negative net total of 119 aircraft because it had more cancellations than orders during the period.
The European company was ahead on orders of narrow-body jets such as the newly launched A321XLR, which got its commercial debut with a stronger than expected tally at last month's Paris Airshow, but remained behind on larger wide-body models.
Airbus posted 123 net narrow-body orders in the first half, compared with Boeing's minus 180, while Boeing won the wide-body category with a positive total of 61 orders against Airbus' negative tally of 35 wide-bodies after cancellations.
The figures do not include a surprise letter of intent for 200 Boeing 737 MAX planes announced by British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) at last month's Paris air show."
894,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>","Traders Are Certain the Fed Will Cut in July, But Unsure What’s Next","(Bloomberg) -- Lurking beyond traders’ apparently unwavering confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates this month is a more nebulous outlook on what the central bank does afterward.
Traders are still pricing a full quarter-point decrease in July, yet they have slowly scaled back views on how much easing takes place for all of 2019 -- pushing expectations down to 64 basis points from about 80 basis points just about two weeks ago. Yet even as the amount of easing priced in has been dialed back, eurodollar options traders have in fact, since last week, favored fading the rebound in interest rates and have been buying contracts that profit if Fed officials reduce rates beyond just their July 30-31 policy meeting.
“The market collectively thinks there’s a cut coming this month because the Fed has basically said there will be,” Kit Juckes, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, said by phone. “But to think there’s a big string of cuts coming after that you have to believe in a serious economic downturn and that’s not clear -- especially after the June labor data.”
The addition of 224,000 jobs in June, far more than economists expected, seems to make it less urgent for the Fed to take aggressive action. Dealings in eurodollar options after July 5’s jobs report show that traders have put aside views that a half a percentage point reduction by the Fed was possible this month (a quarter-point is now seen as a lock).
Traders are eyeing more guidance on the policy path this week as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell starts his two-day testimony to Congress Wednesday, the same day that minutes from the central bank’s last gathering will be released.
“Powell might strike a ‘cautiously optimistic’ tone (possibly, a slight disappointment for ‘doves’), but the economy’s more gripping risks suggest further interest rate cuts are in the offing,” wrote John Herrmann at MUFG Securities in a note Tuesday."
895,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Trump Is Defeating His Own Nafta Replacement,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s getting harder and harder to imagine the new Nafta successfully ratified during this Congress. And Donald Trump has only himself to blame for that.
For one thing, the White House strategy on getting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ratified is still incoherent at best. As Bloomberg’s Jenny Leonard reports, there are at least two factions, surrounding Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, with different ideas of how to get it done. That’s not counting whatever acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who threw a grenade into the mix back in April, currently thinks. And as we all know, even if everyone else was on the same page, the disrupter-in-chief can undermine any kind of strategic approach with an impatient tweet based on whatever he sees on Fox News or hears from whoever he happens to talk to.
The biggest problem, however, is probably that the entire Trump political operation is dedicated to keeping his strongest supporters happy and ignoring everyone else. Jamelle Bouie has an excellent column out on what this means in terms of direct appeals to swing voters. But it’s possible that it’s even more of a problem – for Trump – at the elite level.
In part that’s because Trump’s relentlessly partisan, campaign-never-stops presidency makes it difficult for Democrats to work with him. It’s not so much that they take it personally; while it doesn’t help, politicians are usually pretty good at putting such things aside. But since their constituents are constantly being riled up by one or another thing that Trump has done, working with him is more likely to earn criticism from supporters than it is to earn praise for bipartisanship from swing voters. The closer the 2020 election, the more Democrats are going to be reluctant to hand Trump any wins to campaign on – and, if the election looks promising for them, the closer to the possibility of a Democrat renegotiating the treaty to protect their party’s preferences.
The lack of progress on a trade deal is partly explained by Trump consistently putting both partisanship and personal vendettas ahead of policy achievements. What have Trump’s priorities been for the last couple of weeks? Not the trade treaty, but finding a way to place a citizenship question on the census. That’s a partisan goal. And before that, Trump reportedly spent a great deal of time personally designing his Fourth of July “Salute to America.”
Actually getting the agreement negotiated did seem to be a high priority for Trump. But for whatever reasons, finding a way to get it through Congress has never really appeared to interest him.
The basic problem with Congressional support for the treaty remains the same. Benefits from free-trade agreements are broadly shared but relatively invisible; costs of these treaties are localized and highly visible. Not only that, but the nature of international negotiations, especially on trade, are such that opponents of any agreement always have plausible policy reasons for doing so. It’s always easy to point to things that tougher negotiations theoretically could have obtained. Indeed, that’s always been Trump’s criticism of trade agreements: Not that the U.S. should not have such treaties, but that the existing ones weren’t favorable enough, because of poor negotiating.
Trade has become more popular since Trump was elected. He could use that! If the president put in the effort and organized a real campaign on the Hill, there’s every possibility that he could win on this. But the only campaign he’s ever showed interest in is the one for re-election, and without strong leadership from the White House, it’s getting difficult to imagine Congress acting on this one."
896,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:04PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Square Soars as Raymond James Abandons Bearish Outlook,"Investing.com - Square (NYSE:SQ) surged Tuesday after Raymond James upgraded its outlook on the stock, abandoning its bearish outlook on payments company, citing a more balanced risk-reward profile. 
Raymond James upgraded its rating on Square (NYSE:SQ) to market perform from underperform, sending its shares more than 6% higher. The stock is up about 40% this year.
The positive upgrade from the brokerage marked a pivot from its bearish outlook earlier in the year, when it downgraded Square (NYSE:SQ) to underperform, predicting a lack of growth opportunities for the fintech company. 
But the headwinds facing the company are now baked into the Square's shares, which trade below its peers. 
There are “concerns that the magnitude of the top-line beats would likely wane, and more importantly, the deceleration in second-quarter organic growth could catch some investors by surprise,” Raymond James said. But following the company's “smallest revenue beat in recent memory in 1Q, a 2Q guide that came in below expectations, and a now well-telegraphed margin cadence, the negative catalysts have mostly played out, and the stock has lagged peers.""
The brokerage also hailed the company’s business-to-business seller card offering, which was ""gaining traction"" and could provide enough momentum to exceed expectations in second half of the year.
Raymond James is not alone in its praise for the company’s B2B seller card offering, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) saying last month it believes Square (NYSE:SQ) can keep delivering the growth required to maintain its lofty valuation partly driven by its business debit card. 
The card allows businesses to access its sales revenue immediately, without the need to wait for bank transfers.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>",Emissions rules and electric shift to spur car engines M&A,"By Arno Schuetze, Edward Taylor and Ben Klayman
FRANKFURT/DETROIT (Reuters) - A growing understanding in the car industry of the value of combustion engine technology able to meet new anti-pollution requirements is likely to fuel a wave of consolidation in the next two years, industry executives and bankers say.
Mergers and acquisitions have been stuck in a rut since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was caught cheating pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global tightening of emissions regulations that depressed the value of petrol and diesel technologies.
But the market is beginning to separate companies capable of meeting new emissions standards from those struggling to do so, which could close the gap in price expectations between buyers and sellers over the next 12-24 months, industry experts say.
The auto industry has all but stopped developing next-generation combustion engines as limited resources are directed towards building electric and self-driving cars.
However, electric vehicles are still a niche product, accounting for only 1.26 million - or 1.5 percent - of the 86 million cars sold worldwide last year, and analysts forecast it will be the middle of the next decade before a tipping point comes when electric cars overtake combustion-engined variants.
That means there will still be demand for emissions-compliant combustion engines and so manufacturers and suppliers able to offer that are likely to see valuations recover, said Reinhard Kuehn, co-head of European Automotive at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""At the same time, suppliers that struggle with this will remain a hard sell,"" Kuehn said.
Meanwhile, as production capacity of petrol and diesel engines is cut back, the impetus for mergers among suppliers should increase, bankers believe.
Germany's Volkswagen, one of the largest manufacturers of petrol and diesel engines, has said it will develop its final generation of combustion engines by 2026, while U.S. rival Ford (N:F) last month said it would close two engine factories in Europe.
""The profit pool of companies with combustion engine-related technology – once the envy of the industry – is shrinking with the rise of electric vehicles and the digitization of the industry,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) managing director Axel Hoefer said. ""You would expect someone to come in and consolidate to benefit from economies of scale.""
Volkswagen is now warning its suppliers to prepare industry-wide solutions for winding down combustion-engine manufacturing as it ramps up mass production of electric vehicles.
The company is retooling 16 factories to build electric vehicles and plans to start producing 33 different electric cars under the Skoda, Audi, VW and Seat brands by mid-2023, transforming the industry's supply chain.
""It makes no sense to have factories running at only 40% capacity,"" Stefan Sommer, Volkswagen's procurement head, told Reuters. ""The auto industry is obliged to develop structures to consolidate combustion engine assets, to decide where to bundle certain activities.""
""If we end up with uncontrolled insolvencies, it will be a problem for the industry,"" he said.
MISMATCH
There are more than 120 plants making combustion engine components in Europe, according to consulting firm AlixPartners.
German auto industry association VDA says 436,000 jobs are tied to building petrol and diesel engines in Germany alone.
Demand for compliant combustion engine assets has already triggered consolidation among carmakers themselves - PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) takeover of General Motors' (N:GM) Opel business in 2017 was driven by that issue.
""With emissions regulation getting more stringent, particularly in Europe, some manufacturers are getting left behind in terms of their ability to develop compliant engines,"" Franciscus van Meel, BMW's (DE:BMWG) head of vehicle development, told Reuters.
Until recently, deals have still proved difficult to do because of lingering disagreements over valuations. U.S. group Dana (N:DAN) late in 2018 launched the sale of its European head gasket business, a key component for combustion engines, people close to the matter said. With the help of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) it invited suitors to bid, but pulled the auction several weeks later due to muted interest. The sale of Germany's closely-held Ifa Group, a maker of shafts mainly used in combustion engine-powered cars, was announced a year ago, but never got over the finishing line. Among the few suitors was China's Wanxiang, but differences on pricing proved insurmountable, people close to the talks said.
""The main problem is that buyers' and sellers' price expectations don't match,"" KPMG partner Juergen Schlangenotto said.
""A seller typically says: I have a robust order book and good margins so I want a valuation of 6 times EBITDA (annual core earnings), while a buyer says there’s no long-term growth so I am paying 4 times.""
A fresh test of interest in combustion engine assets will be the sale of engine parts and gear box parts maker Tekfor. Private equity owner KKR is in talks with a Chinese buyer, according to people close to the matter.
James Kamsickas, CEO of U.S. drivetrain supplier Dana, believes internal combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) demand could persist for many years.
""People are overbaking a little bit on how much the internal combustion engine is just going to go away,"" he told Reuters.
""If anything, I'm a very strong advocate that it's going to be a world of hybridization for the next 15 years. Last time I checked, that still requires an ICE."""

907,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 01:01PM ET</span>",NYSE to help Israel create secondary tech stock exchange,"By Steven Scheer
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have begun talks on setting up a secondary stock exchange for high-tech companies in Israel that would compete with venture capital funds.
Israel has a bustling technology sector but most start-ups and established companies opt for private sources of funding rather than tap the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), whose regulations are deemed too stringent for smaller firms.
According to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center and ZAG law firm, Israeli private high-tech firms raised a record $6.47 billion in 2018, up 17 percent from 2017.
Senior Israeli Finance Ministry officials met with NYSE executives in New York this week to discuss creating the secondary market, which would help finance tech companies at their earliest stages, as well as other financial issues.
""This is an expression of confidence by the world's strongest stock exchange in Israel's economy,"" said Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon.
Shai Babad, director general of the ministry, said the two sides did not discuss details of the bourse's model given that talks are in the early stages but that the hope would be that the new exchange would be a unit of the NYSE.
""What we agreed on is how we can make it happen,"" he said. ""There are a lot of accessible investors looking to pursue the high tech sector in Israel.""
Babad noted large demand in Israel for early stage financing of high tech firms. ""High tech companies will be able to raise money, not just abroad and from foreign investors, but they can have a stock exchange to raise money with relatively low regulations and bureaucratic requirements,"" he said.
""It will be just as easy for high tech companies to raise money on a secondary exchange as it is with venture capital.
""The advantage for the NYSE is that they already get to target Israeli companies at the initial stage, and when those companies grow up, then they can go to a listing,"" he added.
The TASE and the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) have long tried to lure tech firms to the stock exchange with little success. Establishing a secondary market would be part of a broader strategy by the ISA, Israel's securities regulator, to create secondary and digital stock markets.
ISA chairwoman Anat Guetta said her goal for the future was to lay the foundations today to shape an innovative and relevant stock exchange. ""We are working to examine the establishment of digital markets in Israel,"" she said.
Babad also said he met with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) president Rob Kapito about breaking down barriers in Israel to invest in infrastructure projects, a sector controlled by the banks.
Separately, financial regulators of Israel and New York State said they had agreed to cooperate in financial services technology."

913,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Germany's Bayer seeks animal health merger with Elanco - sources,"By Arno Schuetze and Pamela Barbaglia
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) has approached U.S. drug firm  Elanco Animal Health  (N:ELAN) to discuss a possible combination of their pet-health businesses to create an industry giant, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The two companies are working with banks to ensure any merger would secure regulatory approval, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Bayer has delayed the launch of an auction to private equity funds to clinch a bilateral deal with Elanco, the fourth-largest player in the animal health industry globally, the sources said.
The German drugmaker is under pressure to raise cash and boost its share price after its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine. Aside from Elanco, its bigger rivals are former  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) unit Zoetis, unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which bought animal health assets from Sanofi (PA:SASY), and drugmaker Merck & Co.
Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said in November his company would divest several assets including its animal health division, which analysts have said could fetch 6 billion to 7 billion euros ($6.7 billion-$7.8 billion).
The sources said discussions with Elanco were at an early stage and Bayer remained interested in receiving bids from private equity investors later this year.
An auction process was initially expected to start in June but Bayer would only dispatch information packages to prospective bidders towards the end of the summer, they said.
A Bayer spokesman said the firm was ""progressing as planned"" with efforts to separate the animal health business.
""After the strategic review of the possibilities, the main focus is on a sale,"" he said, adding Bayer continued to ""consider all value-maximising options."" He declined to comment on Elanco.
Elanco, which also declined to comment on any deal, offers more than 125 products to veterinarians and food animal producers in more than 90 countries.
The company, based in Greenfield in the U.S. state of Indiana, has a market value of $12 billion but it might struggle to finance an outright acquisition of Bayer's unit unless the German drugmaker decided to retain a stake in the combined entity, two sources said.
Elanco inherited a significant amount of debt from its previous owner Eli Lilly (N:LLY), which spun it off last year.
As of December, it had about $2.5 billion of overall senior debt. In its annual report, it warned investors about the risk of failing to generate sufficient cash to service all its debts.
The sources said an all-cash sale to Elanco was unlikely, adding Bayer would need to keep a stake in the merged company to secure a deal.
Private equity firms may offer an easier exit for the German group but they are expected to value the company at a much lower price due to its declining business, the sources said.
Buyout funds had tried to take control of Elanco when it was part of Eli Lilly but the company opted for a more lucrative spin-off and listed the business in New York where it trades at about 20 times earnings.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 11:26AM ET</span>","ABB's Voser battles headwinds as pursues overhaul, new CEO","By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (S:ABBN) is pressing ahead with a review of its underperforming businesses and expects a customer slowdown and China-U.S. trade tensions to mean a turbulent year, its Chairman and interim Chief Executive Peter Voser told Reuters.
The Swiss engineering company is in a ""heavy-lifting phase"", Voser said, completing the separation and sale of its power grids business to Hitachi, and on Tuesday announcing a deal to quit solar energy inverters.
Businesses which generate $3 billion of revenue, 11% of ABB's total annual sales, are now under review and could be sold off or closed down, Voser told Reuters.
""We have under review some $3 billion of revenues and this solar divestment will be part of it,"" he said.
ABB expects a turbulent 2019, with the automotive sector's troubles hitting the industrial robot and drive maker, although demand from the food and beverages sector remains resilient.
""There are clear headwinds in some of the end markets we are operating in, therefore in some of the businesses we see a slowdown,"" Voser said in an interview at ABB's Zurich head office, his first since taking over as interim CEO.
""But it is not just an economic slowdown, there are also geopolitical issues ... it is hard to forecast how long it could go on for.""
Economic data has shown faltering factory output in Europe and concerns that U.S.-Chinese tensions will hurt economic growth.
Voser, a former CEO of Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), took over as temporary boss at ABB following the sudden exit of Ulrich Spiesshofer in April.
""2019 will be a year when a lot of factors will work themselves into our results: some stranded costs, the Power Grids carve out and other portfolio decisions and some slowing down in end markets,"" Voser said.
""2020 will be calmer... there will be a competitive improvement after that.""
'CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT'
The 61-year-old Swiss national, who was ABB's finance chief in the early 2000s, said he was determined to improve the performance of ABB, whose share price has underperformed rivals like  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Schneider Electric (PA:SCH).
""Our operational performance over the last few years has not been satisfactory,"" Voser said. ""Let's not dance around this issue, others have performed better.
""Many investors are in a wait-and-see position at this stage, looking to us to deliver. I think you will see continuous improvement delivered by our employees in the businesses and this will come faster than many expect.""
Voser said there was no need to sell whole businesses, although parts - which run from circuit breakers to digital sensors and software - would be examined, and some could be sold.
Acquisitions could strengthen its remaining divisions - electrification, industrial automation, motion and robotics and discrete automation.
""Some small- and medium-size additions to some of the portfolios we already have make sense, like it also may make sense to get rid of a few,"" he said, although ABB would not carry out ""mega"" acquisitions.
ABB needs to improve sales to get better margins, Voser said, although there would be no new corporate cost cutting programs.
""We have continuously improved on the cost side but not on growth. We didn’t grow enough in the past,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Voser continues to look for a new CEO, a search which he said was running ahead of plan without saying when he expected to make an appointment.
He wanted someone with an industrial background, with the ideal candidate given time to improve ABB's fortunes.
""I think the tenure needs to be a minimum of five years, as the new CEO needs time to implement what we have started."""
915,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 11:17AM ET</span>","U.S. billionaire Ross Perot, who shook up presidential politics in the 1990s, dead at 89","By Bill Trott
(Reuters) - H. Ross Perot, the feisty Texas technology billionaire who rattled U.S. politics with two independent presidential campaigns in the 1990s that struck a chord with disgruntled voters, died on Tuesday at the age of 89, his family said.
""Ross Perot, the ground-breaking businessman and loving husband, brother, father and grandfather, passed away early Tuesday at his home in Dallas, surrounded by his devoted family,"" the Perot family said in a statement. A family spokesman said leukemia was the cause of death.
Perot's fortune was estimated at $4.1 billion by Forbes magazine in April 2019.
Perot was a natural salesman who made a fortune in computer services but he was an unlikely and unconventional politician. He was short with buzz-top haircut, spoke with a folksy Texas drawl and had protruding ears that even he joked about. He was blunt and assertive and his success in business made him accustomed to getting his way.
Perot was so gung-ho that when two of his employees were jailed in Iran in 1978, he organized a team of commandos from his employees and hired a former Green Beret colonel to break them out.
Perot leaped into the 1992 presidential race as an independent and quickly found a lode of Americans turned off by the Republican and Democratic parties. His overarching issue was curbing the government's deficit spending - an issue he referred to as the ""crazy aunt in the basement"" who no one wanted to talk about.
His outsider campaign, much of it financed by his own money, featured 30-minute television ""infomercials."" With his charts, self-deprecating humor and down-home economic remedies, Perot led a Gallup Poll five months before the election with 39 percent, compared to 31 percent for incumbent Republican George H.W. Bush and 25 percent for Democrat Bill Clinton.
SURPRISE WITHDRAWAL
A month later, however, Perot stunned the political world by withdrawing from the race. He re-entered several weeks later saying he had dropped out because Republican tricksters had been plotting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.
Perot finished with a respectable 19 percent of the vote in the presidential election, trailing Clinton's 43 percent and Bush's 37.5 percent.
Perot stayed active in politics by speaking out against the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying it would create a ""giant sucking sound"" of American jobs going to Mexico.
For his 1996 White House run, Perot started the Reform Party but captured little more than 8 percent of the popular vote, as well as causing a rift in the political movement he founded.
Many voters said they had come to perceive Perot as overbearing, volatile, paranoid and egotistical - even if they had liked his ideas.
By 2000, Perot had mostly faded from the national political radar.
Henry Ross Perot was born on June 27, 1930, in Texarkana, Texas, and raised in the height of the Depression. He graduated in 1953 from the U.S. Naval Academy, where he first learned about computers.
After his naval service, Perot joined  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) as a computer salesman in 1957 and quickly made a reputation for himself. In 1962 he met his yearly sales quota by Jan. 19.
Disenchanted that his bosses did not like his ideas, Perot started his own company, Electronic Data Systems Inc in Dallas, a move that would make him a billionaire by age 38 by handling data processing for customers such as the Medicare system, NASA and other government entities.
SELLS COMPANY TO GM
When General Motors (NYSE:GM) bought controlling interest in EDS in 1984, Perot became the largest single shareholder of the world's largest corporation. But he quickly clashed with top GM officials and two years later was paid $900 million to quit the GM board and relinquish control of EDS.
In 1988 Perot started another data company, Perot Systems Corp. He took time off from the company for his political forays but when he returned to it in 1998 he saw the company's profits nearly quadruple and long-term debt slashed by about half. He turned the company over to son Ross Jr. and Dell bought it in 2009 for $3.9 billion.
Perot said he liked to hire military veterans, especially those with combat experience, because of their leadership ability and ability to deal with pressure. American prisoners of war and those listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War became a key issue for Perot and he made several trips to Vietnam on their behalf.
At the Perot Systems headquarters he kept mementoes, including his childhood bicycle and a walking stick believed to have belonged to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 
One section of the building was dedicated to the rescue of two EDS workers imprisoned in Tehran on suspicion of bribery before the shah of Iran was overthrown in 1978. According to the non-fiction book ""On Wings of Eagles"" by Ken Follett, an Iranian EDS employee helped lead a revolutionary mob's attack on the prison, allowing the EDS employees to escape.
They were then sneaked out of the country, along with other EDS employees.
In 1984 Perot's foundation purchased a copy of the Magna Carta dating to 1297 for $1.5 million. It was sold in 2007 for $21.3 million.

Perot's survivors include his wife, Margot, who he married in 1956. They had five children.

Shares of Apple were flat at $199.70.
Apple has been focusing more on its Services unit, which includes sales from iCloud, the App Store and other businesses, as smartphone sales show signs of slowing down. 
The services business accounted for 20% of Apple's $58.02 billion revenue in the second quarter, up from 16% a year earlier. The App Store is a key driver of Apple's services segment, which brought in $37.1 billion in revenue last year. 
Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani expects total App Store developer revenue to grow 18% to about $9 billion in the third quarter. Apple is due to report quarterly results on July 30. 
""We think there is likely upside ahead when it comes to services revenues in the June-quarter, driven by a sizable acceleration in China-centric markets,"" said Daryanani, who has a 3-star rating for accuracy of estimates on Apple, according to Refinitiv data.
The iPhone maker earned nearly 18% of its revenue from Greater China in the quarter ended March.
But, Apple still gets more than 50% of its revenue from iPhone sales.
Wall Street analysts expect consumers to hold off upgrading their iPhones until Apple's expected launch of a 5G-enabled smartphone in the second half of 2020.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) directive, which formalizes an instruction from the manufacturer itself, covers part of the outer wing on the 25 oldest aircraft, which first went into service in 2007 with Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL).
Airbus said the safety of the aircraft was not affected.
""We confirm that small cracks have been found on the outer rear wing spars of early production A380 aircraft. We have identified the issue and designed an inspection and repair scheme."" an Airbus spokesman said.
The repairs, which must be carried out within 15 years of the initial wing box assembly, can be carried out during scheduled heavy maintenance visits, he added.
EASA in its directive said the condition, if not detected and corrected, could reduce the structural integrity of the wing.
Emirates, the world's largest A380 operator, has started checks on nine of its superjumbos and ""so far, there has been nothing untoward in the findings,"" a spokeswoman said. 
The Dubai-based carrier has 111 A380s in its fleet. 
Singapore Airlines is to inspect four of its A380s, while Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways said its A380s were newer models and not affected. 

In 2012, Airbus was forced to carry out A380 inspections and devise a costly repair program after cracks were found on part of the wings, the world's largest for a passenger plane.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank shares extended losses on Tuesday on investor doubts that its chief executive can revive the lender by shrinking the investment bank and returning to its roots as banker to corporate Germany.
Christian Sewing, CEO for just over a year, and his finance chief are on week-long roadshow to explain the restructuring. To underline his commitment, Sewing plans to invest a quarter of his fixed salary -- around 820,000 euros -- in Deutsche shares, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Deutsche's stock price has fallen 10 percent since Sunday's restructuring announcement to cut 18,000 jobs in a 7.4 billion euro ($8.3 billion) ""reinvention"". It is the biggest two-day decline in almost three years.
By 1312 GMT, shares were down 3.8% on the day, after sliding as much as 6.5% earlier. The bank's bonds also fell.
Analysts and investors say Sewing, who joined Deutsche Bank in 1989, is right to cut back its trading desks but question if he can make his plan work when interest rates are still low and U.S. banks have expanded their share of the German market.
""There seems to be some concerns around the plan details, particularly the ability for the bank to retain revenues while cutting costs,"" one of the bank's top 25 shareholders told Reuters, citing worries the bank would need fresh equity to execute Sewing's plan.
Analysts with RBC Capital Markets wrote that the bank's outlook for revenue growth was ""ambitious"" and there was a high degree of risk associated with implementing the plan.
Ratings agency Fitch, which last month downgraded the bank to ""BBB"" status, the lowest investment-grade, echoed this.
""Cutting back volatile, capital-intensive and underperforming sales and trading activities, and further reducing the cost base should improve profitability and strengthen leverage, but execution risks are high,"" it said.
JOB CUTS
Deutsche plans to return closer to its roots by focusing on corporate banking and asset and wealth management, areas that can offer more stable revenues than investment banking but are increasingly competitive.
The bank began cutting jobs in its trading business on Monday, with staff laid off in offices stretching from Sydney to New York.
Sewing, promising to make a break with a past of Deutsche's ""over-promising and under-delivering"", told analysts on Monday that his plan was a ""real game changer"".
At least one big investor is sold on the proposals.
Douglas Braunstein, who holds an 3.1% share in Deutsche through his New York-based Hudson Executive Capital, said it would take a while for the market to appreciate what Deutsche Bank is doing.
""Going back to basics for this 150-year old company is ultimately going to be a very successful strategic decision,"" he said on CNBC.
However, Deutsche Bank's capital instruments took a further hit on Tuesday, with a US dollar Additional Tier 1 (AT1) perpetual instrument callable in Nov 2021 dropping as much as 2.4 cents on the dollar to 84.62; setting the yield at a hefty 30.4%.
The euro-denominated debt also suffered losses with a perpetual AT1 bond callable in May 2027 falling 1.5 cents to 86.56, with the yield rising to 11.89%. < DE107205454=>"
924,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>",Casino's parent Rallye shares slump after court backs SocGen,"By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in debt-burdened  Rallye  (PA:GENC) slumped on Tuesday after a French court ruled that  Societe Generale  can call in collateral it owns in Casino's (PA:CASP) parent, in what is seen as a blow to controlling shareholder Jean-Charles Naouri.
 Casino  Chairman and Chief Executive Naouri in May placed the retailer's parent companies Rallye, Finatis and  Fonciere Euris  under protection from creditors in a bid to save the group from collapse.
Under that safeguard procedure the servicing of bank and bond debt was suspended for at least six months while the group worked to reorganise its debt and potentially reschedule it by up to 10 years.
On Monday, Fonciere Euris (PA:LOEX), which owns 59.5 % of Rallye, which in turn owns 51.7% of Casino, said in a statement that a Paris commercial court had lifted a ban preventing Societe Generale (PA:SOGN) from calling in collateral it had on 1,770,000 shares in Rallye, or 3.4 percent of its capital.
Fonciere Euris had pledged the Rallye shares under a derivatives contract it entered with Societe Generale in 2014.
After the safeguard procedure was announced, Fonciere Euris tried to prevent Societe Generale from calling in the collateral and this was provisionally granted.
However, the latest court ruling dated July 4 cancels that ban.
If Societe Generale decides to use its collateral, this would thus lower Fonciere Euris' stake in Rallye.
Socgen declined to comment on the court decision and Fonciere Euris was not available for further comment.
By 1203 GMT, Rallye shares were down 6%, Fonciere Euris shares were off 5% while Casino shares were roughly stable.
""It seems some banks are no longer prepared to give time to Jean-Charles Naouri. This shows the growing defiance of some banks towards the dossier,"" said one analyst, who asked to remain anonymous.
""That said, it's a forward contract whose terms and legal framework are very specific. I do not think one can extrapolate this court decision to other traditional bank financings or to the safeguard procedure,"" he added.
French retailer Casino has been struggling to improve its profitability in a tough business climate, raising concerns of its ability to pay off the debt of Rallye through dividends.
While Casino itself was not placed under bankruptcy protection, it was hit with downgrades that left its credit rating deeper in junk territory, with Moody's and S&P both citing the company's strong connections with its overly indebted parents.
Casino has already canceled its interim dividend and has pledged to accelerate asset sales in a bid to reduce debt.
Casino's net debt stood at 2.708 billion euros and that of Rallye at 2.899 billion euros at the end of 2018."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers is proposing to revive talks on a plan to pool the debt of euro zone countries, three EU sources told Reuters on Tuesday, in a bid to reduce the shortage of triple-A rated bonds in the bloc.
The plan aims to overcome opposition to the idea of a euro zone safe asset by offering reluctant states the prospect of making government bond holdings more expensive for banks - thus limiting their exposure.
The proposal by Eurogroup President Mario Centeno was received ""with caution"" by finance ministers at a meeting on Monday, the sources said.
A persistent shortage of triple-A rated bonds has kept momentum for a pooled euro zone sovereign bond alive despite opposition from Germany. The euro zone's largest economy has so far rejected any proposal that could potentially leave its taxpayers on the hook for the debts of other countries.
At Monday's meeting, Centeno proposed to set up three working groups to address contentious issues that have so far prevented a reform of the euro zone, officials said, suggesting they conclude their work by December.
One group would focus on the ""Regulatory Treatment of Sovereign Exposures"", the officials said. Debt of euro zone countries is currently considered risk-free - favourable treatment compared with other securities that has encouraged banks to pile up sovereign bonds in their balance sheets.
Lenders mostly buy debt from their own countries, exposing them to market pressure when governments' fiscal policies are seen as imprudent - that is the so-called doom-loop that worsened the euro zone's financial crisis in the last decade and it is still a major concern for high-debt nations.
The average European bank now has sovereign debt exposure equal to 170% of its core tier one capital, a key measure of a bank's financial strength, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysis. That is more than triple the exposure of U.S banks.
Germany and other states with lower debts want to end the doom-loop by making sovereign bonds' holdings more expensive for banks, forcing them to set aside capital against sovereign debt risks.
This is however opposed by states like Italy who have large portions of their high debts stacked on domestic banks. They fear such a move would increase yields on their bonds, causing risks to financial sustainability.
SAFE ASSET
To persuade high-debt states, Centeno proposed to ministers that they discuss the reviewed treatment of government bonds together with a plan to pool part of the debt of euro zone countries.
States that are most indebted have low credit ratings, which make their bonds more expensive and prevent their sale to large investors.
The share of the safest, triple-A rated sovereign bonds that come from the euro zone has dropped from about half before the financial crisis to around 25% currently, as the rating of public debt in several euro zone states deteriorated.
By pooling some of the euro zone debt, the overall rating of the bloc's bonds would rise. This would attract more liquidity to the euro zone and could strengthen the role of the euro as a reserve currency challenging the dollar dominance, supporters of the plan say.
Germany has long opposed the idea of a safe asset, fearing it would increase its debt servicing costs, while Italy backs the idea.
At Monday's meeting, ""a couple"" of countries confirmed their opposition to discussing safe assets, but work will start anyway on the matter, officials said.
Centeno proposed to tackle the issue in the context of the wider reform of the euro zone, which would also include separate discussions on common insurance for bank depositors - another plan that has been blocked for years - and on clarifications of banks' capital requirements in their home states and in those where they have subsidiaries."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell for a third straight day on Tuesday after a stinging warning from German chemicals giant BASF about the effects of the global trade war and as hopes dwindled of a hefty U.S. interest rate cut this month.
With global macroeconomic clouds looming and markets waiting for policy signals from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday, the focus of headlines and sentiment turned to three individual heavyweight stocks. 
For Europe, it was an almost 7% early slump in German chemicals giant BASF after it had blamed a global slowdown and trade war between the United States and China for what one trader described as a ""shocking"" 30% profit warning.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) tumbled another 4% too - having already dropped 5.4% the previous day after it axed 18,000 staff - while Apple's overnight drop of more than 2% on Wall Street after a broker downgrade dragged both global tech sectors lower. (EU)
""Both from a bottom-up and top-down perspective, equity market valuations appear far too ambitious,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a note.
It was particularly stark, they said, as the U.S. business cycle was in a downturn and both forward-looking indicators such as global PMIs and global trade are now in contraction territory. 
""Indeed, companies have begun cutting their 2019 profit forecasts, citing the trade conflict as a reason,"" MS added. 
In the currency markets, Britain's pound was threatening to slip to a more than 2-year low against the dollar and a 6-month trough versus the euro amid a worsening UK economic outlook and rising fears about a no-deal Brexit. [GBP/]
With the key $1.25 level against the dollar giving way in early Asian trade, traders quickly pushed the British currency down half a percent and it barely budged, even as opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn inched closer to backing a second Brexit referendum.
The broader theme though remained the potential reaction to the weaker global outlook from the world's top central banks, especially on what Fed chairman Powell will say during a testimony and grilling from Congress on Wednesday. [FED/DIARY] 
Money market futures <0#FF:> are still fully pricing in a 25 basis point (bps) cut at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting, but have almost priced out a larger 50 bps move that had been seen as a real possibility just a couple of weeks ago. 
Benchmark government bond yields were clawing away from their recent lows [GVD/EUR] and the dollar changed hands at 108.81 yen to build on the more than month high it had set in the previous session.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was also higher at 97.550, while the euro drooped back under $1.12 for the first since mid June. [/FRX]
""It would be pretty disruptive at this stage for Powell to rule out a cut in July or dampen expectations of a cut in July,"" said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
""The last few Fed speakers, albeit non-voting speakers, have suggested July is not a done deal ... and even now, if you look at economists' forecasts, there is not a consensus that there will be a move, and yet the market is 100% priced."" 
TRADE STRAINS
Wall Street looked set to follow Europe and Asia lower with futures markets indicating falls of around 0.5% for the main S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq bourses.
The United States and China are set to relaunch trade talks this week after a two-month hiatus, but a year after their trade war began there is little sign their differences have narrowed.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.45% but pared earlier losses, having traded at its lowest level since June 19.
Chinese blue-chips ended down 0.25%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.75%. Japan's Nikkei put up the only resistance as gains in a few heavyweights in the index helped it edge up 0.15%. (T)
Apple's suppliers, such as Murata Manufacturing and Taiyo Yuden, fell 2% and 4%, however, after Rosenblatt Securities cited a ""fundamental deterioration"" for the U.S. gadget giant over the next 6-12 months.
In Greater China, suppliers from Hon Hai to AAC Tech also lost between 1.4% and 3.1% and in Europe Infineon, ASM and STMicroelectronics slipped about 2%. (EU) 
Among commodities, oil prices firmed after a dip in Asia as as OPEC supply cuts and Middle East tensions outweighed the U.S.-China trade dispute that has been dragging down the global economy and oil demand.
OPEC and its allies agreed last week to extend their supply-cutting deal until March 2020. Brent has risen almost 20% in 2019 supported by the pact and also tensions in the Middle East, especially concerns about the row over Iran's nuclear program.
Benchmark Brent crude rose 59 cents to $64.70 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up 46 cents to $58.12. [O/R]
""OPEC and its allies are doing their best to support the market,"" said Tamas Varga, an analyst with PVM. ""Oil prices are to hold up reasonably well during coming months or at least they are not to fall out of bed.""
Gold prices ticked lower though as the dollar scaled its multi-week highs. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,393.03 per ounce and U.S. gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,395.70 an ounce.

The 33.8 million pounds ($42.1 million) sale represents a fraction of Shell's $261 billion market value.
But it is a rebuke of Shell's strategy less than a year after the Anglo-Dutch company, together with a large group of investors including Sarasin known as Climate Action 100+, agreed on a landmark resolution outlining Shell's ambition to reduce carbon emissions.
Sarasin is reviewing its remaining holdings in Shell of around 120 million pounds, according to a spokesman.
""We have been supportive of your recent leadership in support of the Paris Climate Accord,"" Sarasin said in a July 8 letter to Shell Chairman Chad Holliday, seen by Reuters.
""However, we were extremely disappointed that, despite your public commitment to act on climate change, the strategy that Shell published at its Management Day on 4th June aims to deliver rising fossil fuel production to at least 2030.""
Shell plans to increase its annual spending between 2021 and 2025 to $30 billion, excluding major acquisitions, compared with around $25 billion in recent years. Of the $30 billion, $2 to $3 billion will go towards power and renewables.
""While Shell cannot, of course, bring down global fossil fuel use on its own, it needs to ensure it is not contributing to the problem,"" the letter said.
News of the sale was first reported by the Financial Times.
Shell said the divestment was ""disappointing"".
""Shell plans to reduce the Net Carbon Footprint of the energy products we sell in step with society's progress towards meeting the Paris Agreement.""
""We are very clear that this requires both sustaining investment in our core Upstream businesses as well as growing investment in our customer-facing transition businesses including Integrated Gas, Oil Products and Chemicals,"" it said.
Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England Pension Board who co-led negotiations with Shell on the climate resolution, said engagement with Shell was ""very much ongoing.""
""Clearly Shell are an industry leader, but we are keen to see further steps related to alignment of capital expenditure,"" Matthews said in a statement.
Catherine Howarth, chief executive of climate activist group ShareAction, welcomed Sarasin's move.
""Sarasin's forcefully argued challenge to Shell's board on their capital expenditure plans should reverberate across the wider investment community,"" Howarth said.
The Paris agreement seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most of which come from the burning of fossil fuels, to a net zero by the end of the century to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Monday that it had not been invited to a White House summit on social media being held later this week.
The White House has repeatedly declined to say who will attend the July 11 event. White House spokesman Judd Deere said last month the meeting would ""bring together digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment."" He said on Monday that Trump will speak at the event.
Several conservatives on social media have said they are attending the summit, including Bill Mitchell, a Trump supporter who hosts an online show. At least two social media users posted photos of an invitation to the summit that said it will take place at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Thursday.
U.S. politicians, led by Trump, have increasingly used social media to try to woo voters directly. Trump has said on many occasions that he would not have been elected without Twitter (N:TWTR) and Facebook.
But Republican Trump has regularly attacked Facebook and Twitter as being ""biased"" in favor of Democrats, without offering evidence. He suggested in a Fox Business Network interview last month that Twitter made it ""very hard for people to join me at Twitter... and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.""
In March, Trump tweeted that ""Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats. But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before!""
All three companies have denied political bias.
When asked if it had been invited to Thursday's meeting, a spokesman for Facebook said in an emailed reply that it had not.
Twitter declined to say on Monday if it had been invited to the summit or would take part. Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had been invited.

In April, Trump met with Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and spent a significant time questioning him about why he had lost some Twitter followers, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. With more than 61 million followers, Trump has one of the most-followed accounts on Twitter.

Rare earths are an essential component in rechargeable batteries that power electric and hybrid cars, while some of them, such as neodymium and dysprosium, are also critical to the motors used in electric vehicles.
""We feel it is the right time to initiate the evaluation of plant sites... as a key part of re-building a North American rare earth value chain,"" Chief Executive Officer Don Lay said in a statement on Tuesday.
Rising trade tensions between the United States and China have sparked concerns that Beijing could leverage its dominant position as a supplier of rare earths.

Vancouver-based Medallion, which is looking to produce magnet metal from reddish-brown phosphate mineral monazite, said it was seeking third party proposals for the rare-earth extraction plant.

934,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 07:24AM ET</span>",Bonds Suggest a Ceiling for the Stock Market,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Corporate credit markets have bad news for stock investors. Low yields imply that it's going to be tough for stocks to rally much further from here.
Since equities made what was then an all-time high in January 2018, performance of the stock market has largely tracked the movement of investment-grade corporate bond yields. The rise in yields in 2018 acted as a headwind for stocks, with the S&P 500 posting its worst year since 2008. So far this year, the opposite has occurred, with Treasury yields plunging in response to a changed outlook from the Federal Reserve. Stocks have surged as that interest rate pressure has abated, with ""low volatility"" stocks like consumer staples and utilities doing particularly well. Their performance tends to be tied to interest rates.
The last couple of times corporate yields got this low preceded periods of stock market stagnation. One occurrence was in early February 2015, with yields falling in sympathy with the decline in oil prices. Equities finished the year essentially unchanged. Another instance was in July 2016, shortly after the Brexit vote. Equities drifted lower for the next four months, until just before the U.S. presidential election.
A big factor underlying this thesis is about the prospects for earnings growth. From the fourth quarter of 2014 through the second quarter of 2016 – a period more or less coinciding with the last couple of occurrences of low corporate yields – S&P 500 earnings growth was negative. And over the long run, equities tend to outperform corporate bonds because earnings have tended to grow over time. Without earnings growth, investors would probably prefer the security of bonds to the risk of stocks.
And the problem for today is that earnings growth, after a robust two and a half years, has slowed down significantly. S&P 500 earnings growth was in the low single digits in both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. While earnings growth is projected to pick up significantly in the second half of the year, that seems at odds with broader concerns of slowing global growth and a need for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
If earnings growth does pick up significantly in the second half of the year, then stock performance probably won't be affected by corporate bond yields. But there are plenty of reasons to suspect growth will not pick up. Any slowdown in GDP growth or ratcheting up of the trade war will probably be felt in corporate America's bottom line. Wage growth for employees, now in the low-to-mid 3% range, is about one full percentage point higher than it's been for most of this expansion, which should act as a headwind for profits. It's unclear how much corporations will be willing to take on additional debt to fund earnings growth via stock buybacks or M&A given some concerns about corporate leverage. Companies like Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) have gotten bitten by taking on too much debt.
The kind of earnings growth we've gotten over the past few years was either one-off in nature or more difficult to repeat going forward. There was a cyclical upturn in global economic activity that ran from early 2016 through the middle of 2018 that fueled earnings growth. Passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in early 2018, which lowered corporate tax rates and allowed corporations to repatriate cash from overseas, was a one-off boost for profitability. With those two catalysts behind us, earnings growth may be modest at best, tracking overall economic growth, perhaps with workers getting a bigger share of the pie as the labor market continues to tighten.
And if earnings growth remains modest, stocks may struggle to do more than track the performance of corporate bonds. With yields near their lows of the cycle, that doesn't leave much juice for investors to squeeze.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell for a third straight day on Tuesday after a stinging warning from German chemicals giant BASF about the effects of the global trade war and as hopes dwindled of a hefty U.S. interest rate cut this month.
With global macroeconomic clouds looming and markets waiting for policy signals from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell on Wednesday, the focus of headlines and sentiment turned to three individual heavyweight stocks. 
For Europe, it was an almost 7% early slump in German chemicals giant BASF after it had blamed a global slowdown and trade war between the United States and China for what one trader described as a ""shocking"" 30% profit warning.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) tumbled another 4% too - having already dropped 5.4% the previous day after it axed 18,000 staff - while Apple's overnight drop of more than 2% on Wall Street after a broker downgrade dragged both global tech sectors lower. (EU)
""Both from a bottom-up and top-down perspective, equity market valuations appear far too ambitious,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a note.
It was particularly stark, they said, as the U.S. business cycle was in a downturn and both forward-looking indicators such as global PMIs and global trade are now in contraction territory. 
""Indeed, companies have begun cutting their 2019 profit forecasts, citing the trade conflict as a reason,"" MS added. 
In the currency markets, Britain's pound was threatening to slip to a more than 2-year low against the dollar and a 6-month trough versus the euro amid a worsening UK economic outlook and rising fears about a no-deal Brexit. [GBP/]
With the key $1.25 level against the dollar giving way in early Asian trade, traders quickly pushed the British currency down half a percent and it barely budged, even as opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn inched closer to backing a second Brexit referendum.
The broader theme though remained the potential reaction to the weaker global outlook from the world's top central banks, especially on what Fed chairman Powell will say during a testimony and grilling from Congress on Wednesday. [FED/DIARY] 
Money market futures <0#FF:> are still fully pricing in a 25 basis point (bps) cut at the Fed's July 30-31 meeting, but have almost priced out a larger 50 bps move that had been seen as a real possibility just a couple of weeks ago. 
Benchmark government bond yields were clawing away from their recent lows [GVD/EUR] and the dollar changed hands at 108.81 yen to build on the more than month high it had set in the previous session.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was also higher at 97.550, while the euro drooped back under $1.12 for the first since mid June. [/FRX]
""It would be pretty disruptive at this stage for Powell to rule out a cut in July or dampen expectations of a cut in July,"" said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
""The last few Fed speakers, albeit non-voting speakers, have suggested July is not a done deal ... and even now, if you look at economists' forecasts, there is not a consensus that there will be a move, and yet the market is 100% priced."" 
TRADE STRAINS
Wall Street looked set to follow Europe and Asia lower with futures markets indicating falls of around 0.5% for the main S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq bourses.
The United States and China are set to relaunch trade talks this week after a two-month hiatus, but a year after their trade war began there is little sign their differences have narrowed.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.45% but pared earlier losses, having traded at its lowest level since June 19.
Chinese blue-chips ended down 0.25%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.75%. Japan's Nikkei put up the only resistance as gains in a few heavyweights in the index helped it edge up 0.15%. (T)
Apple's suppliers, such as Murata Manufacturing and Taiyo Yuden, fell 2% and 4%, however, after Rosenblatt Securities cited a ""fundamental deterioration"" for the U.S. gadget giant over the next 6-12 months.
In Greater China, suppliers from Hon Hai to AAC Tech also lost between 1.4% and 3.1% and in Europe Infineon, ASM and STMicroelectronics slipped about 2%. (EU) 
Among commodities, oil prices firmed after a dip in Asia as as OPEC supply cuts and Middle East tensions outweighed the U.S.-China trade dispute that has been dragging down the global economy and oil demand.
OPEC and its allies agreed last week to extend their supply-cutting deal until March 2020. Brent has risen almost 20% in 2019 supported by the pact and also tensions in the Middle East, especially concerns about the row over Iran's nuclear program.
Benchmark Brent crude rose 59 cents to $64.70 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up 46 cents to $58.12. [O/R]
""OPEC and its allies are doing their best to support the market,"" said Tamas Varga, an analyst with PVM. ""Oil prices are to hold up reasonably well during coming months or at least they are not to fall out of bed.""
Gold prices ticked lower though as the dollar scaled its multi-week highs. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,393.03 per ounce and U.S. gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,395.70 an ounce.

BASF (DE:BASFN) sells to so many sectors and geographies that it can be taken as a rough proxy for the global economy. That makes the read-across from its statement somewhat alarming – not least for all those betting that a looser monetary policy can make up for the damage done by trade wars.
BASF stock fell 5.7% by 4:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), while other chemicals companies also slipped: Covestro (DE:1COV) was down by 6.1%,  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO) by 1.5%,  Clariant  (SIX:CLN) by 3.5% and Bayer (DE:BAYGN) by 1.9%.
Germany’s DAX led Europe lower, falling by 1.2%, while the U.K. FTSE 100 fell 0.5% and the STOXX 600 fell by 0.7% to 386.68, giving up all of its gains for the month to date.
The company said it expects earnings before interest and taxes to have fallen 71% year-on-year in the second quarter, and now expects EBIT for the whole of 2019 to fall as much as 30% from a year earlier. It had previously expected a rise of up to 10%.
Two key markets are largely to blame: first, there’s the automotive sector, to which BASF sells a raft of chemicals, coatings and other products. Global production was down 6% in the quarter, and in China, where the economy is cooling fast under the impact of the U.S.’s trade tariffs, the decline was over twice as fast at 13%. 
Second, BASF also sells seeds, pesticides and fertilizers to U.S. farmers. That business has suffered this year not only from extreme weather conditions that have restricted planting across the Midwest, but also from China’s trade countermeasures against the U.S., which have mainly hit the agricultural sector.
“The decrease in earnings prospects for farmers and the trade disputes led to lower demand for crop protection products,” BASF said.
Most worrying for all is the company’s outlook: “To date, the conflicts between the United States and its trading partners, particularly China, have not eased – contrary to what was assumed in the BASF Report 2018. In fact, the G20 summit at the end of June has shown that a rapid détente is not to be expected in the second half of 2019.”
Given the breadth of BASF’s businesses, that’s a message you can expect to hear again and again in the coming second-quarter earnings season."

Borne said France will gradually introduce the tax, which will amount to about 1.5 euros for an economy class ticket on flights within France or the European Union, 9 euros for business class tickets, and up to 18 euros for business class ticket for flights out of the EU region. There will be no tax on transit flights.
""We have decided to put in place an eco-tax on all flights from France,"" Borne said during a news conference, adding that the funds will finance daily transport in France.
Shares of Air France (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) extended losses and were down 4.5% and 2.5% respectively following the announcement.
French President Emmanuel Macron's government wants to tighten environmental regulation but had to abandon an attempt to increase tax on diesel fuel late last year following the ""yellow vest"" protest movement. 
France wants the new European Union Commission to push for an end to global tax exemptions for jet fuel to reduce CO2 emissions, and has also linked up with the Netherlands try and convince fellow European nations to tax airline travel more.

Thousands of job cuts at Germany's once mighty  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have offered a stark reminder of the shaky footing that some of Europe's biggest investment banks are standing.
European investment banks have in recent years been losing market share in their own markets to big U.S. investment banks, which bankers say is because regulation has kept the Europeans from consolidating as their American rivals did years ago.
""Keeping a European capacity in investment banking is a strategic imperative,"" Bank of France Governor Francois de Galhau told a financial sector conference in Paris.
""European banking consolidation is overdue and is indispensable, not to reduce competition - quite the opposite - but to reach the critical mass necessary to make digital investments and allow savings to circulate,"" he added.
Many ECB policymakers like Villeroy and bankers have long called for regulation to be adapted to encourage cross-border mergers, but the governments in Germany and the Netherlands are opposed, bankers say."

PARIS (Reuters) -  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) Chief Executive Valerie Chapoulaud-Floquet, the architect of its push toward higher-priced spirits to drive profit margins, will step down by the end of 2019 for personal reasons, the company said.
The group's share price has more than doubled since the luxury sector specialist took over in September 2014 with a strategy focused on selling spirits priced at $50 or more a bottle.
Chapoulaud-Floquet, 56, will continue to exercise her mandate until the arrival of her successor, the maker of Remy Martin cognac and Cointreau liqueur said.
Remy Cointreau did not say when a new chief executive would be appointed. It was not immediately clear why Chapoulaud-Floquet left, but the company said it was not for health reasons.
Shares in the company, whose market valuation is closer to that of luxury goods companies than peers in the spirits sector, were down 1.2% in morning trade following the surprise announcement. 
""She has done an impressive job at Remy, leading the company's strategic evolution toward a niche super premium business,"" Jefferies analysts said.
""Given her strong leadership, we believe her resignation will be taken negatively by the market, until an appropriate successor is appointed.""
Chapoulaud-Floquet joined Remy Cointreau just as the group was grappling with falling cognac sales in China following the Chinese government's 2012 crackdown on corruption and conspicuous consumption.
Her strategy, which differed from that of rivals such as  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) which launched less expensive brands in the Chinese market to cope with the downturn, has benefited from an upturn in Chinese consumption in recent years.
Remy's Louis XIII luxury cognac - which sells for over $3,000 a bottle - has been in demand in China but has also benefited from growing demand from rich consumers elsewhere, especially in the United States.
Chapoulaud-Floquet said in the same statement she was comfortable leaving, ""as the group's results, foundations, teams and strategic vision allow it to look to the future with optimism, ambition and success"".
Last month the group handed investors a special dividend payout after reporting a stronger-than-expected 14% rise in annual operating profit.
It also reiterated it expected high-end spirits to grow to 60-65% of its sales over the medium term from 53% at present.
Before joining Remy Cointreau, Chapoulaud-Floquet spent 24 years at cosmetics giant L'Oreal (PA:OREP) where she held various directorships in Asia, Europe and the United States.
After L'Oreal, she joined luxury leather and luggage group Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) in 2008, where she rose to the position of president and CEO of the Americas before leaving for Remy.

""She is 56 years old, so perhaps she has plans to take another job elsewhere,"" Liberum analysts said in a note.

(Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday as a profit warning from chemicals giant BASF led to a slide in German shares, which were on course to post their biggest drop in two months.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.7% by 0815 GMT, in line with its Asian peers and Wall Street overnight amid dimming hopes of a sharp interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this month.
German shares (GDAXI) tumbled 1.3%.
In the latest evidence of the U.S.-China trade war squeezing businesses, BASF (DE:BASFn) slumped 5.8% after warning that profit would fall below forecasts for the second quarter and the full year.
It cited the slowdown in global growth and the prolonged trade war as weighing on the agricultural sector as well as global auto production and sales.
The warning also led to a 2% drop in the shares of chemicals peer Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and pushed both Europe's chemicals (SX4P) and auto indexes (SXAP) 2% lower.
""There hasn't been any good news out of the auto sector now, so we have to see what kind of earnings companies like Daimler will release,"" said Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex in London, adding that poor earning could spell out further pain for the DAX.
Also weighing was  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which resumed its slide and was last down 4.1%. It posted its worst day in five months in the prior session as investors questioned the bank's restructuring targets and its ability to make profits after it undertook a major overhaul.
Meanwhile, Apple suppliers Infineon (DE:IFXGn), ASM (AS:ASMI) and STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) slipped about 2% after Rosenblatt Securities on Monday downgraded Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) shares to 'sell' from 'neutral'.
Investors will be watching out for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's opening remarks on U.S. stress tests later in the day and a two-day testimony before Congress starting Wednesday for clues about a rate cut.
After a sharp sell-off in May due to an escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, European shares have made a come back on hopes that major central banks around the world would adopt a looser monetary policy.
""The Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday will be parsed to gauge how close they are to doing anything. They are looking for signs that the jobs report hasn't knocked the Fed's plan of a rate cut,"" said Campbell.
Elsewhere, Nordic lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), which has been struggling to restore trust among investors after disclosing a major money laundering scandal at one of its branches, cut its 2019 earnings forecast for the second time, sending its shares 2.5% lower.
Among gainers, Britain's Ocado (L:OCDO) rose 6.8% to top the STOXX 600 after the online supermarket and technology company said it was confident about its outlook, even though it reported a 46% fall in first-half core earnings."
952,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:56AM ET</span>","Money flows into Asian equities in June on trade optimism, hopes of U.S. rate cuts","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Foreign investors turned net buyers of Asian stocks in June as optimism ahead of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, along with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts bolstered sentiment.
Overseas investors purchased a net $4.2 billion worth of equities in June, data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam showed.
The leaders of the United States and China agreed late last month to restart trade talks after Trump offered concessions including no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei in order to reduce tensions with Beijing.
A collapse in trade talks had prompted sharp foreign outflows from Asian equities in May.
""The U.S.-China trade truce at the G20 meeting will likely support further inflows over the weeks ahead but this will have to be balanced against the impact of slowing growth and elevated equity valuations in some countries (India, Indonesia),"" noted Mitul Kotecha, a senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities.
""On balance, we expect portfolio inflows to Asia to continue to strengthen but to remain discriminatory.""
In June, Thai equities attracted $1.5 billion worth of foreign money as the country's political uncertainty ended after General Prayuth Chan-ocha secured a needed majority in the parliament.
Sino-U.S. trade optimism helped Taiwan and South Korea to secure higher inflows last month, as the two countries have extensive ties with tech companies in China and are part of their supply chains.
However, India received just $374 million worth of inflows, the lowest in five months, as concerns over sluggish consumption and slowing growth overtook last month's national election euphoria.
So far in July, foreign investors have sold a net $451 million in Indian equities. In its annual budget on Friday, the government proposed to increase listed companies' minimum public shareholding and raise the income tax surcharge on foreign portfolio investors.
June inflows into Asia was also helped by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would aggressively cut interest rates soon to boost the economy.
However, a recent rebound in U.S. job growth has reduced the likelihood the Fed will slash rates at its next meeting later this month, pressuring equity markets globally.
“The Trump-Xi meeting did indeed result in another trade truce, and both sides have restarted trade talks. But a deal could still be some time away, and is far from a guarantee,” noted Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Research.
“A rate cut at the next FOMC meeting at the end of July is also far from a done deal given the still strong state of the US labor market.”

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:21AM ET</span>",UBS Australia's 'rock star' banking chief Matthew Grounds to leave,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The head of UBS (S:UBSG) in Australia and New Zealand, Matthew Grounds, is leaving the Swiss bank at the end of the year, a spokeswoman confirmed on Tuesday, possibly ending one of the most storied careers in Australian investment banking.
Grounds, 49, who brokered some of the most talked-about deals of post-financial-crisis Australia over his 11-year stint as CEO, will spend the next six months handling a leadership change to UBS investment banking head Anthony Sweetman and chief operating officer Nick Hughes, the spokeswoman said.
""This is not a decision that Matthew has taken lightly, but he considers this is the right time given the current strong performance of the business and the opportunities that this will provide for the next generation of leaders,"" said an internal memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the spokeswoman.
Grounds declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
The departure is a second shake-up in two days for the Australian investment banking industry, after  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) began laying off dozens of local staff on Monday as part of a global restructure.
Grounds played a leading role in some of Australia's costliest M&A deals and was frequently sought out by its major banks for advice.
UBS under Grounds's leadership advised mining giant BHP Group Ltd (AX:BHP) on a 2001 merger with Anglo–Dutch Billiton Plc to create the world's biggest miner and one of Australia's largest companies.
From 2014, Grounds's UBS advised the government on Australia's biggest privatization sale, the electricity infrastructure of New South Wales state.
That appointment led to Grounds testifying in parliament after UBS was accused of changing a supposedly independent report about the sale from skeptical to positive, according to media reports.
Grounds was also in charge when UBS made A$1.2 billion ($834.5 million) in loans to Papua New Guinea in 2014, which the government used to buy shares of oil and gas producer Oil Search Ltd (AX:OSH).
The deal soured when Oil Search shares fell sharply and Papua New Guinea was forced to sell them at a loss. Authorities in Switzerland and Papua New Guinea are investigating whether the government followed its own borrowing rules in agreeing to the loan.
UBS has said it does not comment on specific client transactions but adheres to strict standards in due diligence and execution.
The firm held the top position in league tables for equity capital markets (ECM) and investment banking fees for M&A in the first six months of 2019, ahead of  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Bank AG [GLDSH.UL], according to Refinitiv data.
In 2012, another year when UBS was the country's top dealmaker, Reuters reported that Grounds pulled off a bonus protection deal to quarantine executives from budgeting cutbacks affecting the rest of the company's global operations.
The bonus arrangement, known as the Kangaroo Deal, ended in late 2018, the Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday.
Another thing that ended for Grounds in 2018 was his friendship with James Packer, the billionaire founder of casino operator  Crown  Resorts Ltd (AX:CWN), according to reports in The Australian newspaper.
Packer had made Grounds executor of his will and godfather to one of his children, but the relationship soured over Grounds's handling of Packer's personal finances, the paper reported.
In 2012, though, the Australian Financial Review quoted Packer as calling Grounds a ""rock star""."
955,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 09, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",ECB Will Find Plenty of New Corporate Bonds If Purchases Resume,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank will have plenty of newer notes to consider if it returns to the corporate-bond market as part of stimulus measures.
Companies have issued about 108 billion euros ($121 billion) of ECB-eligible bonds this year -- outweighing some 55 billion euros of maturities -- spurred by low borrowing costs and the return of U.S. issuers. That has kept the overall ECB-eligible universe at just over 1 trillion euros, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Generally, the ECB only buys investment-grade euro bonds issued by companies other than banks.
Still, the central bank already holds 177.7 billion euros of the eligible universe, a level little changed since the end of net asset purchase last year due to the reinvestment of maturing holdings. The bank also limits purchases to no more than 70% per note. Its buying ability may be further curbed by bondholders’ reluctance to sell, given the shortage of alternative investments available amid $13.4 trillion of negative-yielding bonds worldwide.
The ECB may buy 3.5 billion euros to 4.8 billion euros of corporate bonds each month, corresponding to 50% to 67% of net supply, if it resumes net purchases, according to a  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA estimate. Central bank President Mario Draghi sparked expectations for a possible resumption when he said in a speech last month in Sintra, Portugal that additional stimulus will be needed absent an improved outlook for growth and inflation.
This year, the bank has only bought into 29 of 161 new eligible notes. The notes it has bought into have an outstanding amount of 21 billion euros, just about 20% of the overall amount of eligible securities issued.
German and French borrowers issued most of the new eligible notes this year, with a combined 66 billion euros of sales. U.S. borrowers sold 16 billion euros. The ECB can buy notes from non euro-zone companies provided they are issued via a local entity. For instance, notes sold last month by Illinois-based tractor maker Deere & Co. are eligible for purchase because they came from a Luxembourg unit.
About half of new ECB-eligible bonds sold this year were issued by cyclical or non-cyclical consumer names. Automakers and their suppliers led the cyclical sector, including bonds from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Schaeffler AG. Non-cyclical sales were boosted by reverse Yankee issuers such as Becton Dickinson & Co. and  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) Plc.
In terms of maturity, new eligible notes this year range to as long as 30 years. The ECB buys corporate bonds with maturities stretching from six months to 31 years"

HONG KONG/TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks hovered around two-and-a-half week lows on Tuesday as expectations waned for a hefty interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this month, while technology companies retreated on Apple Inc's overnight drop.
European stock markets were set to follow Asia and U.S. markets lower. Futures for the pan-regional Euro Stoxx 50 slid 0.4%, German DAX futures fell 0.7%, and London's FTSE futures were down 0.2% in early trade.
Investors have rushed to scale back Fed rate cut expectations following unexpectedly strong gains in U.S. jobs for June.
The jobs figures ""have been a good reminder that the market may have gone well ahead of itself when it comes to the pricing of an eventual monetary easing in the United States,"" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said in a note on Tuesday.
Japan's Nikkei was the outlier in Asia, inching up 0.1% thanks to gains in a few heavyweights in the index.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4% but pared earlier losses, having traded at its lowest level since June 19.
In China, the Shanghai Composite was 0.2% lower and the blue-chip CSI300 was off 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.7%.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.5% while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8%, led by fall in Apple after a brokerage downgraded the stock to ""sell"".
Apple's suppliers in Japan, such as Murata Manufacturing and Taiyo Yuden, fell 2% and 4%. In Greater China, suppliers from Hon Hai to AAC Tech lost between 1.4% and 3.1%.
Money market futures are still fully pricing in a 25 basis point (bps) cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on July 30-31, but have almost priced out a larger 50 bps move.
""The headline payrolls figures was pretty strong but wages were tepid, so on the whole a 25 basis-point cut would be justified as an pre-emptive move and I think the current market pricing is fair,"" said Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
Global equities will likely remain under pressure after last month's outperformance, Pictet Wealth Management said in a memo on Tuesday.
""After a strong rally in June that more than erased the May drawdown, valuations look demanding, underpinning our underweight stance,"" the firm said. ""We expect (emerging market) equities to perform sideways in the coming weeks, but with the possibility of rotation to quality cyclicals.""
Investors' focus is shifting to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony before Congress later in the week for clues on monetary policy.
""What the market will be looking for is whether the language is as dovish as previously (at last policy meeting),"" said Christy Tan, head of market strategy for Asia at National Australia Bank. ""There's been some over-dovishness in what the Fed needs to do in the market.""
DOLLAR STRENGTH
In the currency market, fading Fed rate cut expectations helped the dollar.
The euro dropped as low as to 1.1204, its weakest level since June 19.
The dollar changed hands at 108.78 yen, having risen in the previous session to its highest in more than a month.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was a touch higher at 97.432.
The British pound stood at 1.2485, not far from six-month lows of $1.2481 touched on Friday.
Oil prices were slightly softer as concerns about whether slowing global economic growth would hit oil demand eclipsed tensions over Iran's nuclear program.
Brent crude futures fell 0.2% to $64.01 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.4% to $57.46.

The deal was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the SPAC,  Social Capital Hedosophia  Holdings Corp (N:IPOA), will invest about $800 million for a 49% stake in Virgin Galactic.
The deal could be announced as early as Tuesday morning, said the source, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.
Virgin Galactic and Social Capital Hedosophia did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters outside regular business hours.
Branson's company is racing against Blue Origin, the space business of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, to bring tourists into space.
Virgin Galactic in February soared to the edge of space with a test passenger for the first time, nudging the company closer to its goal of suborbital flights for space tourists.
After Branson founded the company in 2004, his ambitious timeline for taking customers into space suffered delays and a fatal setback when the original SpaceShipTwo crashed on a test flight in 2014 that killed the co-pilot and seriously injured the pilot.

Branson has said he plans to be the first passenger on SpaceShipTwo's first commercial flight in mid-2019.

“It’s the confluence of headwinds -- weak global demand, fading impact of rupee depreciation, non-bank finance company crisis and scale-back of government spending -- which is deepening the slowdown,” Edelweiss Securities Ltd. analysts led by Prateek Parekh said in a note.
The country’s economic growth slumped to a five-year low of 5.8% in January-March. The absence of any substantial fiscal stimulus for companies in the federal budget last week puts the onus back on the government to spur growth. The Reserve Bank of India has already cut interest rates three times this year and signaled more easing to come.
Edelweiss expects profits for companies in the NSE Nifty 50 Index rose 7% year-on-year in the April-June period. The broker sees profit expansion concentrated in just a few sectors, namely financials, airlines, pharmaceuticals and cement.
Here’s what analysts expect from the results season that kicks off Tuesday with Asia’s top software exporter, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.

Policy makers could relaunch bond purchases as soon as September -- barely nine months after they capped the program at 2.6 trillion euros ($3 trillion), according to Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha. Other institutions calling for the ECB to restart purchases by early next year include ABN Amro Bank NV, Danske Bank A/S, and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA.
ECB President Mario Draghi said last month that officials will need to add monetary stimulus if the economic outlook doesn’t improve. The euro-zone economy has been stuck in a slump for more than a year, prompting some officials to say it’s no longer possible to consider the downturn a temporary blip.
While most investors and economists have penciled in a rate cut by September, their views on QE are more mixed. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, the head of market operations and a driving force behind QE when it was launched in 2015, said in remarks broadcast Monday that policy makers could “hypothetically” restart net asset purchases if circumstances make it necessary.
The latest boost to the likelihood of bond purchases, according to Guha, was last week’s nomination of International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde to lead the ECB when Draghi steps down at the end of October. She has previously praised bond purchases as a policy tool.
That “certainly removes doubts in the eyes of the market as to whether the outgoing ECB president could muster support for one last big push before leaving office,” Guha said.
Here is a round-up of views on how the ECB might draw on QE to stimulate the euro-area economy:

The U.S. Commerce Department said it had found that imports from Canada were not being unfairly subsidized.
Mexico said in a statement that a U.S. countervailing duty investigation of Mexican fabricated structural steel was an ""ordinary"" anti-dumping probe with no relation to earlier tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Mexico added that its economy ministry would defend the interests of the companies under investigation, and that it had been actively participating in anti-subsidy procedures since early 2019. It did not give further details in the statement.
The preliminary subsidy determination does not endanger ratification of the new North American trade deal, Mexico's deputy foreign minister for the region, Jesus Seade, said on social network Twitter.That deal was designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement that governs more than $1.2 trillion of mutual trade. 
The U.S. International Trade Commission said in March that imports of fabricated structural steel from Canada, China and Mexico were harming domestic producers.
Fabricated structural steel is used in major building projects, such as bridges, buildings, parking decks and ports. An industry trade group had filed a petition asking for the trade case to be launched.
In 2018, the United States imported $722.5 million worth of fabricated structural steel from Canada, $897.5 million worth from China and $622.4 million worth from Mexico, according to the Commerce Department.

The department is expected to make its final ruling on the imports around Nov. 19.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday defended the pace of its investigation into Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) after a judge asked why the agency waited two years after a global scandal related to vehicle emissions to sue the automaker.
The SEC filed a civil suit in March accusing Volkswagen and its former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, of defrauding investors in U.S. bond offerings.
Volkswagen was caught using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 30 billion euros ($33.65 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs. In May, it set aside an additional 5.5 billion euros in contingent liabilities.
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in May questioned the SEC's ""lateness"" in suing VW more than two years after the German automaker settled the U.S. Justice Department's criminal probe, pleading guilty to three felonies and paying $4.3 billion in penalties.
""My basic question is what took you so long,"" Breyer said, adding he was ""totally mystified"" as to why the SEC waited until 2019.
On Monday, the SEC disclosed details of its probe in court filings and said it held extensive settlement talks with the automaker before deciding to file suit.
The SEC said it received about 2 million pages of records from VW and delayed immediately issuing formal subpoenas after VW agreed to voluntarily produce materials. 
In its court filing on Monday, the SEC said that its ""staff worked hard and as quickly as possible under very difficult circumstances to complete an investigation into numerous different securities offerings conducted by a foreign company and three of its affiliates over many years,"" and ""treated VW fairly and afforded the company full process throughout its investigation.""
The agency added that its challenges ""included long delays by VW in producing documents and other information,"" and ""uncooperative witnesses who were reluctant or altogether refused to speak to the staff.""
VW said Monday in a statement that it had ""cooperated fully with the SEC's investigation, and today's filing confirms that the SEC is now piling on.""
The company settled with the Justice Department in January 2017 over the issue of asset-backed securities and ""obtained a broad release, including from fraud and misrepresentation claims,"" it added.
VW noted that the filing said SEC staff did not begin to investigate VW bond sales until 2017 ""even though private bondholders had sued Volkswagen over those bonds in June 2016. Volkswagen has never missed an interest or principal payment for any of its bonds, which always remained investment grade.""
SEC offices in New York and Chicago opened inquiries in September 2015, wrote Jeffrey Shank, an SEC attorney who supervised the probe, in a court filing, adding the agency was unaware of the existence of the VW bonds until 2017 and that it then took 10 months for VW to disclose who was responsible for statements made to VW bond investors.
The SEC said former Volkswagen of America CEO Michael Horn refused to be interviewed by the SEC even after it told his lawyers in September 2017 the U.S. Justice Department would be willing to offer Horn safe passage. 
The SEC also was unable to interview Winterkorn.
Shank said the SEC held settlement talks over several months and gave VW and Winterkorn's lawyers an opportunity to argue why the SEC should not file suit.
Regulators and investors argue VW should have informed them sooner about the scope of the scandal, while the automaker says it was not clear it would face billions of dollars in fines and penalties.
VW issued more than $13 billion in bonds and asset-backed securities in U.S. markets at a time when senior executives knew that more than 500,000 U.S. diesel vehicles grossly exceeded legal vehicle emissions limits, the SEC complaint said.
Volkswagen reaped hundreds of millions of dollars ""by issuing the securities at more attractive rates for the company,"" the SEC said.

Muddy Waters accused ANTA of using ""secretly controlled Tier 1 distributors to fraudulently boost its margins"".

The result was a second day of declines after the market's record-setting close on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.5%. The Dow dropped 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.8%. The Nasdaq 100, dominated by big tech stocks, was down 0.7%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a prime culprit, falling more than 2% on a downgrade. Boeing (NYSE:BA) dropped 1.3% after a Saudi Arabian airline cancelled orders for 30 737 Max jetliners. Together, they represented nearly 61 points of the Dow's 116-point decline. 
 
The market was also in a worrying mood about whether the Fed will cut rates at its July 30-31 meeting. Friday's jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls growing by a larger-than-expected 224,00 jobs, raised fears that the Fed might not cut rates after all. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitoring Tool still sees the Fed cutting its key federal funds rate from 2.25%-2.5% to 2%-2.25%.
Interest rates did move lower on the day. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.034% from 2.048% on Friday. 
The Fed has said it stands ready to cut rates to support the economic recovery. Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before Senate and House committees on Wednesday and Thursday and will be questioned closely on the point. President Trump has criticized the central bank and demanded rates cuts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday issued a notice on broker-dealer custody of digital asset securities, amid industry requests for clarity on whether they can hold such assets under federal securities laws. 
The SEC's statement, issued in conjunction with the general counsel of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), clarified that entities seeking to participate in the marketplace for digital asset securities must comply with the relevant securities laws, most notably the customer protection rule.
""The requirements of the Customer Protection Rule have produced a nearly fifty year track record of recovery for investors when their broker-dealers have failed,"" the SEC said in a statement.
""This record of protecting customer assets held in custody by broker-dealers stands in contrast to recent reports of cybertheft, and underscores the need to ensure broker-dealers robust protection of customer assets, including digital asset securities,"" it added. 
Monday's statement follows queries from market participants over whether federal laws apply to the custody of digital asset securities, such as crypto currencies. It could potentially pave the way for more traditional investors to hold digital asset securities.
While various firms already registered as broker-dealers are seeking to expand their businesses to include digital asset securities services, the SEC says non-registered firms would likely have to register as a broker-dealer before engaging in this activity. 
The SEC has been grappling with how digital asset securities fit within existing federal law, which often requires a custodian to take physical possession of a security.
Matt Comstock, who advises broker-dealers and fintech companies at Washington-based Murphy & McGonigle, said the SEC's statement indicates it would view digital asset securities as uncertificated securities, similar to situations in some states where the ownership of a stock is evidenced by an electronic record as opposed to physical certificate.
SEC rules allow broker dealers to establish custody by employing so-called transfer agents, which are typically SEC-registered entities that maintain records of the securities’ record owners.

But he added the statement also suggests ""that other solutions for custodying securities, such as holding those securities in a wallet controlled by the broker-dealer through private keys, face a more difficult path to approval.""

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday dealt a blow to the Trump administration by striking down a new rule that would have forced pharmaceutical companies to include the wholesale prices of their drugs in television advertising.
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington sided with drugmakers Merck & Co Inc, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co and  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) by halting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule from taking effect on Tuesday as planned.
Mehta in his ruling set aside the entire rule as invalid, saying the HHS lacked authority from the U.S. Congress to compel drug manufacturers to disclose list prices.
""It is outrageous that an Obama appointed judge sided with big PhRMA to keep high drug prices secret from the American people, leaving patients and families as the real victims,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is the largest industry lobbying group.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar announced the rule on May 8, saying that forcing drugmakers to disclose their prices in direct-to-consumer TV advertising could help drive down skyrocketing prescription drug costs if the companies were embarrassed by them or afraid they would scare away customers.
The rule was originally suggested in May 2018 as part of Trump's ""blueprint"" to lower prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers. 
The judge said such disclosures could well be an effective tool in halting the rising cost of prescription drugs. ""But no matter how vexing the problem of spiraling drug costs may be, HHS cannot do more than what Congress has authorized,"" Mehta concluded.
Under the rule, the wholesale, or list, price would be included if it was $35 or more for a month's supply or the usual course of therapy. HHS said the 10 most commonly advertised drugs had list prices of $488 to $16,938 per month or for a usual course of therapy. 
Many drugmakers have opposed the rule. PhRMA said the list prices could be confusing for patients and discourage them from seeking medical care.
Merck, Eli Lilly and Amgen filed their lawsuit alongside the Association Of National Advertisers trade group on June 14, arguing the rule would confuse consumers by forcing them to disclose a price irrelevant to patients with insurance.
Drugmakers have long argued that list prices do not reflect the actual cost of drugs as they do not take into account discounts and rebates negotiated with health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to ensure patient access to the medicines. 
The lawsuit alleged that HHS lacked authority to issue the rule and that it violated their free-speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

The U.S. Justice Department defended the rule in court, saying it met a standard the U.S. Supreme Court set in 1985, when it held the government could force advertisers to disclose factual, non-controversial information.

Australian authorities filed charges last year against the firms and six senior bankers over the sale of A$3 billion ($2.1 billion) in ANZ shares in 2015 and subsequent trading by the underwriters.
The case is being closely followed by brokers and banks around the globe because it could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide.
It was standing room only as lawyers crammed into a tiny courtroom in Sydney for the brief procedural hearing, setting dates in September when lawyers for the banks and bankers will press to be allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.
""We're going to need a bigger courtroom,"" Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said, before fixing the case for its next mention on Sept. 3 and two days of arguments on Sept. 25 and 27.
None of the accused executives were present and it is not clear if or when the matter will proceed to trial. Prosecution lawyer Shanaka Jayasuriya said in court that he would oppose his witnesses being cross examined, without elaborating.
The government accuses the banks of forming a criminal cartel to either ""directly or indirectly"" restrict the supply of ANZ shares or maintain the price of ANZ shares, according to court documents.
The banks and bankers are all defending the charges. ANZ did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. Citigroup had no commend but has previously said it had ""operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades"".
Deutsche referred to a previous statement saying it will vigorously defend the charges and its staff.
JPMorgan (N:JPM), which underwrote the capital raising along with Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, has not been charged. A representative declined to comment.
If convicted, the companies could face penalties of up to A$10 million or triple the benefit of the conduct. The individuals charged could face 10 years in jail.
ANZ, Australia's third-largest bank, is also facing civil charges over the same share issue by the country's corporate watchdog, though that case was paused in June pending the outcome of the criminal matter."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc (NYSE:STI) will stop financing operators of private prisons and immigration holding facilities, it said on Monday, becoming the latest lender to distance itself from a sector associated with the Trump administration's policies.
""This decision was made after extensive consideration of the views of our stakeholders on this deeply complex issue,"" the Atlanta-based company said in a statement.
SunTrust is one of several banks that have underwritten bonds or syndicated loans for at least one of the major private U.S. prison operators, CoreCivic Inc and GEO Group Inc.
In 2018 lenders including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co raised roughly $1.8 billion in three deals for CoreCivic and GEO Group, according to Refinitiv data.
Banks have been under pressure to cut ties with the private prison industry since U.S. President Donald Trump's restrictions on immigration raised concerns about detention center conditions. The centers account for about two-thirds of the people held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings estimated last year.
Earlier this year, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America made similar commitments to phase out relationships with private prison companies. 
Executives of big banks have been confronted by activists at annual shareholder meetings and grilled by lawmakers about their role in the industry. Private prison operators have argued that activists mischaracterize the nature of their facilities. 
“It’s unfortunate that misleading political activism has been allowed to impact a decade-long banking relationship,"" said Geo Group spokesman Pablo Paez. 
CoreCivic and Geo Group have said that none of their facilities housed unaccompanied children.
""This decision is about caving to political pressure,"" said Brandon Bissell, manager of public affairs at CoreCivic on Monday. ""It sends a terrible message to others in the private sector.""
SunTrust's executives are slated to testify about its proposed merger with BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT) before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee later this month.
Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the committee, has asked regulators to withhold approval for the deal, announced in February, until the panel conducts a thorough review.

In response to activism last year, Bank of America,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said they were limiting business with gunmakers. But others, including Wells Fargo, declined to follow suit, and filings show firearms companies retain access to a wide range of financing options.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 09:31PM ET</span>",Shakeup in U.S. Navy leadership adds to Pentagon churn,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A surprise shakeup in the U.S. Navy's leadership this week added to some of the biggest churn in memory at top levels of the Pentagon, where positions ranging from the secretary of defense to the heads of military branches have seen jolting turnover.
Admiral Bill Moran, who was expected to take over as the Navy's top officer next month, announced late on Sunday he would instead retire after what Navy Secretary Richard Spencer called poor judgment regarding a professional relationship.
The decision throws the leadership of the Navy into question just weeks after the U.S. Army reshuffled its most senior jobs after its top civilian, Mark Esper, was named acting U.S. defense secretary on June 18.
Esper has become the third person to sit at the defense secretary's desk since December. He succeeded another acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, who suddenly resigned last month. Shanahan aimed to permanently replace Jim Mattis, who resigned as defense secretary in December over policy differences with President Donald Trump.
The amount of turnover has caught Pentagon-watchers by surprise.
""It is unprecedented,"" said Mark Cancian, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington.
U.S. Congress members have voiced concern that the failure to have a confirmed defense secretary would project American weakness to adversaries at a time of rising tensions with Iran.
But Cancian said military operational positions were far more steady, including at places like U.S. Central Command - which oversees U.S. troops in the Middle East and would respond to an Iran contingency.
NO MILITARY VULNERABILITY
""There isn't a military vulnerability as a result of the turnover,"" Cancian said, adding the biggest impact could be on civilian-led Pentagon policy reform efforts.
The churn is far more widespread than just the U.S. defense secretary or the Army and Navy leadership.
Heather Wilson, who had been considered a contender to replace Mattis, resigned at the end of May as U.S. Air Force secretary. Her job is being filled in an acting capacity by Matthew Donovan.
David Norquist, who had been the Pentagon's comptroller, has been ""performing the duties"" of the deputy defense secretary since Shanahan replaced Mattis. Norquist has been nominated to take that job permanently.
Then there are the normal job rotations that happen periodically in the U.S. military.
For example, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is scheduled to retire in the fall. He will be replaced by Army General Mark Milley, now the Army's chief of staff. The vice chairman jobs are also turning over.
Later this week, Marine General David Berger is scheduled to take over as the next commandant of the Marine Corps, succeeding General Robert Neller.
In the case of Moran, the Navy is trying to smooth over the turbulence by keeping Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson in place until the U.S. Senate confirms a replacement. Such a move may need to involve Congress, however.
Not all of the details on Moran's case have been released. In his statement, Moran said his decision to step aside was ""based on an open investigation into the nature of some of my personal email correspondence over the past couple of years and for continuing to maintain a professional relationship with a former staff officer.""
Sources said the relationship in question was with a former Navy spokesman and public affairs advisor, who had been investigated over accusations of making sexual advances at a 2016 Christmas party while dressed like Santa Claus."

""People are facing further confusion over the number of interest rate decreases we're likely to have going forward due mainly to the strong job numbers Friday, and reacting with a mildly down day in the market,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""Expectations about the number and timing of rate cuts have changed slightly.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 115.98 points, or 0.43%, to 26,806.14, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 14.46 points, or 0.48%, to 2,975.95 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 63.41 points, or 0.78%, to 8,098.38.
A week ago, the market forecast an 80.1% chance of a 25-basis-point cut, and a 19.9% chance of a 50-basis-point cut, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. In afternoon trade, the chances were 92% and 8%, respectively. 
Investors might get an opportunity to gauge near-term monetary policy thinking during Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual testimony to the U.S. Congress on July 10-11. Also ahead are the central bank's June meeting minutes, scheduled for release on Wednesday.

""People are trying to game how bad second-quarter earnings and guidance are going to be,"" Tuz said. ""People are expecting a weak second quarter, but it's hard to determine how weak and what kind of guidance about third and fourth quarters will go along with that.""

Jobs Data, Fed Speakers in Spotlight
Following last week’s better-than-expected employment report, the market will get the latest figures from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs).
The Labor Department will release its February JOLTs report at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that job openings rose to 7.47 million in May, from 7.45 million the prior month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Ahead of Fed Chairman Jay Powell’s two-day testimony due Wednesday, a flurry of Fed speakers will be in the spotlight as investors with many traders eager for clues on monetary policy amid fading expectations for an aggressive rate cut later this month.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard is set to deliver remarks at 10:10 am ET, following by Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic and Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles at 2 pm ET. Bullard wanted the Fed to cut rates at its June meeting.

Crude Inventory Data on Tap
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data expected Tuesday, amid ongoing fears that a weaker global economic backdrop will hinder demand and lead to supply surplus continued.
""The outlook for oil remains tumultuous given global economic deceleration, anemic global oil demand, trade uncertainties, ascendant non-OPEC production offset by geopolitical tensions and rational OPEC+ guardianship,"" analysts at Simmons Energy said.
The American Petroleum Institute last week reported crude oil stockpiles rose by 5 million barrels for the week ended June 28.
Oil prices settled 0.3% higher at $57.66 a barrel.
 PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Results on Tap
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is set to release its second-quarter earnings before the markets opens tomorrow.
The snack and beverage giant is expected to release earnings of $1.50 a share on revenue of $16.43 billion, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
The company’s snack business, which makes nearly a quarter of total revenue, is expected to lead revenue growth, but ongoing weakness in its Quaker Foods North American will likely keep a lid on top line growth.
Quaker Foods North American sales fell 2% in the first quarter year-on-year.
During the previous quarter, PepsiCo said it expects organic revenue to grow 4% and core constant currency earnings per share to decline 1%.
PepsiCo’s shares have gained 19% thus far this year and 23% over the trailing 52 weeks. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alex Navab, who worked as a top dealmaker at KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) for more than two decades before starting his own private equity firm earlier this year, died on Sunday. He was 53.
Navab died while on vacation with his family, Navab Capital Partners said in a statement on Monday, without providing further details.
""Alex was an accomplished business leader and generous philanthropist who loved his family and played an important role in the professional,"" the firm said.
Navab was born in Isfahan, Iran, and fled to Greece following the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
In 1993, he joined KKR, where he rose through the ranks to become head of its Americas private equity business and worked on some of KKR's biggest leveraged buyouts of the last 20 years.
After leaving New York-based KKR in 2017, Navab launched Navab Capital Partners with backing from Goldman Sachs Asset Management (N:GS) earlier this year.
He started his career in finance as a Goldman Sachs investment banker in 1987. Between 1991 and 1993 he worked at James D. Wolfensohn in its mergers, acquisitions and corporate finance division.
""We are heartbroken. A longtime member of the KKR family, Alex was an outstanding investor, leader, mentor and a friend to many,"" KKR co-founders and co-Chief Executives Henry Kravis and George Roberts said in a statement."
977,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Airbus, Boeing indicate they may pull out of Canada fighter jet race - sources","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Airbus SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co may pull out of a bidding process to supply Canada with new fighter jets because they say the contest is unfairly tilted toward  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said on Monday.
The three companies competing with Lockheed Martin's F-35 jet have already complained about the way the contest is being run, and expressed concern some of the specifications clearly favor the U.S. firm, industry sources have said in recent weeks.
Next week the government is due to release the so-called request for proposals - the final list of requirements - for the 88 new planes it wants to buy. The contract is worth between C$15 billion ($11.5 billion) and C$19 billion and the planes are due to be delivered between 2025 and the early 2030s.
Boeing and Airbus have now formally written to Ottawa expressing concerns about the current requirements, said two sources familiar with the matter who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. The fourth bidder is Sweden's Saab AB.
Pat Finn, the defense ministry's top official in charge of procurement, confirmed one of the four companies had sent a formal letter but gave no details. The final request for proposals is due out on July 17 and modifications are still being considered, he said. 
""We continue to engage all four of them,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""We have had some comments (such as) 'If changes are not made in such a place then we would frankly consider possibly not bidding.'""
""We are looking at those very seriously. I can't say that we will make every change, but as far as we know we continue to have four bidders in the race.""
Airbus declined to comment. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. 
Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to buy replacements for its aging F-18 fighters. In May, Ottawa changed the rules to allow Lockheed Martin to submit a bid, prompting Boeing to take the unusual step of announcing publicly it was surprised.
""Anyone who is not Lockheed Martin has expressed a very strong view,"" said one of the sources. ""We have been pretty clear with the government that this is not a request for proposals that lends to our participation.""
At least one firm has expressed unhappiness that the requirements emphasize the ability to carry out first strikes on targets abroad, a strength of the F-35, said the sources.
The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insists the competition is not rigged. Finn said the defense ministry also had made changes to the requirements at the request of Boeing, Airbus and Saab.
Canada is part of the international consortium that developed the F-35. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 of the jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays.

Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but Ottawa has since softened its line.

Funds rose 5.7% from January to June, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. data released Monday. Equity funds were the best-performing strategy, gaining almost 9% in the period.
The advance marks a turnaround from last year when the industry, pummeled by volatility, saw its worst performance since 2011. But the gain pales in comparison to the S&P 500 Index, which returned almost 19% in this year’s first six months.
Among the industry’s big winners this year is David Einhorn, whose fund sunk 34% in 2018, and is now making a comeback with the best start to a year in a decade. Brevan Howard Asset Management’s hedge fund is also off to its best first half since 2009, adding to last year’s rebound.

Two Boeing (NYSE:BA) MAX aircraft crashed in Ethiopia in March and Indonesia last October, triggering the global grounding of the aircraft. Regulators must approve the fix and new pilot training before the jets can fly again.

Ural Airlines signed a deal for the leasing of 14 Boeing-737 MAX 8 in the spring of 2018. The delivery was expected between October 2019 and May 2022, Interfax said.
When asked whether the company considered cancelling the deal, Skuratov told the agency that ""Boeing has certain advantages: seven hours 45 minutes (of flight) without refueling fully loaded.""

981,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 03:59PM ET</span>",Juror urges U.S. judge to uphold $80 million Roundup verdict against Bayer,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A juror who was part of a panel that delivered an $80 million award against  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) after finding that its glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup caused a man's cancer has urged the presiding judge to uphold the decision.
A letter from the juror written on July 4 was posted to the court docket on Monday as part of legal filings by Bayer. The company accused the juror of bias and called on the judge to disregard the letter in his decision making.
In the letter, the unidentified juror told U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco that the $80 million in awards ""were no accident"" and the result of ""meticulous planning"" by the jury.
The letter was a response to statements by Chhabria during a court hearing last week, when the judge said he would have to reduce the $75 million punitive damages portion of the award on constitutional grounds.
Following a four-week trial, a federal jury on March 27 awarded $5 million in compensatory and $75 million in punitive damages to Edwin Hardeman, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. 
U.S. Supreme Court rulings limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9 to 1, which in this case would put the maximum for punitive damages at $45 million.
In the letter, the juror said higher damages ratios were allowed in extraordinary cases, echoing arguments Hardeman's lawyers made during Tuesday's hearing, when they urged Chhabria to affirm the total award.
""Based on the evidence provided, 'reprehensible' is much too kind a word to describe the actions of the  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) employees,"" the juror wrote.
Bayer, which bought Roundup maker Monsanto for $63 billion last year, says Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate are safe for human use and not carcinogenic. It faces Roundup cancer lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs.
The company in filings on Monday only identified the letter writer as ""juror #5.""
A lawyer for the company said he had observed the juror attending Tuesday's hearing, talking to Hardeman's lawyers and hugging Hardeman and his wife. Bayer said juror #5 had also displayed bias against the company during jury selection.
It was juror #5 who was responsible for bringing allegedly improper comments by another juror to the attention of the judge who ultimately excused that other juror without giving Monsanto a chance to challenge the dismissal, according to court filings by Bayer.
Last week's letter marks the second time jurors in the Roundup litigation called on judges to uphold their verdicts.
In October, several jurors who delivered a $289 million verdict against Monsanto, finding Roundup caused a man's terminal cancer, wrote to the San Francisco trial court judge, asking her to ""respect and honor the verdict.""
The judge ultimately upheld the jury's finding but reduced the award to $78 million. The case is on appeal.
Legal experts at the time said the letters were unusual, as jurors generally do not engage with post-trial proceedings following a verdict.
Bayer on Monday said the letters deprived it of fair trials.

""The fact that jurors from both trials wrote letters in support of constitutionally impermissible verdicts is highly unusual, and generates further anti-Monsanto bias in the Bay Area that will infect future Roundup trials,"" the company said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the world fell on Monday after strong U.S. job gains tempered expectations the Federal Reserve will deliver a large interest rate cut at the end of July.
U.S. equities continued their slide from Friday, when the June employment data was released, as hopes of a steep Fed rate cut faded. U.S. stocks were also weighed by losses in shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL), following an analyst downgrade, and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), after a Saudi Arabian airline said it would not proceed with an order for its jets.

U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley's decision to reduce its exposure to global equities due to misgivings about the ability of policy easing to offset weaker economic data also weighed on investor sentiment.
U.S. Treasury debt yields fell, after gaining on Friday in response to the U.S. employment data.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to give testimony on monetary policy before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, which some investors expect will provide clues regarding the likelihood of a rate cut from the U.S. central bank when it meets at the end of the month.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario has blamed a shortage of legal cannabis from the federal government for its slow rollout of retail outlets, a claim dismissed by the federal government and regulatory bodies from other provinces, raising prospects the black market for weed may thrive longer in Canada's most populous province.
Canada became the first G7 country to legalize recreational marijuana in October 2018 but sales have been dampened by supply constraints and prices that are higher than those on the black market.
While the provinces can set their own cannabis guidelines, a provincially run distributor purchases the cannabis from federally licensed producers, and then allocates it to retail locations approved by the province.
Ontario said last week that bottleneck on the federal government's side is the reason the province will release only 50 cannabis licenses later this summer.
""We urge the federal government to take steps to quickly increase the supply of recreational cannabis so that we can continue combating the illegal market in Ontario,"" Marc Pichette, spokesman for the Ontario Ministry of Finance, said in an email.
But the federal government has pushed back on this assertion, as have industry analysts and regulatory bodies in other provinces.
""With the notable exception of Ontario, the rest of the country has made steady progress in displacing the illicit market with licensed and regulated retail stores,"" Bill Blair, federal minister for border protection and organized crime reduction, said in a statement.
Blair's office is one of the departments in charge of cannabis legalization in Canada.
BLACK MARKET
The most recent government data available from April 2019 states that 8,853 kilograms of cannabis products were sold in Canada, which has a population of 37 million. The national inventory of cannabis ready to be shipped and sold was 31,880 kilograms.
By comparison, Oregon, a U.S. state of 4 million people, announced in 2018 a stockpile of 435,000 kilograms of cannabis, causing prices and profits to drop.
Jay Rosenthal, co-founder and president of the research company Business of Cannabis, said Ontario's slow retail start leaves room for illegal weed sales.
""The black market is really effective at filling gaps,"" Rosenthal said.
A major gap he sees is retail. Ontario has just one legal retail cannabis store per 200,000 people, compared with Alberta's one store for every 28,000 people.
A possible reason for this, Rosenthal thinks, is the ""dramatic shift from one government to the next"" that occurred in Ontario in the lead-up to legalization.
The province had initially intended to open government-run cannabis stores, similar to how liquor is sold in the province, but a change of government that came into effect just a few months before legalization opted instead for privately owned businesses.
In the aftermath of this short-notice policy switch, Rosenthal said, ""The supply shortage is an easy scapegoat.""
Nick Kuzyk, chief strategist officer for  High Tide  (CD:HITI), which currently owns or has partnerships with eight operational retail stores across Canada, also is concerned about the black market in Ontario.
But overall he and other retailers Reuters spoke to are happy with how the Ontario government has handled legalization so far, including the latest lottery of 50 licenses.
""I think the government has looked at the data and chosen the number accordingly,"" Kuzyk said. ""They could have chosen 100 or 150 but they chose 50."""

The new deadline for both companies to extend the merger agreement is now April 30, 2020, rather than Jan. 31, 2020, Roche said in a U.S. regulatory filing on Monday, saying the change provides ""additional time to clear the transaction"".
Roche's March 5 bid to add Spark's gene therapy technology is dragging on, with completion pushed back several times as the Swiss company blames time-consuming U.S. Federal Trade Commission scrutiny of any competition issues. Moreover, three U.S. lawsuits challenging the deal are pending, alleging disclosure violations associated with the offer.
""Although closing this deal is taking longer than I had hoped, my excitement about our anticipated partnership has only increased,"" Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan wrote in a note to Spark employees that was published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""While we still expect this transaction to close in 2019, we want to ensure that we proactively identify and remove any potential future obstacles to achieving this outcome.""

Roche is buying Spark to get its one approved medicine, the $850,000 per patient hereditary blindness therapy Luxturna; another investigational gene therapy for haemophilia A, as well as the Philadelphia-based company's development platform that Roche hopes to leverage into additional disease areas.

Rosenblatt Securities downgraded the company to sell on Monday, bringing the total number of bearish analysts up to five, among the 57 ratings tracked by Bloomberg. It’s the highest number of sell ratings the iPhone maker has had since at least 1997, according to historical data compiled by Bloomberg.
Skepticism surrounding the company has accelerated in 2019, with all five of the sell ratings coming in this year. Both New Street Research and HSBC lowered their ratings on the stock to sell in April, and in January, the number of firms with buy ratings dropped below 50% for the first time since 2004.
The caution has been largely driven by uncertainty surrounding demand for the company’s critical iPhone line, with the U.S.-China trade war seen as a particular headwind. In January, Apple cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades, in large part because of iPhone weakness. Apple’s third-quarter results are currently expected to come out on July 30.
According to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than 60% of Apple’s 2018 revenue was related to the iPhone, while 20% came from China, which is also a critical part of its supply chain. Last week, Citi wrote that Apple’s China sales “could be cut in half” due to “a less favorable brand image desire.”
Rosenblatt’s downgrade came as analyst Jun Zhang expects the company “will face fundamental deterioration over the next 6-12 months,” based on disappointing sales trends. The downgrade pushed Apple stock lower by as much as 1.9% in Monday trading.
Still, the sell-equivalent ratings hardly represent a consensus view. A plurality of 23 firms recommend buying the stock, while another 21 have hold ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The news was not entirely negative for Apple on Monday, however, as Wedbush wrote it was “incrementally more positive on global iPhone demand” following checks in Asia. “We saw a ‘slight uptick’ out of Apple suppliers during our checks although overall handset demand remains challenging,” analyst Daniel Ives wrote. He affirmed his outperform rating and $235 price target.

The nation’s 224,000 surge in payrolls in June and recent de-escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China are reasons to think the Fed may take a “wait and see” approach before reducing their benchmark when officials gather on July 31, economists Andrew Hollenhorst and Veronica Clark wrote in a report to clients on Friday.
With policy makers set to enter their “blackout” period, the Citigroup economists said this week marks to last opportunity for them to shift market expectations. Chairman Jerome Powell addresses lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday.
“We do not expect any statements that are too conclusive, but we may get a sense of which options remain on the table as the committee prepares to debate action at their July meeting,” said Hollenhorst and Clark.
Upcoming data releases will also be important, they said. This week will see the publication of the consumer price index, which the Citi economists expect to keep the “lack of inflationary pressure narrative in place.” Reports on retail sales and business investment will also be worth monitoring.
Bloomberg Economics also expects the Fed to hold fire this month.
“While the Fed dropped ‘patient’ from its policy guidance at its June meeting, the strength in the pace of hiring will enable the FOMC to delay until September the onset of a mini-easing cycle,” Bloomberg economists Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva wrote in their latest report.

Jim Norberg, who has spent more than 30 years at McDonald's, will be responsible for growing sales and profit margins as well as improving customer satisfaction at Papa John's, the company said.
Papa John's earlier this year named its first chief people officer after founder John Schnatter, who reportedly used a racial slur during a media training conference call last year, exited following a long and acrimonious battle.
The negative publicity, which dented the pizza chain's sales last year, led the company to name former basketball star Shaquille O'Neal as a board member, brand ambassador and investor.
""Jim is a seasoned expert whose depth and understanding of restaurant operations and the guest experience will help propel our brand forward and position us for continued success,"" Papa John's Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie said in a statement.
At McDonald's, Norberg most recently served as chief operating officer and managed operations for U.S. restaurants while leading a system-wide review to simplify store operations and menus."

Exuberance over the levies dramatically boosted U.S. output just as the global economy was cooling, undercutting demand. That dropped prices, creating a stark divide between companies like  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE)., that use cheaper-to-run electric-arc furnaces to recycle scrap into steel products, and those including United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), with more costly legacy blast furnaces.
Since Trump announced the tariffs 16 months ago, U.S. Steel has lost almost 70% of its market value, or $5.5 billion, and idled two American furnaces in mid-June that couldn’t be run profitably at the lowest prices since 2016. Meanwhile, Nucor, down around 20%, has touted $2.5 billion in expansion projects.
The president’s actions likely “sped up” up an unavoidable “evolution,” said Nucor Chief Executive Officer John Ferriola in an interview last month. “Are some companies are going to suffer? Absolutely. We’ll see some capacity go away, I’m sure of it.""
Last July, Trump stood on a makeshift stage at a U.S. Steel mill in Granite City, Illinois, and beamed as workers cheered the tariffs. At that point, the company had already restarted one of two blast furnaces at Granite City, and vowed the second would soon be brought online.
“Workers are back on the job, and we’re once again pouring new American steel into the spine of our country,” Trump said during the hour-long program. “U.S. Steel is back.”
Since then, though, there’s been a somewhat different outcome.
With the stronger steelmakers aggressively boosting capacity to grab market share, a dip in demand has left older, more costly blast furnaces at U.S. Steel and AK Steel Holding Corp. struggling to compete, even with foreign steel nudged out of the equation.
“Be careful what you wish for,” said Timna Tanners, an analyst at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) who has dubbed the industry’s push to add capacity without enough demand “Steelmageddon.” She called it “ironic” that the tariffs are “punishing some steel companies.”
A spokeswoman at U.S. Steel declined to comment while AK Steel said its products have little overlap with EAFs, and that the additional capacity will further pressure imports.
As expected, the tariffs reduced steel imports, creating more demand in 2018 and boosting profits. With that cash in hand, added money from Trump’s corporate tax cut and confidence that protectionism is here to stay, domestic producers began adding more capacity than they would have otherwise.
The problem: This year, with the global economy cooling, demand -- and prices -- have fallen. That’s given an added incentive to EAF companies with superior profit margins and balance sheets to aggressively grab a bigger share of the market.
“Not all plants are the same,” said Mark Millett, CEO of Steel Dynamics Inc., who in November announced a new $1.8 billion EAF mill to be built in the U.S. southwest. “Not all projects are the same.”
Suppliers to blast furnaces are sounding the alarm. In laying out his vision for iron-ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. at a recent conference, CEO Lourenco Goncalves painted a bleak future for what makes up the overwhelming majority of his current customers.
That’s why Cliffs is investing $830 million in a Toledo, Ohio-based plant that will produce hot briquetted iron for electronic-arc furnaces run by firms such as Nucor, Goncalves said. They invested in the plant because “we were able to see the future of steelmaking in the United States,” Goncalves said in New York last month.
Many “blast furnaces will shut down.,” he added.
U.S. Steel is trying to show investors it can move past its legacy blast furnaces. In February, it announced the restart of construction on an EAF facility in Alabama. And in May, the company said it would spend $1 billion upgrading facilities in Pennsylvania to produce more high-strength steel for the automotive industry.
“Less efficient capacity should go away, but there is no guarantee that it permanently goes away,” Bank of America’s Tanners said. “It probably doesn’t go down without a fight.”

ZURICH (Reuters) - The United States wants Switzerland to extradite a Chinese researcher accused of helping his scientist sister steal secrets worth $550 million from drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), Swiss documents released on Monday show.
Gongda Xue, who is fighting extradition, has been labeled a potential flight risk, according to a Swiss Federal Criminal Court verdict, keeping him in custody pending the extradition request's resolution.
U.S. allegations against Gongda Xue, 49, underscore global fears that China is using networks of highly trained nationals abroad to smuggle trade secrets to the world's second-largest economy.
Last year, prosecutors in Germany charged a Chinese-born engineer with industrial espionage in connection with secrets pilfered from chemical maker  Lanxess  (DE:LXSG).
Gongda Xue, a Basel-area scientist who worked at Switzerland's Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research until 2014, is the brother of Yu ""Joyce"" Xue, a Chinese-American scientist who last August pleaded guilty at the U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania to pilfering secrets from Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
According to the U.S. indictment, Gongda Xue received stolen GSK secrets from his sister, performed tests at Miescher's facilities and sent results to accomplices in China. The stolen information, prosecutors allege, involved antibodies that bind to tumour cells and kill them.
""Gongda Xue knowing received, bought, and possessed a trade secret belonging to GSK...knowing it to have been stolen...with the intent to convert that trade secret...to the economic benefit of someone other than GSK,"" according to one U.S. charge.
GSK said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities.
Xue, an 18-year Swiss resident, was arrested in May in Switzerland and has been held in custody as authorities consider the U.S. request, documents show.
""He faces up 20 years in prison if convicted,"" the Swiss court wrote, in rejecting his release. ""We affirm a flight risk.""
His Swiss lawyer declined to comment.
Yu Xue, his 48-year-old biochemist sister who worked at Glaxo in Pennsylvania until 2016, is awaiting sentencing in her case in which a U.S. government witness estimates secrets stolen were worth more than $550 million.
In total, there are six co-defendants, including Yu Xue's twin sister, Tian Xue, who also pleaded guilty last year to money laundering-related charges.
U.S. government lawyers allege the scheme included establishing a Chinese state-backed company, Renopharma, that relied on theft to bypass costly research that underpins drug development.
""GSK invested more than twenty years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars,"" U.S. prosecutors wrote. ""By stealing these platforms, Renopharma obviated the need to undergo the same time and expense.""
Prosecutors have branded the case ""economic warfare"", adding the group had profit motives and hoped to sell Renopharma for up to $2.2 billion.
Switzerland's Friedrich Miescher Institute, which helped develop cancer compounds such as Novartis's (S:NOVN) Afinitor, confirmed Gonda Xue had been a postdoctoral employee, adding the institute had not accused him of wrongdoing.
""We are cooperating with American authorities,"" an institute spokeswoman said."

Rosenblatt Securities downgraded the company to sell on Monday, bringing the total number of bearish analysts up to five, among the 57 ratings tracked by Bloomberg. It’s the highest number of sell ratings the iPhone maker has had since at least 1997, according to historical data compiled by Bloomberg.
Skepticism surrounding the company has accelerated in 2019, with all five of the sell ratings coming in this year. Both New Street Research and HSBC lowered their ratings on the stock to sell in April, and in January, the number of firms with buy ratings dropped below 50% for the first time since 2004.
The caution has been largely driven by uncertainty surrounding demand for the company’s critical iPhone line, with the U.S.-China trade war seen as a particular headwind. In January, Apple cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades, in large part because of iPhone weakness. Apple’s third-quarter results are currently expected to come out on July 30.
According to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than 60% of Apple’s 2018 revenue was related to the iPhone, while 20% came from China, which is also a critical part of its supply chain. Last week, Citi wrote that Apple’s China sales “could be cut in half” due to “a less favorable brand image desire.”
Rosenblatt’s downgrade came as analyst Jun Zhang expects the company “will face fundamental deterioration over the next 6-12 months,” based on disappointing sales trends. The downgrade pushed Apple stock lower by as much as 1.9% in Monday trading.
Still, the sell-equivalent ratings hardly represent a consensus view. A plurality of 23 firms recommend buying the stock, while another 21 have hold ratings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The news was not entirely negative for Apple on Monday, however, as Wedbush wrote it was “incrementally more positive on global iPhone demand” following checks in Asia. “We saw a ‘slight uptick’ out of Apple suppliers during our checks although overall handset demand remains challenging,” analyst Daniel Ives wrote. He affirmed his outperform rating and $235 price target."

Jim Norberg, who has spent more than 30 years at McDonald's, will be responsible for growing sales and profit margins as well as improving customer satisfaction at Papa John's, the company said.
Papa John's earlier this year named its first chief people officer after founder John Schnatter, who reportedly used a racial slur during a media training conference call last year, exited following a long and acrimonious battle.
The negative publicity, which dented the pizza chain's sales last year, led the company to name former basketball star Shaquille O'Neal as a board member, brand ambassador and investor.
""Jim is a seasoned expert whose depth and understanding of restaurant operations and the guest experience will help propel our brand forward and position us for continued success,"" Papa John's Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie said in a statement.
At McDonald's, Norberg most recently served as chief operating officer and managed operations for U.S. restaurants while leading a system-wide review to simplify store operations and menus."

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 06:15AM ET</span>",Hedge funds chart course through 'IMO 2020' storm,"By Jonathan Saul, Maiya Keidan and Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Shipping companies, refineries, freight derivatives or diesel cracks? Investment funds are placing their bets as the shipping sector prepares for new rules limiting sulfur emissions from ocean-going vessels.
Ever since the International Maritime Organization said the maximum sulfur content in marine fuel must drop to 0.5% from 3.5% from 2020, shipping companies have been wrestling with how to comply without driving up costs at an uncertain time for global trade.
Some shipowners are installing exhaust cleaning systems known as scrubbers so they can continue to use high-sulfur fuel and some are switching to low-sulfur marine diesel, but all expect a period of turbulence when the ""IMO 2020"" rules come in.
Investors in turn are coming up with strategies and launching funds with exposure to parts of the oil and shipping industries they expect to benefit from the new emissions caps.
John Kartsonas, managing partner of Breakwave Advisors, said while broader concerns about trade have dented investors' views on shipping, IMO 2020 was likely to drive freight rates higher.
Breakwave launched an exchange-traded fund last year to invest in dry bulk freight derivatives, hoping to benefit from IMO 2020.
""Rarely you see such a potentially massive disruption,"" said Kartsonas. ""Delays, a reduced active fleet supply, slow steaming and port congestion can push freight rates to decade highs, and beyond.""
The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index, which tracks rates for ships carrying dry bulk commodities, slumped after the financial crisis to 700 points from a record 11,793 points in 2008. It's now about 1,500 points. (BADI)
Dry bulk ships make up more than a fifth of the world's ocean-going vessels and many are among the most polluting ships.
DERIVATIVE BY DESIGN
At hedge fund Svelland Capital in London, one strategy is to focus on petroleum products likely to be affected by the rules.
""IMO 2020, together with the ballast water treatment, will turn shipping upside down and create supply shock,"" chief investment officer Tor Svelland said.
Svelland Capital is launching an ""IMO direct exposure fund"" in July aimed at investors who want to take positions based on IMO 2020, but are less familiar with oil derivatives.
""This is the largest regulatory change in the oil space ever and it will have a massive effect far outside of shipping,"" said the fund's portfolio manager Kenneth Tveter. 
For now, there is no consensus on whether there will be enough low-sulfur fuel to meet demand come 2020. Of the roughly 60,000 vessels worldwide, industry consultants estimate only 3% to 5% are likely to have scrubbers by 2020.
It is also unclear what will happen to demand for high-sulfur fuel - all of which means the price gaps between different fuel grades, as well as the different types of crude used to make them, are likely to change.
""You can try and pick winners in the shipping segment of the equity markets, but to get a pure play you need the derivatives market,"" Tveter said. ""The new fund will look at all the parts of refining that will be affected by the new regulations.
In another sign of the impact of IMO 2020, China said on July 4 that it planned to launch a futures contract for low-sulfur fuel oil by the end of the year.
REFINING REFINING
Dutch asset manager Robeco is also focusing on fuel, but it's investing in oil refineries that are well-placed to produce large quantities of low-sulfur diesel.
""We are invested in refiners since earlier this year and this has been one of the drivers for that investment,"" said Fabiana Fedeli, global head of fundamental equities.
Robeco is selecting so-called complex refineries, plants with lots of units that can turn low-value fuel oil into higher-value products such as distillates, octane and low-sulfur fuel.
Fedeli said concerns about disruptions to global trade had weighed on refining margins and related stocks this year, but IMO 2020 could change that.
""We expect that the impact on refinery margins will become tangible from late Q3 2019 when ships are likely to begin shifting to compliant fuels,"" she said. ""Interestingly, this is still not reflected in diesel crack futures.""
Alistair Way, head of emerging market equities at UK asset manager  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, said refineries that have invested to produce more compliant fuel would benefit.
He said Asian refiners such as  Thai Oil  (BK:TOP) and S-Oil (KS:010950), were well placed as they produced a bigger than average proportion of middle distillates and had less exposure to high-sulfur fuels.
Hedge fund CF Partners in London is focusing on price gaps between different crudes. It expects sweet crude with higher levels of distillates such as Nigeria's Bonny Light or U.S. shale to be more in vogue than heavier, sour crude.
SCRUB THAT
CF Partners is also getting exposure to U.S.-flagged ships known as Jones Act carriers after a law requiring goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported in U.S. vessels. 
Elvis Pellumbi, manager at CF Partners, said it was buying stocks in shipping firms such as  Overseas Shipholding Group  (N:OSG). Pellumbi's fund has $400 million under management, of which 30 percent is investments related to IMO 2020.
George Kaknis, portfolio manager at hedge fund LNG Capital, said he was looking at shipping firms such as American Shipping Company (OL:AMSCA).
""The more shale is produced out of the U.S., the more these guys are kept busy and the more the day rates go up,"" he said.
According to data from Symmetric, which tracks investment funds, hedge fund ownership of some shipping stocks rose in the first quarter. Their ownership of Nordic American Tanker (N:NAT) rose to 12% from 8% in the fourth quarter last year, while hedge fund stakes in DryShips (O:DRYS) rose to 13% from 5%.
Other shipping firms investors said they were looking at with IMO 2020 in mind include Scorpio Tankers (N:STNG),  Navios Maritime Acquisition  (N:NNA), DHT (N:DHT), Frontline (OL:FRO) and  Euronav  (BR:EUAV).
While some shipowners have installed cleaning systems, others see them as potentially high risk as some ports have already banned or restricted scrubbers that pump waste water into the sea, and more may follow suit.
Some investors say the upfront cost of installing scrubbers - about $2 million to $3 million each - also means it would take longer for them to pay off, especially if the price gap between low and high-sulfur fuels narrows.
""We don't believe that those who have invested in scrubbers will achieve the amazing returns they have been advertising,"" said Pellumbi at CF Partners. ""Refiners have/are adapting their production slates to produce more of the right product.""

The Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone fell to -5.8 in July, down from -3.3 the month before, and well short of the 0.1 analysts had forecast. That was the lowest reading since November 2014.
A sub-index for Germany plunged to -4.8 from last month's -0.7, its lowest in almost a decade.
""The high dependence on exports and the Chinese sales market is increasingly becoming a burden and the trade dispute hangs like a sword of Damocles over the one-time poster boy of the euro region,"" Sentix director Patrick Hussy said of Germany.
""A recession looks unavoidable,"" he said of Europe's largest economy.
Hussy said an apparent de-escalation between the United States and China at the G20 summit in Japan had given rise to hope that the economy's downward trend could be stopped but added that despite this investors ""are once again giving the economy a thumbs-down"".
Hussy said the longer no agreement was found in the trade dispute, the more economic confidence suffered.
The United States and China agreed in late June to restart trade talks.
Sentix said 916 investors took part in its survey, which was conducted between July 4 and 6.

Shares of the German lender (DE:DBKGn) touched their highest since early May after it announced a restructuring plan that will cost 7.4 billion euros ($8.3 billion) and see it undo years of work that had aimed to make its investment bank a major force on Wall Street.
The move comes after Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing had flagged the restructuring in May, seeking to convince shareholders that he can turn around Germany's biggest lender after shares hit a record low.
This limited the slide in broader Europe, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) down 0.07% by 0707 GMT, as they followed Asian shares into the red.
Defensive stocks and financials weighed on the benchmark as it extended last session's decline after strong U.S. jobs data saw investors trimming bets of a 50 basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in July.
Much of the global stocks rally since June has been spurred by expectations of an accommodative monetary policy by major central banks to tackle slowing growth as the damaging trade war between United States and China takes its toll.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) has appointed Philipp Rickenbacher as its new chief executive officer, the Swiss private bank said on Monday, opting for a company insider to drive the wealth manager's future growth.
His appointment is the latest leadership change among Switzerland's wealth managers, who seek to preserve and increase the assets of rich clients.  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) appointed Philipp Wehle as the head of its international wealth management business after last week Iqbal Khan quit.
Swiss wealth managers are fighting to win new customers in emerging markets as Europe slows, but face increasingly volatile financial markets and new competitors.
Switzerland's third-largest listed bank looked at an array of internal and external candidates before deciding on Rickenbacker, chairman Romeo Lacher told reporters.
He declined to comment whether former Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) wealth management boss Iqbal Khan had been a contender for the post.
""This is the outcome of a careful evaluation process of internal and external candidates and we are especially proud of having a very strong bench of several internal candidates,"" Lacher told reporters.
""We do not discuss our evaluation process in public.""
Khan had been said to be a contender for CEO position at Julius Baer, speculation which was heightened when he suddenly quit Credit Suisse last week ""to pursue other opportunities.""
Lacher said he was convinced that Rickenbacker, was the best candidate for the job.
The 48-year-old Swiss citizen, currently head of intermediaries and global custody at Julius Baer, will replace Bernard Hodler, who is retiring as CEO and the board.
Julius Baer, which manages assets of 427 billion Swiss francs ($431 billion), has been seeking a successor for Hodler, its former risk chief who took over at the Zurich-based group when predecessor Boris Collardi abruptly left in 2017 to run unlisted rival Pictet.
The bank said Hodler would remain with the bank to ensure a smooth transition in to 2020, before pursuing other projects which were not disclosed.
Rickenbacker, a former consultant at McKinsey, joined Julius Baer in 2004 where he also had a stint as head of advisory solutions.
""We are delighted that, with Philipp Rickenbacher, we have been able to appoint an internal candidate with a compelling leadership and industry track record, deeply familiar with Julius Baer's culture and business, but prepared to actively address the challenges of the future,"" Lacher said.
The chairman said the time was not right for a detailed strategy update, saying the bank would stick to its financial targets.
In February the bank announced plans to ax 130-140 jobs, or around 2 percent of its workforce, as part of a cost-cutting plan, after a tough end to 2018 caused it to scale back growth targets.
The bank is due to report its half-year results on July 22.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 03:11AM ET</span>",South Korea's Moon urges Japan to remove export curbs,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has urged Japan to withdraw export controls on high-tech materials bound for South Korea as a row over forced wartime labor threatened to disrupt global supplies of South Korean memory chips and smartphones.
In his first public remarks on Japan's restriction on exports to South Korea, Moon said on Monday a ""vicious cycle"" of action by the uneasy neighbors, both important U.S. allies, was something both of them should avoid.
South Korea's tech giant Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930) and  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) - the world's top memory chipmakers, and suppliers to Apple (O:AAPL) and China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] - could face delays if the Japanese measures, which took effect on Thursday, drag on. 
Japan tightened restrictions on the export of the high-tech materials to South Korea in connection with a dispute over compensation for forced wartime labor.
The row between the U.S. allies flared last October when South Korea's Supreme Court ruled that Japan's Nippon Steel (T:5401) must compensate South Koreans for forced labor during World War Two.
Japan maintains that the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties, and has denounced the South Korean court ruling as ""unthinkable"".
Moon said South Korea could not rule out countermeasures if the Japanese action inflicted damage on South Korean companies, although he said he did not want see that.
""The vicious cycle of actions and counteractions is not desirable at all for both countries,"" Moon told a meeting with his senior aides.
South Korea is planning to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization over Japan's restrictions.
Moon said he would prioritize development of home-grown high-tech equipment and materials and South Korea would improve the trade deficit with Japan in the long term.
South Korea has been running chronic trade deficits with Japan as South Korean industries rely on Japan for key inputs and equipment.

The dispute over compensation for forced labor is the latest surge of animosity in a relationship long over-shadowed by South Korean resentment of Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 02:16AM ET</span>",VW to deepen alliances with battery suppliers for electric push,"LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will create joint ventures and help finance battery production to persuade skeptical cell suppliers to back its aggressive push for mass producing electric vehicles, board member Stefan Sommer told Reuters.
VW has said it will buy 50 billion euros ($56.57 billion) worth of battery cells and has identified Sweden's Northvolt, South Korea's SKI (KS:096770), LG Chem (KS:051910) and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400) as well as China's CATL (SZ:300750) as strategic partners.
""Not every supplier is convinced that electric mobility will come on such a large scale. You need to spend more time convincing them to invest in the auto industry,"" Sommer told Reuters.
Volkswagen said that by 2025, it needs 150 gigawatt hours worth of battery production capacity in Europe and another 150 in Asia. By 2030 this figure will double.
""These producers need to prioritize between making a new smartphone or building a new battery factory. So even the battery cell producers are asking: will production volumes scale up quickly?,"" he said.
The German automaker is retooling 16 factories to build electric vehicles and plans to start producing 33 different electric cars under the Skoda, Audi, VW and Seat brands by mid-2023.
Customers have been slow to adopt electric vehicles in large numbers because of the limited operating range and long battery recharging times, and because of a lack of charging infrastructure. This has spooked potential suppliers.
""When it comes to normal components, suppliers have the opportunity to sell to other car makers, if VW buys less. But with electromobility we all know: if it does not work for VW, then it won't work for others,"" he said.
This is why VW provides suppliers with finance for tooling and shares the risk of installing new production capacity by making new factories a joint venture.
""The tendency is to do joint ventures. The suppliers are still asking themselves, is this market going to take off or not? Meanwhile they realize it is an opportunity,"" he said.
Joint ventures have the advantage of giving VW an early insight into manufacturing progress as a new plant is erected.
""We have built up our own expertise, which we share with suppliers, which helps when we build a new plant. It gives us an early indication if there are teething problems,"" Sommer said.
""We have not been able to build as many cars as we wanted to. Our supplier is not delivering the numbers that we need.""
From 2021 Volkswagen will use electric battery cells using a composition of nickel, manganese and cobalt in a ratio of 8:1:1, Sommer said, adding that one supplier was still using a ratio of 6:2:2.
For the Chinese market, Volkswagen sees potential for using lithium Iron based batteries, known as LFP. These have lower energy density than NMC cells, but Chinese drivers tend to stay within large cities and do not travel long distances by car.
""The necessity for a long operating range is less important in China,"" Sommer said.
Solid state electric battery cells will replace NMC cells and become mass production ready in the second half of the 2020's, Sommer said.
""Solid state cells can be made in existing battery factories. It will be the same producers and the same factories where solid state batteries are made,"" Sommer said adding that round 60 percent of the tools can be reused for next generation cells.
Volkswagen may even build its own battery cell manufacturing plants in China, Sommer said, but added that for now the car maker is relying on its Chinese joint venture partners FAW , SAIC (SS:600104) and JAC (SS:600418) to find suitable battery suppliers."
1020,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2019 12:41AM ET</span>",China's Venture Capital Boom Shows Signs of Turning Into a Bust,"(Bloomberg) -- China went through a five-year surge in venture capital investment that fostered a new generation of startups from ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing to TikTok-parent Bytedance Ltd. Now the boom may be over.
Venture deals in China plummeted in the second quarter as investors pulled back amid unpredictable trade talks and growing concerns about startup valuations. The value of investments in the country tumbled 77% to $9.4 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier, while the number of deals roughly halved to 692, according to the market research firm Preqin.
The second quarter of 2018 marked the peak for China venture deals with a total of $41.3 billion invested. That included a $14 billion round for digital payments giant Ant Financial, $3 billion for e-commerce upstart Pinduoduo Inc. and $1.9 billion for truck-sharing service Manbang Group (known also as Full Truck Alliance Group). By comparison, the largest venture deal in the second quarter of 2019 was a $1 billion investment in JD Health, the health care affiliate of e-commerce provider JD.com Inc.
China has never been through a widespread bust like the U.S. did after the dotcom boom, in part because the country’s venture market is so new. Years of steady growth in tech investments resulted in predictable -- and enormous -- profits. Whether the current downturn becomes a painful crash depends in large part on how VCs, entrepreneurs and regulators navigate terrain they’ve never seen before.
“We’re seeing real stress in the system for the first time,” said Gary Rieschel, a founding partner at Qiming Venture Partners who has worked in China and the U.S. “We have never seen a downturn in the China market. For 20 years, it’s been pretty much up and to the right.”
China’s venture boom began in 2014 when  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. went public in the largest-ever initial public offering, making clear to investors the potential riches in the world’s most populous country. Venture deals tripled that year to more than $17 billion and proceeded to rise every year through 2018 when the total topped $105 billion, almost as much as in the U.S.
Along the way, firms like Qiming, Sequoia China, Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Group Corp. fostered some of the most valuable startups in the world. Bytedance, the force behind short-video app TikTok and other addictive services, sports a valuation of $75 billion, the highest anywhere according to CB Insights. Didi, the ride-hailing service that ousted Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. from China, was last valued at $56 billion, the second highest.
But the rise of China’s tech industry put it squarely in the crossfire of the trade war. The Trump administration has accused China of stealing intellectual property and unfairly subsidizing companies in strategic fields, including semiconductors, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. In May, the U.S. blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co., preventing the telecom giant from buying American components, and is considering doing the same to a swath of startups.
The trade war gives investors one more reason for caution. Valuations had already grown vertiginous. High-profile startups such as smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp. and delivery giant Meituan Dianping saw their stocks tumble after they went public, reinforcing the impression that private-market valuations had gotten out of hand.
So-called sharing economy startups have also tested the patience of their investors. Companies like Didi, Meituan and bike-sharing provider Ofo blitzed the market with heavy subsidies to grab market share from rivals, making up for their losses with venture money. Now there’s skepticism that many such companies will ever turn a profit.
“You’re really reaching the end of the shared economy -- this idea of let’s give away services for free and make up for it in volume,” Rieschel said. “Some companies -- Didi is the classic case -- are just not showing any ability to become profitable.”
A Didi representative didn’t respond to a message and email seeking comment.
Valuations haven’t declined yet in China though. The country’s startups have resisted so-called down rounds, when they raise money at lower valuations than an earlier round. “China entrepreneurs, more than any on the planet, will do unnatural things to avoid a down round,” Rieschel said.
Meanwhile, venture firms are pivoting to alternative business models, like enterprise software. Such startups are not only less capital intensive, they are at a stage of development where they require less money.
This also may simply be a time when venture investors opt for caution. Given the volatile negotiations between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it’s not clear what kind of opportunities China’s tech startups will face in the years ahead or how capital markets will treat the next big IPO filing.
“It won’t cost you that much to sit on your hands for a few months,” Rieschel said.

(Reuters) - Shared office space manager WeWork Cos is looking to raise $3 billion to $4 billion in debt before it goes public, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, a move aimed to fuel investor confidence in the company.
The potential debt offering underscores the extent to which the disappointing public market debuts for  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) prompted other loss-making start-ups with lofty valuations looking to go public to reassess their plans. 
Uber and Lyft went public earlier this year with high expectations but both faced criticism from investors about their steep losses and lack of a timetable to reach profitability. 
Money-losing WeWork has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities. 
A substantial debt offering could allow it to pitch itself to potential investors in a planned initial public offering (IPO) as having sufficient funding to see itself to profitability. 
The money raised via the debt offering, which will be separate from funds WeWork would receive in an IPO, could grow as big as $10 billion over the next few years, the source said, cautioning that there is still no certainty the offering will ultimately materialize.
WeWork has met with the chief executives of investment banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to discuss the debt offering, the source said. 
Representatives for WeWork, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. 
The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported news of the potential debt offering.
WeWork, which earlier this year was rebranded as the We Company, has filed paperwork for an IPO. 
The We Company said in May losses narrowed slightly in the first quarter from a year earlier to $264 million. The company was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round.
WeWork, which was co-founded in 2010 by CEO Adam Neumann, has helped pioneer ""coworking,"" or shared desk-space, with a focus on startups, entrepreneurs and freelancers. 
To date the New York-based company has raised around $8.4 billion, according to data provider PitchBook. 
In January, Japan's SoftBank boosted its stake in WeWork by $2 billion in a deal that was billions of dollars below what the company had hoped to raise to fund growth and buy out existing shareholders.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Greensill issued false statement on bonds sold by metals tycoon Gupta,"By Tom Bergin
(Reuters) - Financing group Greensill Capital, which is backed by Japan’s SoftBank Group and General Atlantic of the U.S., last year provided a false statement to market participants relating to bonds it had issued in 2017 on behalf of commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta.
The May 2018 statement made to bond market investors and brokers said the Scottish government had approved a guarantee related to a hydro power plant in Kinlochleven owned by Gupta’s GFG Alliance, which the bonds were secured against.
But Scotland says no approval was given, according to a government statement provided to Reuters. The meeting records for the committee that would need to approve such a guarantee, which are available on the committee’s website, do not refer to a 2018 GFG guarantee.
Although the Scottish government had in 2016 provided a guarantee related to an aluminum plant owned by Gupta’s GFG, “no other guarantee has been offered to the GFG Alliance by any Scottish Minister or official,” a spokesman said. 
The prospect of government support had been a key reason Swiss asset manager GAM Holding AG had purchased the 220 million pounds of bonds a year earlier, because under the terms of the bonds it potentially meant a near-term repurchase at a higher price, according to three people familiar with the matter. A Scottish government guarantee would allow GFG to repurchase the bonds early, according to representations in an April 2017 pre-sale document outlining the nature of the proposed deal that was produced by Greensill for GAM and reviewed by Reuters.
The false statement marks the latest development related to a series of GFG bonds purchased by GAM fund manager Tim Haywood, who was suspended and then dismissed following an internal whistleblower alerting UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.
In response to questions from Reuters, Greensill initially denied producing pre-sale documents relating to the Kinlochleven bonds or any updates regarding a guarantee. The company more recently confirmed it had produced the April 2017 pre-sale document and the May 2018 investor update but said the update “was based upon information provided by GFG.”
Greensill added: “Greensill never knowingly issues false statements and strongly refutes such assertions. The contents of any statements made are believed to be accurate at the time made.”
GFG said it had discussed with advisors and investors the potential for a guarantee related to the Kinlochleven power plant but declined to comment on what specifically it told Greensill.
“GFG did not mislead anyone as to the nature of its discussions about additional Scottish government guarantees. GFG has never informed any party that any such guarantees had been put in place, and we are clear that the Scottish Government made no such guarantees,” said GFG, which is the umbrella group for the Gupta family’s metals, power and banking interests.
Gupta didn’t respond to a request for comment.
In statements provided Sunday following publication of this article, Greensill, GFG and fund manager Haywood said the May 2018 update wasn't false or misleading in the context of broader discussions involving the parties. 
Under UK law, knowingly providing false or misleading information about regulated securities is considered market abuse, an offense for which the UK financial regulator can levy large fines and ban companies or individuals from involvement in regulated activities such as the arranging of bond deals, according to Damon Batten, managing consultant with London-based financial services regulatory consultancy Bovill.
There doesn’t need to be a clear victim or loss for regulators to prosecute for market abuse, Batten said.
The amount of due diligence required by bond issuers depends on the situation and their regulatory status, specialists say.
The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK market regulator, declined to comment.
SoftBank didn’t respond to a request for comment. Private-equity group General Atlantic declined comment.
GAM said it did not feel misled by Greensill.
""GAM was never led to believe that the Scottish Government Guarantee had actually been put in place... nor was the May 2018 note interpreted to suggest that the guarantee was in place,"" it said in a further statement provided after publication of this article. ""GAM never received any false or misleading information from Greensill"" with respect to the Kinlochleven bond transaction, it said.
The asset manager said: “GAM continues to value its on-going relationship with Greensill, as reflected by our joint supply chain finance fund.”
GAM has sold or is in the process of selling around a billion dollars of bonds back to GFG, including the Kinlochleven ones, according to public statements and the three people familiar with the repurchases, who added that GAM wanted to be made whole.
Since GAM suspended fund manager Haywood and placed restrictions on client withdrawals following a wave of redemption requests last summer, it has seen its stock market capitalization drop by more than a billion dollars. 
GAM announced Haywood’s dismissal in February, after saying he didn’t comply with due diligence procedures and had signed certain contracts by himself where internal policies required two signatures, but didn't specify the transactions that led to his dismissal.
A spokesman for Haywood said on Friday that the former GAM fund manager denies any wrongdoing. In an April statement to media, Haywood said that the GFG bonds had delivered the profits for fund investments that he anticipated “even if the realization has been slower than I had expected.”
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
Australian Lex Greensill, a former banking executive, founded his financing firm in 2011. In recent months, it received an $800 million investment from SoftBank’s Vision Fund, which a source close to the deal said valued Greensill at around $3.5 billion. That followed a $250 million investment by U.S. private equity firm General Atlantic in 2018.
Greensill has helped GFG raise billions of dollars via bond sales to help fund acquisitions, according to a video on Greensill’s website in which Gupta features. That included the 2017 sale of the Kinlochleven bonds.
Haywood told GAM colleagues that he purchased the bonds, which were due to repay investors over 18 years, because he expected to be able to sell them back to GFG in about a year for more than he paid for them, according to the people familiar with the matter. That is because he understood from Greensill that Scotland was likely to provide a guarantee related to the Kinlochleven plant, which under the terms of the bond would enable GFG to repurchase the bonds and refinance with cheaper debt, the people said.
GFG companies are not rated by any major rating agency and carry high debts.
‘UPDATE FROM GREENSILL’
In May 2018, Greensill put on a secure online platform accessible by bond investors and other market participants the memo titled: “Update from Greensill in relation to KLL,” referring to the Kinlochleven bonds.
The update said the Scottish government had had several conditions before granting a further guarantee. It added that those conditions “have been met, and the guarantee has been approved by the First Minister [Nicola Sturgeon] on behalf of the Scottish Government.” Therefore, GFG planned to redeem the bonds, the update continued. Sturgeon has been head of the Scottish government since 2014.
The Scottish government did discuss the possibility of providing an additional guarantee to support the expansion of GFG’s operations in Scotland, according to minutes of an August 2017 meeting between Sturgeon and a civil servant. The minutes were among documents Scotland released following a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Reuters for all information through mid 2018 on Sturgeon's discussions relating to an additional guarantee. As of March 2018, the most recent documents provided in response to the Reuters request, no approval had been provided.
In its statement provided Sunday following publication of this article, Greensill said the article was ""based on an incomplete and misrepresentative reading of the facts."" It added that the May 2018 update ""was a minute of contemporaneous discussions""...""and was neither false nor misleading.”
In GFG's statement Sunday after publication of this article, the company said ""the May 2018 update written by Greensill formed part of a broader contemporaneous verbal update...that confirmed the conditions precedent for the Scottish Government to commence a formal review to consider the issuance of the guarantee had been met."" 
GFG added in the statement Sunday that the update ""was neither false nor misleading given the context of the contemporaneous verbal discussions."" 
Haywood, in his statement Sunday said: “I was never misled by Greensill, GFG or the Scottish Government on the prospect of or progress towards a potential Scottish government guarantee."" The May 2018 update ""was neither false nor misleading given my understanding of the transaction and contemporaneous discussions,"" he said. 

He added that the Kinlochleven bonds were sold in early 2019. GFG said it purchased and refinanced the bonds early this year.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2019 02:58PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank to quit equities, shrink investment bank in 7.4 billion euro overhaul","By Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is to ax vast swathes of its trading desks in one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis, in a restructuring that will see 18,000 jobs go and cost 7.4 billion euros.
The plan represents a major retreat from investment banking by Deutsche Bank, which for years had tried to compete as a major force on Wall Street.
As part of the overhaul, the bank will scrap its global equities business, scale back its investment bank and also cut some of its fixed income operations, an area traditionally regarded as one of its strengths. 
The bank will set up a new so-called ""bad bank"" to wind-down unwanted assets, with a value of 74 billion euros of risk-weighted assets.
The depth of the restructuring shows that Deutsche is coming to terms with its failure to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS). 
The cuts were foreshadowed on Friday, when the head of Deutsche's investment bank Garth Ritchie agreed to step down.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, who now aims to focus on the bank's more stable revenue streams, said it was the most fundamental transformation of the bank in decades. ""This is a restart,"" he said.
""We are creating a bank that will be more profitable, leaner, more innovative and more resilient,"" he wrote to staff.
Sewing will now represent the investment bank on the board in a shift that illustrates the divisions's waning influence.
The CEO had flagged an extensive restructuring in May when he promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank. This followed Deutsche's failure to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Some investors were cautious about the turnaround plan.
Michael Huenseler, head of credit portfolio management at Assenagon Asset Management, said a lot had to go right for the plan to be successful. 
""The margin for error is...low,"" he said. 
Union Investment portfolio manager Alexandra Annecke said the steps were long overdue and noted that the bank's aim to bring down its cost-to-income ratio to 70% was not ambitious compared with international competitors.
JOB CUTS
Soon after becoming CEO last year, Sewing started to cut jobs and promised to bring staffing ""well below"" 90,000. There were media reports from Reuters and others that Deutsche Bank could cut as many as 20,000 jobs -- more than one in five of its 91,500 employees.
In the event, the bank said it would reduce headcount to 74,000 by 2022. 
Deutsche bank gave no geographic breakdown for the job cuts. The equities business is focused largely in New York and London. 
A person with direct knowledge of the matter said job cuts would be distributed around the world, including in Germany.
Stephan Szukalski, head of the DBV union, told Reuters that the measures were in the right direction, echoing the sentiment of the Verdi labor union. 
""This could be a real new beginning for Deutsche Bank,"" said Szukalski, who also sits on the bank's supervisory board. 
The board met on Sunday to agree the proposed changes, one of the biggest announcements of job cuts at a major investment bank since 2011 when HSBC said it would axe 30,000 jobs. 
Deutsche said it expects a 2.8 billion euro ($3.1 billion) net loss in the second quarter as a result of restructuring charges and loss for the full year.
Deutsche will have been in the red for four out of the five last years. Its shares fell to a record low last month.
Founded in 1870, Deutsche has long been a major source of finance and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets, a role which had the tacit backing of successive governments in Berlin.
Big cuts to its investment bank could make it harder for the bank to fulfil this role and would mark a reversal of a decades-long expansion that began with its purchase of Morgan Grenfell in London in 1989 and continued a decade later by a takeover of Bankers Trust in the United States.
The investment bank generates about half of Deutsche's revenue but is also a volatile business. 
Revenue at the division was forecast to fall to 12.4 billion euros this year, according to a consensus of analysts ahead of Sunday's announced changes. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down more than 30% from 2015.
In the restructuring, Sewing let go two other members of the management board - head of regulation Sylvie Matherat and head of retail Frank Strauss - and brought in some newcomers. 

He also created a corporate bank to streamline services offered throughout the bank, something Sewing called a ""core strength"".

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>","After Deutsche Bank cuts, where will the growth be?","By Rachel Armstrong and Tom Sims
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - For  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) chief executive Christian Sewing, shrinking the group's investment bank will be the relatively easy - if expensive - part of his restructuring plan.
Finding steady revenue streams to produce the 7.4 billion euros ($8.31 billion) the bank expects in charges from cutting down its trading arm will be more challenging.
Germany's biggest bank said on Sunday it planned to focus on corporate banking, foreign exchange, deal-making, asset management, and private banking. All these areas potentially could provide less volatile revenue streams than the bank's equity and rates trading arms, but they are already fiercely competitive and undergoing sweeping technological changes.
CORPORATE BANKING
Deutsche Bank wants corporate banking to be the center of its business.
This involves building on its strengths in transaction banking - such as trade finance and cash management.
The bank is held up by rivals as a traditionally strong performer in these areas, but its standing has slipped recently with the lender dipping from 5th to 6th last year in the global league tables for transaction banking compiled by banking analytics firm Coalition.
Transaction banking, one of the less glamorous areas of finance, is a growing focus at several of Deutsche's rivals, as it requires less capital and is not as cyclical as investment banking.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) for example is looking to launch a cash management business next year while HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) are trying to build on their strong Asian franchises by beefing up their European operations.
In investment banking Deutsche has said it wants to retain a focus on advising on M&A deals and on helping to list companies and issue bonds. The bank remains a major player in this space, but trails U.S. rivals, while some European competitors are gaining some market share.
In Refinitiv's investment banking scorecard, which tracks how firms do on advising on M&A, equity and debt capital markets, loans and leveraged finance, Deutsche currently ranks 8th so far this year globally - steady compared with 2018. In Europe, it has slipped to 8th from 7th a year ago, with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) edging above it.
MANAGING MONEY
In asset management, Deutsche Bank's DWS arm is seen as another of its strong points, and one the bank leaned on to extract value last year when it listed 22.5% of the business.
But with the sweeping rise of passive investments, asset managers need scale and technology to compete. Deutsche had held talks with rival UBS (S:UBSG) earlier this year about a merger of their asset management arms, but talks broke down due to a clash over who would ultimately control the business.
In private banking, Deutsche has said it plans to hire 300 new relationship and investment managers by 2021 as part of a plan to bulk up in the sector.
But the bank will be tracing a path already beaten by several of its rivals, and it will need to find a strong niche if it is to make much headway.
Its wealth management arm had 213 billion euros under management at the end of the first quarter. BNP Paribas, which is just inside the top 10 wealth managers globally, had 361 billion euros at the end of 2018.
TECHNOLOGY
A broader challenge for Deutsche is technology, with the lender trying to update legacy IT systems that are blamed in part for the bank's failure to control costs while also keeping up with the wave of fintech innovation in the industry.
Deutsche has established a board-level Technology, Data and Innovation Committee to tackle this, and in a memo to staff on Sunday Sewing said Deutsche Bank would invest 13 billion euros in technology by 2022.
That should help, but it will be doing so amid a technology arms race in banking.
Research from UBS earlier this year found that JPMorgan (N:JPM) has budgeted $11.4 billion for technology in 2019 alone."

(Reuters) - Cruise, a U.S. self-driving vehicle company majority-owned by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), told Reuters on Friday that a U.S. national security panel approved a $2.25 billion investment in the firm by Japan's SoftBank Corp.
SoftBank has come under increasing U.S. scrutiny over its ties to Chinese firms in the face of an escalating trade and technology war between Washington and Beijing. It is in the process of raising its second $100 billion investment vehicle, dubbed Vision Fund, after deploying its first one of equal size. 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security concerns, approved the investment based on fresh assurances that Cruise's technology would be completely off limits to SoftBank, a source familiar with the matter said. 
A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment. The Treasury Department, which leads CFIUS, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. 
The approval unlocks a seat for SoftBank on Cruise's board, formalizing its oversight, and cements key financing for Cruise, which has raised $7.25 billion in capital since last year, the company said.
""Today's news is another important step toward achieving our goal to develop and deploy self-driving vehicles at massive scale,"" Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a statement to Reuters.
However, approval for the deal did not always appear certain as CFIUS scrutinized it closely, according to two people close to the deal.
The $2.25 billion investment was unveiled by SoftBank in May 2018 amid a wave of investments by the Japanese technology and telecommunications conglomerate in artificial intelligence, data analytics, financial services and self-driving cars.
RED FLAGS
The investment raised red flags with CFIUS because SoftBank invests in numerous mobility units, some based in China, and encourages companies it invests in to share information. 
CFIUS was especially concerned about SoftBank's co-investments with Tencent Holdings Ltd, a Chinese social media and gaming giant, and its investment in China ride-hailing firm Didi, which it fears could take technology from Cruise, sources said.
The committee, emboldened by a law last year aimed at strengthening the inter-agency panel, has flexed its muscles increasingly against Chinese companies as Beijing and Washington remain locked in a heated trade and technology row. 
Reuters reported that Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd has been seeking to sell Grindr LLC, the popular gay dating app, after CFIUS said its ownership posed a national security risk. CFIUS halted a plan last year by Ant Financial, owned by the chairman of China's internet conglomerate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), to acquire MoneyGram International Inc.
The Cruise deal was structured to allow $900 million of the investment to be disbursed initially, with the remainder provided once Cruise AVs are ready for commercial deployment and contingent on regulatory approval. The two tranches would combine to give SoftBank a nearly 20 percent stake in Cruise.
However, the Japanese firm separately announced a joint investment with GM, T. Rowe Price, and Honda of $1.15 billion earlier this year, further boosting its stake.
Softbank's investment, followed by Honda's announcement in October that it will pour $2.75 billion into Cruise, is still one of the biggest and most high-profile investments in self-driving technology to date.
Its Vision Fund, the world's largest technology fund, unveiled a $1.5 billion investment in China's top used car platform, Chehauduo Group, in February. Reuters reported in December that the same fund was hiring an investment team based in China to boost its presence in one of the world's most vibrant tech markets.
It is not the first time SoftBank has gone through a protracted CFIUS review. It has had to accept U.S. restrictions on how it runs some of its companies, including wireless carrier Sprint Corp and investment firm Fortress Investment Group.
SoftBank lost its claim to two seats on the board of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Inc when the ride-hailing giant floated in the stock market in May. SoftBank never received permission for the board seats from CFIUS following an agreement in 2017 to invest $9 billion in Uber. 
The autonomous vehicle industry could revolutionize transportation but faces engineering, safety and regulatory challenges, as well as skepticism among potential users.

GM Cruise and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo are often described as leading the pack of technology and auto companies competing to create self-driving cars and integrate them into ride services fleets.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 08:38PM ET</span>",Buoyant U.S. stocks at odds with downbeat market signals,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even as record highs this week in the major U.S. stock indexes telegraph confidence on Wall Street, caution abounds in other U.S. markets, where falling bond yields and flailing small-cap stocks indicate investors are torn about where to place bets.
Hints from Federal Reserve policymakers that the central bank will cut interest rates have buoyed both U.S. stocks and Treasuries. The S&P 500 (SPX), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and Nasdaq (IXIC) have all notched new highs this week, while yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped below 2% to their lowest since late 2016.
Rate cuts often occur in response to signs of emerging economic weakness, which is ultimately negative for equities. Yet lower interest rates are considered supportive of stock valuations by stimulating corporate earnings and capital spending as borrowing costs for companies fall. Such a conundrum was evident on Friday as stocks fell in response to stronger-than-expected U.S. payrolls data, which dampened expectations of a Fed rate cut.
The conflicting signals have given a bid to stocks in defensive sectors such as real estate and consumer staples, yet investors say they are hesitant to abandon cyclical plays, in the event of Fed rate cuts and a trade truce between the United States and China.
""Investors have got to be nuanced,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh, Scotland. ""I wouldn't disagree with being pro-cyclical or pro-yield.""
It will likely take several months of economic data - along with results from the corporate earnings season later this month - to clarify the picture, investors say. In contrast to Friday's upbeat employment report, data earlier this week showed U.S. manufacturing and service activity in June declined to multi-year lows.
Some are leaning toward an upbeat outlook. The late 2018 swoon in U.S. stocks was an early harbinger of recent softness in economic data, so equity prices have already taken it into account, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. In his view, the S&P's new highs reflect investors' anticipation that the data will turn around with the support of easing monetary policy at the world's major central banks and U.S. fiscal stimulus.
""There's not as much downside as people portray,"" Paulsen said. ""Every policy official in the world is trying to push up the markets and the economy, everywhere you look.""
Yet the performance in shares of small-cap companies, which tend to be more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts, belies such optimism. Though it has gained 16.6% for the year, the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX), which has risen 19.5%. Whereas other indexes have marked new records, it remains 9.7% below its August 2018 high.
""Investors are becoming more and more fearful that the economy is in the late cycle, and small caps, rightly or wrongly, are viewed as a play on the U.S. economy,"" said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York currently forecasts a 29.6% chance of a U.S. recession in the next twelve months. The bank's model, based upon the spread between 10-year and three-month Treasury yields, has reliably predicted recessions once it has hit the 30% threshold, said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a recent note advising a cautious approach toward U.S. equities.
With the muddled market outlook, several market strategists suggest splitting the difference: adding to positions in defensive sectors while looking for opportunities within beaten-up areas of the market, such as small caps.
Such an approach may be especially prudent given the conundrum regarding the U.S. economic outlook, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.

LIMA (Reuters) - Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru plan to work with the World Bank to launch a new bond to cover losses in the event of extreme weather, Peru's finance minister said on Friday.
The bond would be similar to a $1.36 billion earthquake bond that the four countries sold last year through the Pacific Alliance regional bloc they are part of, said the minister, Carlos Oliva.
""What we're going to do is design a new bond that's not just for earthquakes, but for hydrometeorological events, climate, the el Nino phenomena,"" Oliva told Reuters on the sidelines of an event at the Pacific Alliance summit Peru hosts this week.
Oliva said it was too early to estimate a pricetag for the bond but added it ""has to be similar"" to the earthquake bond.
""The model for doing this takes time and the World Bank is helping us with that,"" he said."

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 11:33AM ET</span>",BMW poised to pick production chief as CEO after Krueger bows out,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) board member Oliver Zipse, a 55 year-old company veteran, is the front runner to become the carmaker's new chief executive, sources said on Friday after Harald Krueger announced he would not stay on beyond April 2020.
Krueger said he would not seek a potential extension of his contract, thereby pre-empting deliberations about whether to give him another five-year term.
BMW declined to comment on whether Zipse would be confirmed as chief executive, saying the matter of potential executive appointments will be formally decided on July 18 when the full supervisory board is due to meet.
Zipse is the youngest of three potential successors, a possible advantage as BMW has an upper age limit of 60 for management board members.
He joined BMW as a trainee in 1991 and oversaw big increases in BMW's production capacity, particularly in China and the United States.
Zipse is also a favorite because his current job is head of production, a role which previous BMW chief executives, including Krueger and BMW's current supervisory board chairman Norbert Reithofer, also held before becoming CEO.
BMW, which also owns the Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) brands, has a track record of delivering industry-leading profit margins despite its small scale, thanks in large part to efficient production methods.
Before becoming a management board member in 2015, Zipse was a vice president of technical planning and for product strategy.
""The CEO candidate will not be a surprise,"" one of the sources said.
Zipse's potential rivals include 59-year-old R&D board member Klaus Froehlich and 57-year-old Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter. Another possible rival is Markus Duesmann, BMW's engine development expert, who left for Volkswagen in 2018.
CAR SECTOR UNDER PRESSURE
Under Krueger's leadership, BMW lost the title of best-selling luxury carmaking brand to Mercedes-Benz in 2016, and put the brakes on a plan to mass produce carbon-fiber based electric cars at a time when zero-emission vehicles made by Tesla (O:TSLA) were gaining traction with customers.
Krueger was hastily installed as CEO designate in December 2014 and formally took office in May 2015 following the defection of fellow BMW board member Herbert Diess to rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Auto sector shares have taken a hit since then, with VW's outperforming BMW's, as the Wolfsburg-based carmaker pursued a more radical electrification strategy. [nL8N1YA5A9]
Since Diess left BMW, VW's shares are down 18 percent while BMW's stock is down almost 30 percent. Germany's blue-chip Dax (GDAXI) index is up 26 percent during the same period.
Krueger, who is 53, has avoided high-profile appearances in front of large crowds since he collapsed on stage during his first major news conference as CEO during the Frankfurt car show in September 2015.
At BMW's annual results news conference earlier this year, the company sidestepped questions about whether Krueger would receive a contract extension.
Krueger said on Friday he would be seeking new career opportunities.
""After more than ten years in the Board of Management, more than four of which as the CEO of the BMW Group, I would like to pursue new professional endeavors and leverage my diverse international experience for new projects and ventures,"" he said in a statement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A strong U.S. jobs report that tempered expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month and weak economic data in Germany helped push global stock indices lower Friday after hitting record highs earlier this week. 
Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose back above 2.0% after hitting their lowest levels since November 2016 on Wednesday. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months, the U.S. Labor Department reported. 
That better-than-expected showing reduced the likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting later this month. Expectations of an equity-friendly rate cut helped push the S&P 500 to record highs earlier this week. 
""Obviously, this was a key report for the Fed as well in determining their path in the near term, and with markets fully pricing in a July rate cut and several thereafter, the stronger-than-expected report is likely to throw cold water on those fairly dovish expectations,"" said Candice Bangsund, asset allocation manager at Fiera Capital in Montreal.

1049,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 09:36AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Nothing Says ""Melt-Up"" Like a Monte Paschi Rally","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Nothing in Europe’s stock markets says “melt-up” like the sight of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (MI:BMPS) rallying.
The world’s oldest bank has long been a byword for the woes afflicting Europe’s financial sector, from bad loans to poor governance to misplaced supervisory forbearance and concentrated country risk.
For the last two years it has been grimly clinging to life after the European Commission allowed a state-led bailout worth over 8 billion euros.
Since then, what progress it has made in reducing its bad debt problem has been overshadowed by the broader rise in Italian sovereign risk, as a populist coalition government put the country on a collision course with Brussels and the European Central Bank with a blowout budget that threatened to breach EU rules.
But in the last weeks, the stars have aligned: the macro backdrop has improved as China and the U.S. declared a truce in their trade war, the European Central Bank has moved closer to loosening monetary policy and – crucially – the European Commission this week dropped its threat to start an “Excessive Deficit Procedure” against Italy. The bank itself, meanwhile, has completed the securitization of some $2.5 billion in good loans and given itself more freedom to deal with its bad ones. On Thursday, it even convinced investors to buy a 500 million euro bond, unsecured against any of its assets. In a world where safe 10-year German government debt yields -0.40%, the lure of 4% over three years from a bank propped up by benevolent authorities was too much to resist.
The bank’s stock, which was worth next to nothing until Wednesday, has now risen nearly 50% in two days. It was up 10.6% on Friday morning, while the Italian benchmark FTSE MIB index was down 0.1%.
Europe’s other indexes are all largely trading lower after another gloomy set of German factory orders data ahead of the release of U.S. nonfarm payrolls data later in the day. The STOXX 600 was down 0.4% but was still up 1.7% for the week.
It’s worth noting that Italy’s banks have all had a good week on the back of the temporary peace deal with the EU:  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), UniCredit (MI:CRDI), Banco Bpm (MI:BAMI) and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) have all gained between 7.8% and 9.4% as the yields on Italian government debt have tumbled.
The spread between 10-year German and Italian yields is now down to 203 basis points, from a high of over 300 basis points last year. Given that it was at only 122 basis points before the populist coalition took power, and given the prospect of renewed quantitative easing by the ECB, it still has room to fall much further, which will provide a powerful tailwind for Italian banks - if the government can avoid upsetting the applecart again."
1050,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 09:36AM ET</span>",India considering relaxing foreign investment rules for several sectors,"By Aditya Kalra and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government on Friday said it will consider further liberalizing foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in certain sectors, part of its efforts to make Asia's third-largest economy a more attractive investment destination.
Presenting the annual budget for 2019/20, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would hold discussions with stakeholders to relax FDI rules in the aviation, media, animation and insurance sectors, and ease rules for single-brand retailers.
""I propose to further consolidate the gains in order to make India a more attractive FDI destination,"" Sitharaman said.
Broadening access to India's economy for foreign investors could help Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who won a thumping election majority in May but is still battling a slowdown in economic growth and foreign inflows.
The government's move to ease FDI rules is also seen aimed at assuaging concerns of foreign investors who have become wary of India's investment climate of late, especially after new FDI rules for the e-commerce sector were seen as protectionist.
Sitharaman did not provide many details about the proposals, but there are plenty of clues about the directions the government may be heading in a government document, dated May 3, seen by Reuters. And they may be more ambitious than those made public on Friday.
That document outlined what it called the ""justification"" for easing FDI rules for seven sectors, including single-brand retail and insurance - which Sitharaman mentioned on Friday.
The document also laid out FDI proposals for digital media, contract manufacturing, coal mining, certain plantation crops and firms that store financial information for bankruptcy proceedings.
The proposals included the extension of FDI limits in some of the sectors, while easing rules for others. Told about the plans listed in the document, three senior Indian officials told Reuters last month the proposals had been in the works for some time.
At the time two top officials, Secretary of India's industries department Ramesh Abhishek and Additional Secretary Shailendra Singh, told Reuters there were no FDI changes under consideration, calling Reuters findings based on the government document speculative. The industries department is the key ministry for FDI reforms.
Abhishek and Singh did not respond to a Reuters request on Friday seeking clarifications on their earlier remarks.
PROPOSALS OUTLINED
For the insurance sector, the government document proposed that investment of up to 74% should be allowed with necessary government approvals, above the current 49% limit that is allowed without approval under a so-called automatic route.
The move would come as a boost to firms such as Italy's Generali (MI:GASI) Group, France's AXA and U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (N:MET), which already operate joint ventures in India.
Explaining the rationale, the government document said the private banking sector was ""financially more sensitive"" but allowed up to 74% foreign investment, and so the limits for the insurance sector should be relaxed to provide parity.
Sitharaman on Friday said the government would allow 100% FDI in insurance broking and ease local-sourcing regulations for the single-brand retail sector - both proposals that were listed in the government document seen by Reuters. Multi-brand retailers, who would not be covered, would include department store companies selling a wide range of goods.
In addition, the document also proposed considering that single-brand retailers be allowed to sell goods online without first opening physical stores, as the current policy mandates. That, if approved, would allow companies such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to sell its devices online without first opening shops.
""Online sales will lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training, and product skilling,"" said the document, calling the current requirement of first opening physical stores an ""artificial restriction""."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A strong U.S. jobs report that tempered expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month and weak economic data in Germany helped push global stock indices lower Friday after hitting record highs earlier this week. 
Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose back above 2.0% after hitting their lowest levels since November 2016 on Wednesday. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 224,000 last month as government employment rose by the most in 10 months, the U.S. Labor Department reported. 
That better-than-expected showing reduced the likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting later this month. Expectations of an equity-friendly rate cut helped push the S&P 500 to record highs earlier this week. 
""Obviously, this was a key report for the Fed as well in determining their path in the near term, and with markets fully pricing in a July rate cut and several thereafter, the stronger-than-expected report is likely to throw cold water on those fairly dovish expectations,"" said Candice Bangsund, asset allocation manager at Fiera Capital in Montreal.

Deutsche Bank's supervisory board is expected to meet on Sunday to discuss the restructuring, which could see as many as 20,000 job cuts, with New York and London bearing the brunt.
The lender is still hammering out details on a variety of issues, with the exact makeup of a trimmer management board remains an unanswered question, the people said.
Chief Executive Christian Sewing flagged an extensive revamp in May, promising shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank after Deutsche Bank failed to agree a merger with cross-town rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The overhaul, one of several in recent years, signals that Deutsche Bank is coming to terms with its failure to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as JP Morgan (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS). 
Among other measures the bank is examining is the creation of a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets.
Also, Sewing wants to reduce the size of the bank's nine-member management board, people have said. The bank is still haggling over the staffing of those seats, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. 
The revamp is expected to cost the bank up to 5 billion euros.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the plans for a corporate bank division.
Currently, a single corporate customer may have accounts with the private and commercial bank, the transaction bank and the investment bank. 
The effort would seek to reduce overlap and the new division would have a seat on the board, the people said, confirming news first reported by the Sueddeutsche newspaper. 
The new corporate bank would include the transaction bank, which has been a segment of the investment bank, they said. 
The transaction bank provides everyday banking services important for the finances of corporations, such as international payments. Sewing has talked up the unit over the past year as a source of stable revenue. 

The investment bank, which has lost revenue and market share over past years, is expected to bear the brunt of the cuts in the overhaul package.

1066,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 07:26AM ET</span>",Is It a Bond? Please Can I Have It? Right Now?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s slim pickings in the bond market at the moment. What else can fund managers do but fall into line with their index, close their eyes and buy?
A pervasive fear of missing out on even the slightest hint of yield has created an unseemly buying frenzy that has swept across Europe, touching government bonds and making its way down the credit spectrum to high-yielding corporate debt. 
It's become such a battle for investors to get hold of any form of fixed-income asset that yields on the bonds of France, Belgium, Austria and Sweden at a range of maturities, even beyond 10 years, have turned negative. U.K. retailer Marks & Spencer Group (LON:MKS) Plc, currently battling to revive earnings and figure out how to get people to buy its clothes, felt the FOMO. On Wednesday its 250 million pound ($314.3 million) eight-year bond was six times oversubscribed, and the spread on offer dropped 35 basis points from initial price talk to pricing. 
The backdrop to this is an expectation that the European Central Bank will push its deposit rate ever more negative and restart quantitative easing in the autumn to battle the bloc’s worsening economic weakness. Good news for bond returns. 
But there’s much more to the latest plunge in yields. The fund managers who, all year, had sat on the sidelines in the belief that they could not get any lower are now finding that their performance has fallen behind. Now, they have to catch up, and sharpish. This tectonic shift in fixed income is forcing them to make purchases that in the cold light of day defy logic. Underperforming in a bull market is not a good look. 
One important law of financial logic – if you lend money for longer, you should see a higher return – has been broken. Long bond yields around the world have dropped below the official overnight rates of central banks. The time value of money has essentially disappeared.
The U.S. 30-year bond, for example, yields 2.47%, less than the 2.5% upper bound of the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. It’s even worse in Europe. As my colleague Dani Burger puts it, the continent has gone beyond Japanification, now that a number of EU countries have a higher percentage of negative-yielding debt. 
What sort of world is it when the Greek 10-year is within 10 basis points of U.S Treasuries? If you thought 1.17% was crazy for a yield on Austria’s reopening of its 100-year bond, it now yields 1.06%. 
The evident desire of both the European Commission and the Italian government to avoid a summer row over government spending limits opened the floodgates for investors to pile into the last liquid market with any yield to speak of. The Italian curve has shifted so far down that two-year yields have returned to zero for the first time since the formation of the current populist government in May last year created a fixed-income drama. 
Fund managers who, with ample justification, had been underweight Italy have had to cave in. The year is half over, and there’s no other way to keep performance from being destroyed other than capitulation against their better judgment. 
Where does it stop? It doesn’t look like it will anytime soon. The consummate Euro-federalist Christine Lagarde will deliver continuity when she takes over from Mario Draghi as ECB president on Nov. 1. ""Whatever it takes"" is alive and well.
Fund managers have to strap on duration and secure any yield they can while it still sort of exists. Just try not to think about how all those pensions will get paid in the future."
1067,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 07:12AM ET</span>",GM's H1 China vehicle sales down 15% year-on-year at 1.57 million units,"By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) announced their quarterly sales in China fell, albeit at a slower pace sequentially, as the U.S. automakers were hit by a slowing economy amid the Sino-U.S. trade war.
GM's vehicle sales in China for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 12.2%, while Ford's sales slumped by 21.7%. While GM also suffered from heightened competition in its key mid-priced SUV segment, Ford was hurt by the limited new models for customers to choose from.
For the first quarter of this year, Ford's sales in China tumbled 35.8 percent while GM's skid 17.5 percent.
Still, the numbers from GM, the second biggest international automaker in China by sales, and Ford portend more uncertainty for the industry which is trying to rebound from a downward spiral that led to its first annual sales decline last year in more than two decades.
GM delivered 1.57 million vehicles in China in the January-June period this year, while Ford delivered 290,321 vehicles.
China's factory activity shrank more than expected in June, highlighting the need for more economic stimulus amid higher U.S. tariffs and weaker domestic demand.
Annual car sales in China fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, and they are expected to fall this year too. Sales tumbled 16.4% in May from the same month a year prior, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said. That marked the 11th consecutive month of decline and followed falls of 14.6% in April and 5.2% in March.
U.S. car companies' share of total China passenger vehicles sales fell to 9.6% in the first five months of this year from 10.9% in the year-ago period, according to CAAM. Over the same period, German car makers' share has risen to 23.3% from 20.9% and Japanese auto makers' to 21.3% from 17.3%.
CAAM is set to announce June sales next week, which industry analysts forecast will be negative.
NEW MODELS
In China, GM has a joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104), in which the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac are made. It also has another venture, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, in which they make no-frills minivans and have started to make higher-end cars.
Sales of GM's affordable brand Baojun dropped 31.8% for the latest quarter. But luxury brand Cadillac's sales jumped 36.6%.
GM sold 3.64 million units in China last year, down from 4.04 units in 2017.
Ford makes cars in China through its joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000625) and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) (SZ:000550). It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000980) to sell lower priced cars.
The Dearborn, Michigan automaker has been struggling to revive sales in China, its second biggest market globally, after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017.
GM, Ford and rivals are launching new models or sprucing up older ones to attract customers. GM has laid out plans to introduce around 20 new models or variants of older ones this year.
""Around two-thirds of the about 20 new and refreshed models will arrive in the second half with a sharpened focus on luxury vehicles and mid-size to large SUVs,"" a GM spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that more than half of the new launches will be new models.
Ford has said it plans to localize its luxury brand Lincoln in China and would launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which over a third will be electric vehicles.

It has launched new models such as Focus and Territory to boost volumes in China.

The Central Bank said Wells Fargo Bank International Unlimited Company admitted to five breaches from 2014 to 2019, including a failure to accurately report its capital position that revealed ""serious and systemic weaknesses"" in its reporting capability.
A spokesperson for Wells Fargo said the bank took its regulatory obligations seriously and had made significant improvements to its systems and processes since the breaches occurred.
Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been beset by a string of mis-selling scandals in its home market, prompting billions of dollars in fines and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.
Its Irish incorporated business has branches in London and Frankfurt, offering corporate lending across Europe, according to the bank's website. It had a turnover of $586 million in 2018, the central bank said.
""It is a minimum requirement of being regulated by the Central Bank that firms submit accurate and timely regulatory returns,"" Director of Enforcement Seana Cunningham said in a statement. 
""This enforcement action refers to failings in relation to both capital reporting and liquidity testing. For that reason it is considered to be particularly serious.""
The other breaches included a failure to properly document processes and procedures, the lack of robust board and senior management oversight and a failure to comply with regulatory requirements in relation to liquidity testing.
Weak IT systems also necessitated an excessively high level of manual adjustments in the preparation of regulatory returns, which the central bank said contributed to incorrect calculations.
Wells Fargo initially did not complete required remedial action in 2017 but has since taken the necessary steps to rectify the failings, the regulator said.
That reduced the fine from the ""appropriate level"" of 8.4 million euros ($9.46 million), in line with central bank settlement procedures. The 5.9 million euro fine is the second largest after a 21 million euro fine imposed on Irish lender Permanent TSP (I:IL0A) for overcharging mortgage customers, a central bank spokesman said.

It was also the second reprimand for an Irish subsidiary of a major U.S. bank in the space of 10 days after JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) was fined 1.6 million euros ($1.8 million) for regulatory breaches in outsourcing.

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) forecast a steep plunge in its second-quarter operating profit as the U.S.-China trade war wreaks havoc in global chip and smartphone markets, although one-off gains helped it beat analyst expectations.
The South Korean tech giant is on track to post year-on-year profit declines for a third consecutive quarter as chip prices fell due to a supply glut and U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies, a key Samsung client.
Memory chipmakers like Samsung and South Korea's SK Hynix (KS:000660) are hurting as rising tariffs hit global demand for electronics. Seoul cut its annual economic growth target on Wednesday to a seven-year low as exports slump.
South Korea's tech majors are also bearing the brunt of Japanese curbs on exports to South Korea of materials used in memory chips and smartphones, the latest flashpoint in a quarrel over Japan's use of forced wartime labor.
""There's not enough to say positive earnings momentum has come. Intensified U.S.-China war, and Japanese export curbs and signs of trade conflicts widening globally are likely to delay recovery,"" Lee Kyoung-min, analyst at Daishin Securities said.
April-June operating profit likely fell 56% to 6.5 trillion won ($5.6 billion), Samsung in a regulatory filing ahead of the release of its detailed earnings figures in late July. Revenue likely fell 4.2% from a year earlier to 56 trillion won.
The forecast profit is better than the 6 trillion won indicated by Refinitiv SmartEstimate that gives a greater weighting to top-rated analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
One-off gains in the display division, which supplies display panels to Apple Inc (O:AAPL), were reflected in the operating profit, the company said without elaborating. 
Samsung received reimbursement worth about 800 billion won for display panels sold to Apple as the U.S. smartphone maker missed a sales target the parties had agreed on, analysts said.
Shares in Samsung Elec were down about 1% versus the nearly flat wider market's (KS11) as of 0615 GMT.
In a further sign of the difficulties faced by South Korean smartphone makers,  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) said its second-quarter operating profit likely fell 15.4% percent from the same period a year earlier. 
LG estimated profit of 652.2 billion won for the April-June period.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Shares in Hexagon (ST:HEXAb) tumbled 15% on Friday after the Swedish industrial technology group warned of a fall in sales as the trade war hits China's smartphone industry and said it would cut 700 jobs.
Investors have been concerned about Hexagon's exposure to the Chinese market, which counts for a sixth of the company's revenue, and slowdowns in the automotive and electronics industries that have led rivals to issue warnings.
""Having experienced favorable growth in China over recent quarters, Hexagon has seen a much weaker-than-expected development in June,"" the maker of measurement and positioning systems and software said on Friday.
CEO Ola Rollen told Reuters June accounts for typically 50 percent of Hexagon's sales in its manufacturing intelligence unit and that the electronics sector had historically been a growth segment for Hexagon, representing 4%-5% of group sales.
""In June several orders were canceled or postponed due to the uncertainty in the electronics - mobile phone handsets production - sector in China,"" Rollen said in an email.
""No one knows exactly how this geopolitical tension will impact the global demand situation but we are now beginning to see concrete negative results from this trade war,"" he added.
UNCERTAINTY
Although Washington and Beijing reopened stalled talks this month, companies remain cautious with no firm deadline set for a final deal as the world's two largest economies remain at odds over significant issues.
Samsung (KS:005930) forecast a steep plunge in its quarterly profit on Friday as chip prices fell due to a supply glut and U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecom group Huawei.
Hexagon estimated revenue of 975 million euros ($1.10 billion) for the second quarter ended June. It said this meant organic sales would shrink 1% from a year ago, which JP Morgan analysts said was well below consensus for growth of 4.5%.
Brokerage  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said the drop might suggest broader weakness beyond electronics in China. 
""That is a question that will be answered in greater detail when we have reviewed all markets, but as a broad comment, yes, the rest of the business has performed more or less in line with expectations,"" Rollen said.
Hexagon's sensors and software are used for measurement and quality inspection in manufacturing processes and in engineering plant design and also in areas such as infrastructure planning, construction, mining, agriculture and energy. 
The company predicted an adjusted operating profit of 237 million euros, against 228 million a year ago. JP Morgan had a forecast of 262 million euros.
BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT
Hexagon, which employs over 20,000 people, said it would reduce its global workforce by around 700 employees and book a cost of 44 million euros in the second quarter.
The measure is expected to result in annualized cost savings of 51 million euros by the end of 2020. Rollen ruled out further need for restructuring or cost saving measures.
""We believe that this measure is enough, in combination with extensive new product launches, to set us back on track towards our financial targets set for 2021,"" he said.
The group is targeting sales of 4.6-5.1 billion euros and an operating margin of 27-28 percent by the end of 2021.
Rollen recently faced unwanted attention over insider share trading charges against him, related to a purchase of shares in a firm unconnected to Hexagon. He was found not guilty last month by an appeals court in Oslo.

Over the past decade, the group has released figures each summer detailing how much money has been saved through cost-cutting, production sharing and other efficiencies, establishing it as a barometer of the health of the 20-year-old alliance.
But since Carlos Ghosn, the former group chairman, was arrested in Japan and charged with corruption, relations between Renault and Nissan have frayed, raising doubts about the future of the one of the more successful auto alliances.
""People have changed, governance has changed, why go on doing exactly the same thing,"" one of the sources told Reuters, referring to the annual synergy figures.
""We haven't taken a definitive decision (on whether to publish it).""
The last cost-saving announcement, approved by the management of each company, was made in June 2018 and detailed synergies of 5.7 billion euros ($6.4 billion) achieved in 2017.
That was up from 5 billion euros in 2016, 4.3 billion euros in 2015, 3.8 billion euros in 2014 and 2.9 billion euros in 2013. The figures were first published in 2010.
The target for 2018, according to the last forecast published before the Ghosn affair, was for cost-savings and revenue gains totaling 5.5 billion euros, slightly down on 2017.
The long-term objective was to hit 10 billion euros by 2022-2023 -- out of total annual revenue, with Mitsubishi having joined the alliance in 2017, of around 170 billion euros.

SAN SALVADOR DE JUJUY, Argentina (Reuters) - In Argentina's remote northern province of Jujuy, Chinese telecoms giant ZTE (HK:0763) is installing a little slice of the Asian nation's vast surveillance state - security cameras that the local government says will help to curb street crime.
Even this relatively small, little-reported deal is raising concerns in Washington, which is increasingly warning allies not to buy Chinese technology that it says could be used by Beijing to spy on its customers.
ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) sealed a nearly $30 million surveillance contract with Jujuy in March to provide cameras, monitoring centers, emergency services, and telecommunications infrastructure. ZTE first made its sales pitch three years ago. 
The deal is an example of the tech inroads China is making in Latin America even as the United States warns about the dangers of using Chinese technology, especially related to surveillance. A Chinese official in Buenos Aires told Reuters the Jujuy project could help China expand its tech footprint in the country, by encouraging other cities to adopt similar technology.
Washington has ""concerns"" about ZTE's project in Jujuy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department's Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau said in a statement.
""China gathers and exploits data on an unrivaled scale, and uses the information to promote corruption, support arbitrary surveillance, and silence dissent,"" the spokeswoman said.
The U.S. worries about the project, which have not been previously reported, show how the United States is scrutinizing both big deals and small in its efforts to slow the spread of Chinese security technology around the globe.
The United States has offered little public evidence to support its warnings to allies, and Argentine and Chinese officials played down concerns about the Jujuy project in interviews and statements to Reuters.
ZTE, which has a small presence in Argentina, declined to share company data on its surveillance technology projects in Latin America or to comment for this story. 
U.S. ACCUSATIONS `ABSURD` 
At an event in the provincial capital San Salvador de Jujuy in May, ZTE's general manager in Argentina, Dennis Wang, alongside Governor Gerardo Morales, his security minister and police officials, made a presentation and described how the technology had helped cut crime rates in China. 
Jujuy already has close ties to China. A Chinese company is heavily invested in lithium mining in the province and China has provided the financing and technology for a huge solar farm, South America's largest.
Now Jujuy can be ""safe like China,"" the local government said in an announcement about the event.
China's lower crime rate is due in part to its sprawling - and contentious - surveillance apparatus of cameras, facial recognition software, citizen databases and courts controlled by the ruling Communist Party that have high conviction rates.
To be sure, authorities in many democratic nations including the United States and Britain also make wide use of surveillance technology. However, human rights watchdogs say China abuses these powers to suppress dissent and protest by its own citizens. 
China has built an extensive video surveillance system and installed smartphone monitoring technology in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where more than a million Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in so-called vocational training centers. ZTE and its subsidiaries have been heavily involved in building China’s internal surveillance project, according to procurement documents, including the surveillance infrastructure in Xinjiang.
The Chinese official in Buenos Aires dismissed U.S. worries as ""anxiety"" over the success of Chinese firms, especially in the race towards 5G telecommunications technology that firms like ZTE and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] are spearheading.
The official, who asked not to be named, said Latin American countries had a growing need to improve security, creating an opportunity for China to sell surveillance technology at a competitive price.
China's foreign ministry said the U.S accusation that China exploited data gathered by its companies was ""absurd."" The country was a ""firm safeguarder of internet security"", it said.
There have been no expressions of concern about the deal in Argentina, where China - a major trading partner and financier - is viewed as an important ally and not a threat.
Argentina's foreign ministry declined to comment on the U.S concerns. 
SAFER STREETS
Jujuy officials have reason to be open to affordable Chinese tech. The province is one of the poorest in Argentina and has crime rates slightly above the national average.
Security Minister Ekel Meyer said in an interview in San Salvador de Jujuy that residents accepted the watchful eye of the security cameras in exchange for safer streets.
He wants to take it even further by expanding the system to include facial recognition technology, a tool China has been rolling out as part of its domestic surveillance web.
Meyer said any citizen who was law abiding had nothing to fear from the surveillance system. ""This protects him,"" he said.
ZTE had already set up a small test zone in a local public city park and shipments for the first phase of the project arrive in September, the government said.
A source with knowledge of the Jujuy project said government officials had not carried out any kind of assessment of the technology's vulnerabilities.
Joseph Cannataci, a UN Special Rapporteur for data privacy, told Reuters during a recent visit to Argentina that the country needed to do a better job of vetting security equipment and software that it purchased.
""I don't care who you buy it from ... You should not assume that the vendor you are buying from is to be trusted. You should carry out your privacy impact assessment,"" he said, referring to a U.N.-recommended test to ensure people's right to privacy is not violated. 
U.S.-CHINA TECH WAR
The United States and China are in the middle of protracted trade standoff, with tech at the core. ZTE itself was hit with a crippling supplier ban last year, and the White House has since taken aim at even larger rival, Huawei. 
This has seen the United States look to persuade, often loudly, global trade partners to shun Chinese-made technology, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo firing such warnings during a Latin America tour earlier this year.
""The Chinese Communist Party is using technology equipment and services exports to promote Tiananmen-style repression across Latin America,"" a White House official told Reuters.
China launched a deadly crackdown on protesting students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989 in which rights groups say possibly thousands of people were killed. There have not been any similar incidents in Latin America this century. 
""Telecommunications equipment purchasing decisions being made today will have a lasting impact on how the United States works with partners and who it chooses to partner with in the future,"" the U.S. official said. 
In South America those warnings, however, appear to be falling on deaf ears.
In Venezuela, ZTE also helped the government of President Nicolas Maduro roll out a smart-card ID known as the ""fatherland card."" The ID transmits data about cardholders to servers supplied by ZTE and is increasingly linked by the government to subsidized food, health and other social programs. 
In Ecuador, Huawei and state-owned China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation built a surveillance system of more than 4,000 cameras for the government that was installed in 2011. In Uruguay, the government announced in February a Chinese donation of 2,100 Huawei security cameras for installation in four cities. 
In Brazil, despite Trump calling for President Jair Bolsonaro to sideline Huawei, Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourao said in June the government would not exclude the Chinese firm from operating a 5G mobile telecoms network.
Analysts said the United States had taken its eye off the ball in the resource-rich region as China had increased its global clout. 

""Team China is offering good technology, at a very reasonable price with very favorable financing. It's a pretty compelling package and the U.S. doesn't really have alternatives to that,"" said Paul Triolo, head of global technology policy at the Eurasia Group.

Technology shares (SX8P) retreated 0.9% with Infineon (DE:IFXGn), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) slipping between 0.7% and 1.5% after Samsung's (KS:005930) dour forecast showed the impact of U.S.-China trade war on global chip and smartphone markets.
Adding to tech woes, Swedish industrial technology group Hexagon (ST:HEXAb) warned of a drop in quarterly revenue due to the U.S.-China trade war, sending its shares down 14%.
Investors in U.S. financial markets will return from Independence Day holiday to focus on the non-farm payrolls, due at 12:30 GMT.

LONDON (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) is making a multi-million pound investment to build electric vehicles in Britain, in a major boost for the UK government and a sector hit by the slump in diesel sales and Brexit uncertainty. 
Britain's biggest car company, which built 30 percent of the UK's 1.5 million cars last year, will make a range of electrified vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in central England, beginning with its luxury sedan, the XJ. 
""The future of mobility is electric and, as a visionary British company, we are committed to making our next generation of zero-emission vehicles in the UK,"" Chief Executive Ralf Speth said on Friday. 
The announcement gives a boost to Britain's automotive sector hit this year by Honda and Ford's (N:F) plans to close factories. 
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has highlighted the dangers of a no-deal Brexit and the need to maintain frictionless trade with the European Union, echoing warnings from the industry that just-in-time production could be hit by customs delays and additional bureaucracy.
But it has signed a deal with workers at the Castle Bromwich factory to go from a five-day to a four-day working week with the same amount of hours which should allow the plant to operate more efficiently.
Three of JLR's four European car plants are in Britain, giving it limited capacity elsewhere on the continent. 
The other, in Slovakia, only opened last year and is still being ramped up with other models allocated there. 
""We are making this investment because the ongoing Brexit uncertainty has left us with no choice, we had to act, for our employees and our business,"" JLR said.
""We are committed to the UK as our home and will fight to stay here but we need the right deal.""
Both candidates to replace Prime Minister Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have both said they are prepared to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal, although it is not their preferred option. 
Brexiteers have argued that the EU’s biggest economy Germany, which exports hundreds of thousands of cars to Britain ever year, would do its utmost to protect that trade
Friday's announcement comes after a turbulent few months for Jaguar which announced around 4,500 job cuts earlier in January and posted a 3.66 billion pound ($4.5 billion) loss in 2018/19.
The carmaker is undergoing a turnaround designed to offer an electrified option to all of its new models from 2020 as it seeks to move away from its reliance on diesel vehicles which are being increasingly shunned by buyers.
Jaguar also called on the government to bring giga-scale battery production to the country so that Britain is not left behind in the rush to produce low and zero-emissions vehicles and technology.
Britain's business minister Greg Clark said the government was doing all it can to meet that goal.
""We are determined to realize that ambition,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) deliveries rose about 28% in the first half to just under 390 aircraft, putting the planemaker on course to beat crisis-hit Boeing (N:BA) in 2019 but handing it a record production task in the second half, industry sources said.
The working tally of as many as 389 deliveries - including 227 in the second quarter - leaves the European planemaker with around 500 planes to hand over in the second half of the year in order to meet an annual delivery goal of 880-890 airplanes.
This year's mid-way Airbus delivery numbers are boosted partly by the Canadian A220, recently acquired from Bombardier.
Airbus declined comment. It is expected to issue first-half orders and deliveries on Monday. Operational numbers can vary before publication subject to confirmation by auditors.
First-half deliveries in 2018 had dipped 1% to 303 aircraft due mainly to delays in receiving A320neo engines.
While engine delays have eased, getting the cash-generating single-aisle program on track after separate industrial snags at a plant in Hamburg is one of the company's top priorities.
Airbus will nonetheless reclaim its position as the world's no.1 commercial aircraft producer for the first time since 2011 as deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX remain frozen in the wake of two fatal accidents. Boeing delivered 202 planes up to May 31.
Airbus has reshuffled some key industrial management posts with the head of its A400M military airlifter, former space systems executive Michael Menking, brought in to run the dominant A320 program, according to a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) posting.

Previous A320 program head Klaus Roewe has been named head of customer services.

LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity-backed oil and gas producer Siccar Point is testing the waters for its potential sale later this year, hoping to attract interest for its mostly untapped North Sea resources, industry and banking sources said.
Siccar Point has in recent days invited over a dozen companies to review data on its Corona Ridge area in the west of Shetlands area with the aim of selling down part of its 70% stake in the Cambo field, according to sources close to the process.
The company however hopes that the interest in Cambo will draw offers for its entire portfolio, which includes stakes in a number of major North Sea projects at various stages of development, the sources said.
The projects include stakes in the Mariner field which is operated by Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR) and is expected to start production later this year as well as Rosebank, a large project also operated by Equinor.
Siccar Point, headed by Jonathan Roger, a former  Centrica  (LON:CNA) executive, and backed by private equity firm Blue Water Energy and Blackstone (N:BX), is valued at over $2 billion, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie and one of the sources.
Any decision on a sale of Cambo or Siccar Point as a whole will take place later this year, one of the sources said.
""A Cambo farm down might result in a broader transaction for the company,"" one of the sources said.
Investment bank Rothschild and Lambert Energy Advisory are running the process for Siccar Point, according to the sources.
Siccar Point did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Blackstone declined to comment. Blue Water, Lambert and Rothschild were not immediately available.
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) last year acquired a 30% stake in the Cambo field which Siccar Point aims to develop after successful well tests in August 2018.
The field holds around 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas available for development, according to the company's 2018 financial statement.
Siccar Point is one of several new private equity-back oil companies in the North Sea. It emerged as a major player following the $1 billion acquisition of Austrian oil and gas company OMV's (VI:OMVV) UK business in November 2016.
Many of the companies, such as private-equity backed Chrysaor and Neptune, are aiming for future stock market floatations, but uncertainty over the oil price outlook has dampened investor appetite.
Siccar Point had near 479 million barrels of oil equivalent in discovered reserves by the end of 2018, the financial statement said. Its output last year averaged 11,152 barrels of oil equivalent per day and group profit was $161 million.
Last year it sought buyers for its 20% stake in Rosebank, but the sale process was put on hold after the field's operator  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) sold its stake to Equinor.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust body on Thursday raided the local unit of French firm  Mersen  SA (PA:CBLP) and an Indian company over allegations they colluded on prices of equipment supplied to Indian Railways, two sources told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) conducted raids at Mersen's two offices in Bengaluru in southern India and at the offices of India's Assam Carbon Products in Hyderabad and Kolkata, one of the sources said.
The raids mark only the fifth such search operation in CCI's 10-year history. They can only be conducted with approval from a judge.
The raids followed a review of a complaint by the federal railways department which alleged the two companies had colluded over pricing of carbon brushes before submitting their bids. Such brushes are used in electric motors.
""Both of them were fixing prices, they did bid rigging to inflate prices,"" said one of the sources who is aware of the allegations made by the Indian Railways.
""Mersen is fully cooperating with the Indian authorities. As the investigation is ongoing, Mersen will not further comment,"" Mersen said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
Repeated calls to the offices of Assam Carbon Products went unanswered. Indian Railways and the CCI did not respond to requests for immediate comment.
Shares of Mersen (PA:CBLP) - a specialist in electrical power and advanced materials with a market capitalization of 685 million euros - were down more than two percent in early trading on the Paris bourse on Friday.
India's state railways, largely built during British colonial rule, are in the midst of a $130 billion, five-year modernization plan. The country's rail network is the fourth-largest in the world. 
About 30 antitrust officials were involved in searches at the offices of the two firms which began on Thursday and are likely to continue for about 24 hours, one said source. Some company executives were also questioned.
The CCI has conducted a number of raids involving global corporations since last year. In March, it raided units of global commodities trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN). Earlier it conducted raids at the offices of global brewers such as Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa) and Anheuser Busch InBev. (http://reut.rs/2JeQKEs)

1081,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 03:14AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Asset Mulling Fed at Zero, More QE Keeps Buying Bonds","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Asset Management is buying Treasuries and Italian bonds in a bet slowing inflation and trade-war tensions will convince major central banks to keep cutting interest rates.
The $1.7 trillion money manager is snapping up U.S. five- and 10-year notes as it predicts the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark rate by a combined 75 basis points through year-end. Shorter-maturity Italian bonds are attractive as the European Central Bank is set to resume quantitative easing, said Seamus Mac Gorain, head of global rates in London.
“The dovish backdrop comes from inflation but the trade war makes the cuts far more immediate,” Mac Gorain said in an interview. “We don’t really need to see any further escalation in the trade war for central banks to cut.”
Bonds are rallying around the world as slowing growth drives down inflation and enhances the value of fixed-income assets. The Fed said last month it was ready to lower rates due to increasing global uncertainties, while the European Central Bank has been edging closer to adding monetary stimulus as manufacturing slumps. Economists are expecting the Bank of Japan will also increase accommodation.
Treasury 10-year yields will probably fall to 1.75% by the end of December as the Fed makes a succession of rate cuts, starting with one this month, Mac Gorain said. U.S. benchmark notes yielded 1.94% in early London trading Friday, having dropped from as high as 3.26% in October.
“One of the questions we ask ourselves is: Is the Fed going to get back to zero in the cycle? It is possible they could do, but I think it’s not clear as yet. It really depends on how the economy evolves.”
Italy Attractive
JPMorgan has turned constructive on shorter-maturity Italian bonds, including five-year securities, in a bet they will be boosted as the ECB resumes debt purchases.
“We expect QE to come in the coming months, and that’s very, very supportive for Italy in particular,” Mac Gorain said. The most likely date for QE to restart is September, he said.
Italy’s two-year yields dropped below zero this week for the first time since May last year, while 10-year yields slid to 1.56% on Thursday, the lowest since October 2016. Even after their recent declines however, they remain among the highest in the euro area.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's largest pension fund, on Friday reported a profit of 9.1 trillion yen ($84.4 billion) in January-March, swinging from a record loss in the prior quarter, thanks to an upturn in stock markets.
The fund, which managed 159.2 trillion yen of assets as of end-March, had quarterly profits of 2.7 trillion yen on domestic stocks and 5.1 trillion yen on foreign equities, its earnings results showed.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) stock average rose 8.4% during the quarter, boosted by speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve's next policy move would be an interest rate cut.
The GPIF had suffered a record 14.8 trillion yen loss in the three months ended in December as worries about the escalating U.S.-China trade war battered global markets.
Given the ultra low interest rate environment in Japan, the fund has retreated from unprofitable domestic bonds and pushed into foreign assets.
It had 26.3% of its portfolio in Japanese bonds as of end-March, compared with 36.15% in September 2016 when the Bank of Japan launched its policy of pinning 10-year government bond yields around 0%.
By contrast, the GPIF's foreign bond holdings accounted for 16.95% of its portfolio in the latest quarter. It bought a net 630 billion yen of foreign bonds during the quarter, according to a Reuters calculation based on the fund's results.

Anbang said it would sell 77.7% of its stake in Hexie Health Insurance through its property and casualty insurance subsidiary, and the remaining portion to five companies including Fujia Group, a private commerce company.
Fujia Group will take a 51% controlling stake after the deal, the statement said.
Anbang did not reveal the size of the deal, which requires approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).
The move comes as regulators seek to speed up the process of selling Anbang's assets to minimize financial risks. Anbang was one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of foreign assets a few years ago, using leveraged loans and risky short-term financing tools.
More than 1 trillion yuan ($145.4 billion) worth of Anbang assets had been or were in the process of being disposed, CBIRC Vice Chairman Liang Tao told reporters on Thursday.
The regulator also would cut the portion of Anbang's risky short-term insurance products to under 15% of its total insurance products by 2019, Liang said.
The Chinese government took control of Anbang in February last year, part of a sweeping campaign to reduce financial risk. The company's former chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was later sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement.
""For the next step, the takeover team will steadily introduce strategic investors to Anbang and push forward its restructuring,"" Liang said, without elaboration.
China has formed a new company called Dajia Insurance Group to take over the assets of Anbang, according to sources familiar with the matter and a government document. The new group was led by He Xiaofeng, the head of Anbang's takeover team.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian prudential regulator on Friday scrapped a minimum 7% interest testing rate for bank customers' loan applications, adding to the stimulatory tools being deployed to revive the sluggish economy.
The change comes in a week where the central bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 1% and the government passed A$158 billion ($111 billion) worth of tax cuts to boost an economy that is threatening to stall.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) said it would give banks greater flexibility to set their own minimum testing rates, in a dramatic shift in just a few months after a public inquiry said banks needed to tighten lending standards.
""In the prevailing environment, a serviceability floor of more than 7% is higher than necessary,"" said Chairman Wayne Byres.
The change removes the minimum 7% interest rate banks are currently required to use in their stress tests of customers' loan applications and instead introduces a 2.5% buffer above banks' loan rates to assess serviceability.
The easing of the borrowing limit, first introduced in 2014, comes amid a sustained drop in house prices, record-low credit growth and as the central bank considers further cuts to interest rates.
The changes also mark a softening of APRA's more strident position on mortgage regulations that followed a scathing year-long public inquiry into banking sector misconduct.
That inquiry put forward dozens of recommendations including a strict interpretation of current lending rules and tests before signing on home borrowers.
""With many risk factors remaining in place, such as high household debt, and subdued income growth, it is important that (banks) actively consider their portfolio mix and risk appetite in setting their own serviceability floors,"" Byres added. 
The changes were effective immediately, following a consultation of its proposals announced in May.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2019 11:56AM ET</span>","Deloitte, partner fined over Serco Geografix audit failures","By Huw Jones and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Deloitte and a senior partner have been fined and severely reprimanded for misconduct over the audit of  Serco  Geografix (SGL), an outsourcer that on Thursday formally settled a six-year criminal investigation into fraud and false accounting.
Auditing watchdog The Financial Reporting Council said on Thursday it had fined Deloitte 4.23 million pounds ($5.32 million) and audit engagement partner Helen George 97,000 pounds after they admitted misconduct for audits in 2011 and 2012.
The latest fines were announced as a London judge said the subsidiary of Serco (L:SRP), that had been awarded government contracts to electronically tag offenders between 2010 and 2013, committed ""deliberate fraud"".
Judge William Davis made the comment as he granted formal approval for a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) between SGL and the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), under which the company will pay a fine of 19.2 million pounds and costs of 3.7 million pounds.
""SGL engaged in quite deliberate fraud against the Ministry of Justice in relation to the provision of services vital to the criminal justice system,"" the judge said.
SGL's parent Serco Group, one of Britain's largest government contractors, has said the fraud and false accounting offences related to how the company reported to the Ministry of Justice the levels of profitability of its electronic monitoring contract.
The judge said the decision by Serco Group to accept obligations under the terms of the deal had strengthened the public interest in approving the DPA, a court-approved corporate plea-bargaining tool introduced in Britain in 2014.
The SGL penalty comes on top of 12.8 million pounds compensation already paid by Serco to the Ministry of Justice as part of a 70 million pound civil settlement in 2013.
The SFO said its investigation into individuals associated with the case continued. A spokeswoman said on Thursday that a charging decision could come as soon as this year.
In the meantime, detailed facts of the case have not been published.
AUDIT SHAKE-UP
The penalty on Deloitte, one of the world's Big Four accounting firms with EY, KPMG and PwC, comes at a sensitive time for the audit sector as Britain's government considers how to implement a proposed sweeping reform of auditing.
Lawmakers have called for a major shake-up of accounting after the failures of retailer BHS and construction company Carillion.
Deloitte said it recognized and regretted its audit work on Serco Geografix had been below the expected standards.
""We have a program of continuous improvement for our audit quality processes ... We have also specifically agreed with the FRC certain actions focused on learning lessons from the shortcomings in this audit work,"" it said in a statement.
Both Deloitte and Helen George qualified for fine reductions after cooperating with the investigation, without which Deloitte's fine would have been set at 6.5 million pounds and George at 150,000 pounds.
Both parties were sanctioned for failure to act in accordance with the fundamental principle of professional competence and due care.
Deloitte is also paying 300,000 pounds toward the costs of the investigation and has arranged for extra training for audit staff. George remains at the firm."

The center-right president, speaking at an industry event, said that Argentina and Latin American neighbor Brazil were talking about the free-trade deal with the United States, confirming earlier comments made by Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie.
""The chancellor has said that we are also talking with Brazil about free trade deals with the United States and China,"" Macri said at the event, where he also underlined progress on trade deals with Canada, South Korea and Europe.
Faurie had told local newspaper La Nacion in an interview on Wednesday that there was the possibility of a free trade pact with the United States. Neither Faurie nor Macri gave details about the talks.
Marcos Peña, Argentina's chief of staff, told reporters on Thursday that a free trade deal with the United States was ""more a long-term project"" rather than anything imminent.
Argentina and Brazil as part of the South American Mercosur trade bloc struck a historic trade deal with the European Union last week after around two decades of negotiations.
Macri, who is under fire over economic turbulence at home and a biting recession, has long pushed his credentials as trying to open Argentina's economy and forge trade links with global partners. He is running for re-election in October.

""The demand for our products is going to multiply, and we have to prepare ourselves to produce more,"" Macri said.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",U.S. judge blocks Qualcomm effort to put antitrust ruling on hold,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ruled against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's effort to block the implementation of a sweeping antitrust ruling against it as the mobile chip supplier pursues an appeal that could take more than a year to wind through the courts.
Qualcomm has argued in court that the ruling could hamper critical negotiations with phone makers over 5G technology, forcing it to rework license agreements and even offer deals to rival chip suppliers, scrambling its business in a way that would be impossible to unwind if it wins on appeal.
A Qualcomm spokeswoman told Reuters the company plans to immediately ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the lower court's decision.
Shares in Qualcomm were down 0.5 percent to $76.73 after the ruling, which had been widely expected. 
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh did not give a specific reason for denying Qualcomm's motion but she did strike from the record several pieces of evidence that Qualcomm had tried to use to make its case, including a slide deck from internal Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) documents that Qualcomm alleged was evidence of a coordinated effort inside the iPhone maker to harm Qualcomm financially. Government regulators had objected to including the slide deck, which would have become part of the official record for higher courts to review.
Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to wireless data networks, is fighting a May 21 decision by Koh in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Koh ruled that Qualcomm's patent licensing practices had ""strangled competition"" and directed the company to renegotiate licensing agreements with customers.
Among other things, the ruling would drastically alter Qualcomm's business model by forcing it to license its patents to rival chip makers instead of phone makers, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies. Those patents generate most of Qualcomm's profits.
Qualcomm on May 28 asked Koh to set aside her decision while it pursues an appeal. It argued that Koh's ruling raised ""serious legal questions"" because, among other things, Koh blocked market evidence showing that Apple dropped Qualcomm in favor of rival chip supplier  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Smartphone maker LG Electronics Inc opposed Qualcomm's efforts to freeze the ruling. The phone maker said it is negotiating chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm and could be forced into signing another unfair deal unless Koh's protections remain in place. The FTC had also opposed Qualcomm's move.

Koh's ruling on Wednesday only related to whether to put the provisions on hold temporarily as any appeal plays out. Analysts expect many phone makers to be negotiating critical 5G contracts with Qualcomm while the appeal runs its course.

(Reuters) -  William Hill  (L:WMH) plans to cut about a third of its betting shops and jobs in Britain after the government slashed the maximum stake permitted on fixed-odds terminals, dubbed the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by their critics.
Britain cut the maximum stake allowed to 2 pounds ($2.52) in April after complaints that the machines, which had previously let gamblers bet up to 100 pounds every 20 seconds, were highly addictive and allowed players to rack up big losses.
William Hill, which last year warned that about 900 shops could be shut, said on Thursday it had suffered a significant fall in revenues since the change and would close 700 of them.
It said that the closures, which would put about 4,500 of its 12,500 British jobs at risk, were likely to begin before the end of the year, in the latest blow to Britain's struggling high streets. 
Despite industry warnings that such a reduction could cost thousands of jobs, the British government pushed ahead with it, saying the machines, offering games such as roulette, were a blight preying on the most vulnerable in society.
The popularity of the terminals had helped to sustain a nationwide network of around 8,500 betting shops on British high street when more and more gamblers were using smart phones, tablets and computers to bet on sports such as soccer and horse racing -- the traditional mainstays of the industry.
The closure of betting shops is likely to further accelerate that trend towards online gambling. 
""This is all about evolving consumer preferences and managing the progressive shift online. Very sensible even if not costless,"" Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey said.
Job cuts and store closures among Britain's gambling firms are also reshaping the face of the high street, after the collapse of several retail chains, including Toys R Us UK and electronics retailer Maplin, in recent years.
William Hill's rival GVC (L:GVC) has warned the stake limit would lead to the closure of up to a 1,000 shops and cut its 2019 core profit by about 135 million pounds ($170 million).
And in May, Flutter Entertainment (L:FLTRF), formerly  Paddy Power  Betfair, forecast its revenue from fixed-odds machines would slump 43%, but said it did not see substantial changes in footfall at its shops as a result of the change.
William Hill, which in March took a 882.2 million pound non-cash write-down of its retail business, did not immediately respond to a request for details on its plan. It said it was consulting with its employees over the shop closures.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Illycaffe chairman says open to partnership to expand cafe network,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian premium coffee maker illycaffe is open to a strategic partnership to help accelerate the growth of its retail network and could consider selling a minority stake for the first time in its 86-year history, Chairman Andrea Illy told Reuters.
The group wants to expand its network of branded cafes at home and abroad, especially in the United States where bigger rivals like Starbucks (O:SBUX) and JAB are jumping on a trend away from regular coffee bars toward high-end cafes.
Illycaffe - which serves up 7 million cups of its brew in restaurants and cafes each day - has 219 illy-branded outlets outside Italy, including 23 in North America.
In comparison, Seattle-based Starbucks has around 14,000 U.S. outlets and recently unveiled a new up-market ""roastery"" in New York. JAB owns several chains, including hipster favorite Intelligentsia Coffee, with well over 10,000 U.S. stores.
In a phone interview, Illy said the premium roaster had so far used a cautious approach to expanding retail outlets globally, with 20 openings every year, net of closures.
""If we find a traveling companion who knows the retail industry very well we could speed up growth,"" Illy said, adding a partner with a U.S. expertise could be valuable.
""We are bombarded with proposals from investors and banks ... if the right partner shows up we could even open up our capital to let them get a return on their investment,"" he said, adding the group could sell a ""small slice"" of its equity.
The remarks by Illy, grandson of founder Francesco Illy, hint to a potential shift in the future for the company, which is 100% owned by the family's holding company. In October, Andrea Illy poured cold water on the idea of selling a minority stake.
BOARD OVERHAUL
Matthew Barry, senior beverages analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International, said illycaffe needed to look beyond its home turf which was small and slow-growing.
The premium brand of illycaffe, which produces a blend made by nine varieties of Arabica beans, gives it an edge over rivals, the analyst said.
""Though pretty crowded, I think it is easier for Illy to distinguish itself (in the U.S.) coffee shop business since its offerings are very different than a Starbucks, a Dunkin, or an independent third-wave shop,"" Barry said.
Illy made clear the roaster was not in need of financial support and would not open its capital to private equity firms or competitors, such as JAB, with which the group signed a licensing deal on pods last year.
No concrete talks with a partner were under way, he said, adding that, with or without an ally, the company would open up more to attract talent from outside the founding family.
To meet this goal, illycaffe recently overhauled its governance, appointing seven directors who are not family members to its 10-member board. Six of them are independent.
Illy also set up a board committee on sustainability issues and the group plans to become carbon free by 2033.
""Sustainability is an endless effort embracing all our activities, from the lamp bulbs to the cars we use,"" Illy said.
The group posted sales of 483 million euros ($545 million), up 5% at constant exchange rates in 2018. Adjusted core profit rose 10.7% to 75.3 million euros."

""The optimal size of the banking sector is hard to gauge, but it seems clear, though, that the European banking sector is still too large,"" Enria told a conference in Lisbon.
""So there is a need for consolidation.""
He said that after a crisis ""consolidation can help to mop up excess capacity.""
""However, this is not about creating ever-larger banks. It is about more efficient banks, and the banking sector needs to be diverse in terms of dimension,"" he said.
In some cases ""the room for consolidation is particularly relevant in the mid-size and lower-size of the scale"", he said.

German 10-year yields slid below the minus 0.40% rate that the central bank pays on money parked with it. That is spurring investors to turn to riskier assets, such as Italian and Greek notes that are leading a rally in European bonds this week. Governments are cashing in, with both Spain and France auctioning debt at record-low borrowing costs on Thursday.
The move to more deeply negative yields supports the view that Europe may be following in the footsteps of Japan’s troubles to revive low inflation and growth. Analysts predict yields will keep falling on the conviction that Christine Lagarde, who is set to succeed Mario Draghi as European Central Bank president, will increase stimulus either through rate cuts or quantitative easing.
“The markets are really saying we expect more from the ECB,” Marilyn Watson, head of global fundamental fixed-income strategy at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., told Bloomberg TV. “We expect yields to go lower still.”
Ten-year German yields have fallen eight basis points this week to a record-low minus 0.41%. Italian bonds have outpaced the bund rally to narrow the spread between the two to below 200 basis points this week, the lowest since May 2018.
Ten-year securities in Belgium, France and the Netherlands have already joined the sub-zero club, adding to a record global pile of negative-yielding debt. In the U.K., 10-year yields also fell below the Bank of England’s interest rate this week for the first time since the global financial crisis. And in the U.S., 30-year Treasury yields fell below the top of the Federal Reserve’s target range Wednesday.
The ECB can currently buy bonds that yield less than the deposit rate, though priority is given to those that still offer a premium. In Germany, there are scant securities left in that category with 20-year yields also turning negative this week, although Draghi has hinted the ECB could tweak rules on the level of debt the institution can hold.
Bond markets may be relieved that German Bundesbank President Jens Weidman didn’t get the ECB job, given his previous opposition to QE, said Mark Holman, chief executive officer at TwentyFour Asset Management. Instead Lagarde, who was an early proponent of QE for the euro zone, has the political nous to do well, he said.
“Our sense is that she will continue to err on the side of caution, which is what markets would like,” Holman said.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",U.S. judge blocks Qualcomm effort to put antitrust ruling on hold,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ruled against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's effort to block the implementation of a sweeping antitrust ruling against it as the mobile chip supplier pursues an appeal that could take more than a year to wind through the courts.
Qualcomm has argued in court that the ruling could hamper critical negotiations with phone makers over 5G technology, forcing it to rework license agreements and even offer deals to rival chip suppliers, scrambling its business in a way that would be impossible to unwind if it wins on appeal.
A Qualcomm spokeswoman told Reuters the company plans to immediately ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the lower court's decision.
Shares in Qualcomm were down 0.5 percent to $76.73 after the ruling, which had been widely expected. 
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh did not give a specific reason for denying Qualcomm's motion but she did strike from the record several pieces of evidence that Qualcomm had tried to use to make its case, including a slide deck from internal Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) documents that Qualcomm alleged was evidence of a coordinated effort inside the iPhone maker to harm Qualcomm financially. Government regulators had objected to including the slide deck, which would have become part of the official record for higher courts to review.
Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to wireless data networks, is fighting a May 21 decision by Koh in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Koh ruled that Qualcomm's patent licensing practices had ""strangled competition"" and directed the company to renegotiate licensing agreements with customers.
Among other things, the ruling would drastically alter Qualcomm's business model by forcing it to license its patents to rival chip makers instead of phone makers, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies. Those patents generate most of Qualcomm's profits.
Qualcomm on May 28 asked Koh to set aside her decision while it pursues an appeal. It argued that Koh's ruling raised ""serious legal questions"" because, among other things, Koh blocked market evidence showing that Apple dropped Qualcomm in favor of rival chip supplier  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Smartphone maker LG Electronics Inc opposed Qualcomm's efforts to freeze the ruling. The phone maker said it is negotiating chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm and could be forced into signing another unfair deal unless Koh's protections remain in place. The FTC had also opposed Qualcomm's move.

Koh's ruling on Wednesday only related to whether to put the provisions on hold temporarily as any appeal plays out. Analysts expect many phone makers to be negotiating critical 5G contracts with Qualcomm while the appeal runs its course.

(Reuters) -  William Hill  (L:WMH) plans to cut about a third of its betting shops and jobs in Britain after the government slashed the maximum stake permitted on fixed-odds terminals, dubbed the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by their critics.
Britain cut the maximum stake allowed to 2 pounds ($2.52) in April after complaints that the machines, which had previously let gamblers bet up to 100 pounds every 20 seconds, were highly addictive and allowed players to rack up big losses.
William Hill, which last year warned that about 900 shops could be shut, said on Thursday it had suffered a significant fall in revenues since the change and would close 700 of them.
It said that the closures, which would put about 4,500 of its 12,500 British jobs at risk, were likely to begin before the end of the year, in the latest blow to Britain's struggling high streets. 
Despite industry warnings that such a reduction could cost thousands of jobs, the British government pushed ahead with it, saying the machines, offering games such as roulette, were a blight preying on the most vulnerable in society.
The popularity of the terminals had helped to sustain a nationwide network of around 8,500 betting shops on British high street when more and more gamblers were using smart phones, tablets and computers to bet on sports such as soccer and horse racing -- the traditional mainstays of the industry.
The closure of betting shops is likely to further accelerate that trend towards online gambling. 
""This is all about evolving consumer preferences and managing the progressive shift online. Very sensible even if not costless,"" Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey said.
Job cuts and store closures among Britain's gambling firms are also reshaping the face of the high street, after the collapse of several retail chains, including Toys R Us UK and electronics retailer Maplin, in recent years.
William Hill's rival GVC (L:GVC) has warned the stake limit would lead to the closure of up to a 1,000 shops and cut its 2019 core profit by about 135 million pounds ($170 million).
And in May, Flutter Entertainment (L:FLTRF), formerly  Paddy Power  Betfair, forecast its revenue from fixed-odds machines would slump 43%, but said it did not see substantial changes in footfall at its shops as a result of the change.
William Hill, which in March took a 882.2 million pound non-cash write-down of its retail business, did not immediately respond to a request for details on its plan. It said it was consulting with its employees over the shop closures.

U.S. GAMBLE
British betting companies have been pushing into the United States after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting.
""High street betting shops are costly, and revenues are being lost to the online business, and funds are required to finance the expansion into the U.S. – an emerging market for gaming,"" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. 
William Hill, whose British retail business generated 56% of net revenue in 2018, has invested in a digital launch in New Jersey and started operations or expanded in six U.S. states.

Britain accounted for 86% of William Hill's total net revenue last year, while the U.S. contributed 5% and Italy and Spain 4%, the company said on its website.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Illycaffe chairman says open to partnership to expand cafe network,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian premium coffee maker illycaffe is open to a strategic partnership to help accelerate the growth of its retail network and could consider selling a minority stake for the first time in its 86-year history, Chairman Andrea Illy told Reuters.
The group wants to expand its network of branded cafes at home and abroad, especially in the United States where bigger rivals like Starbucks (O:SBUX) and JAB are jumping on a trend away from regular coffee bars toward high-end cafes.
Illycaffe - which serves up 7 million cups of its brew in restaurants and cafes each day - has 219 illy-branded outlets outside Italy, including 23 in North America.
In comparison, Seattle-based Starbucks has around 14,000 U.S. outlets and recently unveiled a new up-market ""roastery"" in New York. JAB owns several chains, including hipster favorite Intelligentsia Coffee, with well over 10,000 U.S. stores.
In a phone interview, Illy said the premium roaster had so far used a cautious approach to expanding retail outlets globally, with 20 openings every year, net of closures.
""If we find a traveling companion who knows the retail industry very well we could speed up growth,"" Illy said, adding a partner with a U.S. expertise could be valuable.
""We are bombarded with proposals from investors and banks ... if the right partner shows up we could even open up our capital to let them get a return on their investment,"" he said, adding the group could sell a ""small slice"" of its equity.
The remarks by Illy, grandson of founder Francesco Illy, hint to a potential shift in the future for the company, which is 100% owned by the family's holding company. In October, Andrea Illy poured cold water on the idea of selling a minority stake.
BOARD OVERHAUL
Matthew Barry, senior beverages analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International, said illycaffe needed to look beyond its home turf which was small and slow-growing.
The premium brand of illycaffe, which produces a blend made by nine varieties of Arabica beans, gives it an edge over rivals, the analyst said.
""Though pretty crowded, I think it is easier for Illy to distinguish itself (in the U.S.) coffee shop business since its offerings are very different than a Starbucks, a Dunkin, or an independent third-wave shop,"" Barry said.
Illy made clear the roaster was not in need of financial support and would not open its capital to private equity firms or competitors, such as JAB, with which the group signed a licensing deal on pods last year.
No concrete talks with a partner were under way, he said, adding that, with or without an ally, the company would open up more to attract talent from outside the founding family.
To meet this goal, illycaffe recently overhauled its governance, appointing seven directors who are not family members to its 10-member board. Six of them are independent.
Illy also set up a board committee on sustainability issues and the group plans to become carbon free by 2033.
""Sustainability is an endless effort embracing all our activities, from the lamp bulbs to the cars we use,"" Illy said.
The group posted sales of 483 million euros ($545 million), up 5% at constant exchange rates in 2018. Adjusted core profit rose 10.7% to 75.3 million euros."

The company said Helen Weir will become senior independent director and Alastair Miller will be the chair of the audit committee.
""Since becoming Chairman in April it has been a priority of mine to restore the Board to full strength and these appointments are a big step in that direction,"" said Chairman Peter Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Superdry had warned in May of a shortfall in annual profits after Dunkerton began aggressive moves to reform how the British fashion retailer was run.
It delayed the publication of annual results to July 10, blaming the ""complexity"" of reflecting one-time lease and store impairment charges, coupled with recent management changes.
Superdry is still looking for a permanent chief executive officer and two non-executive directors.
The company, whose trademark jackets, hooded tops and jogging bottoms are popular with young people, appointed retail industry veteran Nick Gresham as interim chief financial officer in May."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's consumer watchdog has sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (KS:005930) Australian unit for allegedly misleading consumers by promoting water-resistant Galaxy smartphones as suitable to use in swimming pools and the surf.
The world's largest smartphone maker did not know or sufficiently test the effects of pool or saltwater exposure on its phones when ads showed them fully submerged, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) lawsuit says.
The case is the first filed by a major regulator and could result in multi-million dollar fines. It centers on more than 300 advertisements in which Samsung showed its Galaxy phones being used at the bottom of swimming pools and in the ocean. 
""The ACCC alleges Samsung's advertisements falsely and misleadingly represented Galaxy phones would be suitable for use in, or for exposure to, all types of water ... when this was not the case,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement on Thursday.
Samsung said it stood by its advertising, complied with Australian law and would defend the case.
The South Korean electronics giant has spent heavily on advertising to rebuild public faith in its premium smartphones following the costly recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 devices in 2016.
It is due to announce preliminary quarterly earnings on Friday, when it is widely expected to flag a profit plunge due to falls in chip prices.
HOT WATER
Samsung's water resistance claims came under heavy scrutiny as early as 2016 when influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports said the Galaxy S7 phone - which appears dunked in a fish tank in commercials - had failed an immersion test.
The company attributed that to a manufacturing defect, affecting a small number of phones, which it soon fixed. But customers online continued reporting problems, forum comments show.
Some consumers damaged their phones when exposing them to water and Samsung had refused to honor warranty claims, the ACCC said in the lawsuit, though Samsung said it complied with all of its warranty obligations under Australian law.
The regulator also said Samsung's advice to some Galaxy model users that the phones were not suitable for beach or pool use suggested the firm considered water could cause damage.
""Samsung showed the Galaxy phones used in situations they shouldn't be to attract customers,"" Sims said. 
""Samsung's advertisements, we believe, denied consumers an informed choice and gave Samsung an unfair competitive advantage.""
The ACCC alleges law breaches occurred in more than 300 advertisements. If proven, each breach after 1 Sept. 2018 can attract a fine of up to A$10 million ($7 million), triple the benefit of the conduct or as much as 10% of annual turnover.

Breaches prior to 1 Sept. 2018 can attract penalties as high as A$1.1 million. Rival Sony settled a U.S. class action over similar claims for its Xperia smartphone range in 2017, promising refunds where the phones had failed.

SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday it would give $100 million over multiple years to local governments and non-profit organizations to help families and communities affected by the deadly crashes of its 737 MAX planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The move appears to be a step toward repairing the image of the world's largest planemaker, which has been severely dented by the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane in March just five months after a similar crash of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia.
The two crashes killed a total of 346 people.
Boeing is the target of a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into the development of the 737 MAX, regulatory probes and more than 100 lawsuits by victims' families.
The multi-year payout is independent of the lawsuits and would have no impact on litigation, a Boeing spokesman said.
The $100 million, which is less than the list price of a 737 MAX 8, is meant to help with education and living expenses and to spur economic development in affected communities, Boeing said. It did not specify which authorities or organizations would receive the money.
Many of the passengers on board the Ethiopian Airlines flight were aid workers or involved with health, food, or environmental programs. 
""If the money is spent on furthering the work of the people on that airplane it would be money well spent,"" said Justin Green, a New York-based attorney representing several of the Ethiopia crash victims. 
But he said the fund would not affect his clients' courtroom strategy: ""What families really want to know is why this happened. Could this have been avoided?""
Anton Sahadi, a representative of relatives of the Lion Air crash victims, said the families appreciated the $100 million fund but it did not mean they would stop lawsuits.
""We will continue to fight for our rights in the courts,"" he said. ""Boeing is doing this to build their image back.""
CHARM OFFENSIVE
After the Lion Air crash on Oct. 29 Boeing started developing a software https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane-southwest/boeing-sees-fix-for-latest-737-max-software-flaw-in-september-idUSKCN1TS26Q?enowpopup fix on a stall-prevention system called MCAS believed to have played a role in that disaster, as well as in the Ethiopian crash.
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after the second crash and regulators must approve the fix and new pilot training before the jets can fly again.
But just last month, regulators identified a new problem that will delay commercial flight for the jets until October at the earliest.
Boeing is in settlement talks over the Lion Air litigation and has separately offered to negotiate with families of Ethiopian Airlines victims, but some families have said they are not ready to settle, exposing the planemaker to a lengthy court battle.
""The Boeing brand is worth far more than $100 million and the board and executive leadership understand that is what is at stake,"" said William Klepper, a Columbia Business School professor.
Following an initial response that public relations experts criticized as stilted and lawyer-driven, Boeing has been on a charm offensive, with executives at the Paris Airshow last month repeatedly apologizing for the loss of life. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg posts regular Twitter updates on efforts to safely return the 737 MAX to service and win back public confidence.
Robert Clifford, a Chicago-based attorney with several of the Ethiopian crash cases, suggested some of Boeing's $100 million pledge could be spent assisting efforts to return the remains of victims to their families.
""These families are distraught about the effort to get back their loved ones,"" Clifford said. ""They want closure.""

Boeing has also offered to match any employee donations in support of the families and communities impacted by the accidents through December.

Trade developments remained in focus as U.S. chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington and Beijing “will be scheduling face-to-face meetings” soon.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.2% and 0.4% respectively by 10:35 PM ET (02:35 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.1%.
U.S. and Chinese officials are “on the phone,” Kudlow told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “They will be on the phone this coming week. And they will be scheduling face-to-face meetings. Lots of communications.”
The two sides agreed to resume negotiations and hold off imposing additional tariffs on each other’s goods over the weekend.
Citing people familiar with the situation, Bloomberg reported today that China is now considering buying some U.S. agricultural products as a gesture of goodwill.
Purchases could include soybeans, corn and pork, the sources said.
The news came after Trump vowed to allow U.S. companies to continue conducting business with Chinese tech giant Huawei, although details of the arrangement were not disclosed.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.1%. South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed.

Four independent and minor-party senators on Thursday indicated they will support the legislation, meaning it’s set to become law in an upper house vote later in the day. That will bring A$158 billion ($111 billion) of income tax relief to more than 10 million workers and fulfill a pledge that was the cornerstone of Morrison’s bid for re-election in the May 18 ballot.
“Today there’s very good news for millions of working Australians who will get to keep more of their own money,” Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told reporters in Canberra on Thursday. He thanked the four senators for their support of the bill.
Conservative Hero Faces Reality of Australia’s Faltering Economy
The cuts will be phased in and by 2024-25, new streamlined brackets will ensure 94% of Australians pay 30% income tax or less. The package includes immediate rebates of as much as A$1,080 for low- and middle-income earners, a much-needed sugar hit for the faltering economy that will be welcomed by the central bank.
Beyond the tax cuts and previously announced infrastructure spending, the policy agenda for the third-term government looks thin, other than tackling red tape and a review industrial relations laws to crack down on union corruption. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe is urging the government to consider stronger action including increased infrastructure investment and structural reforms.
“There are options other than monetary easing for putting us on a better path,” Lowe said on Tuesday after the central bank cut interest rates to a record-low 1%. “We will achieve better outcomes for society as a whole if the various arms of public policy are all pointing in the same direction.”
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) sense of urgency has been stoked by a litany of data that shows Australia is on track to record its weakest fiscal year since the last recession in 1991, dragged down by record household debt, moribund wages and two years of tumbling housing prices.
The Labor opposition is calling for the government to speed up the cuts instead of waiting until 2022-23, while there are concerns a loss in tax revenue may result in less spending on public services, especially if economic conditions further deteriorate.
The legislation ensures the top income tax rate of 45% kicks in at A$200,000 instead of the current A$180,000, and removes the 32.5% rate. By 2024-25, there will be three brackets:
The Australian Council of Social Service, a group that lobbies for poverty reduction, welcomed the immediate rebate, which will see those earning between A$48,000 and A$90,000 getting A$1,080 of relief.
Still, in a statement earlier this week, it labeled the long-term tax cuts as “too expensive, too risky, too unfair, and too late.”
While six independent and minor party lawmakers collectively hold the balance of power in the Senate, the government only needs to win the support of four of them to pass legislation following the election. By the end of the last parliament, it had to court eight of the 10 so-called cross-benchers.

1124,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Why China's Stock Market Is Scarier Than 2015,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Around the world, more investors are starting to bet that dumb money can outfox smart money.
In the U.S., the world’s largest stock market, passive funds now manage just as big a pile of assets as active ones. China is following suit. As of June 30, assets managed by stock index funds rose 32% from a year earlier, outpacing growth in active funds. 
As China’s day traders move their savings into ETFs, however, they need to beware of land mines. By one key measure, the stock market looks a lot riskier than it did during the roller coaster ride of 2015. 
I’m talking about analyst coverage, an important transmission mechanism for information that ensures stocks don’t deviate too much from their fundamental value. Of the benchmark CSI 800 Index – which tracks Shanghai and Shenzhen’s largest listed companies(1) – a whopping 20% has no sell-side analyst coverage; and another 10% is followed by only one analyst, data compiled by Nine Martingale Investment Management LP show. By comparison, roughly 80% of CSI 800 stocks were followed by more than one analyst in January 2015.
The picture is only slightly prettier when we move up the market-cap chain. Of the blue-chip CSI 300 Index, 12% is tracked by one analyst or fewer, up from 8% in 2015. Mind you: China has no shortage of brokers. The Securities Association of China, a trade union, boasts more than 100 members. 
This is in stark contrast to the U.S., where stocks in benchmark indexes are closely followed by Wall Street. Only 16 stocks in the Russell 1000 Index are tracked by one analyst or fewer, and the S&P 500 Index has only two such black sheep, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
You don’t have to reach too far back for evidence of the damage this can cause. Before its abrupt trading halt in May 2015, Hong Kong-listed Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Ltd., was the largest member of the popular Guggenheim Solar ETF, with a 12% weighting. Yet the Chinese company had no analyst coverage – and trading volume was as thin as the solar panels it claimed to make. With its chairman Li Hejun holding an almost 75% stake, Hanergy's stock was vulnerable to price manipulation. After the halt, Guggenheim's ETF slumped 7.8% in one day, as U.S. investors rushed to pull their money out.
It’s worth asking why Chinese brokers have scaled back their research. One explanation is dwindling trading volume. In Shanghai, turnover is roughly one-third of its peak in 2015, as officials worked to stamp out margin financing and sentiment drooped.
Browsing through a list of stocks that lost coverage, brokerages such as Shanxi Securities Co., Western Securities Co. and Sealand Securities Co. jump out. Back in 2015, day traders used this sector to play the broader market. Now, with little trading – and tiny commission fees – bigger brokers aren't even bothering to assign ratings to their smaller peers.
Some smart money has already discovered this pitfall. A portfolio constructed at the beginning of the year including only CSI 800 stocks with analyst coverage would have outperformed one with uncovered stocks by 5 percentage points. In other words, China’s mom-and-pops may still be better off going with active fund managers.
I’ve argued previously that China is the only major market left in the world where traders can make real money. The dearth of analyst coverage is another reason why, and could mean that Chinese stocks aren’t fit for passive investors just yet. Another Hanergy may be lurking.

The Dow industrials broke their last record close, set on Oct. 3. Wednesday's rally was fueled by gains in Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CSCO), pharmaceutical giants Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:NYSE:JNJ) and McDonalds (MCD).
The rally may have been simply pre-Independence Day enthusiasm or investor optimism global trade disputes will get resolved.

Stocks and bonds stopped trading at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT), futures trading an hour later. U.S. financial markets are closed Thursday for the Independence Day holiday.
The Nasdaq 100 was led by Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), reportedly in talks to sell out to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), after reporting strong second-quarter sales, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).
The rally was aided by another fall in interest rates. The United States 10-Year yield fell to 1.95% from Tuesday's 1.976%. The yield has fallen 27% this year as investors have worried about slowing global and domestic economic growth.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitoring Tool, investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut its key federal funds rate at its July 30-31 from 2.25%-2.5% to 2%-2.25%. Another rate cut would come in September.
To underscore that concern about the state of the economy. the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private-sector growth adding 102,000 jobs in June, compared with a forecast of 140,000 jobs from economists surveyed by Investing.com.
The Labor Department will issue its big June report before Friday's market open. Economists surveyed by Investing.com expected the economy added 160,000 non-farm jobs in June, after a disappointing May report showed only 75,000 jobs created.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (Reuters) - An association of Brazilian mining companies on Wednesday criticized some proposals made a day earlier by a Senate committee that spent months investigating the collapse of one of Vale SA's tailings dams.
In a 400-page report, the Senate panel looking into the January disaster proposed a ban on new tailings dams, sought the phase-out of all existing tailings dams within 10 years and recommended harsher legislation for environmental crimes.
The dam in the town of Brumadinho, which contained tailings, the mud-like byproducts of mining, burst on Jan. 25, unleashing a torrent of toxic mud that killed at least 246 people, most of them buried alive.
The panel also asked for implementation of a 40% royalty charge on high-yield mines and recommended the indictment of several Vale executives, including the former CEO and the current CFO.
Wilson Brumer, president of the association known as Ibram - which includes Vale - said the proposals regarding dams and taxation need to be better evaluated, with specific studies before any implementation.
Senators were punishing the whole mining sector for one company's mistakes, Brumer said. He also said the report would create legal confusion in the sector, and could impact investment decisions.
""We don't want to ignore what happened, it needs to be investigated. But let's not mix up punishment with taxation,"" he said.
Currently, mining activities in Brazil are subject to a royalty charge of 3.5% over gross revenue.
Regarding an overall decommissioning of all dams, Ibram says it could be very hard to carry out due to the diversity of the sector. Some smaller mining companies could not bear the high costs expected if the proposal were passed, it said."

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. consumers likely paid more for grills to cook their Independence Day hot dogs and burgers this year because of the U.S.-China trade war, but they will find some consolation in less costly meat for cookouts as tariffs curb U.S. exports. 
The tit-for-tat tariff fight between the world's two largest economies started by U.S. President Donald Trump a year ago has U.S. companies facing higher costs for metals and components, while U.S. agricultural exports to China have fallen off. 
Grill manufacturers such as RH Peterson Co, which owns high-end brands Fire Magic Grills and American Outdoor Grill, said they were struggling with higher prices for raw materials like steel as well as Chinese-made components of their products. ""It's something that has been very harmful for our operations,"" said Joe Valencia, purchasing manager at RH Peterson.
While the company absorbed some of the costs, it has raised prices on grills by almost 10% this year - more than the normal seasonal increase of 1% to 4% each summer, said Jerry Scott, senior vice president of sales.
Fourth of July meats are bountiful in U.S. grocery stores after U.S. farmers increased production and trade disputes limited some exports.
At a Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co-owned Mariano's grocery store in Chicago, customers enjoyed ""Buy one, get one free"" steak specials and $3.99 burgers this week.
""I actually did notice that meat was cheaper this year,"" said Donald Denna, a Mariano's customer. ""We normally cook chicken on the Fourth of July, but this year I got steak.""
    Lean ground beef used in hamburgers costs $4.52, down from $4.65 last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Boneless New York strip steak costs $8.64 a pound, down from $9.75 a year ago.
""Ongoing trade disputes that constrain market access and/or result in elevated tariffs ultimately reduce the volume and value of U.S. meat exports,"" said Glynn Tonsor, an agricultural economist at Kansas State University. 
    Pork spareribs for the grill cost $2.07 a pound, up slightly from $2.04 a year ago. Pork prices have increased as an outbreak of a fatal hog disease in China has fueled expectations for increased U.S. exports by companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) despite a 62% tariff on U.S. pork in China. 
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE
U.S. pork exports to China and Hong Kong, the No. 2 buyers of U.S. pork before the trade war, were down 16% this year through April and also fell to top-buyer Mexico as the Trump administration renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.
Beef exports to China fell 34% to 30,242 metric tons. China is not a major buyer of U.S. beef but imposed a 25% retaliatory tariff on imports last year. Large U.S. supplies of beef and pork are keeping a lid on chicken prices too.
The trade war has roiled global markets, with varying consequences for consumers. Futures prices for Midwest hot-rolled coil steel,, one type of metal used in grills, have fallen this week to $525, below record highs from May 2018 when Trump applied broad tariffs on global steel imports but well above their five-year low of $364 in December 2015.
It could have been worse. The U.S. government recently postponed the introduction of tariffs on $300 billion worth of products, a list that included all Chinese-made grills, after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Japan last month. Of the grills sold in the United States, 90% are imported and most larger chains such as  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's Companies Inc buy their products straight from Chinese suppliers.

Another piece of good news - fireworks, a July 4 staple, were also included on the list of Chinese products slated to have 25% tariffs levied on them in July. But those tariffs were also postponed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd ""under the highest national security scrutiny"" since the company is still blacklisted.
In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the ""presumption of denial"" standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved. 
President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns. 
U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world's top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.
But four days after Trump's announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.
""It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing's changing,"" said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer. 
""There's even less change than we anticipated if we're still applying the presumption of denial,"" Jacobson added, noting that he's advising clients not to even apply for a license because it's not worth their time and money under that review policy. 
In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.
All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the ""presumption of denial"" licensing policy.
The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete. 
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow ""lower tech"" chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.
The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.
It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Major averages close at record highs on dovish Fed hopes,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the major indexes closing at a record high, as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would take a more dovish turn as a raft of data provided more evidence of a slowing economy.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury Note yields (US10YT=RR) touched its lowest since November 2016 at 1.939%, while euro zone yields tumbled to record lows on bets the European Central Bank's next chief would stay a dovish course.
Data on Wednesday showed the U.S. trade deficit jumped to a five-month high while services sector data showed a slowdown in activity. The reports come on the heels of data on housing, manufacturing, business investment and consumer spending that point to slowing economic growth in the quarter.
""The data has been mixed, it hasn’t been terrible, sort of a decline generally,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.
""Certainly the bond market is continuing to hit fresh yield lows so that is a message there is a definite slowing and the central banks will have to cut. I guess the equity markets are saying that is going to be OK.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 179.32 points, or 0.67%, to 26,966, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 22.79 points, or 0.77%, to 2,995.8 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 61.14 points, or 0.75%, to 8,170.23.
The defensive utilities (SPLRCU), real estate (SPLRCT) and consumer staples (SPLRCS) rose the most among the 11 major S&P sectors as the falling bond yields made stocks that pay high dividends more attractive. The dividend yield for the broad S&P 500 and the 10-year Treasury are nearly identical.
(Graphic: S&P 500 dividend yield vs 10-year Treasury - https://tmsnrt.rs/2YvzTnI)
Traders currently see a 29.7% chance the Federal Reserve would cut borrowing costs by half a percentage point at its July 30-31 policy meeting, up from the 25% perceived chance on Tuesday and 24% a week ago. A cut of at least a quarter percentage point is viewed as a certainty.
Rising expectations for a rate cut, fueled by softer economic data and comments from global central banks indicating a more dovish stance helped the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indexes post their best June performance in decades.
The Atlanta Fed on Wednesday trimmed its second-quarter GDP growth view to 1.3% on an annualized rate, down from 1.5% on Monday.
Trading volumes were thin due to shortened trading hours on Wednesday ahead of the July Fourth holiday. About 4.15 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.89 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Additional data on the labor market showed the ADP National Employment Report, considered by some to be a precursor to the Labor Department's more comprehensive monthly nonfarm payrolls data due on Friday, showed U.S. private employers added 102,000 jobs in June, well below economists' expectations.
Among stocks,  Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC) surged 13.57%, the most on the S&P, after sources told Reuters that chipmaker Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) is in advanced talks to buy the cybersecurity firm. Broadcom fell 3.5%.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) rose 4.61% after the electric carmaker set a record for quarterly vehicle deliveries after months of questions about demand for its luxury electric cars.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.85-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 85 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 88 new highs and 40 new lows."
1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 01:16PM ET</span>",Reinsurance hedge fund Tangency Capital raises further $165 million,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Tangency Capital has raised a further $165 million to invest in the property reinsurance market, bringing its size to $265 million as the hurricane season gets under way, one of its co-founders told Reuters on Wednesday.
Insured losses from natural catastrophes totaled more than $200 billion in the past two years, leading to a rise in reinsurance premiums. Reinsurers help insurers share the burden of large losses such as hurricanes, in return for part of the premium.
Tangency Capital launched last year to invest directly in non-life reinsurance risks, and is benefiting from the rising rates, Dominik Hagedorn told Reuters by telephone.
""The market environment now is actually quite attractive, we are seeing meaningful rate improvement.""
Reinsurance rates rose by up to 25% in Florida, an area affected by hurricanes, in the latest renewal round, broker Willis Re said this week.
Investors have been attracted to funds that invest in catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities as a way to gain exposure to the reinsurance market, which has higher returns than many asset classes.
Catastrophe bonds, for example, offer a high coupon but do not pay out if a particular natural catastrophe occurs.
Six insurance-linked hedge funds launched in 2018, though only one launched this year, according to data from Preqin. There were 227 hedge fund launches globally this year and 302 liquidations, Preqin said.
Tangency gained investments from pension funds and family offices in the latest funding round, Hagedorn said.
Tangency Capital has offices in London and Bermuda and was founded by Hagedorn, Michael Jedraszak and Kai Morgenstern."

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 01:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sweden's EQT targets Asia Pacific as IPO decision looms,"By Esha Vaish and Pamela Barbaglia
STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - High above Stockholm's skyline, Sweden's EQT Partners is plotting the next chapter in its rapid rise from a Nordic-focused investor to the world's seventh-biggest buyout firm, with a focus on growth in the Asia Pacific region.
With 40 billion euros ($45 billion) under management, EQT has quietly transformed itself since its launch in 1994 from an investment arm for Sweden's influential Wallenberg family into Europe's second-largest private equity (PE) fund behind Britain's CVC.
EQT raised a record 9 billion euros in March for its fourth infrastructure fund and in May paid $8.2 billion for U.S. fiber network firm Zayo (N:ZAYO) and $10 billion for Nestle's (S:NESN) skincare unit, its largest deal to date.
While much of EQT's growth outside of the Nordics has come from buying and selling companies in Germany and Switzerland, its management is now turning east for expansion.
""Asia offers a great opportunity for growth and we intend to increase our presence there,"" Chief Executive Christian Sinding told Reuters at EQT's new headquarters.
The 46-year old Norwegian, dressed in shirt and jeans rather than formal business attire, stressed that the fund wanted to grow in areas where it was still small rather than expanding in new asset classes.
Sinding said EQT may pursue an initial public offering (IPO) as part of a strategic review which was announced last year. A decision on whether to proceed would be made after the summer.
""In order to future-proof EQT and continue our growth, we are considering taking this a step further by building EQT's own balance sheet,"" Sinding told Reuters.
And while economic uncertainty means tougher times might lie ahead, Sinding - who has worked at EQT for 21 years and has led its equity investment advisory team since 2011 - sees bigger deals and larger funds as a natural evolution.
""We think a lot about the recession. EQT pays high multiples for assets, but we're okay with that because it's about buying really good companies and making them better,"" he added.
Sources familiar with the Nestle deal said EQT paid close to 20 times EBITDA due to fierce competition from other investors. A report by Bain & Co says the average multiple for European and U.S. buyout deals is around 11 times across all sectors.
Asia Pacific represents around 16% of EQT's portfolio and former CEO Thomas von Koch, now its deputy managing partner, is set to move to Hong Kong to back the growth strategy for the region, which includes setting up an office in Australia.
The Nordic region dominates EQT's holdings with 33% of its invested capital at the end of 2018, with the rest of Europe accounting for 25%, the Americas 20% and the rest of the world the remainder.
Sinding also wants to invest in disruptive but not yet profitable start-ups in Europe, in a quest to find the next Spotify (N:SPOT) or Klarna, as well as in profitable private firms in need of capital such as Banking Circle.
""We have a ventures fund and great buy-out funds but there is an interesting pocket in between,"" he said.

'MOST REPUTABLE'
While U.S. giants Blackstone (N:BX), KKR and Carlyle (O:CG) have gone public and become self-styled alternative asset managers, only a handful of PE funds are listed in Europe.
Sinding ruled out any interest in diversifying EQT away from its core business of companies, infrastructure and credit.
""We stick to investments that can add real value. Our aim is not to be the biggest private equity fund but rather the most reputable,"" he said.
Unlike its biggest American and European competitors, EQT has flat organizational and fee structures, both staples of Nordic consensus-building business models, as well as an industrial approach where target firms are chosen because of their business model.
Pressure to change EQT's set-up and become a publicly-traded company is partly driven by  Investor  AB (ST:INVEb), the Wallenberg investment vehicle, looking to cut its exposure to EQT, bankers close to the IPO have said.
Investor AB, which has 21.5 billion Swedish crowns invested in EQT through a 23% stake in EQT AB and investments in most of its funds, has annually made a 30% return and cash flows of 1 billion crowns-1.5 billion from the investments over 25 years.
Sources said a dual listing in Stockholm and Zurich, which is home to EQT's second headquarters, is a possibility as the firm seeks to model itself after Zurich-listed  Partners Group  (S:PGHN), which trades at 23.8 times earnings and has outperformed U.S. rivals in the last five years.
""It is the only IPO in Sweden for which local investors are getting out of bed,"" a Stockholm-based banker said."
1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>",China criticizes Britain for 'shameless' comments on Hong Kong,"By Ben Blanchard and Alistair Smout
BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - China told Britain to keep its hands off Hong Kong on Wednesday while London called for Beijing to honor the agreements made when the city was handed over in 1997, escalating a diplomatic spat over the former British colony. 
Beijing denounced British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt as ""shameless"" and said it had made a diplomatic complaint to London after he warned of consequences if China neglected its commitments to guarantee basic freedoms.
""In the minds of some people, they regard Hong Kong as still under British rule. They forget ... that Hong Kong has now returned to the embrace of the Motherland,"" China's ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, said.
""I tell them: hands off Hong Kong and show respect. This colonial mindset is still haunting the minds of some officials or politicians,"" Liu told reporters.
The growing war of words between China and Britain follows mass protests in Hong Kong against a now suspended bill that would allow extradition to mainland China.
Hundreds of protesters in the former British colony besieged and broke into the legislature on Monday after a demonstration marking the anniversary of return to Chinese rule.
China called the violence an ""undisguised challenge"" to the ""one country, two systems"" model under which Hong Kong has been ruled for 22 years. 
On Tuesday, Hunt warned of consequences if China did not abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 on the terms of the return of Hong Kong, which allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including the right to protest.
""We can make it clear we stand behind the people of Hong Kong in defense of the freedoms that we negotiated for them when we agreed to the handover in 1997 and we can remind everyone that we expect all countries to honor their international obligations,"" Hunt told Reuters.
Hunt is one of two contenders vying to replace Theresa May as British prime minister and his rival Boris Johnson told Reuters on Wednesday that he also backed the people of Hong Kong ""every inch of the way"".
The comments clearly irked Beijing. China's London envoy scolded Britain and said meddling in Hong Kong would cause a ""problem in the relationship"" between them.
""The UK government chose to stand on the wrong side: it has made inappropriate remarks not only to interfere in internal affairs of Hong Kong but also to back up the violent law-breakers,"" Liu said.
'SHAMELESS'
Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang chided Hunt, saying that only after Hong Kong's return to China did its people get an ""unprecedented"" guarantee about democracy and freedom.
""To say that the freedoms of Hong Kong residents is something Britain strived for is simply shameless,"" he told a news briefing. ""I would like to ask Mr. Hunt, during the British colonial era in Hong Kong, was there any democracy to speak of? Hong Kongers didn't even have the right to protest.""
China had lodged ""stern representations"" with Britain both in Beijing and London about Hunt's remarks, he added.
Britain said it had summoned Liu to the foreign office following his ""unacceptable"" comments, a government source said.
""Message to Chinese govt: good relations between countries are based on mutual respect and honoring the legally binding agreements between them,"" Hunt said on Twitter after Liu's media briefing.
""That is the best way to preserve the great relationship between the UK and China.""
RESETTING TIES
The turbulence in Hong Kong was triggered by an extradition bill opponents say will undermine Hong Kong's much-cherished rule of law and give Beijing powers to prosecute activists in mainland courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam had strongly promoted the bill, but suspended it on June 15 in the face of public protests against it. Critics have called on her to officially kill the bill, but she has resisted.
Britain and China had been seeking to reset ties after a row over the disputed South China Sea last year, with Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua visiting London last month to oversee the start of a link between its stock exchange and that of Shanghai.
Confrontation and lawlessness in Hong Kong could damage its reputation as an international business hub and seriously hurt its economy, China's top newspaper, the People's Daily, said in an editorial.
""It will not only serve no purpose, but will also severely hinder economic and social development,"" the ruling Communist Party's official paper said, denouncing what it called artificially created division and opposition.
China has blamed Western countries, particularly the United States and Britain, for offering succor to the protests.
In an editorial, the official China Daily, an English-language newspaper Beijing often uses to send its message to the world, condemned ""outside agitations"".
""What has also been notable is the hypocrisy of some Western governments - the United States and United Kingdom most prominently - which have called for a stop to the violence, as if they have had nothing to do with it,"" the paper said. 

""But, looking back at the whole protest saga, they have been deeply involved in fuelling it since its inception.""

(Reuters) - Canada's  Canopy Growth  Corp (TO:WEED) (N:CGC) fired founder and co-Chief Executive Officer Bruce Linton, a surprise move that comes just a week after the weed producer's largest shareholder expressed disappointment over its loss-making streak.
The world's largest pot company announced earlier in the day that Linton was stepping down, leaving Mark Zekulin in charge of the company.
""I think stepping down might not be the right phrase,"" Linton said in an interview with CNBC https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/canopy-growth-co-ceo-to-step-down.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain. ""I was terminated.""
Linton also said he did not know why he was fired, adding, ""At the end of the day I really think sometimes entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs because they're not super employable.""
Last month, Canopy reported a net loss of about C$323 million for the fourth quarter, attributing it to increased investments in expanding the business.
A week later, Constellation Brands (N:STZ), which owns a stake of nearly 56% in Canopy and has four of its six board seats, said it was not happy with the Canadian company's year-end results.
""We are working with Canopy almost on a daily basis to ensure that we are all focused on the right things,"" Constellation CEO Bill Newlands had said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
On Wednesday, the brewer said it fully supported the decision made by Canopy's board to appoint Zekulin as the company's sole CEO.
""It is pretty clear that it was at the urging of Constellation Brands. At this point they have enough power on (its) board to make these kinds of decisions,"" William O'Neil analyst Andrew Kessner said.
Linton's strategy of chasing growth at the expense of near-term profits seemed to have fallen out of favor with top Constellation executives, who are under pressure to provide a clearer timeline on a return on investment in Canopy, Kessner said.
Linton founded Canopy in 2013 in an abandoned Hershey's chocolate factory in Smiths Falls, Canada and has since been the face of the company. He took the company public in 2014 and has bolstered its operations with acquisitions worth more than C$5 billion.
Under Linton, Canopy also raised over C$6 billion since its founding in 2013, with the Corona beer maker agreeing to invest more than $4 billion in the company - the biggest such investment in the cannabis industry.

Linton did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters' calls and emails to Canopy seeking details on Linton's departure were not answered.
While it was not clear what Linton's severance package would be, company filings showed that his total compensation for 2018 was $2.46 million, a near six-fold rise from a year earlier due to $2 million of option-based awards.
Analysts at brokerage Stifel said they would not be surprised to see Linton take on another role within the cannabis industry, likely as an entrepreneur as his strength was in recognizing early stage value.
Rade Kovacevic, who currently leads the company's Canadian operations and recreational strategy, will take over the role of president from Zekulin.
The company also named John Bell, Canopy's lead director of five years, as chairman, a decision that it said would be reviewed at the board's annual meeting in September.
Earlier this year, Canopy also replaced long-term Chief Financial Officer Tim Saunders with a former Constellation executive.
Shares of the company, which fells as much as 5.3% earlier in the session, reversed course to trade marginally up."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled slightly more than $5 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week, ending what had been the largest rush into domestic stocks since 2016, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute.
The retreat from the U.S. stock market came after investors had pushed $17.9 billion into funds that hold domestic stocks over the two previous weeks, and was the first move away from U.S. stocks since the $8.2 billion decline in net assets during the week that ended June 5.
Investors have pulled a total of $35.6 billion out of U.S. stock funds since the start of the year despite a rally that has pushed the S&P 500 up more than 19% to new record highs. The move has been fueled largely by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, making equities more attractive by lowering company and consumer borrowing costs.
Bond funds continued to rake in new assets despite the prospect of lower interest rates. Taxable and municipal debt funds brought in slightly more than $10.5 billion in new assets, continuing a streak in which the category has pulled in $213.4 billion since the beginning of the year.
World stocks, meanwhile, lost $3.4 billion in net outflows, leaving the category down nearly $13.1 billion for the year to date."

London-based Synthomer is offering Beachwood, Ohio-headquartered Omnova $10.15 for each share, a premium of 58% to Omnova's closing price on Tuesday.
Shares of Synthomer fell 5% to 352.4 pence, making them the top loser on the FTSE 250 index. Omnova shares surged 55 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to trade at $9.96.
Acquiring Omnova will help Synthomer bolster its footprint in Europe and Asia and penetrate into China, Synthomer said in a statement.
The deal will be financed through a rights issue of up to $257 million and is likely to be completed by late 2019 or early 2020.
Five years ago, Omnova faced pressure from activist investor Barington Capital Group. In 2015, the company agreed to add two of the New York-based hedge fund's representatives to its board: Barington Capital founder James Mitarotonda and specialty chemicals industry executive Joseph Gingo. A year later Omnova named Anne Noonan as chief executive officer to replace Kevin McMullen but the company, a subscale business in a fast consolidating industry, still struggled.
Upon completion of the deal, Synthomer expects it will add to its earnings in the first financial year and projects an annual pre-tax cost savings of $29.6 million by the end of the third year.
Separately, Omnova said its second-quarter profit fell over 33% to $5.6 million, hurt by volatile markets and challenging economic conditions."

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 12:31PM ET</span>",German prosecutors intensify Deutsche Bank client investigation: source,"By John O'Donnell and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors are escalating a money laundering inquiry involving  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), including planned raids on wealthy former clients, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Frankfurt's state prosecutors will in the coming months search the homes of people who it suspects of using a company formerly owned by Germany's biggest bank for tax evasion and money laundering, the person said.
The intensified scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, which has said it has no indication of any misconduct, comes at a delicate time as the Frankfurt-based bank seeks to revamp its struggling business and repair a reputation ravaged by a series of scandals.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the investigation but referred to earlier comments by a senior official in which he defended its record, saying that it has invested in fighting money laundering and that it is cooperating with investigators.
Police searched the homes of eight people in Germany as part of the investigation in May, after a two-day search of Deutsche Bank's headquarters by 170 police and investigators in November.
That high-profile raid tainted it for months, hitting its share price as well shaking confidence in the bank among government officials and its customers.
During the raid, police obtained the names of 900 clients suspected of using its Regula subsidiary to avoid taxes, the person said.
Prosecutors said at the time that they suspected Deutsche Bank had helped clients shift criminal money, identifying more than 300 million euros ($339 million) that had flowed to a British Virgin Islands registered vehicle in 2016.
The prosecutors also said they were investigating two members of Deutsche Bank staff.
Deutsche Bank executive Karl von Rohr said in February that it had acted to ensure the ""tax honesty"" of clients, and had no indication of any misconduct by the bank or staff.
Regula was highlighted in data leaks including the Panama Papers, which were uncovered by a consortium of journalists.
The regional government in the German state of Hesse and German federal police bought this data, which includes almost 290,000 documents relating to 1,500 offshore firms, in 2017. It is now in the hands of Frankfurt public prosecutors.
'FLAGRANT OFFENDER'
Although Deutsche Bank sold Regula in early 2018 to a Bermuda-based bank, the evolving investigation puts it under further pressure following years of scrutiny and billions of dollars in fines for schemes, including so-called mirror trades.
Deutsche has agreed to pay more than $600 million in fines to the New York and British authorities for that scheme, one of its most recent scandals, that regulators said allowed Russian clients to covertly move money abroad.
That prompted lawmakers in the United States to send the bank a questionnaire asking about its money laundering controls.
""Deutsche Bank has been a flagrant offender of our money laundering laws,"" U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen told Reuters. ""They are in a league of their own. So we want to look at it for that reason.""
Von Rohr said in a speech that Deutsche Bank had improved controls, tripling staff who fight money laundering and financial crime since 2015 and was maintaining close contact with regulators.
U.S. lawmakers have also asked questions about the bank's relationship with Donald Trump, but Deutsche's response has been held up by a legal challenge by the U.S. president, in which he accused House leaders of harassment.
In addition, the U.S. lawmakers are also seeking information about Deutsche Bank's links to prominent Russians as well as its money laundering controls, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The German bank has also come under pressure in a separate money laundering scandal involving  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), prompting European lawmakers to call for it to reappear before the European Parliament over its money laundering controls.
Ana Gomes, a Portuguese EU parliamentarian, and Sven Giegold, a German EU lawmaker, said they were disappointed by an earlier appearance in parliament by Deutsche Bank.
""They did not answer in a way that would suggest they were reforming,"" Gomes said.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 11:59AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to axe investment bankers in up to $5.6 billion revamp,"By Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is preparing to unveil a sweeping, multi-billion euro overhaul within days that would see the axe fall heaviest on investment bankers, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The revamp is expected to cost the bank up to 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion), one of the sources said.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing flagged an extensive restructuring in May when he promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank. The pledge came after Deutsche failed to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The lender, Germany's largest, is planning on cutting between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs, or more than one in five of its 91,500 employees.
The bulk of the job cuts will take place outside Germany, said a person with knowledge of the plans, as they are mostly targeting the investment bank, a unit that has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis.
The overhaul signals that Deutsche is coming to terms with its failure to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
""Sewing really wants to move the needle,"" said another person familiar with the plans.
The price tag for restructuring raises the probability that the lender will report a loss for the full year, the person said, meaning Deutsche will have been in the red for four out of the five last years.
But executives and investors hope the overhaul, however costly, will be radical enough to turn around the bank's fortunes after its shares fell to a record low last month.
Deutsche declined to comment on the restructuring costs or the effect on its earnings. The bank said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability.
""We will update all stakeholders if and when required,"" it said. The bank's supervisory board is due to meet on Sunday to discuss the overhaul, people familiar with the matter said.
ACHILLES HEEL
Other measures under consideration include a reduction in the size of the bank's nine-member management board, as well as the creation of a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets.
Founded in 1870, Deutsche has long been a default source of lending and advice for German companies seeking to expand abroad or raise money through the bond or equity markets, a role which had the tacit backing of successive governments in Berlin.
Big cuts to its investment bank could make it harder for the lender to fulfill this role and would mark a reversal of a decades-long expansion that began with the purchase of Morgan Grenfell in London in 1989 and continued a decade later by taking over Bankers Trust in New York.
The investment bank generates about half of Deutsche Bank's revenue but is also considered its Achilles heel.
Revenue at the division is forecast to fall to 12.4 billion euros this year, according to a consensus of analysts. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down more than 30% from 2015.
In a shift that underscores its waning relevance within Deutsche, the investment bank would be represented on the board by Sewing rather than having a seat at the table, as is currently the case, according to people familiar with the plans.
To help finance its overhaul, Deutsche is seeking to lower the amount of capital that regulators require it to have on hand, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
The bank is aiming for a so-called common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 12.5%, two of the people said, confirming a figure first reported by the Financial Times. The paper said that would free up 3.5 billion euros in capital."

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares opened nearly 7% higher on Wednesday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk made good on his promise of delivering record number of electric cars in the second quarter, quelling fears about demand for its sedans and SUVs.
Wall Street analysts and investors have raised doubts about demand and the Silicon Valley automaker's ability to sort out recent delivery issues, particularly after a disastrous first quarter when deliveries slumped 31%.
""We are increasingly comfortable that they should reflect an even better in the third quarter, and probably their first hundred thousand in a quarter,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.
Tesla delivered 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter, beating analysts' average estimates, but did not comment on when it would return to profitability.
Shares of the company were up 6.4% at $238.92, their highest in nearly two months. Up to Tuesday close, the stock had lost nearly one-third of its value so far this year.
Tesla's first quarter was hurt by logistics issues at international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after a tax credit was halved, which spurred concerns that demand for Tesla's electric cars may have peaked.
While Musk has been trying to convince investors that demand remains high for Tesla cars and delivery could be made efficiently, some analysts remained skeptical about Tesla's ability to deliver on its promise and maintain margins.
Needham analysts said they remain cautious about Tesla's ability to remain profitable and maintain healthy margins, with Credit Suisse analysts also echoing a similar view.
In the quarter, Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s - seen as linchpin for its growth into a mass-market company. That compared with analysts' average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Tesla ""has a shot at being profitable this quarter on a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, even with materially pressured automotive gross margins"".
Tesla still faces multiple challenges, including starting production in China in the backdrop of U.S.-China trade tensions and overhauling its production process at a time when several of its top executives are leaving the company.
""These are undeniably strong numbers, but given Tesla's recent history of significant swings in performance from quarter-to-quarter we remain cautious for now,"" Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett said."

(Reuters) - Proterra Inc, the U.S. electric bus manufacturer whose investors include car makers  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG (DE:BMWG), has hired investment banks to prepare for an initial public offering (IPO), according to people familiar with the matter.
Proterra has brought down the cost of electric batteries in its buses, making them more competitive with diesel-run vehicles. It has won orders from U.S. cities seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of public transport.
The Burlingame, California company employs several former executives from electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). It is working with underwriters including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) on preparing for an IPO that could come as early as this year, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
They said the timing of the IPO depended on market conditions.
JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, while Proterra and Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment.
The market for electric vehicles has been heating up. Tesla shares jumped 8 percent on Wednesday, a day after it set a record for quarterly vehicle deliveries.
Founded in 2004, Proterra has provided hundreds of public transport buses to U.S. cities and is expanding into school buses. In June, Proterra announced contracts with the Virginia Department of General Services and Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina.
In addition to driving down the cost of its vehicles, the company provides leasing options which aim to reduce the initial outlay of ordering its buses. It says its vehicles are cheaper to operate than diesel-run rivals.
Proterra also offers an option where it retains ownership of charging facilities, reducing upfront costs of switching to electric vehicles, according to its website.
Proterra sees a vast opportunity since the U.S. is significantly behind other cities in the world in adopting electric buses, especially in China.
Proterra's competitors include Chinese automaker BYD, which is backed by Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), and Canadian bus manufacturer New Flyer.
Proterra has so far raised $525 million in private fundraising rounds, and last year was valued at $855 million, according to data provider Pitch Book. Among its early backers are General Motors (NYSE:GM) Ventures LLC and Kleiner Perkins.
Proterra CEO Ryan Popple, a former Kleiner Perkins partner, was one of Tesla's first employees under founder Elon Musk. In media interviews, Popple has declined to disclose when Proterra's IPO may come."

(Reuters) - Hopes that European Central Bank Chief nominee Christine Lagarde would follow the dovish steps of Mario Draghi pushed European shares to a two-month high on Wednesday, and boosted high-dividend yielding defensive stocks.
If approved by the European parliament, Lagarde will succeed Draghi when his term expires at the end of October.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) jumped 0.60% by 0815 GMT to hit its highest level since May 1, with the defensive food & beverages (SX3P), real estate (SX86P) and utilities companies (SX6P) rising more than 1% each.
Government bond yields in much of the euro zone fell to fresh record lows on the news. Bank stocks (SX7P), which tend to suffer in a low interest rate environment, underperformed.
High-dividend stocks including AB InBev (BR:ABI),  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS),  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR) powered the STOXX as investors searched for yield.
""Lagarde, who has built a solid experience fighting against the never-ending financial crisis, is expected to walk on Mario Draghi's dovish footprints to help the Euro area cope with the weakening global economy,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group.
The benchmark index has gained 1.5% this week, continuing its strong run from June after the ECB and the U.S. central bank signaled more accommodative measures to counter the impact of a protracted U.S.-China trade war.
The rally this week was mainly on optimism from news over the weekend that the United States and China restarted talks to resolve a trade dispute that has roiled financial markets for at least a year.
""The United States and China need to shed some light on their trade truce that they reached over the weekend. They sent positive signals but everybody is still waiting for specifics,"" said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg in London.
Putting a damper on markets was news that the Commerce Department's enforcement staff was told this week that China's Huawei should still be treated as blacklisted, a stark difference from President Donald Trump's statement over the weekend vowing to ease a ban on sales to the firm.
European chipmakers STMicroelectronics (MI:STM), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) fell between 0.5% and 2.5% on the news.
The biggest gainer on the STOXX 600 was Britain's biggest sportswear retailer JD Sports (L:JD), which rose 3.2%, after the company said it was on track to at least meet market expectations for annual profit.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday said he would reduce an $80 million damage award against  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) to $50 million or less in the case of a man who blamed his cancer on glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said the jury's $75 million punitive damages award to plaintiff Edwin Hardeman in March could not stand.
""It's quite clear that under the Constitution I'm required to reduce the punitive damages award and it's just a question of how much,"" Chhabria said during a court hearing in which lawyers for both sides discussed the company's request to overturn the verdict. Chhabria said he would issue a ruling by the end of next week.
Following a four-week trial, a federal jury on March 27 awarded $5 million in compensatory and $75 million in punitive damages to Hardeman, who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014.
U.S. Supreme Court rulings limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9 to 1.
Chhabria said he was also considering reducing the compensatory damages award because Hardeman was now in full remission and unlikely to suffer as much as he had in the past.
Bayer, which bought Roundup maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $63 billion last year, says Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate are safe for human use and not carcinogenic.
The company faces lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs nationwide and a series of Roundup jury verdicts against Bayer have prompted its share price to plummet. Under pressure from activist shareholders, Bayer on Wednesday said it set up a committee to help resolve the litigation and hired an external lawyer to advise its supervisory board.
Bayer had asked Chhabria to completely reverse the jury verdict in Hardeman's case in light of scientific evidence and assessments by regulators finding glyphosate to be safe.
Brian Stekloff, a lawyer for Bayer, on Tuesday said Monsanto went ""above and beyond"" to meet regulatory requirements, warranting a complete reversal of the punitive damages award.
But Chhabria disagreed, saying jurors had seen sufficient evidence that Monsanto did not care whether its products cause cancer, instead focusing on undermining people who were raising concerns.

""There was nothing suggesting that anybody at Monsanto viewed this issue objectively or with any consideration for the life of human people,"" the judge said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian bank earnings are getting squeezed by the central bank's move to cut the cash rate to a record low 1%, analysts and investors say, as it gets harder to reduce deposit rates to offset the cheaper mortgages they must now offer borrowers.
Shares of the so-called Big Four banks fell between 0.73% and 1.2% in the 24 hours following Tuesday's cut, underperforming an otherwise rising market.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), the biggest of the four, is seen as one of the most susceptible because it has the largest deposit book and cannot drop rates much lower to its existing customers.
""It is bad for their earnings, and that's mostly because they have a very large deposit book paying near zero rates, which doesn't go down any more,"" said Simon Mawhinney, chief investment officer at fund manager Allan Gray.
""So the cost of funds tends to stay more or less fixed, but their interest income falls with the rate cuts.""
On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered the cash rate by 25 basis points, the second easing in two months to support an economy forecast to grow at its slowest pace in a decade.
The cut will reduce the bank's margins by about 3 basis points and cut earnings by up to 2.5% for the current financial year, according to Morgan Stanley. Each bank, however, does its best to try and hedge this impact by investing in longer-dated bonds. The lenders' profits took a hit last year from weak credit growth, and charges to cover hefty legal bills and remediation costs linked to widespread wrongdoing in the sector.
In an attempt to protect margins, three of Australia's four biggest lenders resisted public pressure to pass on the central bank rate cut in full to mortgage customers, although the strategy risks triggering a public rebuke from the government.
At the same time, banks tended not to drop interest rates on savings and deposit accounts by the full quarter of a percent.
Following a bank share rally last month driven by relief a change of government would not cut tax incentives for property buyers, investors and analysts are now reining in their earnings expectations.
This is particularly so now that the RBA has hinted it is open to a third rate cut this year as it attempts to revive the country's sluggish economy.
""Rate cuts typically happen at the point of the cycle when the economy is quite weak and credit growth is low,"" said Mawhinney.
""So rate cuts are bad, all round, for banks.""
JP Morgan banking analysts told clients on Wednesday in a note that given ANZ had passed on the full benefit of the cut to borrowers, its earnings would now be lowered by about 2%.
It warned that any further rate cuts would require the banks to hold back much more because ""saver base rates have hit their lower bound""."

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics' second-quarter profit likely halved as Huawei woes worsen chip glut,"By Ju-min Park and Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics is likely to say second-quarter profit more than halved when it reports preliminary earnings on Friday, data showed, as a drop in memory chip shipments to China's embattled Huawei exacerbated a price-squeezing supply glut.
The quarterly result would be the South Korean firm's lowest in nearly three years, with the prospect of an earnings recovery still some quarters away as a period of oversupply continues unabated amid a broader slowdown in tech markets, analysts said.
The world's biggest supplier of DRAM and NAND memory chips is also the world's largest maker of smartphones, a market where chip client Huawei is second place. Companies worldwide have been forced to restrict business with Huawei to comply with U.S. trade sanctions on a company Washington deems a security risk.
""How much Huawei will use chips ahead is definitely a swing factor in prices,"" said analyst Jay Kim at Sangsangin Investment & Securities. ""When there's not many players that can buy chips instead of Huawei, then Samsung has to cut prices to sell them.""
Though chip earnings took a hit from reduced Huawei custom, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (KS:005930) smartphone business is likely to benefit from a drop of as much as 40% in international sales of Huawei handsets. So far, however, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] has strong enough support at home in the world's largest smartphone market to retain its global ranking.
Even so, selling chips brings in most of Samsung's profit - over two-thirds - and a saturated smartphone market and falling demand from data centers have pulled prices down.
Prices for DRAM chips, which provide devices with temporary workspaces and allow them to multi-task, are unlikely to rebound in the second half of the year, said analyst Avril Wu at tech researcher TrendForce. Moreover, she said, it will be difficult for Samsung to clear its inventory until the first half of 2020.
TrendForce estimates DRAM prices in the three months through June fell 25%. Last month, it lowered its forecast for the July-September quarter to a decline of 15% to 20%, from 10%.
On Friday, Samsung is likely to flag a 60% decline in April-June operating profit at 6 trillion won ($5.14 billion), according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, which is based on the estimates of 29 analysts, with the estimates of analysts historically more accurate given greater weighting.
The tech firm booked 14.9 trillion won in the same period a year earlier. It is due to publish final second-quarter figures later this month. Its shares rose 5.3% over the three months.
TRADE TROUBLES
Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, and just as the impact of its U.S. predicament ripples through both the chip and smartphone sectors, tech firms such as Samsung have also become collateral damage in a broader Sino-U.S. trade war punctuated by tit-for-tat import tariffs.
Samsung could also be on the receiving end of Japanese curbs on exports to South Korea of high-tech materials used in chips and smartphones - a retaliatory measure to South Korean wartime compensation claims that Japan says were resolved decades ago.
Still, in the long run, the good news for Samsung could lie in Huawei's troubles. If U.S. sanctions remain, Samsung could sell 37 million more smartphones annually, said senior analyst Song Myung-sup at HI Investment & Securities. Moreover, it would likely install its own chips in those handsets, Song said.
Last year, Samsung shipped 292 million handsets to Huawei's 205 million, showed data from market tracker Counterpoint.
In April, Samsung said it expected both smartphone and chip sales to pick up in the second half of the year, while U.S. chip rival Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) likewise said demand would recover later this year.
""Earnings recovery for memory chipmakers will come, but it won't be fast and it won't be a big leap,"" Song said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's  Eva Airways  (TW:2618) has canceled 550 more flights scheduled through mid-July as a cabin crew strike entered its 14th day, after latest negotiations on work conditions and wages broke down this week.
Flight attendants at the Taiwanese airline went on strike on June 20 after a months-long discussion between the two yielded no results, disrupting over 2,000 flights and impacting about 405,000 passengers including the latest cancellations.
The strike, the longest in Taiwan's aviation history where labor unrest is uncommon, has led Eva to estimate a revenue loss of about T$1.75 billion ($56 million).
""The company is still delaying. We urge them to put down their prejudices and sign an agreement with us as soon as possible,"" Judy Hsiao, a media liaison officer for the union, said after an 11-hour long talk with Eva broke down on Tuesday.
There was no indication of any resolution early on Wednesday with a union representing Eva flight attendants urging the firm to come back to the negotiation table, saying no renewed contacts between the parties had been initiated.
Eva said it had no comment when contacted by Reuters.
In a statement late on Tuesday, Eva said it had reached ""some initial agreements"" with the union and that ""the company's door is always open for flight attendants to come home"".
On Tuesday evening, the union said over 1,000 flight attendants and supporters joined a rally in front of Taiwan's presidential office, calling President Tsai Ing-wen to address what it sees as an ""autocratic and authoritarian"" management.
More than 2,000 flight attendants from Eva Air's all-female cabin crew have been taking turns to join demonstrations outside the firm's headquarters near Taoyuan International Airport since June 20.
The protests have been marked by signs, speeches and, at times, scuffles between cabin crew and Eva representatives.
Eva has filed several lawsuits against the union since the strike began, including asking for a daily compensation of T$34 million ($1 million) for what it sees as an ""illegal strike"".
Eva Air, best known internationally for the Hello Kitty livery on some of its jets, operates flights to many destinations around Asia as well as to North America and Europe.
Pilots at rival China Airlines (TW:2610) went on strike in February, leading to 122 flight cancellations and T$220 million in lost revenue.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 10:40PM ET</span>","Lee Iacocca, auto executive who saved Chrysler from bankruptcy, dies at 94","By Bill Trott
(Reuters) - Lee Iacocca, the charismatic U.S. auto industry executive who gave America the Ford Mustang and was celebrated for saving Chrysler from going out of business, has died at the age of 94,  Fiat  Chrysler said.
Iacocca died Tuesday at his home in Bel-Air, California of complications from Parkinson's disease, his daughter Lia Iacocca Assad told the Washington Post.
""The company is saddened by the news of Lee Iacocca's passing. He played a historic role in steering Chrysler through crisis and making it a true competitive force,"" Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) said in a statement. 
""He was one of the great leaders of our company and the auto industry as a whole. He also played a profound and tireless role on the national stage as a business statesman and philanthropist,"" the company said.
During a nearly five-decade career in Detroit that began in 1946 at  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), the proud son of Italian immigrants made the covers of Time, Newsweek and the New York Times Sunday Magazine in stories portraying him as the avatar of the American Auto Age. One of the first celebrity U.S. chief executives, his autobiography made best-seller lists in the mid-1980s.
Iacocca was a cracker-jack salesman. He encouraged his design teams to be bold, and they responded with sports cars that appealed to baby boomers in the 1960s, fuel-efficient models when gasoline prices soared in the 1970s, and the first-ever, family-oriented minivan in the 1980s that led its segment in sales for 25 years.
""I don't know an auto executive that I've ever met who has a feel for the American consumer the way he does,"" late United Auto Workers Union President Douglas Fraser had said. ""He's the greatest communicator who's ever come down the pike in the history of the industry.""
Iacocca also had some duds, such as the Ford Pinto, an economy car that became notorious for exploding fuel tanks. ""You don't win 'em all,"" he said of the Pinto.
Iacocca won a place in business history when he pulled Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler, from the brink of collapse in 1980, rallying support in U.S. Congress for $1.2 billion in federally guaranteed loans and persuading suppliers, dealers and union workers to make sacrifices. He cut his salary to $1 a year.
Iacocca was often described as a demanding and volatile boss who sometimes clashed with fellow executives. 
""He could get mad as hell at you, and once it was done he let it go. He wouldn't stay mad,"" said Bud Liebler, vice president of communications at Chrysler during the 1980s and 1990s. ""He liked to bring an issue to its head, get it resolved. You always knew where you stood with him.""
Iacocca often spoke of his immigrant roots and how America rewards hard work. When he was tapped by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 to be chairman of a campaign to restore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, he said he accepted the job as a way of honoring his parents.
The campaign raised more than $350 million, more than double the initial $150 million goal.
MARKETING SUCCESSES
Iacocca began his career just as post-war prosperity kicked the Auto Age into high gear. By the 1970s, many new suburban homes came with a two-car garage. 
Lido Anthony ""Lee"" Iacocca was born in the Pennsylvania steel town of Allentown on Oct. 24, 1924. His father, Nicola, owned a hot dog stand he called The Orpheum Wiener House - a foretaste of his son's later marketing creativity. 
In high school he was freshman class president, ""a big shot,"" he had thought. But when he stopped shaking his classmates' hands, he lost re-election. ""It was an important lesson about leadership,"" Iacocca wrote.
He was a diligent student, made the debating team and was a star in Latin class. Sophomore year he survived rheumatic fever, an illness that later kept him out of the military during World War Two, and graduated 12th in a class of more than 900. 
Iacocca enrolled in Lehigh University, earning his engineering degree in fewer than four years and received a fellowship at Princeton for his master's degree.
After joining Ford, he realized right away he was better at marketing than engineering. Ten years later, when his district had the worst sales in the country, he came up with a marketing campaign, ""56 for '56"" - buyers could get a 1956 Ford with 20% down and three years of monthly installments of $56. 
The plan took off like a rocket and Ford executive Robert McNamara, who would become secretary of defense in the Kennedy administration, made it part of Ford's national sales strategy. 
Iacocca's relationship with the Mustang was cemented when both Time and Newsweek featured him and the car on their covers in April 1964. By 2013, about 9 million Mustangs had been sold.
Gene Bordinat, Ford's design executive at the time, said of Iacocca's contribution to the Mustang's popularity: ""We conceived the car and he pimped it after it was born.""
It was cheap to produce and generated big profits. For years, it was Iacocca's signature achievement. 
The low moment in Iacocca's career though came in 1978, when Henry Ford II fired him. He asked why, reminding his boss that the company had earned record profits of $1.8 billion two straight years. Ford replied: ""Well, sometimes you just don't like somebody.""
The firing made national news. Iacocca never forgave Ford, and he described his former boss as a spendthrift and dictator. 
CHRYSLER FACED TWO HEADWINDS 
Iacocca's exile from Detroit board rooms was brief. Within weeks he accepted the presidency of Chrysler, even though its market share was shrinking and losses were deepening.
In 1979 Chrysler was facing twin blows of spiking interest rates and a second oil shock that doubled the price of gasoline. When the U.S. economy plunged into recession, sales at every automaker plummeted.
Iacocca searched for a merger partner but when no takers emerged, he turned to the government for up to $1.5 billion in loan guarantees. He pounded on the doors in Washington, assisted by dealers and union officials who knew their brethren would be out of work if Chrysler folded.
Asking for federal help was controversial, and one editorial cartoon depicted a child asking what the U.S. Capitol was called. ""The Chrysler Building"" came the answer.
Iacocca won the loan guarantees but they required broad sacrifices, of plant closures, pay cuts for factory workers and layoffs of white-collar staff.
He put his personal reputation on the line, and in the end, it was a tour de force of leadership. Factoring in positions at Chrysler, its dealerships and suppliers, he saved more than 500,000 jobs.
""People saw him in the trenches,"" Liebler said. ""When we needed the loan guarantees and he was pounding the halls of Congress, the dealers were with him ... he worked his head off day and night, and everyone who was involved in any way with Chrysler knew it."" 
About that time, Chrysler's introduction of the smaller, fuel-efficient ""K Cars"" gave it a boost. In a series of no-nonsense television commercials, Iacocca barked, ""If you can find a better car, buy it!""
He paid the loans back seven years early, and in 1983, a cartoon showed frantic executives of the troubled U.S. airline industry shouting into a phone, ""Get me Lee Iacocca!"" 
But Iacocca's star faded in the late 1980s as Chrysler floundered again. 
Chrysler struggled through the 1990-1991 economic downturn, losing $800 million in 1991. Iacocca refused to cut new product spending, and by 1992, the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and LH sedans led to a $732 million profit, while Ford and General Motors Co (N:GM) were in the red.
With Chrysler profitable again, Iacocca stepped down at the end of 1992. He lived out his latter years in stylish Bel-Air, California.
In retirement, Iacocca invested in the casino business and a line of imported olive oil, and he joined corporate boards. 
He penned ""Where Have All the Leaders Gone?,"" a 2007 book critical of American leadership, especially President George W. Bush.
Iacocca had two daughters with his first wife, Mary, who died of diabetes in 1983, prompting him to start a family foundation to fight the disease. 

After Mary's death he married twice more. His second was brief and ended in annulment, while his third ended in divorce.

U.S. notes also gained for a second day as investors sought haven assets before a U.S. holiday Thursday and a raft of data this week including monthly payrolls numbers. Bonds rallied around the world after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of downside risks to growth, and European Central Bank officials were reported to be discussing additional stimulus.
“A major driver of Treasury yields lower is a dovish shift of central banks, including the ECB and BOE,” said Hidehiro Joke, a bond strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Ten-year yields may risk falling toward 1.70% as markets are very pessimistic” about economic growth, he said.
U.S.10-year yields slid as much as three basis points to 1.95%, the lowest since November 2016. They have declined from as high as 3.26% in October last year.
Traders are bracing for a slew of U.S. economic numbers being released Wednesday before the July 4 holiday. Data include durable goods orders, factory orders, and the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) employment figures. Friday’s payrolls report may either reassure investors concerned about last month’s weak numbers, or validate suspicions the economy is faltering.
All of that could help determine whether the Federal Reserve will fulfill market expectations for monetary-policy easing at its July 30-31 meeting. Fed funds rate futures are pricing in more than a quarter point of cuts for that gathering, and some traders have speculated a half-point reduction may be on the table.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) set a record for quarterly vehicle deliveries in a triumphant response to months of questions about demand for its luxury electric cars, sending shares up 7% after hours on Tuesday.
Tesla did not comment on profit - which is still elusive - but the robust deliveries could help jumpstart investor sentiment on Tesla, which has been challenged in recent months. Before Tuesday's after-hours spike, Tesla shares were down about a third from the beginning of the year.
Brushing aside concerns about demand that have dogged the company all year, Tesla said orders during the second quarter exceeded deliveries, despite buyers getting a smaller tax credit. 
A $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit was cut in half at the end of last year, fell to $1,875 on Monday and expires at the end of the year.
""We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,"" the company said in a statement.
Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s in the quarter, the company's latest sedan and linchpin of the company's growth strategy. That compared with analysts' average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Deliveries of all models rose 51% from the first quarter to 95,200 vehicles, including 17,650 Model S and X. Analysts on average were expecting total deliveries of 89,084.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has repeatedly said Tesla could deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year.
Tuesday's numbers helped take the sting off a difficult first quarter, in which deliveries plunged and the company lost $702 million.
That fraught quarter – hurt by logistics issues at Tesla's international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after the tax credit was halved – spurred worries that Tesla may have tapped a limited market for electric cars at premium prices.
Despite the positive second-quarter delivery numbers, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cautioned that ""the Street remains skeptical."" 
Demand and profitability will remain the two main drivers to buoy Tesla shares in coming quarters, Ives told Reuters, signaling that Tesla's challenges are far from over.
Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research noted that second-quarter deliveries were likely artificially boosted by customers pulling forward their vehicle purchases before the July 1 tax credit cut, warning that could result in a ""significant retracement"" in deliveries in the third quarter.
Tesla did not repeat its prior forecast that it would post a second-quarter loss but return to profit in the third quarter. 
A big challenge for Tesla has been how to deliver its vehicles efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. An improved system for logistics helped in the second quarter, Tesla said, without providing more detail. 
In prior quarters, Tesla has diverted employees from all parts of the company to help with deliveries in an all-hands-on-deck effort to meet delivery goals. That has proved to be an expensive and inefficient way to meet targets, which reduces potential profit margins on each vehicle.
The delivery numbers included 10,600 vehicles that had been in transit at the end of the first quarter.
The company has pledged to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, a goal many analysts predict will be difficult to meet. 
Overall, total production rose 13% to 87,048 vehicles compared with the first quarter. The company churned out 72,531 Model 3s in the second quarter, up from a total of 62,950 Model 3s in the preceding quarter.
Tesla said that going forward, it would no longer disclose how many vehicles were in transit at the end of each quarter due to production changes that made the number less relevant. At the end of the second quarter, over 7,400 vehicles were in transit.

1170,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 06:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.

1. Labor, Services Data on Watch

There's a larger-than-usual amount of economic indicators set for tomorrow, with the stock market closing early at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT) and closed Thursday for the July 4 holiday.

Ahead of Friday’s monthly payroll report, the market gets a duo of reports on the labor market in the form of private sector payrolls and initial jobless claims. 

An update on U.S. services activity will also be closely watched amid concerns about slowing growth. 

{{|0ADP}} will report its nonfarm private-sector employ,ment number for June at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT). In May, the report showed only 27,000 new private-sector jobs created, less than expected and the smallest since the economic recovery began in 2010.

On average, economists expect that the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) report will show 140,000 private-sector jobs were added last month, well above the 27,000 added in the prior month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 29. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims declined to 220,000 from 227,000 previously.
Traders will also look to the U.S. services data for signs the economy remains on track despite external pressures. The services PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 57.7.
The services sector is critical component of the US economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product (GDP).

Crude Inventories on Deck
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a draw.
The American Petroleum Institute released data Tuesday that, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. 
The API showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 5 million barrels last week. 
The EIA, meanwhile, is expected to report domestic supplies fell 2.964 million barrels for the week ended June 28.
Crude production will also garner attention after the EIA reported last week that output remained near a record at 12.1 million barrels a day.
Crude futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday, as fears that a weaker global economic backdrop would keep a lid on oil demand offset an agreement by OPEC and its allies to extend their oil-production pact by a further nine months.
U.K. Supermarkets in Focus
With little top-tier earnings on the calendar stateside, UK supermarkets will be in focus, with J  Sainsbury  PLC (LON:SBRY) set to report earnings before EU markets open. 
The performance of Sainsbury’s core grocery business will likely garner attention as the supermarket continues to face stiff competition from the discounters Lidl and Aldi.
The report comes after the U.K. competition watchdog rejected Sainsbury’s proposed £7 billon merger with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)-owned Asda earlier this year. "

The oil and gas producer, in a regulatory filing, said fixing a record date for the planned consent solicitation and the proposals of the Icahn Group ""are not in the best interests of Occidental or its stockholders"".
Last week, Icahn said he planned to oust and replace four Occidental directors and change the company's charter to prevent it from ever engineering a takeover, like its $38 billion bid for Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC).
Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting.
Icahn, one of industry's most powerful activist investors, cast himself as one of the deal's most fervent critics by charging that Occidental's bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental's future if oil prices sink.
Icahn, who owns a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30, had sued Occidental in a Delaware court. 
According to last week's filing, he said Occidental lacks effective corporate governance and that its directors made mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition of Anadarko.

Icahn was not immediately available for comment.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Global regulators will meet in Montreal next week to review pilot licensing requirements, the U.N.'s aviation agency said, as part of a discussion that has gained urgency following two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the past year.
It is the first time that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which sets global standards for 193 member countries, will undertake such a broad review on training requirements.
While the meeting was not called in response to the MAX crashes in Indonesia last October and in Ethiopia in March, it coincides with a larger debate on whether increasingly automated commercial jets are compromising pilot skills. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide and could not be back in service for months yet.
Most attention surrounding the two 737 MAX crashes that killed a total of 346 people focuses on suspected flaws in an automated stall-prevention system called MCAS, which  Boeing Co  (N:BA) implemented to make the MAX perform like previous 737 models.
But the training given to pilots to allow them to handle such problems smoothly is also under scrutiny, expanding an industry debate over pilot skills that has been raging for years as crew spend less and less time flying aircraft manually.
""Recently, with current events, people are discussing whether the minimum requirements or experience are still valid,(or) should we review that?"" ICAO's chief of operational safety Miguel Marin told Reuters.
In addition to regulators, representatives of a global pilots group are expected to attend the July 8-12 meeting, Marin said. Marin called the meeting a ""first step,"" with any eventual change up to regulators.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration increased the number of required training hours for commercial pilots from 250 to 1,500 in 2013, a move that some players have criticized as excessive, particularly as the industry grapples with future pilot shortages.
At the Montreal meeting, regulators will discuss flying hours and competency-based training, where pilots demonstrate skills like landing an airplane, as opposed to focusing on learning to fly and accumulating hours regardless of aircraft type.
ICAO's multi-crew pilot license created in 2006 focused on competency based training, where pilots need 240 hours to become first officers on a single aircraft type.
""What we're seeing in highly-automated aircraft, it's not how to manage the airplane if things are OK. It's those unexpected malfunctions that throw the airplane off,"" Marin said.
""We think that can only be addressed with a different type of approach to training rather than just saying, give them more hours."""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics is likely to say second-quarter profit more than halved when it reports preliminary earnings on Friday, data showed, as a drop in memory chip shipments to China's embattled Huawei exacerbated a price-squeezing supply glut.
The quarterly result would be the South Korean firm's lowest in nearly three years, with the prospect of an earnings recovery still some quarters away as a period of oversupply continues unabated amid a broader slowdown in tech markets, analysts said.
The world's biggest supplier of DRAM and NAND memory chips is also the world's largest maker of smartphones, a market where chip client Huawei is second place. Companies worldwide have been forced to restrict business with Huawei to comply with U.S. trade sanctions on a company Washington deems a security risk.
""How much Huawei will use chips ahead is definitely a swing factor in prices,"" said analyst Jay Kim at Sangsangin Investment & Securities. ""When there's not many players that can buy chips instead of Huawei, then Samsung has to cut prices to sell them.""
Though chip earnings took a hit from reduced Huawei custom, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (KS:005930) smartphone business is likely to benefit from a drop of as much as 40% in international sales of Huawei handsets. So far, however, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] has strong enough support at home in the world's largest smartphone market to retain its global ranking.
Even so, selling chips brings in most of Samsung's profit - over two-thirds - and a saturated smartphone market and falling demand from data centers have pulled prices down.
Prices for DRAM chips, which provide devices with temporary workspaces and allow them to multi-task, are unlikely to rebound in the second half of the year, said analyst Avril Wu at tech researcher TrendForce. Moreover, she said, it will be difficult for Samsung to clear its inventory until the first half of 2020.
TrendForce estimates DRAM prices in the three months through June fell 25%. Last month, it lowered its forecast for the July-September quarter to a decline of 15% to 20%, from 10%.
On Friday, Samsung is likely to flag a 60% decline in April-June operating profit at 6 trillion won ($5.14 billion), according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, which is based on the estimates of 29 analysts, with the estimates of analysts historically more accurate given greater weighting.
The tech firm booked 14.9 trillion won in the same period a year earlier. It is due to publish final second-quarter figures later this month. Its shares rose 5.3% over the three months.
TRADE TROUBLES
Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, and just as the impact of its U.S. predicament ripples through both the chip and smartphone sectors, tech firms such as Samsung have also become collateral damage in a broader Sino-U.S. trade war punctuated by tit-for-tat import tariffs.
Samsung could also be on the receiving end of Japanese curbs on exports to South Korea of high-tech materials used in chips and smartphones - a retaliatory measure to South Korean wartime compensation claims that Japan says were resolved decades ago.
Still, in the long run, the good news for Samsung could lie in Huawei's troubles. If U.S. sanctions remain, Samsung could sell 37 million more smartphones annually, said senior analyst Song Myung-sup at HI Investment & Securities. Moreover, it would likely install its own chips in those handsets, Song said.
Last year, Samsung shipped 292 million handsets to Huawei's 205 million, showed data from market tracker Counterpoint.
In April, Samsung said it expected both smartphone and chip sales to pick up in the second half of the year, while U.S. chip rival Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) likewise said demand would recover later this year.
""Earnings recovery for memory chipmakers will come, but it won't be fast and it won't be a big leap,"" Song said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's  Eva Airways  (TW:2618) has canceled 550 more flights scheduled through mid-July as a cabin crew strike entered its 14th day, after latest negotiations on work conditions and wages broke down this week.
Flight attendants at the Taiwanese airline went on strike on June 20 after a months-long discussion between the two yielded no results, disrupting over 2,000 flights and impacting about 405,000 passengers including the latest cancellations.
The strike, the longest in Taiwan's aviation history where labor unrest is uncommon, has led Eva to estimate a revenue loss of about T$1.75 billion ($56 million).
""The company is still delaying. We urge them to put down their prejudices and sign an agreement with us as soon as possible,"" Judy Hsiao, a media liaison officer for the union, said after an 11-hour long talk with Eva broke down on Tuesday.
There was no indication of any resolution early on Wednesday with a union representing Eva flight attendants urging the firm to come back to the negotiation table, saying no renewed contacts between the parties had been initiated.
Eva said it had no comment when contacted by Reuters.
In a statement late on Tuesday, Eva said it had reached ""some initial agreements"" with the union and that ""the company's door is always open for flight attendants to come home"".
On Tuesday evening, the union said over 1,000 flight attendants and supporters joined a rally in front of Taiwan's presidential office, calling President Tsai Ing-wen to address what it sees as an ""autocratic and authoritarian"" management.
More than 2,000 flight attendants from Eva Air's all-female cabin crew have been taking turns to join demonstrations outside the firm's headquarters near Taoyuan International Airport since June 20.
The protests have been marked by signs, speeches and, at times, scuffles between cabin crew and Eva representatives.
Eva has filed several lawsuits against the union since the strike began, including asking for a daily compensation of T$34 million ($1 million) for what it sees as an ""illegal strike"".
Eva Air, best known internationally for the Hello Kitty livery on some of its jets, operates flights to many destinations around Asia as well as to North America and Europe.
Pilots at rival China Airlines (TW:2610) went on strike in February, leading to 122 flight cancellations and T$220 million in lost revenue.

""The company is saddened by the news of Lee Iacocca's passing. He played a historic role in steering Chrysler through crisis and making it a true competitive force,"" Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) said in a statement. 
""He was one of the great leaders of our company and the auto industry as a whole. He also played a profound and tireless role on the national stage as a business statesman and philanthropist,"" the company said.
During a nearly five-decade career in Detroit that began in 1946 at  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), the proud son of Italian immigrants made the covers of Time, Newsweek and the New York Times Sunday Magazine in stories portraying him as the avatar of the American Auto Age. One of the first celebrity U.S. chief executives, his autobiography made best-seller lists in the mid-1980s.
Iacocca was a cracker-jack salesman. He encouraged his design teams to be bold, and they responded with sports cars that appealed to baby boomers in the 1960s, fuel-efficient models when gasoline prices soared in the 1970s, and the first-ever, family-oriented minivan in the 1980s that led its segment in sales for 25 years.
""I don't know an auto executive that I've ever met who has a feel for the American consumer the way he does,"" late United Auto Workers Union President Douglas Fraser had said. ""He's the greatest communicator who's ever come down the pike in the history of the industry.""
Iacocca also had some duds, such as the Ford Pinto, an economy car that became notorious for exploding fuel tanks. ""You don't win 'em all,"" he said of the Pinto.
Iacocca won a place in business history when he pulled Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler, from the brink of collapse in 1980, rallying support in U.S. Congress for $1.2 billion in federally guaranteed loans and persuading suppliers, dealers and union workers to make sacrifices. He cut his salary to $1 a year.
Iacocca was often described as a demanding and volatile boss who sometimes clashed with fellow executives. 
""He could get mad as hell at you, and once it was done he let it go. He wouldn't stay mad,"" said Bud Liebler, vice president of communications at Chrysler during the 1980s and 1990s. ""He liked to bring an issue to its head, get it resolved. You always knew where you stood with him.""
Iacocca often spoke of his immigrant roots and how America rewards hard work. When he was tapped by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 to be chairman of a campaign to restore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, he said he accepted the job as a way of honoring his parents.
The campaign raised more than $350 million, more than double the initial $150 million goal.
MARKETING SUCCESSES
Iacocca began his career just as post-war prosperity kicked the Auto Age into high gear. By the 1970s, many new suburban homes came with a two-car garage. 
Lido Anthony ""Lee"" Iacocca was born in the Pennsylvania steel town of Allentown on Oct. 24, 1924. His father, Nicola, owned a hot dog stand he called The Orpheum Wiener House - a foretaste of his son's later marketing creativity. 
In high school he was freshman class president, ""a big shot,"" he had thought. But when he stopped shaking his classmates' hands, he lost re-election. ""It was an important lesson about leadership,"" Iacocca wrote.
He was a diligent student, made the debating team and was a star in Latin class. Sophomore year he survived rheumatic fever, an illness that later kept him out of the military during World War Two, and graduated 12th in a class of more than 900. 
Iacocca enrolled in Lehigh University, earning his engineering degree in fewer than four years and received a fellowship at Princeton for his master's degree.
After joining Ford, he realized right away he was better at marketing than engineering. Ten years later, when his district had the worst sales in the country, he came up with a marketing campaign, ""56 for '56"" - buyers could get a 1956 Ford with 20% down and three years of monthly installments of $56. 
The plan took off like a rocket and Ford executive Robert McNamara, who would become secretary of defense in the Kennedy administration, made it part of Ford's national sales strategy. 
Iacocca's relationship with the Mustang was cemented when both Time and Newsweek featured him and the car on their covers in April 1964. By 2013, about 9 million Mustangs had been sold.
Gene Bordinat, Ford's design executive at the time, said of Iacocca's contribution to the Mustang's popularity: ""We conceived the car and he pimped it after it was born.""
It was cheap to produce and generated big profits. For years, it was Iacocca's signature achievement. 
The low moment in Iacocca's career though came in 1978, when Henry Ford II fired him. He asked why, reminding his boss that the company had earned record profits of $1.8 billion two straight years. Ford replied: ""Well, sometimes you just don't like somebody.""
The firing made national news. Iacocca never forgave Ford, and he described his former boss as a spendthrift and dictator. 
CHRYSLER FACED TWO HEADWINDS 
Iacocca's exile from Detroit board rooms was brief. Within weeks he accepted the presidency of Chrysler, even though its market share was shrinking and losses were deepening.
In 1979 Chrysler was facing twin blows of spiking interest rates and a second oil shock that doubled the price of gasoline. When the U.S. economy plunged into recession, sales at every automaker plummeted.
Iacocca searched for a merger partner but when no takers emerged, he turned to the government for up to $1.5 billion in loan guarantees. He pounded on the doors in Washington, assisted by dealers and union officials who knew their brethren would be out of work if Chrysler folded.
Asking for federal help was controversial, and one editorial cartoon depicted a child asking what the U.S. Capitol was called. ""The Chrysler Building"" came the answer.
Iacocca won the loan guarantees but they required broad sacrifices, of plant closures, pay cuts for factory workers and layoffs of white-collar staff.
He put his personal reputation on the line, and in the end, it was a tour de force of leadership. Factoring in positions at Chrysler, its dealerships and suppliers, he saved more than 500,000 jobs.
""People saw him in the trenches,"" Liebler said. ""When we needed the loan guarantees and he was pounding the halls of Congress, the dealers were with him ... he worked his head off day and night, and everyone who was involved in any way with Chrysler knew it."" 
About that time, Chrysler's introduction of the smaller, fuel-efficient ""K Cars"" gave it a boost. In a series of no-nonsense television commercials, Iacocca barked, ""If you can find a better car, buy it!""
He paid the loans back seven years early, and in 1983, a cartoon showed frantic executives of the troubled U.S. airline industry shouting into a phone, ""Get me Lee Iacocca!"" 
But Iacocca's star faded in the late 1980s as Chrysler floundered again. 
Chrysler struggled through the 1990-1991 economic downturn, losing $800 million in 1991. Iacocca refused to cut new product spending, and by 1992, the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and LH sedans led to a $732 million profit, while Ford and General Motors Co (N:GM) were in the red.
With Chrysler profitable again, Iacocca stepped down at the end of 1992. He lived out his latter years in stylish Bel-Air, California.
In retirement, Iacocca invested in the casino business and a line of imported olive oil, and he joined corporate boards. 
He penned ""Where Have All the Leaders Gone?,"" a 2007 book critical of American leadership, especially President George W. Bush.
Iacocca had two daughters with his first wife, Mary, who died of diabetes in 1983, prompting him to start a family foundation to fight the disease. 

After Mary's death he married twice more. His second was brief and ended in annulment, while his third ended in divorce.

1176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>",Treasury Yields Drop to Two-Year Low Amid Bets on Global Easing,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury 10-year yields dropped to the lowest in more than two years amid prospects for additional global monetary easing.
U.S. notes also gained for a second day as investors sought haven assets before a U.S. holiday Thursday and a raft of data this week including monthly payrolls numbers. Bonds rallied around the world after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of downside risks to growth, and European Central Bank officials were reported to be discussing additional stimulus.
“A major driver of Treasury yields lower is a dovish shift of central banks, including the ECB and BOE,” said Hidehiro Joke, a bond strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Ten-year yields may risk falling toward 1.70% as markets are very pessimistic” about economic growth, he said.
U.S.10-year yields slid as much as three basis points to 1.95%, the lowest since November 2016. They have declined from as high as 3.26% in October last year.
Traders are bracing for a slew of U.S. economic numbers being released Wednesday before the July 4 holiday. Data include durable goods orders, factory orders, and the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) employment figures. Friday’s payrolls report may either reassure investors concerned about last month’s weak numbers, or validate suspicions the economy is faltering.
All of that could help determine whether the Federal Reserve will fulfill market expectations for monetary-policy easing at its July 30-31 meeting. Fed funds rate futures are pricing in more than a quarter point of cuts for that gathering, and some traders have speculated a half-point reduction may be on the table.

The company said the jobs will be at its UK head office in London, in research and development, Amazon Web Services and operations.
The roles include entry-level positions at warehouses as well as engineers, software developers, data scientists, and cloud and machine learning experts.
In 2018, Amazon added 2,500 permanent jobs in Britain, its biggest market in Europe. On Tuesday the retail giant said it would create 1,800 permanent jobs this year in France, its second-biggest European market.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 06:22PM ET</span>",Tesla Model 3 deliveries beat Wall Street targets,"By Alexandria Sage and Munsif Vengattil
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) set a record for quarterly vehicle deliveries in a triumphant response to months of questions about demand for its luxury electric cars, sending shares up 7% after hours on Tuesday.
Tesla did not comment on profit - which is still elusive - but the robust deliveries could help jumpstart investor sentiment on Tesla, which has been challenged in recent months. Before Tuesday's after-hours spike, Tesla shares were down about a third from the beginning of the year.
Brushing aside concerns about demand that have dogged the company all year, Tesla said orders during the second quarter exceeded deliveries, despite buyers getting a smaller tax credit. 
A $7,500 U.S. federal tax credit was cut in half at the end of last year, fell to $1,875 on Monday and expires at the end of the year.
""We believe we are well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,"" the company said in a statement.
Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s in the quarter, the company's latest sedan and linchpin of the company's growth strategy. That compared with analysts' average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Deliveries of all models rose 51% from the first quarter to 95,200 vehicles, including 17,650 Model S and X. Analysts on average were expecting total deliveries of 89,084.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has repeatedly said Tesla could deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year.
Tuesday's numbers helped take the sting off a difficult first quarter, in which deliveries plunged and the company lost $702 million.
That fraught quarter – hurt by logistics issues at Tesla's international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after the tax credit was halved – spurred worries that Tesla may have tapped a limited market for electric cars at premium prices.
Despite the positive second-quarter delivery numbers, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives cautioned that ""the Street remains skeptical."" 
Demand and profitability will remain the two main drivers to buoy Tesla shares in coming quarters, Ives told Reuters, signaling that Tesla's challenges are far from over.
Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research noted that second-quarter deliveries were likely artificially boosted by customers pulling forward their vehicle purchases before the July 1 tax credit cut, warning that could result in a ""significant retracement"" in deliveries in the third quarter.
Tesla did not repeat its prior forecast that it would post a second-quarter loss but return to profit in the third quarter. 
A big challenge for Tesla has been how to deliver its vehicles efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. An improved system for logistics helped in the second quarter, Tesla said, without providing more detail. 
In prior quarters, Tesla has diverted employees from all parts of the company to help with deliveries in an all-hands-on-deck effort to meet delivery goals. That has proved to be an expensive and inefficient way to meet targets, which reduces potential profit margins on each vehicle.
The delivery numbers included 10,600 vehicles that had been in transit at the end of the first quarter.
The company has pledged to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019, a goal many analysts predict will be difficult to meet. 
Overall, total production rose 13% to 87,048 vehicles compared with the first quarter. The company churned out 72,531 Model 3s in the second quarter, up from a total of 62,950 Model 3s in the preceding quarter.
Tesla said that going forward, it would no longer disclose how many vehicles were in transit at the end of each quarter due to production changes that made the number less relevant. At the end of the second quarter, over 7,400 vehicles were in transit.

1179,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 06:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.

1. Labor, Services Data on Watch

There's a larger-than-usual amount of economic indicators set for tomorrow, with the stock market closing early at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT) and closed Thursday for the July 4 holiday.

Ahead of Friday’s monthly payroll report, the market gets a duo of reports on the labor market in the form of private sector payrolls and initial jobless claims. 

An update on U.S. services activity will also be closely watched amid concerns about slowing growth. 

{{|0ADP}} will report its nonfarm private-sector employ,ment number for June at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT). In May, the report showed only 27,000 new private-sector jobs created, less than expected and the smallest since the economic recovery began in 2010.

On average, economists expect that the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) report will show 140,000 private-sector jobs were added last month, well above the 27,000 added in the prior month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 29. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims declined to 220,000 from 227,000 previously.
Traders will also look to the U.S. services data for signs the economy remains on track despite external pressures. The services PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 57.7.
The services sector is critical component of the US economy, accounting for roughly 80% of U.S. private-sector gross domestic product (GDP).

Crude Inventories on Deck
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday, investors got an early insight into weekly U.S. supplies, showing a draw.
The American Petroleum Institute released data Tuesday that, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. 
The API showed weekly crude stockpiles fell by 5 million barrels last week. 
The EIA, meanwhile, is expected to report domestic supplies fell 2.964 million barrels for the week ended June 28.
Crude production will also garner attention after the EIA reported last week that output remained near a record at 12.1 million barrels a day.
Crude futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday, as fears that a weaker global economic backdrop would keep a lid on oil demand offset an agreement by OPEC and its allies to extend their oil-production pact by a further nine months.
U.K. Supermarkets in Focus
With little top-tier earnings on the calendar stateside, UK supermarkets will be in focus, with J  Sainsbury  PLC (LON:SBRY) set to report earnings before EU markets open. 
The performance of Sainsbury’s core grocery business will likely garner attention as the supermarket continues to face stiff competition from the discounters Lidl and Aldi.
The report comes after the U.K. competition watchdog rejected Sainsbury’s proposed £7 billon merger with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)-owned Asda earlier this year. "
1180,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 05:58PM ET</span>",Occidental urges shareholders to reject activist Icahn's proposal,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) on Tuesday called on its shareholders to reject activist investor Carl Icahn's moves to launch a proxy fight for four seats on the company's board.
The oil and gas producer, in a regulatory filing, said fixing a record date for the planned consent solicitation and the proposals of the Icahn Group ""are not in the best interests of Occidental or its stockholders"".
Last week, Icahn said he planned to oust and replace four Occidental directors and change the company's charter to prevent it from ever engineering a takeover, like its $38 billion bid for Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC).
Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting.
Icahn, one of industry's most powerful activist investors, cast himself as one of the deal's most fervent critics by charging that Occidental's bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental's future if oil prices sink.
Icahn, who owns a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30, had sued Occidental in a Delaware court. 
According to last week's filing, he said Occidental lacks effective corporate governance and that its directors made mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition of Anadarko.

Icahn was not immediately available for comment.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 05:51PM ET</span>",U.N. aviation agency to review global pilot training in shadow of 737 MAX crashes,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Global regulators will meet in Montreal next week to review pilot licensing requirements, the U.N.'s aviation agency said, as part of a discussion that has gained urgency following two fatal crashes of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the past year.
It is the first time that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which sets global standards for 193 member countries, will undertake such a broad review on training requirements.
While the meeting was not called in response to the MAX crashes in Indonesia last October and in Ethiopia in March, it coincides with a larger debate on whether increasingly automated commercial jets are compromising pilot skills. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide and could not be back in service for months yet.
Most attention surrounding the two 737 MAX crashes that killed a total of 346 people focuses on suspected flaws in an automated stall-prevention system called MCAS, which  Boeing Co  (N:BA) implemented to make the MAX perform like previous 737 models.
But the training given to pilots to allow them to handle such problems smoothly is also under scrutiny, expanding an industry debate over pilot skills that has been raging for years as crew spend less and less time flying aircraft manually.
""Recently, with current events, people are discussing whether the minimum requirements or experience are still valid,(or) should we review that?"" ICAO's chief of operational safety Miguel Marin told Reuters.
In addition to regulators, representatives of a global pilots group are expected to attend the July 8-12 meeting, Marin said. Marin called the meeting a ""first step,"" with any eventual change up to regulators.
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration increased the number of required training hours for commercial pilots from 250 to 1,500 in 2013, a move that some players have criticized as excessive, particularly as the industry grapples with future pilot shortages.
At the Montreal meeting, regulators will discuss flying hours and competency-based training, where pilots demonstrate skills like landing an airplane, as opposed to focusing on learning to fly and accumulating hours regardless of aircraft type.
ICAO's multi-crew pilot license created in 2006 focused on competency based training, where pilots need 240 hours to become first officers on a single aircraft type.
""What we're seeing in highly-automated aircraft, it's not how to manage the airplane if things are OK. It's those unexpected malfunctions that throw the airplane off,"" Marin said.
""We think that can only be addressed with a different type of approach to training rather than just saying, give them more hours."""
1182,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",Wall Street looks to earnings after strongest June in decades,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - On the heels of the S&P 500's best June performance in more than six decades, investors are anxious to see whether earnings can justify further gains as the largest U.S. companies open their books in the coming weeks.
The profit picture for 2019 has been weakening since the start of the year as the U.S.-China trade war has dragged on, increasing worries about its potential impact on corporate profit margins.
Analysts expect almost no profit growth for the second quarter in comparison with a year ago, versus a forecast of 6.5% growth at the start of the year. In addition, they expect a gain of just 0.7% in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The S&P 500 (SPX) hit a record high on Monday after last week closing out June with a 6.9 percent monthly increase, its biggest June percentage gain since 1955.
The potential for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this year largely propelled June's gains, while recent developments on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan over the weekend offered fresh hope for investors that trade tensions may be easing.
With valuations rising, market watchers are paying close attention to the earnings forecast trend. The S&P 500 is now trading at about 17 times forward earnings, up from 16.3 at the start of the month, based on Refinitiv's data.
""We do have the Fed as a powerful force,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""But a lot depends on external factors. We're already seeing downward revisions to the third quarter, and I don't think that's surprising.
""We know that economic policy uncertainty is created by the trade situation.""
Companies also face tough earnings comparisons with last year, when tax cuts fueled a 24.9% profit gain in the second quarter.
Just as with the first quarter, both the second and third quarters could end up stronger than forecast, since the majority of companies typically beat analysts' expectations during a reporting period.
While S&P 500 companies may narrowly escape a profit recession this year - defined as two straight quarters of year-over-year declines - earnings for 2019 now are seen rising just 2.3%.
That would represent the lowest annual profit growth for S&P 500 companies since 2016, which included the tail end of a four-quarter profit decline and left earnings growth that year at just 1.4%, according to Refinitiv's data.
(For a graphic on 'Estimated Q2 S&P 500 profit growth' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2G0rf9J)
On Saturday, the United States and China agreed to restart trade talks. U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to slap new levies on about $300 billion of additional Chinese goods, including popular consumer products, if the latest meeting proved unsuccessful. [
Tariffs on imports increase costs for U.S. companies, which then may need to raise prices on their goods.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL), in comments posted on a government website, said last month that proposed U.S. tariffs on goods from China, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, will reduce the company's contributions to the U.S. economy and hurt its global competitiveness.
Companies getting ready to report on the second quarter will no doubt warn about the potential impact of higher tariffs on their businesses, as they have done in recent earnings seasons.
Last week, FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said the U.S.-China trade tensions would hurt its fiscal 2020 performance, along with the non-renewal of its contract with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Second-quarter reporting heats up in mid-July, with JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) due to report July 16.
To be sure, the prospect of lower interest rates is likely to soothe some of the worries, since lower rates in general reduce costs for companies.
But even with the recent trade news, strategists say uncertainty surrounding the trade discussions is likely to continue to weigh on outlooks.
""Our overarching conclusion is that the developments over the weekend on their own don't do enough to remove the uncertainty created by trade tensions, which began over a year ago and remain an overhang on corporate confidence and the macro outlook,"" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a note on Monday."

1185,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Grim Earnings Forecasts Are Getting Worse by the Week,"(Bloomberg) -- On Wall Street, it’s not exactly a news bulletin when companies cut profit forecasts two weeks before earnings season. Easier to clear a lowered bar, when results are released. Right now, though, something more worrisome may be at work.
More than 80% of S&P 500 companies that have revised their profit estimates one way or the other in the lead-up to reporting have slashed them, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts are in on the action too, reducing company projections at the fastest pace in near three years.
“One of the things that investors seem to be overlooking is how poor the earnings environment is,” said David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management. “We’re so focused on monetary policy and this mythical China deal that we just don’t seem to be paying attention to earnings, which are really what should be driving stock prices.”
In and of itself, a flurry of downward revisions is nothing unusual at this time of year. Companies are always more likely to disclose bad news, and a few may be interested in lowering estimates before they report. But the extent of the negativity this time around is notable and is another burden for investors struggling to formulate views on the economy, global trade and the Federal Reserve.
Of S&P 500 companies that have revised their profit outlook over the past couple months, 82% cut, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The proportion bears an eerie similarity to the third quarter of last year, right before stocks plunged nearly 20%. Before that, you have to go back to 2015 to find more pessimism.
Wall Street analysts have been forcefully downgrading estimates too. In June, they cut forecasts on 116 more stocks than they upgraded them for, the worst reading since September 2017, according to Sundial Capital Research. Typically, analysts firm up their forecasts during the last month of a quarter, and this time “they’re worried,” said Sundial’s Jason Goepfert.
“There is some sagging in earnings,” said John Lekas, chief executive officer and senior portfolio manager at Leader Capital. “I’m not disputing that earnings across the board are priced to perfection. You know, you’re going to get some disappointments in there.”
The earnings headwinds have been plenty -- from a relatively stronger dollar in the second quarter to lower oil prices, higher input costs and uncertainty from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. While a recent truce between the two world superpowers was taken as a positive, the benefit is likely short-lived since company executives are still in the dark on what comes next.
“Companies are still wait-and-see,” Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ETFs, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “The earnings outlook probably has downside because we didn’t get this resolution of any type.”
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). is set to kick off the official second quarter earnings season in earnest on July 15, with other large banks following shortly thereafter. After avoiding a profit decline in the first quarter, companies in the S&P 500 will again be tested. Estimates call for a 2.5% drop in earnings for the three-month period ended in June. Should the negative reading hold, it would mark the first profit contraction in three years.
On Wall Street, it’s assumed that companies lower their forecasts only to make beating them easier. With that in mind, earnings-per-share will likely come in positive for the second quarter, according to Jonathan Golub, the chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). Strip out the positive effect from share buybacks, though, and an earnings contraction is still in the cards.
Still, it’s not like anyone is calling for Armageddon. A modest decline in the second quarter is expected to be followed by a modest rebound in the third and a 7% gain in the fourth. By the middle of 2020, companies should start seeing double digit profit growth once again, if the forecasts hold true. But with geopolitical tensions lingering and a question mark surrounding global growth, those estimates are feeble.
It’s a high stakes season.
“Even as a macro strategist, I will be watching individual earnings reports,” said Frances Donald, chief economist for Manulife Investment Management. “One of the big reasons is most economists and the Federal Reserve are going to be watching for signs that the uncertainty created by trade tensions have already weighed on the economy. Not just the tariffs themselves, but the lack of visibility into future trade relationships.”"

The S&P 500 closed up 0.3% to 2,973.01, its second closing record in two days. The index fell just shy of setting a new 52-week high.
The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%, and the Dow Jones industrials rose 0.3%.
The trade disputes came alive again when President Donald Trump said a China-U.S. trade deal should be a bit ""tilted"" toward the United States. Then, the White House said it might impose $4 billion in new tariffs on the European Union over the subsidies given to Airbus, the arch-rival of Boeing.
At the same time, crude oil prices fell more than 4% as traders became convinced crude output from U.S. shale formations could offset production cuts to the end of the year agreed to by OPEC and its allies.
All the developments seemed to offset the good feeling achieved at last week's G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, especially when the United States and China agreed to restart trade talks.
WTI futures fell $2.84, or 4.8%, to $56.25. Brent futures fell 4.1% to $62.40. Crude's slump hit energy stocks. Seven of the 10 worst S&P 500 performers were oil-and-gas producers.
Interest rates moved lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 1.976%, below the 13-week Treasury yield of 2.148% and a signal of investor worries about the economy. Banks stocks were mostly lower, but big real-estate stocks moved higher in response.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the biggest drag on the Dow, off 0.6% and subtracting more than 20 points from the index.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM),   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also were laggards. 
  Verizon Communications   (NYSE:VZ) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) were the Dow leaders. Cisco was also the second-best performer among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The index was up 0.4%.
The biggest techs, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Cisco and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were higher.
The tensions won't go away Wednesday, but at least trading in the United States will close early for the July 4 holiday. Markets will be closed on Thursday with regular trading resuming on Friday.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai report rise in U.S. sales in June,"By Nick Carey and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Major automakers on Tuesday posted mixed U.S. sales results for June and the second quarter, with demand still fairly strong for SUVs and pickup trucks while passenger car sales continued a long-running decline.
In the pickup truck segment,  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV's (FCA) (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) Ram outsold General Motors Co's (N:GM) Chevrolet Silverado in the second quarter. GM reports sales on a quarterly instead of monthly basis.
The Silverado has long held second place behind Ford Motor Co's (N:F) F-Series pickup trucks, with Ram often a distant third. But so far in 2019, FCA's sales of Ram pickups have outpaced Chevy Silverado sales by more than 40,000 vehicles. 
FCA, GM and Ford escalated a price war in June over pickup trucks - one of few vehicle market segments offering substantial profits, which matters at a time when overall U.S. new-vehicle sales are expected to fall this year.
High interest rates, plus competition from millions of nearly new, off-lease vehicles have translated into fewer consumers splurging on new cars. After a weak start to the year, sales in the last couple of months have been largely flat versus 2018. 
""The market is not as down as it was to start off the year, which says a lot about market stability,"" said George Augustaitis, director of industry analysis at CarGurus Inc, an online marketplace for new and used cars. ""At this point, a Fed interest rate cut could be the thing that sparks the industry.""
There have been growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, possibly as soon as at the central bank's next policy meeting at the end of July, although Fed officials last week pushed back on those expectations. 
FCA said its sales rose 2% in June, driven by a 56% jump in Ram sales. 
""This type of year-over-year growth is likely not sustainable in the short term, however, calendar-year-to-date, our pick-up truck sales are up 28%,"" FCA U.S. sales chief Reid Bigland said in a statement. ""As a result I do feel that double-digit truck growth is achievable well into the future."" 
GM said second-quarter sales fell 1.5%, with strong sport utility vehicle sales offset by poor performance for its pickup trucks. The No. 1 U.S. automaker said sales of trucks would pick up in the third quarter as both its most popular and most affordable versions of the Silverado will hit dealer showrooms.
Ford, which like GM reports sales quarterly, saw its sales fall 4.1% in the second quarter, with retail sales to consumers down more than 8%, according to auto industry data.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) reported a 3.5% drop in sales for June, led by falling sedan sales. 
In the last few years, Americans have increasingly shunned passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) sales plunged nearly 15%, with huge drops for much of its lineup including the best-selling Rogue SUV. After years of relying on steep discounts to increase U.S. market share, Nissan is trying to pull back so it can sell vehicles more profitably.
Billy Hayes, Nissan's North American vice president for sales, said many of the automaker's models will be revamped in the next year or two, which will help lift sales.

 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) on Tuesday reported a 1.5% rise in U.S. sales for June, lifted by strong demand for SUVs and trucks.

Mediaset shareholders' meeting approved on April 18 a loyalty share scheme that rewards longer-term investors with additional votes under an Italian law that is traditionally used by controlling shareholders to strengthen their grip on companies. Under the new scheme, investors will have two voting rights for each share held for at least 24 straight months.
The Italian broadcaster is controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Vivendi declined to comment.
Mediaset has been embroiled with Vivendi, the French media conglomerate controlled by Vincent Bollore, since 2016 when Vivendi pulled out of a deal to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit.
After the failed pay-TV sale, Vivendi built a stake of 29 percent in Mediaset but was later forced by Italian regulators to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns.
As Mediaset considers Vivendi's stake illegitimate, its board prevented both the French group and the trust in which it has transferred most of its stake to vote at April's shareholder meeting.
Vivendi could be excluded from voting at shareholder meetings of a new Amsterdam-based TV company the Italian broadcaster is establishing, according to a bylaw of the new holding.
Mediaset earlier this month unveiled a corporate overhaul that includes putting the group and its separately-listed Spanish unit under a new Dutch holding company as part of a pan-European growth strategy.
Vivendi could potentially scupper the corporate overhaul if it exercises its right of withdrawal for its whole stake as Mediaset has set a ceiling of 180 million euros on the cash outlay for the option, well below the Vivendi stake.
The board of directors of Mediaset will duly consider the request with a view to taking the relevant decisions, the company said in a statement."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks managed modest gains on Tuesday after holding near the unchanged mark for much of the session as enthusiasm over the U.S.-China trade truce faded after the United States threatened tariffs on additional European goods.
Washington's proposed tariffs on $4 billion worth of European Union goods in an extended dispute over aircraft subsidies came just as trade tensions with China seemed to be easing. 
Still, stocks have rallied to push the S&P 500 to a record for a second straight session in the wake of the U.S. trade truce with China. The benchmark index finished Monday's session well off its highs, however, as investors questioned the lack of details in the agreement. 
The S&P 500 had rallied nearly 7% in June on hopes the two largest economies in the world would find a way to end their trade war. 
With U.S. and global economic data showing signs of slowing, the focus for investors will now turn to monetary policy and the upcoming earnings season.
""We’ve got a wait and see on the trade deal, a wait and see on the Fed, a wait and see on earnings and all of that is in front of us by at least two weeks,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
""I am not surprised at all to see this market shift into sideways action."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 69.25 points, or 0.26%, to 26,786.68, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 8.65 points, or 0.29%, to 2,972.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 17.93 points, or 0.22%, to 8,109.09.
The softening data triggered a drop of about 3% in crude oil prices despite an agreement among oil producers to extend supply cuts and pushed the energy sector (SPNY) down 1.74%, the biggest drag on markets. The defensive real estate <.SPLRCR>, up 1.82% and utilities (SPLRCU), up 1.24% sectors were the best performers on the session.
Oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) declined more than 1% each, while  Apache Corp  (N:APA) slumped more than 6%. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a Federal Reserve policymaker, on Tuesday expressed skepticism that a U.S. interest rate cut is the right move until there are more signs the economy is moving to a truly weaker path.
Market participants still expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its July 30-31 policy meeting, despite the latest developments in trade talks.
Automatic Data Processing (O:ADP) lost 2.66%, pressuring the tech-heavy Nasdaq, after market sources said brokerage Jefferies is re-offering 8 million of the company's shares at a discount.
L3Harris Technologies (N:LHX) gained 4.28%, making it the best performer on the S&P 500, after Jefferies added the defense contractor to its top picks for aerospace and defense electronics for the second half of 2019. 
Investors are now awaiting the monthly jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show the private sector added 160,000 jobs in June, after May's sharp slowdown in jobs growth. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.30-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 55 new lows. 

About 6.36 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.02 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Export Development Canada its position on Saudi Arabia on Tuesday from “off cover” to “open on restricted basis,” ending a 10-month halt on business. The EDC move to suspend business in the country came after the Saudi government put its own freeze on any new deals for Canadian firms.
“EDC has now made the decision, based on our monitoring, that business conditions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have improved to a point where we can again start considering support for Canadian companies exporting to the market,” spokeswoman Amy Minsky said by email. “We believe there are opportunities for Canadian companies” in the country, she said, “and we don’t want to preemptively close the door to them.”
The move highlights an easing of tensions between the two countries since a diplomatic feud erupted last summer after a tweet by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland criticized the arrest of a Saudi women’s rights activist. In response, Saudi Arabia lambasted Canada for interfering in its domestic affairs, expelled the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh and ordered a freeze on new investment.
Before the incident, EDC had rated Saudi Arabia as open for business with a low risk of political interference. It’s current “restricted” status means that “we recognize there are risks, but are open to assessing transactions on a case-by-case basis to verify whether each meets our requirements for sustainable and responsible business,” Minsky said.
At the time of Freeland’s tweet, EDC had exposure of about C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) to Saudi Arabia, and about 250 customers operating in the kingdom."

Citigroup upgraded Cars.com (NYSE:CARS) to buy from neutral as it noted that the company’s current valuation was low even when the prospect of an acquisition was excluded, sending the company's shares more than 4% higher. The Chicago-based company runs a digital research marketplace for car shoppers.
Since September, Cars.com has been exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale amid pressure from activist investor Starboard Value, which bought a 9.9% stake in the company in December 2017. The stake represented 9.58% of the outstanding shares as of March 30.
Starboard late last year suggested the company should sell itself or shake up its management hierarchy to bolster its stock price. Cars.com responded by slashing its workforce by nearly 8% as it sought to rein in costs.
The moves have not helped the stock. The shares peaked at $32.94 in July 2018 and slumped to an intraday low of $19.08 on June 26. They're down 2.3% in 2019.
The company, however, has not set a timetable for a sale and said it would not provide additional details until the board approves a specific course of action or determines further disclosure is appropriate or required by law.
The investment community is largely holding out for a possible acquisition of Cars.com, with CFRA in April maintaining its buy rating on the stock, which it said was predicated on a takeout."

“As China faces uncertainty after the trade war, money now needs to find a market which is large and growing, and India is among them,” Rana Gupta, managing director of Indian equities at Manulife Asset Management Singapore Pte., said in an interview in Mumbai. “India’s adding a few trillion dollars to the economy and that’s how it obviously generates interest.”
Foreign investors have pumped more than $11 billion into Indian equities this year on bets there will be political stability and more room for a majority government to push for economic reform. In addition, Indian stocks will become relatively more attractive as China’s economy suffers from its ongoing trade war with the U.S.
Amid uncertainty about global economic growth, investors are looking for markets that are driven by domestic demand, have room for lower interest rates, and are under a stable government that doesn’t indulge in populist spending, Gupta said. “Fortunately, India ticks all the four boxes and looks quite good as an investment opportunity,” he said.

About 29% of Gupta’s $257 million Manulife India Equity Fund has holdings in banks and financial companies. It has returned 12% annually over the past three years, beating 87% of its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Among financial shares, Manulife is betting mainly on non-state banks and insurance companies on the view they will benefit from an increasingly formal economy and the growing number of Indians parking their savings into financial instruments.
Manulife is also eyeing businesses that stand to benefit from government measures on affordable housing. It is also interested in companies that produce white goods, ceramics and paint. Chemical and light engineering businesses are also attractive, as they may gain from China’s economic shift to consumption from manufacturing, Gupta said.
Manulife Financial Corp.., which manages more than $1 trillion of assets globally, oversees about $500 million of Indian equities. On June 21, it signed a venture with India’s Mahindra Asset Management Co. to invest $35 million for a 49% stake."

(Reuters) - Five states have agreed to facilitate settlement talks by dropping objections to a bid by  Insys Therapeutics Inc  (PK:INSYQ) in bankruptcy court to put on hold their lawsuits alleging the drugmaker helped fuel the opioid epidemic.
The agreement was announced on Tuesday by a lawyer for Chandler, Arizona-based Insys during a hearing before a federal bankruptcy judge in Wilmington Delaware, who was set to consider whether to block the states from moving forward with their cases.
Insys requested the injunction when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 10, becoming the first drugmaker accused in lawsuits by state and local governments of contributing to the deadly opioid epidemic to do so.
Insys filed for bankruptcy days after striking a $225 million settlement with the Justice Department resolving claims it paid doctors bribes to prescribe Subsys, the company's addictive fentanyl spray.
A federal jury in Boston in May found Insys founder John Kapoor and four other former executives guilty of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy involving Subsys marketing practices.
Filing for bankruptcy normally halts active litigation against a company while it reorganizes. But a longstanding exception in U.S. bankruptcy law allows for lawsuits to proceed enforcing government officials' ""police powers.""
Lawyers for Maryland and Minnesota, where Insys faced upcoming administrative trials in August and September, last week opposed Insys' motion to stay their cases, citing that exception. New York, New Jersey and Arizona joined them.
A ruling on Insys' motion could have influenced whether OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP - another opioid manufacturer facing some 2,000 lawsuits - decides to file for bankruptcy protection, according to a person familiar with the matter and legal experts.
But at Tuesday's hearing, Ronit Berkovich, a lawyer for Insys, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross that the five states, as well as North Carolina, had agreed to stay their cases in order to support a settlement negotiation protocol.
After hearing arguments over the proposal's merits, Gross agreed to approve it, saying it initiates negotiations that need to take place to avoid draining cash-strapped Insys of money.
""We don't want to reduce that money by litigating and the like,"" he said.
Cities and counties pursuing hundreds of similar cases against Insys are not part of the deal, nor are several states that had already agreed to put their lawsuits on hold.
But Berkovich said they would be invited to participate in the negotiation process, which she said envisions putting Insys in a position to file a restructuring plan for the court's approval by Sept. 2."

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>",Kering crown jewel Gucci banks on high-end gems for growth,"By Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci, the luxury brand that powers most of parent Kering's (PA:PRTP) profits, made its first steps in high-end jewelery on Tuesday with a dedicated store in Paris - part of its bid to expand its reach after a blowout fashion makeover.
Sales at the Italian label have grown at a breakneck pace since a turnaround under designer Alessandro Michele over the past three years, beating most industry rivals even as the rate of expansion slowed to 20 percent in the first quarter.
With its sights on one day overtaking peers Louis Vuitton, owned by  Kering  rival LVMH (PA:LVMH), or privately-held Chanel as the biggest luxury brand by revenue, Gucci is branching into new areas, including by recently rolling out cosmetics.
Its high-end jewelery venture will see it compete with heavyweights of that sector, including Richemont's (S:CFR) Cartier and van Cleef & Arpels, with a specialized store on Paris' historic Place Vendome.
Gucci, best known for its handbags and as a clothing label, already sold gold-based jewels in the 1,500 to 2,000 euro ($2,260) range. Its new line, with pieces designed by Michele and inspired by mythical gardens and fauna, carries price tags of between 50,000 and 800,000 euros.
The push comes at a booming time for the jewelery market, with demand from Asian customers in particular riding high.
Estimated to be worth 18 billion euros globally by consultancy Bain - though branded jewelery represents a smaller chunk - it was the fastest growing segment of the personal luxury goods business last year alongside shoes, with worldwide revenues rising 7 percent.
""This is an attractive category with lots of blank space,"" Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said.
Gucci will have a long way to go to catch up with jewelery leaders, however - Cartier's sales are estimated at around 5 billion euros by analysts, ahead of U.S brand Tiffany (N:TIF), at $4.4 billion or LVMH's Bulgari at around 2.5 billion euros.
By contrast, Louis Vuitton, which branched into high-end jewelery in 2012, is estimated to make no more than several hundred million euros a year from jewels, as is Kering-owned jeweler Boucheron.
Paris-based Kering also has brands like Pomellato, Dodo and Qeelin in this category, although jewelery and watches are its smallest division.
The group reports first-half sales on July 25, with all eyes on whether Gucci can maintain its momentum."

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 12:48PM ET</span>",Arizona to pull incentive for Nike plant over sneaker recall,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Arizona will withdraw financial incentives for  Nike  Inc's (N:NKE) manufacturing plant in the state after the sportswear maker pulled the release of a sneaker that featured a colonial-era version of the American flag, Governor Doug Ducey said on Tuesday. 
The world's largest sportswear maker recalled the shoe after former NFL quarterback and Nike sponsor Colin Kaepernick asked the company not to sell a shoe with a symbol that he and others consider offensive because of its connection to an era of slavery, the Wall Street Journal reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-nixes-betsy-ross-flag-sneaker-after-colin-kaepernick-intervenes-11562024126 on Monday. 
Nike had planned to release a new version of the Air Max 1 sneaker ahead of the Fourth of July holiday that featured a version of the U.S. flag with 13 white stars representing the first U.S. colonies. The flag is commonly known as the ""Betsy Ross flag."" 
""Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike,"" Ducey, a Republican, said in a series of tweets https://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1145980544909340672 on the recall. 
""Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation's independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,"" he said.
Nike did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Ducey's decision.
On Monday, a Nike spokesperson said it had ""chosen not to release the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July as it featured an old version of the American flag."" 
Ducey said he had ordered the State's Commerce Authority to withdraw all financial incentives under its discretion for the company's plant.
Nike was planning to construct a $185 million plant in Goodyear, Arizona, that would employ over 500 people. 
Kaepernick last year became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan, sparking similar outrage. 
The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men.
Protesters responded by burning their Nike shoes, investors sold shares and some consumers demanded a boycott. 
However, since Kaepernick was featured in the Nike ad in September, the company's stock has risen about 4% as of Monday's close. 
""I think it's important to understand who Nike's core demographic is here,"" said Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at NPD. ""They’re really focused on teens and looking at the commentary on Twitter and so forth, I don’t see a lot of teens coming out with a negative attitude here.""

This year, Nike's shares are up 15%, but they were down marginally on Tuesday at $85.05.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Brewing giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev  NV (AB InBev) (BR:ABI) is seeking to raise up to $9.8 billion by listing its Asia-Pacific business in Hong Kong, marking what would be the world's largest initial public offering this year.
Budweiser Brewing Company APAC, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, is selling 1.6 billion primary shares at between HK$40-$47 ($5.13-$6.02) apiece, according to termsheets seen by Reuters.
The deal will raise between $8.3 billion and $9.8 billion for heavily-indebted AB InBev before any over-allocation option is included, giving Budweiser Asia a market capitalization of up to $63.7 billion after the IPO.
The world's largest brewer has been working to reduce a debt pile of over $100 billion following the purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) in late 2016.
The company has said the main merit of a Hong Kong listing would be to create a champion in the Asia-Pacific region, where sales are still growing and increasingly wealthy consumers are trading up to higher margin premium beers.
""In addition to paying down debt, the deal provides AB InBev with a 'platform for M&A' whereby local brewers such as ThaiBev might prefer to tie up with a locally focused player in an Asian currency,"" said Nico von Stackelberg of Liberum.
Shares in Belgium-based AB InBev traded 1.4% higher at 79.36 euros by 0925 GMT.
WORLD'S BIGGEST
Even at the low end of the price range, the IPO will be the biggest globally this year, outstripping the $8.1 billion raised in New York by Uber (N:UBER), data from Refinitiv shows.
Global share listings hit their lowest level in three years in the first half of the year, with a slowdown in Europe counteracting a stronger U.S. showing.
The IPO pricing values Budweiser Asia at 16-18 times its enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, one termsheet shows.
EV-EBITDA is a common valuation metric that seeks to help investors compare companies' operations and strip out the different effects of financing costs.
Budweiser Asia's ratio compares with an EV-EBITDA value of 11 for AB InBev itself, according to Refinitiv data, 15 for China-focused Tsingtao (HK:0168) and 10 for Japan's Kirin (T:2503), another Asia-centric brewing giant.
The deal will be a welcome boost to Hong Kong, which is lagging behind the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq in terms of IPOs this year, with $8.9 billion to its credit compared with $14.9 billion and $17.5 billion raised by its U.S. rivals.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) wealth management boss Iqbal Khan is leaving Switzerland's second-largest bank in the latest high-level departure under its chief executive Tidjane Thiam.
Khan's surprise move ""to pursue other opportunities"" sparked speculation that the 43-year-old, who has overseen solid growth and profitability gains at Credit Suisse, could be hired by rival private bank  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) or UBS (S:UBSG).
A source close to Thiam said they did not know what Khan had planned next, while a source close to Khan said the sudden move had come as a surprise even for close associates.
Khan, who could not be reached for comment, will be replaced by international wealth management's (IWM) chief financial officer, Philipp Wehle, a Credit Suisse veteran and former German military intelligence officer who has held a number of roles since joining in 2005.
Sources told Reuters in March that Zurich-based Julius Baer is considering Khan as a possible successor to its CEO Bernhard Hodler. Baer declined to comment on Tuesday.
Wehle was also appointed a member of the executive board, Credit Suisse said in a statement on Monday.
STRONG RESULTS
Thiam -- who has cut thousands of jobs, focused on wealth management and settled legal cases that had plagued predecessors -- has been reshuffling leadership including naming a new chief risk officer in February.
""Under his leadership, IWM has delivered strong financial results, while enhancing our client franchise and achieving industry leading growth,"" Thiam said in a statement. ""I thank Iqbal for the strong results he delivered.""
IWM had record quarterly net revenue and pre-tax income in the first three months of the year.
Khan joined Credit Suisse from Ernst & Young in 2013 as finance chief for the private banking and wealth management business and in 2015 was appointed as CEO of IWM and an executive board member.
Financial sector sources said Khan would be a good candidate for foreign banks, one adding he was ""could easily be a strong addition to some of the American banks"".
Khan's abrupt departure did not necessarily signal he had been passed over to become Credit Suisse CEO as Thiam has said he was in no hurry to go.

Shares in Credit Suisse were down 1.1% by 0930GMT, compared to a 0.3% drop for Europe's banking index (SX7P).

1210,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",As Wall Street Slashes Yield Forecasts a Famed Bond Bull Resists,"(Bloomberg) -- Steven Major reckons even his mother, a retired medical secretary with little knowledge of finance, would have made a killing on bonds in the first half of the year. But the next six months will be a different story.
In the wake of last quarter’s rally, a host of Wall Street analysts has been slashing their forecasts for the yield on 10-year Treasuries, with some even contemplating a drop below 1%. However  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s head of fixed income research -- a renowned bull -- is holding his ground, sticking with the bank’s forecast for a yield of 2.1% by year end.
For Major, a lot of bad news is already in the price. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, signs of economic slowdown as well as geopolitical risks have all forced central banks to become more dovish, sending American bond yields lower by nearly 90 basis points this year.
“I’m not in the business of being deliberately negative,” Major said in a phone interview. “To get darker than this, to predict a Japan scenario, we would need new information.”
That hasn’t held back Major’s peers, who have revised down their estimates for the benchmark U.S. yield by 65 basis points on average since the end of the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC cut its forecast to the current level in March, having started the year predicting 2.5%.
In a sign of the tightly priced market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 2.019% as of 7:46 a.m. New York-time, barely changed on the week even after the U.S. resumed trade talks with China. Traders are still pricing in almost 75 basis points of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2019.
Major has been one of the biggest bond bulls in recent years, known for his view that high debt, slower growth and demographics will keep rates low in the long-term. Yet after government bonds globally returned 5% and credit 7.8% in the first half, he sees limited upside in the months ahead. Rates in many countries are at or near zero, so policy makers have less firepower. Meanwhile the Fed’s median dot plot for the longer-term points to a policy rate of 2.5% -- suggesting limited scope for yields to fall much more, he said.
“Easy money has been made in the first six months of the year due to the capitulation” of the bearish sentiment around bonds, said Major. “My intuition is that it’s going to be much more difficult in the second half.”

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>","British companies, pension funds may have to report climate risks","By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - British public companies and pension funds may have to publish by 2022 what risks their businesses face from climate change under a new so-called green finance strategy.
Britain last week became the first G7 country to sign into law a requirement to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and the green finance strategy, published on Tuesday, sets out plans to increase investment in sustainable projects and infrastructure. 
The government paper builds on disclosure on climate risks set out by the G20 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. 
The government report said the financial sector needed be at the heart of changes required to meet the net zero emissions goal. 
""The re-allocation of tens of trillions of dollars of capital toward green investment offers the potential to reshape cities, energy systems and land use around the world. The nature of this investment ... will determine the future of our climate,” the report said.
""This includes setting expectations for publicly listed companies and large asset owners to disclose by 2022 how climate change risk impacts their activities.""
It said it would work with regulators to decide whether mandatory disclosures, rather than the current voluntary system, was needed.
The climate risks include potential ""stranded assets"" of fossil fuel companies which may not be able to burn all their oil, gas or coal resources if carbon emissions are limited. Insurance companies have also warned of the risk of claims relating to increased extreme weather damage from floods or hurricanes. 
Many investors have called on companies to provide better communication on how climate change could impact their businesses, amid concerns that assets are being mispriced because the full scale of the risk is not being factored in.
The overall share of the market capitalization of mining and oil and gas stocks in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index (FTSE) is about 17%.
More than 200 of the world's largest listed companies have forecast that climate change could cost them a combined total of almost $1 trillion, a report by charity group Carbon Disclosure Project showed last month.
The G20's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures launched its voluntary framework in 2017 that calls on companies to provide climate-related financial disclosures in their public annual financial filings.
The task force published its second status report last month, showing 785 companies and organizations, with a combined market capitalization of more than $9.2 trillion, had committed to support the framework.
Companies supporting it included insurance groups AXA (PA:AXAF) and  Aviva  (L:AV), oil companies Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) and mining companies  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and BHP (AX:BHP).

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks eked out meagre gains on Tuesday amid worries the global economy was faltering after data showed manufacturing activity slowed last month, weakening appetite for risk.
MSCI's All Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was higher by 0.05% by midday in London, up for a fourth straight day. Futures (ESc1) indicated a lower open for stocks on Wall Street.
Stocks had rallied globally on Monday after the United States postponed imposing another round of tariffs on Chinese products and the two countries agreed to continue negotiations on trade.
But investors were skeptical of further gains for equities after discouraging manufacturing surveys in the past 24 hours and a U.S. threat of additional tariffs on European goods.

""It's clear that the tariffs already in place will continue to take a toll on global and domestic growth, and with Trump now turning his attention on Europe, the early bullish bias seems to ease again,"" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.25%, although plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR) dropped as much as 1% as the United States stepped up pressure in the long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies. 
The U.S. Trade Representative's office released a list of additional products - including olives, Italian cheese and Scotch whiskey - that could be subject to tariffs, on top of products worth $21 billion that were announced in April.
""We've got the trade spat resurfacing between the U.S. and EU, which is reiterating Trump's protectionist stance on trade, and that is obviously not the kind of news you want to hear,"" said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg in London.

But Chinese blue chips (CSI300) were flat and Korean shares (KS11) lost 0.36%. Japan's Nikkei (N225) finished up 0.11%.
Australian shares (AXJO) were flat, pulling back from earlier gains after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a record low 1.0%, as expected. However, the RBA left limited room for more cuts, raising the possibility of unconventional policy easing.
The Australian dollar  pulled up from recent lows to gain 0.4% against the U.S. dollar at $0.6992.
The safe-haven yen strengthened against the dollar, which fell 0.2% to 108.25 yen per dollar . 
The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against major rivals (DXY), was 0.1% lower at 96.749.
The euro got a brief boost after a media report that European Central Bank policymakers are in no rush to cut interest rates at a July policy meeting.
The single currency (EUR=EBS) edged up as much as 0.25% to the day's highs at $1.1322 before retracing some of its rise to stand 0.1% up on the day at $1.1300. 
In debt markets, Italian government bonds rallied after Italy cut its 2019 budget deficit target to avoid European Union disciplinary action, potentially easing another major concern for markets. 
Oil prices slipped as concerns that the global economy could be slowing outweighed an agreement by producer club OPEC on Monday to extend supply cuts until next March.

The FDJ company, Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica, is 72 percent state-owned.
Last month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said FDJ would be privatized by the end of the year, market conditions permitting. Asked how much the state could hope to raise from the sale of FDJ, he had just said ""a few billion euros"".

Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, recently held talks with a select group of investment banks to discuss potential roles on the offering, according to the people. Detailed work on the IPO may pick up speed later this year or early next year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
The revived IPO plan will still face significant hurdles, including the ability of kingdom to achieve the $2 trillion valuation it’s been seeking for the company. Demand for the share sale would also likely be affected by lower oil prices as well as growing concerns among top institutional investors about pouring money into fossil-fuel companies that contribute to climate change.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also keen to list Aramco in New York, but advisers are wary of opening up the company to the risks of U.S. litigation. Prince Mohammed has insisted that the IPO will still take place in 2020 or 2021.
After working with banks for more than two years, Aramco formally put the IPO plans on hold last year and instead decided to buy a $69 billion stake in local chemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Aramco is planning to wait until the Sabic acquisition is completed before conducting the IPO, one of the people said.
Aramco was originally working with Evercore Inc., Moelis & Co.,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the planned share sale. It wasn’t immediately clear if all the banks had been approached again or if some new firms are also being considered.
No final decisions have been made, and the timeline for the share sale could still change, the people said. Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The IPO project was first announced in 2016 as the cornerstone of the Vision 2030 plan to modernize the Saudi economy, with a target of listing in the second half of 2018. The kingdom wants to raise a record $100 billion from selling a 5% stake in Aramco, which would make it the biggest IPO in history and a windfall for any banks that win a role."

MANILA (Reuters) - Tessie, her husband and their adult son recently vacated their home of 37 years in a Manila suburb to make way for some unfamiliar tenants - 20 Chinese nationals.
It wasn't an easy decision to let out their 5-bedroom home, but for 140,000 pesos ($2,730) a month in rent - nearly three times the norm in their middle-class neighborhood - it was an offer too good to refuse, said Tessie. She declined to be identified by her full name. 
Like Tessie, many Filipino landlords are laying out welcome mats for the surging number of Chinese coming to Manila to work in online gaming companies taking sports and casino bets, undeterred by simmering anti-China sentiment and a common perception that Chinese are taking Filipino jobs.
""I was afraid at first because I heard so many bad things abut Chinese tenants but I was convinced later on when my friends told me they were doing the same"", said Tessie. 
""It's benefiting people like me who need to earn"", said the 63-year-old housewife. 
Her home is close to a two-tower office building where five of the nine floors are used by Chinese gaming firms. A Chinese restaurant and Chinese tea shop downstairs do brisk trade. 
Such arrangements are now commonplace across the business hubs of Manila, where Chinese gaming firms are capitalizing on the Philippines' liberal gaming environment and an insatiable appetite for gambling in China, which forbids all types of betting.
The influx started in 2016, coinciding with the rise of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who since coming into power has pursued warmer ties with China, and the gaming regulator's move to license these internet gambling operators. 
The number of Chinese work permit holders nearly quadrupled in two years to 109,222 in 2018, government data showed, making China the biggest source of expatriate workers in the Philippines. 
In comparison, there were 4,477 work permit holders from Japan and 622 from the United States last year.
The arrival of Philippine offshore gaming operators, better known as POGOs, has become a major boon for the property market just as it was getting crimped by a slowdown in the country's $24 billion outsourcing sector. 
""POGOs came in and saved the office market"", said Dom Fredrick Andaya, a director at Colliers International Philippines. ""We would have had double-digit vacancy rates by 2017 if POGOs did not come"". 
OFFICE, HOME RENTS SURGE
Philippine gaming regulators have so far licensed 56 POGOs from 35 in 2016. They have also accredited 204 gaming support providers that market their products and render customer service to players abroad, among other services.
Reuters requested comment from at least two POGOs whose contact details were available online but they did not respond. Reuters also visited at least one gaming tenant in a building in the main Makati business district but was denied entry. 
POGOs will likely take up 1 million square meters of office space in Manila by year-end, Andaya said, nearly 12 times more than in the last quarter of 2016.
Office rents in the Manila Bay area, which has the highest concentration of POGOs, have risen as much as 150% over the past two years, with some renting up for 1,500 pesos per square meter, Andaya said, comparable to rents in Makati.
Alongside, the influx of Chinese workers has fueled a surge in demand for residential space, lifting condominium and housing rents by as much as 50% in areas where POGOs operate, said Pronove Tai International Property Consultants.
""The sales market increased with investors buying bulk units...which they lease to Chinese companies as staff housing"", Pronove Tai said.
Chinese accounted for close to 50% of local developers' foreign sales, Colliers said, helping drive residential property prices higher.
Shop signs and names of restaurants, spas and pharmacies in Mandarin have become increasingly common around the capital, and many retail stores are now using Chinese digital payment apps WeChat Pay and AliPay.
But lawmakers are growingly worried that the rising number of Chinese workers could lead to local strife and increase the competition for jobs when 2.29 million Filipinos are unemployed.
The issue is being compounded by the arrest of hundreds of undocumented Chinese workers in illegal online gambling outfits and construction sites and the discovery by authorities that some of these entities have not been paying correct taxes.
But Duterte has called for tolerance.
""The Chinese, let them work here. Let them be. Why? We have 300,000 Filipinos in China. That's why I can't just say, leave, or have them deported. What if they make all the 300,000 (Filipinos) leave"", Duterte said in a speech in February.
Filipino businessman JP Gaspar, who is renting out his family's four-bedroom home to Chinese nationals for 100,000 pesos a month, said he is aware the country's embrace of China may not last longer than Duterte's six-year term in office. 
""In the meantime, I'll grab the opportunity"", Gaspar said.

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. online retail giant Amazon (O:AMZN) said on Tuesday it will create 1,800 permanent contract positions this year in France, its largest European market after Britain and Germany, although furniture retailer Conforama went the other way in cutting jobs.
The increase will bring Amazon's total number of permanent staff to 9,300 by end 2019 and reflects the group's commitment to the French market where it has invested over 2 billion euros ($2.26 billion) since 2010, the statement said.
Amazon's plan comes as Conforama, the French unit of South African retailer Steinhoff (J:SNHJ) which is in the midst of a financial restructuring, plans to cut 1,900 jobs in France.
Deputy finance minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Sud Radio that ""traditional retail faces a very deep transformation. It is true that the coincidence of these two figures - 1,800 hires at Amazon and 1,900 job cuts at Conforama - reflects this transformation.""
She said the French government will be ""extremely vigilant"" regarding Conforama and would look to limit its impact.
Amazon has been expanding steadily in France where it has 20 sites, including six logistics centers, the most recent slated to open over summer in Bretigny-Sur-Orge near Paris.
Amazon is the e-commerce leader in France with a market share of 17.3 percent, but its grocery market share stands at just 2 percent, according to Kantar data.
The U.S. group, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its ambitions to expand in food retail.

In April, it expanded its partnership with French food retailer  Casino  (PA:CASP) with Amazon installing pick-up lockers in Casino stores and making more of the French company's products available on Amazon.

The French 'APE' (Agence des Participations de l'Etat) body said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  (N:C), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), SocGen (PA:SOGN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), HSBC (L:HSBA),  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) and CIC would work on the FDJ deal.
The FDJ company, Europe's second-biggest lottery after Italy's Lottomatica, is 72 percent state-owned.
Last month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said FDJ would be privatized by the end of the year, market conditions permitting. Asked how much the state could hope to raise from the sale of FDJ, he had just said ""a few billion euros"".
The privatizations of companies such as airports group ADP (PA:ADP) and FDJ are integral to President Emmanuel Macron's drive to curb government involvement where he believes the private sector would better deliver investment and change.
The government plans to sell all or part of its 50.6 percent stake in ADP, currently worth around 8.4 billion euros ($9.50 billion).
However, those plans have been complicated by a group of opponents who have demanded a referendum on the ADP privatization, and have accused the government of ""flogging the family silver"".

Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, recently held talks with a select group of investment banks to discuss potential roles on the offering, according to the people. Detailed work on the IPO may pick up speed later this year or early next year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
The revived IPO plan will still face significant hurdles, including the ability of kingdom to achieve the $2 trillion valuation it’s been seeking for the company. Demand for the share sale would also likely be affected by lower oil prices as well as growing concerns among top institutional investors about pouring money into fossil-fuel companies that contribute to climate change.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also keen to list Aramco in New York, but advisers are wary of opening up the company to the risks of U.S. litigation. Prince Mohammed has insisted that the IPO will still take place in 2020 or 2021.
After working with banks for more than two years, Aramco formally put the IPO plans on hold last year and instead decided to buy a $69 billion stake in local chemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Aramco is planning to wait until the Sabic acquisition is completed before conducting the IPO, one of the people said.
Aramco was originally working with Evercore Inc., Moelis & Co.,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the planned share sale. It wasn’t immediately clear if all the banks had been approached again or if some new firms are also being considered.
No final decisions have been made, and the timeline for the share sale could still change, the people said. Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
The IPO project was first announced in 2016 as the cornerstone of the Vision 2030 plan to modernize the Saudi economy, with a target of listing in the second half of 2018. The kingdom wants to raise a record $100 billion from selling a 5% stake in Aramco, which would make it the biggest IPO in history and a windfall for any banks that win a role."

(Reuters) - European shares retreated on Tuesday from two-month highs hit in the previous session, as U.S.-China trade talk euphoria subsided and Washington's latest tariff threats on $4 billion of additional EU goods held back market gains.

Global stock markets rallied on Monday, with the STOXX 50 index (STOXX50) hitting its highest level since February 2018, after the United States and China restarted trade negotiations over the weekend after a long pause.
The STOXX 600 index had its worst performance in more than two years in May after a sudden escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, but stocks recouped most of their losses since then on hopes that major central banks would be more accommodative to counter the impact of the dispute.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that any trade deal with China would need to be ""somewhat tilted"" in favor of the United States putting a damper on sentiment.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2019 03:11AM ET</span>",Landlords big winners as Philippines bets on Chinese gaming boom,"By Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - Tessie, her husband and their adult son recently vacated their home of 37 years in a Manila suburb to make way for some unfamiliar tenants - 20 Chinese nationals.
It wasn't an easy decision to let out their 5-bedroom home, but for 140,000 pesos ($2,730) a month in rent - nearly three times the norm in their middle-class neighborhood - it was an offer too good to refuse, said Tessie. She declined to be identified by her full name. 
Like Tessie, many Filipino landlords are laying out welcome mats for the surging number of Chinese coming to Manila to work in online gaming companies taking sports and casino bets, undeterred by simmering anti-China sentiment and a common perception that Chinese are taking Filipino jobs.
""I was afraid at first because I heard so many bad things abut Chinese tenants but I was convinced later on when my friends told me they were doing the same"", said Tessie. 
""It's benefiting people like me who need to earn"", said the 63-year-old housewife. 
Her home is close to a two-tower office building where five of the nine floors are used by Chinese gaming firms. A Chinese restaurant and Chinese tea shop downstairs do brisk trade. 
Such arrangements are now commonplace across the business hubs of Manila, where Chinese gaming firms are capitalizing on the Philippines' liberal gaming environment and an insatiable appetite for gambling in China, which forbids all types of betting.
The influx started in 2016, coinciding with the rise of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who since coming into power has pursued warmer ties with China, and the gaming regulator's move to license these internet gambling operators. 
The number of Chinese work permit holders nearly quadrupled in two years to 109,222 in 2018, government data showed, making China the biggest source of expatriate workers in the Philippines. 
In comparison, there were 4,477 work permit holders from Japan and 622 from the United States last year.
The arrival of Philippine offshore gaming operators, better known as POGOs, has become a major boon for the property market just as it was getting crimped by a slowdown in the country's $24 billion outsourcing sector. 
""POGOs came in and saved the office market"", said Dom Fredrick Andaya, a director at Colliers International Philippines. ""We would have had double-digit vacancy rates by 2017 if POGOs did not come"". 
OFFICE, HOME RENTS SURGE
Philippine gaming regulators have so far licensed 56 POGOs from 35 in 2016. They have also accredited 204 gaming support providers that market their products and render customer service to players abroad, among other services.
Reuters requested comment from at least two POGOs whose contact details were available online but they did not respond. Reuters also visited at least one gaming tenant in a building in the main Makati business district but was denied entry. 
POGOs will likely take up 1 million square meters of office space in Manila by year-end, Andaya said, nearly 12 times more than in the last quarter of 2016.
Office rents in the Manila Bay area, which has the highest concentration of POGOs, have risen as much as 150% over the past two years, with some renting up for 1,500 pesos per square meter, Andaya said, comparable to rents in Makati.
Alongside, the influx of Chinese workers has fueled a surge in demand for residential space, lifting condominium and housing rents by as much as 50% in areas where POGOs operate, said Pronove Tai International Property Consultants.
""The sales market increased with investors buying bulk units...which they lease to Chinese companies as staff housing"", Pronove Tai said.
Chinese accounted for close to 50% of local developers' foreign sales, Colliers said, helping drive residential property prices higher.
Shop signs and names of restaurants, spas and pharmacies in Mandarin have become increasingly common around the capital, and many retail stores are now using Chinese digital payment apps WeChat Pay and AliPay.
But lawmakers are growingly worried that the rising number of Chinese workers could lead to local strife and increase the competition for jobs when 2.29 million Filipinos are unemployed.
The issue is being compounded by the arrest of hundreds of undocumented Chinese workers in illegal online gambling outfits and construction sites and the discovery by authorities that some of these entities have not been paying correct taxes.
But Duterte has called for tolerance.
""The Chinese, let them work here. Let them be. Why? We have 300,000 Filipinos in China. That's why I can't just say, leave, or have them deported. What if they make all the 300,000 (Filipinos) leave"", Duterte said in a speech in February.

""In the meantime, I'll grab the opportunity"", Gaspar said.

1233,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",How U.S. Chipmakers Pressed Trump to Ease Huawei Export Controls,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s decision to allow U.S. companies to continue selling to Huawei followed an extensive lobbying campaign by the U.S. semiconductor industry that argued the ban could hurt America’s economic and national security.
In multiple high-level meetings and a letter to the Commerce Department, the companies argued for targeted action against Huawei Technologies Co. instead of the blanket ban the Trump administration imposed in May. That includes identifying specific technologies that the Chinese company shouldn’t be given access to, while allowing U.S. firms to supply the rest.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, or SIA, a trade group that represents companies like  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Broadcom Corp (NASDAQ:AVGO). and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc., told the Trump administration that its sanctions against the Chinese company will make them appear to be undependable partners, which will put them at a severe disadvantage globally.
Representatives of chipmakers last month met with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to argue that the decision to place the company on a so-called entity list could hurt the country, people familiar with the meeting said.
In the letter seen by Bloomberg News, SIA said that the action risked cutting off its members from their largest market and hurting their ability to invest. At the same time, Huawei would in many cases be able to get components elsewhere, they argued.
“Overly broad restrictions that not only constrain the ability of U.S. semiconductor companies to conduct business around the world, but also casts U.S. companies as risky and undependable, puts at risk the success of this industry, which in turn impacts our national security,” the group wrote last month. They added that the administration should take into account those factors when evaluating license applications from American firms.
Their talking points seem to have found their way to Trump. After concluding a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Osaka on Saturday, the U.S. president said American firms weren’t pleased with his Huawei policy and announced that he has agreed to let them keep shipping some of their components and technology.
“I’ve agreed -- and pretty easily -- I’ve agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so American companies will continue,” the president said during a press conference. “The companies were not exactly happy that they couldn’t sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to Huawei. So I did do that.”
He later clarified he will only allow them to sell “equipment where there is no great national emergency problem with it,” without offering more details. Trump’s comments stoked confusion among industry and analysts and the White House has not yet announced specifics on the path forward for U.S. companies doing business with Huawei.
While China hawks in Congress and Trump’s administration feared a potential reversal of the export ban, U.S. industry has been pushing the White House to ease restrictions that require American firms to get a U.S. government license in order to sell to the Chinese tech giant.
A spokesman for SIA said the group has “consistently urged the administration to advance U.S. semiconductor leadership as it works to preserve national security, and we’re encouraged by the direction the president set in Osaka.”
A Commerce spokesman said companies can submit license applications explaining the importance of exports on their business relationship. When a case is made for license approval based on concrete and supportable facts, decisions on those licenses are made. When data is absent, Commerce is unable to act, the spokesman said.
Chipmakers have been placed in a tough spot by the trade dispute and security-related action against Huawei. China is their biggest market, providing about a third of revenue. They’re arguing that not all exports to Huawei and its affiliates pose a security risk and that much of what’s sold there is easily replaceable with non-U.S. products. Given the massive cost of research and development for chips, continuing to miss out on revenue could hurt their competitiveness.
Their concerns were stoked by China’s response to Trump’s Huawei ban. In May, Beijing threatened to compile a list targeting companies that it says are not dependable suppliers. American firms were also spooked when Chinese government officials called them in for meetings and threatened to add them to the list if they don’t make sure the U.S. eases up on its ban, people briefed on the meetings said.
The chip industry’s proposed solution is to ask for a narrower set of restrictions, according to people involved in the negotiations with U.S. government representatives. They argued that there are choke points -- crucial pieces of technology, that if withheld could slow down Huawei without totally crippling it. In many cases, providing chips without the engineering support and software needed to integrate them in devices is enough, the people said.
Micron, Intel
In the letter the SIA highlighted several areas that don’t warrant a blanket ban. The memory chip industry is dominated by Korean makers with a 68% market share of the commodity products. That means if Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)., Intel and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). are excluded from China, they will directly lose market share, the group argued.
In analog chips, simpler components that convert things like sound and radio waves into digital signals, the U.S. owns 65% of the market. European and Japanese companies have ‘viable substitutes’ that Chinese customers could use. And even in logic chips, where companies such as Intel and Qualcomm have won the U.S. a 69% stranglehold, Huawei’s own HiSilicon chip unit is among a list of alternative providers that could offer replacements for crucial components of smartphones, computers and networking gear.
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Sunday that the granting of licenses only applies to general merchandise. “Anything to do with national security concerns will not receive a new license from the Commerce Department. I think that’s very important.”
Still, it’s unclear what the Trump administration’s end goal is. Trump said he will only make a decision on what to do about Huawei when trade talks are in the final stages. “We’ll have to save that until the very end,” he said.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 09:22PM ET</span>",USTR proposes $4 billion in potential additional tariffs over EU aircraft subsidies,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just days after reaching a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, the U.S. government on Monday ratcheted up pressure on Europe in a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, threatening tariffs on $4 billion of additional EU goods.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office released a list of additional products - including olives, Italian cheese and Scotch whiskey - that could be hit with tariffs, on top of products worth $21 billion that were announced in April.
USTR said it was adding 89 tariff sub-categories to its initial list, including a variety of metals, in response to public comments, but gave no further explanation. Over 40 individuals testified about products included on the initial list at a public hearing on May 15 and 16.
The United States and the EU have threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs on planes, tractors and food in a nearly 15-year dispute at the World Trade Organization over aircraft subsidies given to U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and its European rival, Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Senior officials from Boeing and a U.S. aerospace trade group urged the U.S. government last month to narrowly tailor any tariffs imposed on the EU over illegal aircraft subsidies to avoid harming American manufacturers.
No comment was immediately available from Boeing or Airbus.
The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States criticized the Trump administration's latest tariff threats and warned they would jeopardize U.S. jobs and hurt consumers.
""We strongly oppose the inclusion of distilled products in the proposed retaliation list,"" said spokeswoman Lisa Hawkins.
""U.S. companies - from farmers to suppliers to retailers - are already being negatively impacted by the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by key trading partners on certain U.S. distilled spirits ... and these additional tariffs will only inflict further harm,"" she said.
Monday's move followed news during the Paris Air Show that the United States could be open to negotiations on an ""enforceable mechanism"" that could allow Airbus to receive government funding on commercial terms, potentially paving the way for an end to the aircraft subsidy fight.
Such a deal would also include moves by the United States to address tax incentives provided by Washington state to Boeing and make them compliant with trade rulings, as part of a possible new framework for aircraft industry funding, two U.S. sources said at the time.
The WTO has found that the world's two largest planemakers received billions of dollars of harmful subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world's largest-ever corporate trade dispute.
It is expected to rule on the U.S. sanctions request over the summer, although the date could slip to September.
USTR said it would hold a hearing on the proposed additional products on Aug. 5. 
It said it could immediately impose increased duties on the products included in the initial list, if the WTO arbitrator issued a decision before the public comment period ended on the supplemental list. 

Further actions on the supplemental list could follow, it added.

After jumping as much as 1.2%, the benchmark for U.S. equities ended Monday’s session with a 0.8% gain at 2,964. While the late-day pullback was consistent with short-term profit taking after last month’s rally, the reversal wasn’t big enough to indicate a collapse is imminent, Rich Ross, the firm’s head of technical analysis, said in a post-market research note.
“At the same time, the breakout was not the most definitive either, leaving the S&P in a technical purgatory of sorts whereby a slightly more decisive breakout would set the stage for a run at 3,020-40 with measured upside to 3,150,” Ross said. “Conversely a failure at an all-time high would leave us uniquely vulnerable.”
In the meantime, equity bulls are in control in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets and selling pressure remains weak, he said.

SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s federally created fiscal oversight board on Monday imposed a fiscal 2020 budget on the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth that for the first time limits spending choices by its government, according to the board's executive director.
Natalie Jaresko said the $20.2 billion budget for the central government that includes $9.1 billion of general fund spending complies with the fiscal plan for the island, which filed a form of bankruptcy in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
""It reflects the priorities of that fiscal plan - public safety, healthcare, education and the continued right-sizing of the government,"" Jaresko told reporters.
She added that the budget for the fiscal year that began on Monday contains new ""detailed"" spending levels that will prohibit the government from moving money around to pay for things not in the fiscal plan like employees' Christmas bonuses.
Governor Ricardo Rossello told reporters the board did not include the bonus payment in last year's budget but ""we found a way to pay for it.""
Puerto Rico lawmakers on Sunday approved an approximately $9.6 billion general fund budget that includes roughly $500 million in pension and healthcare payments previously paid by cash-strapped municipalities and public corporations, as well as money for bonuses.
“Those monies are not in the budget nor the certified fiscal plan,” Jaresko said, adding that municipalities must seek ways to increase their own revenue. 
Christian Sobrino, the governor’s fiscal oversight board representative, said the government is analyzing the board's budget and “reviewing the mechanisms that will be used to implement public policy measures that the board has sought to impede through the budget.” 
Last year, Rossello sued the board over its imposed budget, arguing the panel exceeded its powers. U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who presides over the island’s bankruptcy process, ruled in August that the board has broad and exclusive authority over Puerto Rico’s budget under the federal PROMESA Act, although it cannot demand changes in law.
Faced with similar differences between the board and the elected government over this year's budget, Jaresko said on Monday that “there’s no reason to go to court” given Swain's ruling.
Meanwhile, the board said it sued certain fuel suppliers of the island’s bankrupt power utility, or PREPA, over the weekend to “recover potentially billions of dollars in fraudulent payments,” related to the delivery of substandard fuel between 2002 and 2015, according to statement."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A former University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California gynecologist accused by hundreds of patients of molestation and other misconduct over the past three decades pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of sexually assaulting 16 students who were under his care.
George Tyndall, 72, was also ordered to remain in custody in lieu of nearly $2.1 million bond, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Theresa Sullivan said she would review a defense request to slash his bail at another hearing set for Wednesday.
Defense lawyer Andrew Flier, citing his client's age and ""serious health concerns,"" including diabetes and a heart condition, denied in court that Tyndall was a flight risk or threat to the public. His medical license has been suspended.
Tyndall was charged last week with 29 felony counts of sexual penetration and sexual battery by fraud in a scandal that has already resulted in a $215 million civil settlement in federal court.
The 16 patients he is criminally charged with assaulting were students who ranged in age from 17 to 29 and were allegedly violated by Tyndall at the downtown Los Angeles university's campus health center between 2009 and 2016.
Flier entered a not guilty plea on Tyndall's behalf during a 20-minute court hearing. If convicted on all charges, Tyndall faces a prison term of up to 53 years.
Allegations against Tyndall and USC's handling of the matter - he was not reported to the state medical board for eight months - generated a furor on campus that led the university's then-president, C.L. Max Nikias, to resign last year.
'NOT SUICIDAL'
The gray-haired doctor entered the courtroom with his hands shackled to his waist and stood silently behind a glass partition during the proceedings, wearing a padded blue garment commonly called a ""suicide suit.""
Flier told reporters afterward that his client was ""not suicidal whatsoever"" but was required by jail officials to wear the outfit ""for his own protection.""
Upon his arrest last Wednesday, Tyndall complained of chest pains and was briefly hospitalized, police said. Flier said his client was returned to custody on Friday after examinations and a battery of tests medically cleared him.
The .38-caliber handgun Tyndall was carrying when arrested was meant for self-defense, his attorney said, adding that Tyndall ""has had a lot of threats.""
Authorities say more than 350 women reported being subjected to molestation, lewd comments and other sexually inappropriate behavior by Tyndall during medical exams by him at USC, long one of America's most prestigious private universities.
Many accusers said they recalled sensing something unprofessional or ""creepy"" about Tyndall at the time, only to fully comprehend in retrospect - after reading media accounts of other complaints - that they had been victimized.
Tyndall insists he is innocent and that he conducted his exams ""by the book,"" always with a ""chaperone"" in the room and always wearing gloves, Flier told reporters.
""As soon as someone makes an inappropriate comment, that does not connote"" criminal behavior, the attorney said. ""The character assassination is overwhelming in this case.""
Flier said he was seeking to lower Tyndall's bail to $500,000, a bond sum he said the doctor could afford.
A federal court earlier this month granted preliminary approval to a $215 million settlement in a class-action civil suit filed on behalf of Tyndall's former patients. Tyndall's lawyers said he agreed to the settlement to avoid further litigation costs.
The USC case follows a similar scandal that roiled USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. Larry Nassar, a former USA Gymnastics team doctor who also was on that university's staff, was sentenced to up to 300 years in prison in two trials last year after more than 350 women testified about abuse at his hands.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>","Exxon quarterly profit to feel pinch of weaker natural gas, chemical earnings","By Shanti S Nair
(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said on Monday lower natural gas and chemical margins in its second quarter would offset improved crude and refining operations, pointing to flat profits sequentially and down from a year-earlier.
The U.S. oil major said in a securities filing it expected improved crude prices to boost second-quarter profit by $400 million to $600 million. However, natural gas (NGc1) prices which have dropped to multi-year lows in the face of tepid demand, were expected to offset it by an equal measure.
RBC Capital Markets analysts in a note said the magnitude of weakness across refining, chemicals and natural gas and the lack of sequential improvement, ""leaves us heading into another disappointing quarter for Exxon's earnings momentum.""
Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones, expects second-quarter upstream earnings to be weaker compared with a year ago. She lowered the brokerage's profit estimates to 88 cents per share from 95 cents previously. That is below Wall Street's mean estimates of 97 cents and the year-ago quarter's 92 cents a share.
""We have to be more patient with their turnaround plan,"" said Rowland.
Exxon said weaker margins in its chemical business is expected to reduce second-quarter profit by $100 million to $300 million over the first quarter. It also estimated a potential gain of $200 million over the first quarter from a lack of impairment charges.
The company is scheduled to release its results on July 26.
Rowland expects refining and marketing to return to profitability due to higher margins while chemicals should continue to post weaker results given lower margins and scheduled maintenance.
In April, the company reported first-quarter profit that slumped 49% to $2.4 billion and missed analysts' estimates due to a weakness across its major businesses.
Exxon shares, which have risen about 12% this year to Friday's close, ended the day off 7 cents a share at $76.56 compared with a 0.1% rise in the S&P 500 Energy index (SPNY) as a result of oil prices that steadied as OPEC extended supply cuts until March 2020 during a meeting in Vienna."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - After an unusual number of explosions, several Brazilian power transmission companies have started removing a piece of equipment made by  General Electric  Co (N:GE), a blow for GE's Brazil unit as it battles competing suppliers from China and India.
Brazil's grid operator ONS recommended replacing GE's CTH-550 transformer model after registering 53 explosions, as Reuters exclusively reported in January. ONS said then that the equipment showed ""a failure rate that is superior to what is expected"" for such a device.
There are close to 700 pieces of that equipment in Brazil's grid, each costing up to 100,000 reais ($26,000). Power transmission companies have already launched tenders to buy replacement transformers while they discuss the costs and a schedule for the changes with GE and regulators.
In a statement to Reuters, GE said it is investigating what caused the equipment failure in Brazil.
""GE Grid Solutions performed a series of checks in the equipment with its clients and, as of this moment, there is no evidence that the problems were caused by the design, components or production processes,"" it said.
Brazil's electrical energy regulator Aneel said that, after conducting a detailed analysis, it has determined the problem is with the manufacturer.
""The transmission companies acquired a product which, according to the reports, has presented a high rate of failure,"" Aneel director Sandoval Feitosa told Reuters.
Taesa (SA:TAEE11), one of Brazil's largest power transmission companies, controlled by regional utility Cemig (SA:CMIG4) and Colombia's ISA (CN:ISA), said it has started replacing all GE model CTH-550 transformers in its networks.
Taesa's CEO Raul Lycurgo Leite said the changes will be completed next year, adding that it will take time due to the buying process and coordinated grid work.
China's State Grid Corp [STGRD.UL], which has expanded strongly in Brazil this decade, has also confirmed plans to make the changes, but did not provide further details.
Other companies such as Furnas and Copel said they have opened tenders to buy new transformers.
These companies are also negotiating with Brazil's electricity regulator Aneel to have some fines suspended. They were fined due to interruption in the flow of power after the explosions and say they are not responsible for the outages."

New York Fed President John Williams is set to participate in a panel discussion at a ""Special High Level Event on the Global Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook"" held by UBS in Zurich, Switzerland.
Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester will deliver a speech on the economic outlook at the European Economics and Financial Centre in London at 6:35 AM ET (10:35 GMT), followed by an audience Q&A.
Auto stocks could also be in focus, with the latest figures for total U.S. auto sales expected at 8:00 AM ET.
The consensus for total unit vehicle sales in June is a 17 million annual rate vs a higher-than-expected rise in May's pace to 17.3 million.
2. Crude Inventories in Spotlight
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data will be closely watched for signs on whether domestic crude inventories will mount a third-consecutive week of declines.
WTI crude settled at $59.09 a barrel, up 1.1%, as OPEC and its allies reportedly agreed to extend production cuts, while a U.S-China trade truce also lifted sentiment.
Russia agreed with Saudi Arabia to extend the current output-cut agreement by six to nine months, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, according to published reports.
“The G20 sideline meetings delivered two positive outcomes: the world's largest two economies resume trade talks and Russian President Putin gave the Saudis the green light to approve cuts by six to nine months,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York.

But the gains were smaller than those seen right after the open. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high, but fell back to a gain of 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%, but saw its high early in the day cut by about 60%.
The Nasdaq Composite added 1.1%, largely because of a rally in big chip stocks. But it, too, fell back a bit as the day wore on.
The catalyst for the rally was the U.S. agreement to resume trade talks made by Trump with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday in Japan and the U.S. president's Sunday meeting with Kim Jong-un at the Demilitarized Zone in Korea.
Semiconductors had a strong day on the China news, especially the news chip makers can sell products to Huawei, the big Chinese telecommunications company. The Philadelphia Semiconductor  index rose 2.4% as the technology sector pushed the overall market higher.
But the cheer created by the announcement faded with reports of manufacturing weakness in the United States and elsewhere.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the Dow's big loser, off 2.1% and subtracting 51 points from the index. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the index's best performer on the day, up 1.8% and adding 25 points to the index. 
Boeing continues to face delays in getting its 737 Max airliner back into service. It now appears a fix won't be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration until September. In addition, news reports suggest investigators are looking into potential manufacturing problems with the 787 Dreamliner.
The IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was up in June -- but barely at a reading of 50.6 -- and up from an earlier cut of the data. It was, the Financial Times noted, the second-lowest reading since September 2009. 
The market reaction to the China and Korea was similar to what happened on the news of Osama Bin Laden's death. Big open, then a slow decline as the day went along.
Meanwhile, 58 S&P 500 stocks hit new highs on the day. Three Dow stocks hit 52-week highs:   American Express   (NYSE:AXP), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Visa I(NYSE:V).
Nine of 103 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 hit new highs, including Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) were the index leaders.
Trading volumes are likely to fall this weekend because of the July 4 holiday when U.S. markets will be closed. Trading is even expected to be light on Friday, despite the Labor Department's release of the June payrolls and unemployment report.
Oil prices moved higher after members of OPEC and the OPEC+ countries agreed to extend output cuts. WTI futures finished up 62 cents to $59.09 a barrel. Brent futures, the global benchmark, added 32 cents to $65.06 a barrel.
Interest rates were higher, with the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield at 2.034%, up from up 2% on Friday.

HONG KONG/TAIPEI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to allow U.S. firms to sell ""high tech"" products to Huawei led Asian investors to snap up shares in suppliers to the Chinese smartphone maker on Monday, even as some experts wondered what had changed.
Huawei was put on a U.S. list in May that restricts U.S. tech firms such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google from doing business with the Chinese telecom network gear maker, viewed as a security risk by Washington amid trade tensions with Beijing.
Trump said on Saturday the ban was unfair to U.S. suppliers, who were upset that they could not sell parts and components to Huawei without U.S. government approval.
However, he did not say which U.S. firms could resume supplying Huawei.
While analysts had doubts about what it meant for the company, shares in Huawei's smartphone suppliers jumped in Asian trading on Monday as investors saw Trump's comments as a positive sign for its smartphone sales.
OLED display panel maker BOE Technology Group (SZ:000725) and Shenzhen Goodix Technology (SS:603160), a maker of fingerprint sensors, climbed 10% to their daily limit.
Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317), the world's top contract electronics assembler, and contract chipmaker TSMC (TW:2330) rose 3% and 4% respectively.
""The White House's apparent U-turn ... is unlikely to give Huawei the products it really needs,"" Richard Windsor, founder of independent research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note.
""And even if it did, it is quite possible that fatal damage has already been done to Huawei's smartphone business,"" he said.
Trump's remarks were taken by some tech bloggers to mean that Google would be able to restore Huawei's access to Play Store and apps.
Arthur Liao, a Taipei-based tech analyst at Fubon Securities, said it was unclear whether U.S. tech firms can deliver components for Huawei's future products or just components for existing lines.
Shares in some other suppliers including Shennan Circuits (SZ:002916), Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ:002475),  Shenzhen Sunway Communication  (SZ:300136), and OFILM Group Co Ltd (SZ:002456) also surged.
LOBBYING EFFORT
After saying for weeks that it has access to enough non-U.S. technology to carry on as usual, Huawei said last month it would take a $30 billion revenue hit.
""We acknowledge the U.S. president's comments relating to Huawei and have no further comments at this time,"" a Huawei spokesman told Reuters on Monday.
Several U.S. companies stopped supplying Huawei in recent weeks, but quietly lobbied the U.S. government to ease the ban, Reuters reported last month.
Memory-chip maker Micron (O:MU) said last week it had resumed some shipments to Huawei, and chip maker Intel (O:INTC) took similar action, according to the New York Times.
Google said last month it would not provide the Android operating system (OS) for Huawei phones after a temporary reprieve from the ban expired in August, but current models could still use the apps.
Windsor said Huawei's access to Google mobile products could remain blocked despite Trump's remarks.
""It is fairly easy to argue that Google Mobile Services is unique and only available from the U.S. and potentially could be considered a security threat depending on what data is going over those services,"" he said.
A Google spokesman in Singapore declined to comment on Monday.
The sanctions also prevent U.S. telecom companies from buying network equipment from Huawei based on national security grounds. Huawei has denied its products pose a security threat.
""National security concerns will remain paramount,"" National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow said on Sunday, adding that Trump's decision to allow expanded sales of U.S. technology supplies to Huawei will leave the most sensitive equipment off limits."

The CFE [COMFEL.UL] said last week it would aim to negotiate a ""fairer"" outcome to contract disputes with several companies through a mediation process overseen by the London Court of International Arbitration.
The infrastructure firms include Mexican companies Fermaca, Grupo Carso and IEnova (MX:IENOVA), a subsidiary of U.S.-based  Sempra Energy  (SRE), as well as Canada's TC Energy Corp (TO:TRP).
The London arbitration court could not immediately be reached for comment.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement on Monday that it was concerned by the move, stressing the importance of legal certainty to secure foreign investment.
""This action risks sending a negative signal to U.S. and other international investors about the business and investment climate in Mexico,"" the group said. ""We therefore urge CFE and the Government of Mexico to reconsider this decision and to observe the president's pledge to honor the sanctity of existing contracts.""
The group did not detail what action it wanted CFE to take.
CFE began talks with pipeline builder Fermaca on Monday as part of a push to negotiate independently with the companies, CFE spokesman Luis Bravo said.
""All the companies have agreed to talk about the contracts. Today we met with Fermaca to determine how to negotiate,"" CFE spokesman Luis Bravo said. The talks will take place in parallel to the process in international arbitration court, he added.
Fermaca could not be reached for comment.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pushed back against criticism of the arbitration request, saying the terms of the agreements were ""abusive"" toward the state.
The U.S. chamber has repeatedly come to Mexico's defense during U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, defending the North American Free Trade Agreement when Trump threatened to kill the deal and urging the United States to exempt Mexico and Canada from steel and aluminum tariffs.
The CFE's pursuit of arbitration has sparked criticism from others in the international community. Canada raised concerns about the dispute, and Moody's said the spat was ""credit-negative"" for the utility, the companies involved and the sector as a whole."

JBS SA, the world's largest meat producer, rose 6% to 22.51 reais in late afternoon trade, while rival BRF SA, the world's biggest chicken exporter, jumped 8% to 31.91 reais. Marfrig Global Foods, which is in talks for a merger with BRF, rose more than 3%.
Under the agreement announced on Friday, the Europeans will lower tariffs on a range of agricultural commodities from the Mercosur trade bloc, including beef, poultry, pork, sugar, cheese and honey, according to terms detailed by the EU on Monday.
The EU has agreed to reduce barriers on 82% of agricultural imports from the Mercosur bloc over a transition period of up to 10 years, Brussels said, adding the EU also offered more partial commitments including quotas for more sensitive farm products.
For beef, Brussels said the agreement would allow EU imports of 99,000 tonnes from Mercosur a year, with a tariff of 7.5%.
The agreement also allows 180,000 tonnes of poultry imports from Mercosur ""duty free,"" along with 25,000 tonnes of pork at a duty of 83 euros per tonne, according to the terms of the deal, which Brussels said would be implemented in phases.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said it could take up to three years for full implementation of the accord, which requires legislative approval from all countries involved.
The EU and Mercosur, which was founded in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, together form a market with 780 million people and a quarter of global gross domestic product, Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said last week.
Brazilian exports to the EU last year totaled some $42 billion, almost a fifth of total exports from the country, according to the ministry."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Monday, but finished off earlier highs, led by gains in technology stocks on optimism for progress in U.S.-China trade talks and signs of a likely reprieve for Chinese telecom company Huawei.
Despite losing some of its initial steam, the S&P 500 still managed to close at a record high after the United States and China agreed on Saturday to resume trade talks. In addition, President Donald Trump also offered concessions including no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], while China agreed to make unspecified new purchases of U.S. farm products.
Still, stocks had given up a good portion of their earlier gains as investors contemplated whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would be as dovish as has been anticipated recently and caution crept back in for what is likely to be a lightly traded week due to the July Fourth holiday.
""There was celebration on the open and it was a case where if some of this trade uncertainty goes away, even if it is not solved, so to speak, that decreases the likelihood the Fed needs to step in, or at least step in as aggressively as people were thinking about a week and a half ago,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
Tech stocks (SPLRCT), Wall Street's top performers so far in 2019, jumped 1.45%, with heavyweight Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) 1.83% gain providing the biggest boost.
Chipmakers with a sizable revenue exposure to China jumped nearly 5% at their session high before also pulling back, last showing a 2.65% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX). Huawei supplier Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) gained 3.9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 117.47 points, or 0.44%, to 26,717.43, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 22.57 points, or 0.77%, to 2,964.33 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 84.92 points, or 1.06%, to 8,091.16.
Stocks saw their steepest sell-off this year in May, a 6.6% decline, after a breakdown in the U.S.-China trade talks sparked concerns of a global economic slowdown.
But hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to preserve a strong run of U.S. economic growth, and a dovish turn by central banks around the globe, helped the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indexes post their best June performance in decades.
Despite the latest development in talks, traders still anticipate the Fed's next move will be a rate cut of at least a quarter of a percentage point at its July 30-31 policy meeting.
Data showed growth in manufacturing cooled in the United States in June while factory activity shrank across much of Europe and Asia, further supporting expectations of a rate cut.
Gains on the Dow were held in check by a 2.1% drop in  Boeing Co  (N:BA) after a report that federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records relating to the production of the 787 Dreamliner in South Carolina.
 Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) jumped 5.9%, the most on the S&P, as gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau rose more than expected in June. Shares of peers Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS) also rose.
 Coty Inc  (N:COTY) tumbled 13.5%, falling the most on the S&P, after the company said it would overhaul its operations and write down about $3 billion in value of its brands acquired from Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG).
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 62 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 122 new highs and 31 new lows.
About 7.04 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.15 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions."

(Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) is in exclusive talks to sell a majority stake in its data analytics unit Kantar to private equity firm Bain Capital, it said on Monday, in a $4 billion deal aimed at steering the world's biggest advertising company back to growth. 
The news puts an end to months of speculation around the heavily-contested auction which drew interest from a broad spectrum of buyout firms that are flush with cash to invest. 
WPP had shortlisted a series of U.S. buyout funds to submit binding bids for a majority stake in Kantar including Apollo and Platinum, Reuters reported in May.
The auction, led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and part of the company's efforts to raise cash, kicked off last year and also drew interest from European private equity houses CVC Capital Partners and Permira.
In a statement on Monday, WPP said Kantar was valued at $4 billion including debt. Bain's proposal was subject to negotiation and it was not certain the talks would result in a deal, the company said.
Shares of WPP closed up 2.2% at 1,012 pence on Monday after media reports reported earlier in the day that Bain emerged as the leading bidder.
Bain's interest in Kantar is the latest private equity deal to emerge in recent weeks. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Lego's founding family on Friday took Merlin Entertainments (L:MERL) private in a $7.5 billion deal, in one of the biggest private equity deals in Europe in recent years.
Nestle (S:NESN) also said in May it was in exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.33 billion).
WEIGHED DOWN
Kantar's underlying sales fell 2% last year to 2.6 billion pounds with operating profit down 14% to 301 million pounds.
The business generates about 15% of WPP's overall sales and provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world's largest advertisers. 
It has traditionally weighed on WPP's overall organic growth rates - a key measurement for the industry.
Analysts say Kantar risks losing market share to more tech-savvy peers, while its business model is challenged by consumer goods companies developing their own data teams, rather than relying on surveys undertaken by external firms.
First-quarter results in April showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018.
DIGITAL FOCUS
WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and turmoil linked to founder Martin Sorrell's abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied.
With technology transforming the way advertising is made, placed and sold, clients want WPP to better integrate its agencies so it can produce faster offerings across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost.
WPP's Mark Read, who took the helm of the 12-billion pound advertising giant last year, has pledged to spend 300 million pounds restructuring the group to bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021.
Read, a soft-spoken executive who worked alongside Sorrell for decades, set out a plan in December to hire more creative staff, including around 1,000 new jobs to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies, in a bid to return the company to growth.

Last week, Boeing said that it would take until at least September to solve 737 MAX software issues - later than airlines had been expecting - after U.S. aviation regulators uncovered a new problem during simulator sessions.
""I'm sure this will cause us to have to take the MAX out of the schedule beyond Oct. 1,"" Kelly said in an internal update, adding that the company would also see ""what other modifications we might need to make our plans for this year because it's obviously extending well beyond what I had hoped.""
Kelly did not elaborate on the possible modifications. So far, the Texas-based airline has tried to substitute its MAX routes with spare aircraft but has still been forced to cancel about 115 daily flights. 
 American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (O:UAL), the other two U.S. carriers that operate the 737 MAX, have removed the jetliner from their flying schedules until early September.
The three airlines are expected to provide more details on the financial toll of a prolonged MAX grounding during second quarter results later in July.

Boeing's fast-selling narrowbody was grounded worldwide in March following two deadly crashes within five months.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 03:51PM ET</span>","Hedge fund chief Daniel Loeb opposes United Technologies, Raytheon merger","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb said on Friday that his hedge fund Third Point LLC will vote against the planned merger of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), saying there is no ""strategic rationale for this transaction.""
""We have concluded that the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,"" Loeb wrote in a letter to the board of directors of United Technologies
On June 10, the industrial conglomerate and military contractor announced a $120 billion merger, a deal that would intensify the pace of consolidation in the aerospace and defense industry and is expected to be completed in the first half of next year.
In his letter, Loeb criticized United Technologies management for turning its back on previous plans to break the company into three businesses - aerospace, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners - and accused United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes of engineering the merger to secure his employment.
United Technologies said it does not agree with Loeb's conclusions, adding that its board remains confident that the merger will create a premier systems provider. Other shareholders ""agree with us as to the desirability of the merger,"" the company said.
Loeb, a forceful supporter of United Technologies' plan to break into three businesses, called the planned merger a ""baffling change in UTC’s strategy.""
Loeb is now the second powerful Wall Street investor to oppose the deal after rival hedge fund manager William Ackman wrote to United Technologies to complain even before the deal was publicly announced.
Neither Loeb nor Ackman, whose firms each own less than 1 percent of the company, could single-handedly derail the deal and each has said there are other investors who share their concerns.
Both men accused Hayes of trying to extend his reach, with Loeb writing on Friday that a ""sweetheart employment agreement"" for Hayes would ""entrench him for another half a decade ultimately as both CEO and Chairman of the Board!""
Bloomberg first reported that Loeb sent the letter to United Technologies.
United Technologies' deal with Raytheon faces regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Defense Department and big customers like  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) will have a lot of clout in the antitrust review, and may worry about over-reliance on one company for a big suite of products."
1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 03:51PM ET</span>",Why U.S. small caps may lag despite U.S.-China trade truce,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A truce in the trade war between the United States and China that pushed large-cap stocks to new record highs Monday does not appear to be enough to buoy the shares of small U.S. companies that are struggling under the weight of higher tariff costs.
Lower margins and less pricing power are preventing small companies from either passing on or weathering the effects of higher trade tariffs to the same degree as large caps, effectively putting a ceiling on their growth prospects, fund managers and analysts say.
That is souring investors on their shares and leaving small-caps underperforming in a steep reversal from last year, when many investors jumped into small companies in the expectation that they would be insulated from the trade wars because of their focus on the domestic market.
For the year to date, the benchmark Russell 2000 index of small companies is up nearly 17%, yet remains more than 8% below the record highs it reached in August 2018. The large-cap S&P 500, by comparison, hit record highs Monday as part of its nearly 18.5% rally this year.   
“I would not be overweight in small caps right now because the risks are too high relative to large caps,” said Barry James, a portfolio manager at James Advantage Funds whose James Micro Cap fund is one of the top-performing small-cap funds for the year to date. ""That's eventually going to change and they could have a spectacular run, but this year at least the index overall is not attractive from a risk standpoint.""
The Russell 2000 index is dominated by financial and healthcare, two sectors that face the risk of compressed margins from lower interest rates and increased governmental regulation if Republicans lose either the presidency or the Senate in the 2020 elections, James said.
As a result, James is focusing on companies like recreational products maker Johnson Outdoors Inc and electric wire maker Encore Wire Corp that have above-average growth prospects, he said.
The United States and China agreed on Saturday to resume trade negotiations after U.S. President Donald Trump offered concessions to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when the two met at the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan.
Those included no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. China agreed to make unspecified new purchases of U.S. farm products and return to the negotiating table.
Dan Mahr, a portfolio manager of the Federated MDT All Cap Core fund, said that his fund remains underweight small caps in favor of larger companies like MasterCard Inc and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) that are benefiting more from market momentum.
""Investor sentiment is much higher as you go up the cap-scale,"" he said.
WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMY
A weak global economy is also weighing disproportionately on small-cap stocks, which are saddled with rising international revenues and feel a greater hit from trade tariffs than large caps, said Venu Krishna, deputy head of U.S. equity research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""The core issue is that global growth is slowing and while the trade war concerns ebb and flow there's a general sense that they are here for longer,"" he said. ""We don't see a catalyst that will push small-caps higher.""
Barclay's now estimates that small-caps will post EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) growth of 2% this year, down from its estimate of 5.5% growth earlier this year, Krishna said.
Those economic concerns are pushing investors to pile into companies that seem to be flawless and punish those that might miss analyst estimates or have additional leverage on their balance sheets, said Randy Gwirtzman, a portfolio manager of the Baron Discovery fund.
""If it's not perfect, it's not working right now,"" he said.
As a result, Gwirtzman has been moving into biotech companies Revance Therapeutics Inc and Esperion Therapeutics Inc that have been hurt by investor skittishness over the healthcare sector. At the same time, he has been adding to his position in cyber security company ForeScout Technologies Inc, whose shares tumbled in May after its guidance fell short of Wall Street expectations.
""There are many quality companies that for whatever reason people are just scared of,"" Gwirtzman said. ""People are running to things that have no problems in them and paying a lot, and we'd rather get things with manageable problems at much lower multiples."""

1255,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>","Turkey Stockpiles Crucial Weapons Parts, Anticipating U.S. Sanctions","(Bloomberg) -- Turkey, girding for the worst despite encouraging messages from President Donald Trump, has stockpiled crucial spare parts for American-made weapons in case Congress sanctions it over a contentious Russian missile purchase.
It’s unclear when the stockpiling decision was first taken, but Turkish officials say the preparations were made in anticipation of possible U.S. embargoes. The U.S. has been threatening sanctions against Turkey since 2018, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan decided to buy the Russian S-400 missile-defense system, a competitor to American-made Patriots.
Still haunted by a crippling U.S. arms embargo half a century ago, Turkey’s military has been amassing parts for F-16 jets and other military hardware, according to two Turkish officials familiar with their country’s defense strategy. Relations between the two countries deteriorated over the course of the Syrian civil war, when the U.S. armed a Kurdish militia that Turkey views as a terrorist group, and in the aftermath of a 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan that his government blames on a Turkish imam residing in the U.S.
NATO member Turkey is determined to acquire ballistic missile technology, and aims to co-produce the next generation of the S-400, the officials added, citing discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Erdogan said his country will take delivery of the S-400 air defense system within days.
“The first batch of S-400s will be delivered in a week or 10 days,” Haberturk newspaper cited him as saying in a report Monday. “I’ve clearly told this to Trump, Mr. Putin also said it.”
The U.S. argues that the pivot to Moscow could allow Russia to collect critical intelligence that would weaken NATO and compromise the American F-35 stealth fighter, which Turkish companies are helping to build. Yet while Congress is drawing up potential sanctions plans that at their harshest would cripple the Turkish economy, Trump has cast Turkey as a victim in the saga.
At their meeting at the Group of 20 nations in Japan on Saturday, the U.S. president said Erdogan was treated unfairly by the Obama administration when he sought to buy an American missile-defense system. While the S-400 deal is “a problem,” the U.S. is “looking at different solutions,” he said.
The optics of Trump’s support for Turkey were undercut by a later White House statement that he had “expressed concern” about the Russian missile deal.
Erdogan Says He Never Got Sense From Trump of Looming Sanctions
Turkey turned to Russia to address weaknesses in its air defense after failing to persuade the U.S. to share technology from its Patriot air-defense system as part of any acquisition deal. A missile deal with Moscow was announced in July 2017, and to try to head it off, the State Department last year approved a possible $3.5 billion Patriot sale to Turkey.
Turkey isn’t convinced a Patriot deal would go through, due to doubts about opposition in Congress, and it won’t leave its air space vulnerable to penetration any longer, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.
U.S. sanctions would degrade the alliance between the countries, and while Turkey would retaliate, it would leave the door open for resolving differences, they added. Last summer, Washington penalized Ankara over the jailing of an American pastor, compounding an already challenging economic outlook. The Turkish lira lost about a quarter of its value, inflation and joblessness soared, and the economy entered its first technical recession in a decade.
Still Haunted
The officials declined to say which spare parts have been accumulated, where they were bought, or how long the inventory could last. The accumulation of parts is meant to signal that Ankara is better prepared to withstand American sanctions than it was when the U.S. imposed a four-year arms embargo over the Turkish military’s seizure of northern Cyprus in 1974, they said.
Distrust of U.S. Propels Turkey’s Russian Missile Purchase
A resolution submitted to the House of Representatives seeking sanctions against Turkey may hold a clue to the focus of Turkey’s parts-buying spree.
“In addition to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Turkish defense acquisition programs that could be affected by sanctions include the Patriot air and missile defense system, CH-47F Chinook heavy lift helicopter, UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft,” the resolution says.
The U.S. has threatened to end Turkey’s participation in the F-35 fighter program by July 31 if Ankara doesn’t scrap the S-400 deal. Turkey could separately face sanctions under two pieces of legislation that allow punishment of entities doing business with parts of the Russian state. Major Turkish defense contractors could be cut off from the U.S. financial system and virtually barred from buying American components or selling their products in the U.S.
New U.S. Defense Chief Renews Warning to Turkey on Russia S-400
If Turkey is excluded from the F-35 program, it will look for alternatives, including Russian jets, while trying to develop its own warplanes and ballistic missiles for domestic use and export, the Turkish officials said.
Why Russian Missiles Divide Turkey and the U.S.: QuickTake
Turkey regards standalone Russian S-400 missiles as superior to Patriots and capable of protecting the Turkish capital and the commercial hub of Istanbul, the officials said. Their presence would alleviate concerns over the security of Turkish straits linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, they added."

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) were set to end the day higher.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was up 2.3% Monday afternoon after rising nearly 5% soon after the open. Just about all of the components in the index were higher, except Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which was flat to lower.
Top performers in the index were Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Inphi Corporation (NYSE:IPHI), both up more than 5%. 
Traders had feared that escalating trade tensions would weigh on economic growth in China, one of the world’s biggest spenders on chip equipment.
President Donald Trump also pledged to ease restrictions on Huawei, a key customer for some of the largest U.S. companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).

In June, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) blamed a disappointing quarter on slowing demand, particularly in China, where its largest clients like Huawei have suffered from U.S. export restrictions. Broadcom shares were up more than 3%.
“We believe the truce sets up improving visibility, a rebound in orders and upside to depressed expectations for the Huawei-exposed semi suppliers in (the second half of 2019),” Mizuho Securities said.
Semiconductor investors will have to wait for “a more permanent resolution to the trade tariffs and more confidence in the supply chain,” which would drive the sector higher in 2020.
Trade friction aside, however, the industry has also suffered from lower demand for smartphones, denting the growth of component suppliers.

Smartphone vendors shipped a total of 310.8 million smartphones worldwide in first quarter of the year, down 6.6% from the 332.7 million units in 2018, according to market-research firm IDC.
Huawei has ""downgraded its forecast for total smartphone shipments in the second half of 2019 by about 20% to 30% from the previous estimate,"" according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review that cited ""a source familiar with Huawei smartphone orders.""

Smartphone vendors shipped a total of 310.8 million smartphones worldwide in Q1 2019, down 6.6% from the 332.7 million units in Q1 2018, according to market-research firm IDC.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",Natixis to face trial on sub-prime exposure statement from 2007,"PARIS (Reuters) - French investment bank  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) said on Monday it had been ordered to stand trial over a statement the bank issued in 2007 on its sub-prime exposures.
A magistrate opened a formal investigation in 2017 over two statements Natixis released respectively in July and November 2007 over its exposure to the subprime crisis that was shaking world markets at the time.
Natixis said that following the investigation, the magistrate ordered the trial for the statement released in November 2007. There is no date yet for the trial.
The bank said the sub-prime crisis was unprecedented so that the bank had no way of anticipating the chain reaction of consequences it unleashed.
""Natixis considers it has provided the public, in all sincerity, all the information available on its exposure gradually as it was identifying the underlying risks,"" the bank said in its statement on Monday.
Natixis was one of the French banks hardest by the crisis in 2007 when the collapse of bonds backed by poor quality mortgages -- dubbed sub-prime -- spread through financial markets. Natixis eventually had to be rescued by its parent bank BPCE.
In 2010, French stock market watchdog AMF had looked into whether Natixis had misled investors about its financial situation during the 2007 sub-prime crisis and decided not to bring any charge."

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 01:06PM ET</span>",Behind the plunge in China auto sales: chaotic implementation of new emission rules,"By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Shanghai-based Buick dealer Ron Li in late April found himself in an unfamiliar quandary: how to sell off almost 80 sedans and sport-utility vehicles crowding up his dealership lot.
The crux of the problem: a June 30 deadline for cars built to so-called China-5 emissions standards to be sold. After that only vehicles meeting new standards could be put up for sale.
People were still coming in but weren't buying the stage-5 cars, Li said.
""Customers didn't know how long they could drive China-5 cars or whether they would be able to resell them in the future. And to be honest, we didn't know either.""
To cope, his dealership in May slashed stage-5 vehicle prices by as much as 30%, participating in what dealers and industry executives have called unprecedented widespread discounting as China's auto sales headed for their worst ever monthly drop.
Encouraged by a central government eager to combat smog, Shanghai is one of 15 cities and provinces to implement new stage-6 standards ahead of the original July 1, 2020 deadline.
Checks by Reuters with employees at about 20 dealerships in Shanghai, Beijing and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which have also brought forward the implementation of new standards, found that stage-5 cars had been a tough sell.
Some offered discounts of more than $2,000 when compared to the same model that meets stage-6 standards. One Peugeot dealership in Shanghai even went so far as to offer a free 301 compact car for customers who bought a 5008 SUV.
While a slowing economy and the trade war with the United States were initially held responsible for slides in sales since April, most of the blame is now being laid on the poorly managed fast-tracking of new rules by the 15 cities and provinces, which account for more than 60% of sales in the world's largest auto market.
The sales crisis, which saw May sales plunge 16% from a year earlier, is prompting downward revisions to forecasts for China's 2019 auto sales that most analysts had thought would be flat or show mild growth.
Now, most expectations are for an annual decline in sales of around 5%, which would follow a 2.8% decline in 2018 when sales contracted for the first time since the 1990s. But Yale Zhang, an analyst at Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight, believes the fall could be closer to 10%.
""Those unsold China-5 vehicles in key areas will be sold to other regions and sales in those areas will be hit as well,"" he said.
SCOURGE OF SMOG
In China, smog has become a major source of public discontent and Beijing declared a ""war on pollution"" five years ago, seeking to mitigate the environmental damage done during four decades of breakneck economic growth.
To that end, it has aggressively pursued the adoption of the electric cars and its stage-6 emission standards are regarded as the most stringent in the world.
The central government ramped up its anti-pollution drive last year, urging local authorities to implement stage-6 standards ahead of time. The southern province of Hainan was the first to jump on the bandwagon, saying it was thinking of doing so as early as November 2018.
This set off a round of announcements from other provinces and cities which began bringing their implementation dates forward - though the timing varied from January to March to July. Some, including Hainan, later postponed after local dealers complained they wouldn't be able to sell off inventories.
Confusion ensued and it was not until last month that authorities clarified that buyers of stage-5 cars would be able to resell them.
Dealers will also need to bear the cost of shipping unsold stage-5 cars to other cities and provinces where implementation comes later, while automakers have had to contend with headaches related to rolling out stage-6 models to market in time.
""Why can't companies be allowed to arrange production and new product rollouts according to the rules?"" Shi Jianhua, a senior official at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, told a news conference in June.
""The implementation date of China-6 rules was fixed, so why has it been accelerated in a way that doesn't give companies sufficient time?"" he added in rare criticism of government moves.
While carmakers do not necessarily have to make fundamental changes to engine technology to meet the new standards, they have to add catalysts and come up with better filtering systems that trap exhaust gases and particulate matter. In some cases, such changes might take a few years to design and execute, engineers told Reuters.
The problem is ""the cost and the amount of time it takes to design specific components into the design of a given engine,"" said a China-based engineer at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The process to gain regulatory approval for car models can take six months to a year and vehicle testing agencies such as the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) do not have enough labs to meet the sudden surge in demand, multiple industry sources said.
CATARC did not respond to a request to comment.
That's meant carmakers have produced fewer stage-6 compliant vehicles than hoped for.
Just 21% of cars sold in May met stage-6 standards but this has to rise to 50% if supply is to meet demand, Jefferies said in a research note last month.
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), the biggest foreign brand in China, said in an emailed statement all its existing model lines will meet stage-6 standards in key regions from July 1.
""Currently, we have a reasonable stock of China-5 vehicles and are reducing this, for example by reallocating the models nationwide,"" it added.
A Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co representative said almost all of its line-up was stage-6 compliant. GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A representative for Geely [GEELY.UL] said all of its gasoline models met stage-6 standards, while a spokesman for Toyota Motor Corp said the Japanese automaker had the technical reserve to meet the new standards and the switch to stage-6 rules would not have a big impact.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd is widely regarded within the industry as the most prepared international car manufacturer, having stated that as of February 90% of its China car manufacturing met stage-6 standards.
By contrast, local carmakers such as GAC and Great Wall Motor Co Ltd still had models waiting to be verified in June, according to the government's Vehicle Emission Control Center.
For some customers, however, the confusion surrounding the switch to new emissions standards was a win for them.
""I know cars well. These China-5 vehicles are technologically advanced enough. Why shouldn't I buy a new car with big discounts?"" said Jiang Lingfeng as he checked out a stage-5 Regal sedan at the Buick showroom in Shanghai."

LONDON (Reuters) - After possibly the best first-half of a year ever for world markets, investors now find themselves hoping for a familiar fallback to keep the party going: central banks wading in with more stimulus.
Some are even betting the recent wave of pessimism about the global economic outlook is misplaced, despite the possibility of a swift end to the newly agreed U.S.-China trade truce and bond markets flashing recession warnings.
Few are optimistic enough to expect as stellar a run for markets as in the first six months of 2019, when global equities soared 15%, U.S. government bonds returned 7% and commodity prices climbed as central banks promised more stimulus.
(Graphic: Global markets in H1 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FEK8yw)
And risks abound, not least from trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies and elevated share and bond valuations, which may tempt investors to sell and book profits.
Potential hazards litter the horizon, including Federal Reserve policy meetings on July 30-31 and September 17-18 and Britain's next date to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. Mario Draghi's eight-year term as European Central Bank chief ends the same day; his successor may oversee the reintroduction of quantitative easing before year-end.
But investors' addiction to central bank largesse has many believing that the end of a decade-long bull run -- and the longest economic expansion on record -- will be postponed.
""It's almost like bad news becomes good news,"" said Jim Leaviss, a fixed income fund manager at M&G, predicting that weak economic data would spur central banks into launching a new round of monetary easing, as they have already signaled.
Markets' dependency on central bank stimulus has created a disconnect in asset pricing that has dominated 2019.
While government bond yields in Germany and the United States have plummeted -- which many investors say is a clear sign of nervousness about the outlook -- equity markets have soared back towards record levels.
""One of the key themes we've focused on is that there is misplaced macro pessimism,"" said Joseph Little, chief strategist at HSBC Global Asset Management.     
    ""So if you get anything reasonably constructive in terms of economic news, politics, corporate profits, or the news is not as bad as the market discounts, then there is scope for a number of risky assets to perform well in the second half of the year.""
CAUTIOUS MOOD
While equities are retesting 2019 highs, investors have entered the second half of the year in a cautious mood as data points to slowing growth momentum across the world.
Demand for government debt is predicted to remain high -- Goldman Sachs said their downside risk scenario for the 10-year German Bund (DE10YT=RR), the go-to safe-haven European government bond, is to yield around -0.5%. It hit a record -0.34% low last week.
Gold too recently surged to a six-year high as investors sought hedges against a weakening dollar (DXY) and falling U.S. interest rate expectations.
But investors are hardly panicking. Yields on junk-rated company debt, usually shunned during troubled times, are near their lowest in over a year, down some 2 percentage points since January .
In a world where an estimated $13 trillion of fixed income assets carry sub-0% yields, money managers are likely to continue diversifying into lower-rated -- riskier -- securities.
What's more, rock-bottom volatility -- swings in prices -- favors seeking ""carry"", a strategy where investors sell lower-yield assets to buy higher-yielding securities.
""The question (for credit investors) is are we going to see a significant increase in (company) default risks?"" said Eric Brard, head of fixed income at Amundi Asset Management.
""We are in a period of slowing growth but we don't expect a recession,"" he told Reuters, noting yield premiums on investment-grade corporate debt were still 40 to 50 basis points away from their tightest levels over underlying benchmarks.
PUT TO THE TEST
The disconnect between buoyant equities and nervous bonds may be explainable if fixed income investors are simply adjusting to lower ""neutral"" policy rates in the world's big economies, rather than anticipating a major downturn.
Barclays analysts believe just that, meaning the ""stock market move is more consistent with the bond rally"".
Others are less sure. Colin Harte, head of research for BNP Paribas Asset Management's multi-asset solutions team, predicts investor faith in central banks will be tested later this year.
He believes markets' current disposition is sustainable only if ""Goldilocks"" conditions, of economic growth without much inflation, remain in place.
The risk is that markets are underplaying the trade war impact and not yet pricing in how a broader retrenchment from the ""high point"" of globalization will impact the world economy.
""If that is the case, monetary policy won't work,"" he said. ""Markets may be quite disappointed."""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. financial services provider Fidelity National Information Services Inc (FIS) (N:FIS) is set to gain unconditional antitrust approval from the European Union for its $35 billion bid for payments company Worldpay (N:WP), people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The deal, announced in March, is the biggest in the fast-growing electronics payments industry which has seen a wave of consolidation recently.
FIS produces software for banks and asset managers as well as its financial services outsourcing business. Worldpay, spun off from Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) in 2010, is a major player in card payments.
Global payments could top $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people switch from cash to digital payments for online and in-store sales, according to consulting firm McKinsey.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by July 5, declined to comment. FIS and Worldpay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FIS and Worldpay shares extended gains following the Reuters report. By 1445 GMT, FIS shares were up 2.5% and Worldpay up 3.9%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global share listings hit their lowest level in three years in the first half of the year, with a slowdown in Europe counteracting a stronger U.S. showing where tech giants Uber and Pinterest made their debuts.
Proceeds from global listings fell 31% to $62.8 billion in the year to date, compared to $90.5 billion in the same period a year ago, mostly dragged down by a seven-year low in Europe, Refinitiv data shows.
Just $10.1 billion was raised from European IPOs, a 57% slide compared from a year earlier, while proceeds from U.S.-listed IPOs rose by 4.3% to $29.8 billion, as investors poured money into companies that use technology to disrupt traditional industries.
(Graphic: Shaky year for European IPOs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Yk8Prg)
Among the most anticipated share offerings of the year were Silicon Valley's ride hailing apps Uber Technologies (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) and image sharing website Pinterest (N:PINS).
At $79 billion market capitalization, Uber was the biggest of a group of tech startups that have spent years raising money in private rounds at record prices before listing.
""Investors continue to see significant fund flows into the tech sector as they consider it more resilient and less exposed to the economic cycle,"" said Sam Losada, Head of EMEA Equity Capital Markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
""Most recent tech IPOs show how much investor appetite there is for disruptive equity stories which play into digital transformation trends,"" Losada added.
MIXED APPETITE
While Uber was the biggest, Beyond Meat (O:BYND), a maker of plant-based burgers and sausages, was the most successful. Its shares climbed more than 160 percent on its May 2 market launch.
In contrast in London rail ticketing app Trainline (L:TRNT), which went public on June 21, was the one bright spot among generally lackluster performances. Its shares are more than 6% above the IPO price of 400 pence.
Political uncertainty around Britain's departure from the European Union and a slowdown in the euro zone economy have created market turbulence in the first half, discouraging investment flows.
Fintech was Europe's most prolific sector, with a series of payment processing companies, including Italian private equity-owned Nexi (MI:NEXII) and Middle Eastern-focused Network International (L:NETW) going public.
Despite an improvement in proceeds from European listings in the second quarter, recently-listed companies including  Finablr  (L:FINF), Watches of Switzerland (L:WOSG) and telecoms operator Airtel Africa still trade below their flotation price.
Finablr and Airtel slashed the IPO price to the bottom of their targeted range. Airtel shares fell as much as 15% in a dismal debut last Friday. [L8N23Z1HT]
Adam Farlow, Head of EMEA Capital Markets at law firm Baker McKenzie, expects ""a more conservative pricing, particularly among larger listings"" in the second half of the year, as issuers become more concerned that a stock underperformance might negatively impact the valuation of companies.
""Stagnant share prices do create a vicious circle and impact future investment decisions of the buyside,"" Farlow said."

The soda maker was in arbitration with Monster Beverage over the launch of Coca-Cola Energy, as it would put the company in direct competition with Monster and violate their initial agreement in 2015. 
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola launched the drink as a part of its efforts to break away from its traditional fizzy sodas and shift to health-focused trends.
Coca-Cola Energy, first launched in Spain and Hungary in April, has caffeine from naturally derived sources, guarana extracts, B vitamins and no taurine - a stimulant often found in energy drinks.
According to the ruling, the beverage maker can continue to sell and distribute Coca-Cola Energy, including in markets where it has already been launched, and is free to launch the product in new markets globally.
Coca-Cola said it would continue its partnership with Monster, in which it holds a stake of nearly 19%.

Shares of Monster fell 3% before the opening bell, while Coca-Cola's shares rose marginally.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A skirmish over stock market access between Switzerland and the European Union risks escalating into a broader political battle over sovereignty that could do lasting damage to relations.
After months of tensions, the bourse row came to a head on Monday when Brussels refused to extend recognition of Swiss market regulation, effectively banning EU-based banks and brokers from trading on Swiss exchanges.
The step punished Bern for failing to endorse a treaty negotiated over 4-1/2 years that would have non-EU member Switzerland routinely adopt changes to EU single market rules and provide a more effective way to settle disputes.
Switzerland retaliated by banning trading in Swiss stocks on EU exchanges, which normally generate around 30% of the volume in Zurich-listed shares.
The EU's powerplay could stiffen Swiss resistance to signing the draft treaty, which has raised concerns across the political spectrum about infringement of Swiss sovereignty.
Both sides say they remain open to talks, but no quick deal is in sight with Switzerland's biggest trading partner.
Swiss parliamentary elections on Oct. 20 complicate matters, and with Brexit also looming on Oct. 31 Brussels is loathe to be soft on the Swiss for fear of encouraging British hopes for favorable divorce terms.
Gerhard Pfister, leader of the centrist Christian Democrats in the four-party Swiss coalition government, told the Blick newspaper at the weekend that several roadblocks remained.
""The blockade will be lifted in a year at the earliest,"" he predicted, citing questions over the role of EU courts in deciding on Swiss rules to protect wages and on whether EU citizens in Switzerland get the same rights as at home.
Swiss labor unions and their Socialist allies in government have been dead set against watering down labor rules, which protect Europe's highest wages against cut-rate German plumbers, French electricians or Italian roofers on short-term jobs.
Winning labor over for a deal remains a main hurdle before European Commission President and self-declared Swiss ally Jean-Claude Juncker's term is set to end on Oct. 31.
Anti-Swiss sentiment is on the rise in the EU, as well, over perceived Swiss foot-dragging.
EU members in central and eastern Europe are upset that, amid the stock market row, the Swiss parliament has held up a 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.3 billion) ""cohesion payment"" to reduce economic and social disparities in the bloc and seen as the price of Swiss admission to the single market.
With politicians about to head into summer breaks, efforts to revive talks may have to wait until September."

(Reuters) - U.S. chip gear maker Applied Materials Inc (O:AMAT) on Monday agreed to buy Japan's Kokusai Electric for $2.2 billion in cash from investment firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), as it bets on rising demand for memory chips.
While a decline in demand from smartphone makers has hurt memory chip prices, analysts expect the market to rebound as data center customers ramp up operations, coupled with higher demand for chips used in artificial intelligence-based devices and 5G phones.
Shares of the world's biggest maker of chipmaking equipment were up 3.3% at $46.40 in trading before the bell.
The deal comes less than two years after KKR took control of Hitachi Kokusai in a $2.2 billion deal. The Financial Times had reported in February that the private equity firm was in talks with two Chinese buyers for the ""full or partial"" sale of the company.
Kokusai, which counts Samsung (KS:005930), SK Hynix (KS:000660), Toshiba (T:6502) and Micron (O:MU) among its top customers, reported revenue of $1.24 billion as of March 2018.
""AMAT needs to acquire a $1B+ revenue business to make a difference to its revenue and earnings, so this makes sense,"" Cowen and Co analysts wrote in a client note.
The deal would push the U.S. company's share of the chipmaking equipment market to above 20% from 18%, according to the Nikkei, which had earlier reported on the deal.
Applied Materials last month forecast third-quarter profit and revenue above estimates after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.
It expects to use a combination of cash and debt to fund the deal, which is expected to close within a year and immediately add to its adjusted earnings per share.

Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC served as exclusive financial adviser, and Hogan Lovells and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP served as legal counsel for Applied Materials.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose sharply on Monday, with chipmakers making handsome gains, as trade tensions between the United States and China eased after both sides agreed to restart talks.
Futures jumped more than 1% when trading resumed on Sunday, with the S&P 500 e-minis  and the Dow e-minis <1YMcv1> hitting record highs early Monday as investors returned to riskier assets following the truce. 
U.S. President Donald Trump offered concessions including no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in order to reduce tensions with Beijing.
Twenty-seven of the 28 Dow components trading before the bell were higher, with chipmakers that have a sizable revenue exposure to China climbing. 
 Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) and Micron Technology Inc (O:MU) gained between 3% and 4.6%. 
Stocks saw their steepest sell-off this year in May after an escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute sparked concerns of a global economic slowdown. 
However, expectations of a more accommodative Federal Reserve helped the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow Industrials index (DJI) post their best June performance in generations. 
As financial markets cheered the latest development in trade talks, traders scaled back on the probability of a half-point rate cut this month to around 15%, from nearer 50% a week ago. 
At 7:23 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis <1YMcv1> were up 251 points, or 0.94%. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 31.75 points, or 1.08% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 130.75 points, or 1.7%. 
A rise in oil prices also lifted sentiment. OPEC and its allies looked on track to extend supply cuts until at least the end of 2019 at their meeting in Vienna this week. [O/R]
Among other stocks, shares of MGM Resorts International (N:MGM),  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS) climbed between 1% and 5% after gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau rose more than expected in June.

The platitudes and chummy photo-ops. The billions of dollars in U.S. arms sales. And, of course, the willingness to brush aside evidence implicating the crown prince in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
But what’s gone largely unnoticed is just how enthusiastic the kingdom has been in snapping up America’s debt.
After aggressively culling its holdings of U.S. government debt for most of 2016, Saudi Arabia has amassed an even larger position since Trump’s election in November that year. Based on the latest reported figures, the nation nearly doubled its ownership of Treasuries to $177 billion. No major foreign creditor has ramped up its lending to the U.S. faster.
Coincidence? Perhaps. After all, you could probably marshal any number of plausible explanations for the timing of the oil-exporting nation’s buildup that don't involve some political quid pro quo. Rising petrodollar revenue. Risk aversion. A shift out of negative-yielding bonds. And considering how big the U.S. deficit has grown because of Trump’s tax cuts, the amounts involved won’t move the needle all that much when it comes to America’s financing needs.
Whatever the case may be, however, this much is clear: as Trump continues to defend Prince Mohammed in the face of growing criticism on a whole host of issues, from the Saudi-led war in Yemen to his alleged role in the gruesome killing of Khashoggi, the kingdom has everything to gain from appearing to lend financial support to its most important ally — even if it isn’t intentional. That's particularly true after talk surfaced in May that China, the largest foreign creditor to the U.S., might be considering the unlikely move of dumping its Treasuries to punish Trump over his trade war. (Though at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, the two countries declared a truce, at least for now.)
“It’s a relationship where one hand washes the other,” said Martin Indyk, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S. special envoy to the Middle East during the Clinton administration. Buying of Treasuries could be a “manifestation of the closeness of the relationship.”
Indyk was quick to note he doesn’t have any particular inside knowledge on the situation and the Treasury market is a natural destination for Saudi Arabia’s petrodollars anyway. But he suggested that as tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalate, it also makes sense Trump would want the Saudis to boost production to keep oil prices in check. More output means more petrodollars, which can then be recycled back into Treasuries.
The numbers stand out. From the end of October 2016, the last month before Trump’s election, through April of this year, Saudi Arabia upped its ownership of Treasuries from $97 billion to $177 billion, Treasury Department data show. The 83% jump was by far the biggest among the top 12 foreign creditors in percentage terms. (The U.K., a banking center whose figures are seen as a proxy for hedge funds and other global investors, had the biggest absolute gain. Its holdings rose from $207 billion to $301 billion.)
The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, which manages the country’s investments, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The buildup is also noteworthy because of just how dramatically Saudi Arabia reduced its holdings in the months leading up to the election. In the first nine months of 2016, the kingdom slashed its ownership of Treasuries by almost 30% in its most aggressive retreat in over a decade.
A big part of the drawdown had to do with Saudi Arabia’s fiscal crisis at the time, when the monetary authority burned through tens of billions of dollars to plug its biggest budget deficit in a quarter-century. Yet there was also plenty of speculation about Saudi Arabia’s political motivations as well.
In April of that year, the New York Times reported that Saudi officials warned the Obama administration and members of Congress it would sell off $750 billion worth of Treasuries and other American assets if lawmakers passed a bill allowing the kingdom to be held liable in U.S. courts for the Sept. 11 terror attacks. (It ultimately became law after Congress overrode President Barack Obama’s veto.) That came after America took tentative steps toward a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia’s archrival Iran, highlighted by the landmark nuclear deal under Obama that Trump pulled out of last year.
So with Trump, the kingdom has every incentive to play nice.
Besides breaking with tradition to visit Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip, Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, have forged close, personal relationships with the crown prince, who’s known as MBS. At the G-20, Trump met the kingdom’s de facto leader for breakfast on Saturday, calling him a “friend” and praising their “great relationship.”
Crucially, Trump has repeatedly downplayed Prince Mohammed’s role in Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, in spite of CIA intelligence that led lawmakers to unanimously assign blame to him. (Saudi government officials have denied that he had anything to do with the murder.) In May, Trump even bypassed Congress to approve a $2 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia over bipartisan objections. While the Senate blocked the move, Trump will likely use his veto to push the deal through.
Critics say that by repeatedly giving Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt, Trump has provided cover for Prince Mohammed — once feted as a progressive reformer — to crack down on dissent at home and wage a brutal war in Yemen, which has led to over 200,000 deaths, according to the United Nations.
Granted, there are reasons to think that Saudi Arabia’s investments in Treasuries have nothing to do with politics. From the end of October 2016 through April this year, the price of Brent crude oil rose just a shade over 50%, a boon for the coffers of the world’s largest oil-exporting nation.
Saudi Arabia may also be shifting its exposure away from lower-yielding European bonds, according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. After all, 10-year Treasuries currently yield about 2.02%, versus roughly -0.33% for German bunds. And as the world’s safe-haven asset, it’s not hard to see Saudi Arabia moving into U.S. government debt as a hedge for weakening global growth.
“I suspect this is partly a debt management issue” rather than from any political motive, Chandler said. “Especially since there hasn't been a rise in Saudi Arabia's (foreign) reserves.”
Indeed, even as the country’s holdings of Treasuries have jumped, its foreign-reserve assets have hardly budged. It’s a potential sign that Saudi Arabia is funneling more cash to plug its deficit as it ramps up domestic spending.
Yet in some ways, Saudi Arabia’s ownership of U.S. government debt has always been influenced by political considerations. For more than four decades, how much the kingdom actually held was kept secret from the public as part of a strategic agreement brokered during the Nixon administration. The unique arrangement bound together two countries that shared few common values, reshaping U.S.-Saudi relations for generations. It was only in May 2016 that the U.S. began releasing a detailed breakdown of Saudi Arabia’s holdings in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Bloomberg News.
Brad Setser, a former Treasury official who’s currently a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, takes a nuanced view.
Like a handful of other countries, Saudi Arabia has traditionally held its Treasuries across a number of global financial centers, according to longtime observers. And it’s likely the official tally understates the true size of the kingdom’s holdings, which is masked behind those of other countries. The recent uptick suggests to Setser the country now has less reason to obscure its investments from broader view than it did in the past.
“Whether it’s that they’re best friends with Trump or feel more comfortable overall — the portion of the Saudi reserves that is showing up in the U.S. data has clearly been going up over time,” Setser said.

Economists led by Chetan Ahya said the truce wasn’t enough to remove the uncertainty around trade policy, which will weigh on the growth outlook, regardless of likely monetary policy easing, including from the Federal Reserve.
Morgan Stanley cut both its 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts by 20 basis points each to 3% and 3.2%, respectively. The economists project global growth will slow to a six-year trough of 2.9% by year-end from 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019.
While the U.S.-China agreement to delay further tariffs and resume trade negotiations was cheered by investors, Morgan Stanley said it doesn’t offer clarity on the critical issues. An escalation of tariff wars, if sustained, would push the global economy into a recession, they said.
“We project global growth to slow even further, and any sustained escalation from here raises recession risks,” the economists wrote in the note on June 30.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). economists also said investors shouldn't stop worrying about trade risks following this weekend's news.
“There was no material de-escalation of tensions but only a pause until further progress,'' Citigroup’s Cesar Rojas and Global Chief Economist Catherine Mann said in a Sunday note. ``The impact on the real economy is ongoing from both the current tariffs and the uncertainty on the potential escalation.”"

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>",Japan to tighten tech material exports to South Korea in wartime labor row,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Ju-min Park
TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan will tighten curbs on exports of high-tech materials used in smartphone displays and chips to South Korea amid a growing dispute over South Koreans forced to work for Japanese firms during World War Two, the industry ministry said on Monday, prompting condemnation from Seoul.
Tighter export controls, to become effective on Thursday, would slow the export process by several months, hitting South Korean tech giants, such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), SK Hynix (KS:000660) and  LG Display  (KS:034220).
The step comes amid Tokyo's growing frustration at what it calls a lack of action by Seoul over issues stemming from its top court ruling last October that ordered Nippon Steel (T:5401) to compensate former forced laborers.
South Korea's industry minister, Sung Yun-mo, said: ""We will take necessary countermeasures including filing a complaint to the (World Trade Organization)."" 
""Our government expressed deep regret"" over Japan's tightening of its materials shipments, Sung said. 
South Korea's finance minister also called a meeting to discuss plans for reacting to Japan's move, finance ministry officials said. 
The South Korean foreign ministry as well summoned Japan's ambassador and called for a withdrawal of the curbs, it said. 
Japan rejected South Korea's proposal last month to create a joint compensation fund for victims with contributions from both nations' companies.
""South Korea has failed to show any satisfactory measures to resolve the forced labor issue ... and severely damaged mutual trust,"" said an official of the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
""As trust has been lost, we cannot have a dialogue and are unable to ensure that proper export controls are being taken,"" he told a news briefing.
The neighbors share a bitter history dating to the Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including forced use of labor by Japanese companies and the use of comfort women, a euphemism for girls and women, many of them Korean, forced to work in its wartime brothels.
Japan, which says the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties, has denounced the rulings and urged the launch of an arbitration panel.
The materials to be restricted are fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays, as well as resists and hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is used as an etching gas to make semiconductors.
Resists are thin layers of material used to transfer circuit patterns to a semiconductor substrate. Hydrogen fluoride is used in etching silicon materials. 
Japan will stop preferential treatment for shipments of these three materials to South Korea, requiring exporters to seek permission each time they want to ship, which takes about 90 days, the ministry official said.
Japan produces about 90% of fluorinated polyimides and resists worldwide as well as about 70% of etching gas, making it difficult for chipmakers to find alternatives, said the Sankei newspaper, which reported the plans on Sunday.
A source at one of South Korea's top memory chipmakers said chipmakers would have to try to build stockpiles, adding that the company relies on Japan for more than 70 percent of its resists and etching gas.
Samsung Electronics, the world's top memory maker, said it was looking into the matter, but offered no further comment. LG Display, a Apple (O:AAPL) supplier, said in a statement that the company would see ""some"" impact from any trade condition changes with Japan. 
SK Hynix declined comment.
Sung, the South Korean industry minister, said the country had been diversifying import sources and localizing supplies to cope with Japan's ""one-sided"" measure.
In Tokyo, shares of resist maker JSR (T:4185) and fluorochemicals maker  Kanto Denka Kogyo  (T:4047) plunged, but small South Korean material producers gained.
Japan also plans to strip white list status from South Korea under a trade control law, requiring Japanese exporters to seek a license for items that could be used in some weapons-related applications.
On Japan's white list are 27 countries, from Germany to South Korea, Britain and the United States.
South Korean exporters and experts urged the administration of President Moon Jae-in to step in and resolve the tension.
""This is not a problem starting from the business sector, and I think our government should stand up and try to fix this while companies are taking a hit,"" Lee Soo-chul, a board member of the Seoul-Tokyo Forum, a private foundation of diplomats and businessmen from both countries, told Reuters.
""But I am not sure if the current government is realizing how critical this situation is,"" said Lee, a former head of Samsung Group's Japanese operations.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 04:52AM ET</span>","Stocks cheer trade reprieve, bonds reconsider rate cuts","By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Stocks rallied and bonds retreated on Monday as the United States and China agreed to restart trade talks, leading investors to pare wagers on aggressive policy easing by the major central banks.
The dollar firmed on the safe-haven yen as Treasury yields rose and futures reined in bets for a half-point rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve this month.
""It (Trump-Xi G20 meeting) played as well as possible,"" said SEB Investment Management's global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. ""So It gives us time to digest and get a bit better activity in the global economy."" 
The United States and China agreed on Saturday to resume trade negotiations after President Donald Trump offered concessions to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when the two met at the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan.
These included no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei [HWT.UL] in order to reduce tensions with Beijing. China agreed to make unspecified new purchases of U.S. farm products and return to the negotiating table.
The initial reaction was one of relief that at least new tariffs were avoided. 
Europe's STOXX 600 and Japan's Nikkei (N225) climbed 1% and 2.1% respectively to hit two-month tops and MSCI's broadest global index (MIWD00000PUS) added 0.2% having only just missed out on its best first half to a year.
Chinese blue chips (CSI300) jumped 2.6% to their highest since late April, Germany's export-heavy DAX (GDAXI) sprang 1.5% to its highest since August, Wall Street futures were up over 1% while the combination of the Huawei hiatus and M&A activity hoisted Europe's the tech sector (SX8P) to a one-year high. 
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) and Nasdaq (NQc1) rose 1.1% and 1.7% each too whereas in the bond market Treasury futures (TYc1) slid 10 ticks as yields on 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) edged up 4 basis points to 2.04%. [GVD/EUR][.N]
Fed funds <0#FF:> dropped over 5 ticks as the market scaled back the probability of a half-point rate cut this month to around 15%, from nearer 50% a week ago. 
""I think the Fed expectations in the market are very aggressive. Possibly a bit too aggressive,"" SEB's Peterson added.
DAMAGE DONE
Yet, no deadline was set for a trade deal and much damage has already been done, with two surveys of Chinese manufacturing showing activity contracting.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held at 49.4 in June, just missing forecasts, while the Caixin/Markit PMI dropped to 49.4, the worst reading since January. 
Surveys from Japan and South Korea showed similar slowdowns as did the 19-country euro zone's reading which contracted for fifth month running and at a faster pace than previously thought.
""Euro zone manufacturing remained stuck firmly in a steep downturn in June, continuing to contract at one of the steepest rates seen for over six years,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The disappointing survey rounds off a second quarter in which the average PMI reading was the lowest since the opening months of 2013.""
The reaction in currency markets was to strip some recent gains from safe harbors like the yen and Swiss franc. The dollar crept up 0.4% on the yen to 108.26  and 0.7% on the franc to 0.9830 .
The dollar added 0.4% on a basket of currencies to 96.531 (DXY), while the euro eased to $1.1328 (EUR=). The dollar went the other way on the Chinese yuan, dipping 0.4% to 6.8403 .
The dollar's gains took some of the shine off gold, which fell 1.5% to $1,388 per ounce .
Oil prices sprang higher on news OPEC and its allies look set to extend supply cuts at least until the end of 2019 as Iraq joined top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia in endorsing the policy. [O/R]

Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose $1.85 or 2.8% to $66.40, while U.S. crude (CLc1) gained $1.84 or 2.75% to $59.90 a barrel.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling 5-Star party believes the government has a legal opinion that would justify terminating a national motorway concession that accounts for a third of core profits of infrastructure group Atlantia, a source said on Sunday.
The anti-establishment party, which rules in coalition with the right-wing League, has been campaigning for almost a year to scrap the concession, blaming Atlantia for a bridge collapse which killed 43 people on its toll network in Genoa last August.
Atlantia denies accusations by 5-Star leader and deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio that it had neglected maintenance on the bridge. Last week, it received some support from League leader Matteo Salvini who said no one should rush to judgment before investigations into the cause run their course.
However, the source familiar with 5-Star's thinking on the matter said a transport ministry report, still unpublished, had found serious inadequacies in maintenance and management of the bridge by Atlantia's toll-road unit, Autostrade per l'Italia.
The source showed Reuters three pages of the report which concluded that ""the grounds existed for a termination of the concession for a breach of duty by the concessionaire"".
Reuters has not viewed the rest of the ministry's report.
An Atlantia spokesman declined immediate comment on the source's comments.
Separately, Di Maio said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post late on Sunday that ""as far as we understand"" there were serious maintenance inadequacies on the part of Autostrade and that compensation due to it in the event of early termination would not be ""enormous"".

The source said compensation would still be due to Atlantia, such as for investments made on the motorway network, but much less than the 24 billion euros estimated by market analysts as the net present value of the concession due to expire in 2038.

Monte dei Paschi had closed a year ago the sale of its bad loan management unit, dubbed Juliet, to asset manager Quaestio Holding and credit manager Cerved (MI:CERV), signing a 10-year contract under which it paid fees for debt collection services.

""The revision of the accords is aimed at the reduction of risk parameters in the context of a significant worsening of economic conditions in recent months,"" it said.

Monte dei Paschi said the penalty was fully offset by lower debt servicing fees in the years ahead.

""All that is going to happen is Commerce will grant some additional licenses where there is a general availability"" of the parts the company needs, National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow said on ""Fox News Sunday."" 
U.S. microchip firms in particular ""are selling products that are widely available from other countries ... This not a general amnesty ... The national security concerns will remain paramount,"" he said.
The partial lifting of restrictions on Huawei was a key element of the agreement reached over the weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to reopen stalled trade negotiations between the two countries.
It has drawn bipartisan criticism from U.S. Senators concerned that Huawei has close ties to Chinese intelligence agencies that could exploit the global distribution of its technology.
""There will be a lot of pushback if it is a major concession,"" to Huawei, South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsay Graham said on ""Meet the Press."" 
Huawei, the world's biggest telecommunications equipment maker and No.2 smartphone maker, denies its products pose a security threat and has sought to fight back in U.S. courts since Washington put it on an export blacklist last month. Kudlow said that designation would remain.
Kudlow said the broader concerns about Huawei will be part of the renewed discussions.

The agreement over the weekend ""is not the last word,"" Kudlow said.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) plans to hire 300 more relationship and investment mangers for its wealth management business by 2021, as part of a plan to bulk up in areas the German lender hopes will bring steadier revenue streams. 
Deutsche Bank is in the middle of a major restructuring as it tries to shrink its investment bank that has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. The shake up is expected to lead to thousands of job cuts in areas like equities trading.
Chief executive Christian Sewing wants instead to allocate more resources to businesses that have more stable revenue streams, with wealth management one of them. 
""This drive to grow our business is now materializing with a big investment push,"" Fabrizio Campelli, global head of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management told Reuters in an interview. 
Under Campelli's plan the number of relationship and investment managers will grow by 300 - around a third of the current numbers - globally. They will be spread across its America, Europe and Emerging Markets regions. 
""We need to increase significantly our client footprint, which means the net increase of client facing individuals needs to be material,"" he said. 
Wealth management is attractive to banks as it requires less capital and its earnings tend to be less cyclical. 
But it is also highly competitive. Swiss banks UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are already big players, with wealth management at the heart of their business models, while upstart fintech companies are also trying to make inroads. 
""The space is very crowded and the market is one that many banks have sought to make a mark on,"" said Campelli, who has run the business at Deutsche since October 2015. 
""We looked at trends we believe Deutsche Bank wealth management can be particularly relevant in and within those areas we are making some very targeted investments"". 
Campelli said trends they are particularly focused on include the growth in entrepreneurial - as opposed to family - wealth, the increasing number of family offices, and the rise of millennial high net worth individuals, who tend to manage their wealth differently from previous generations. 
He declined to say how big the overall investment would be to fund this growth, beyond ""several hundred million"" euros. 
TOP 10 AMBITIONS
Deutsche's wealth business had 213 billion euros ($242.35 billion) in assets under management (AUM) in the first quarter of the year, up by 14 billion euros from the end of 2018. 
It currently trails its major Swiss and U.S rivals in private banking league tables, tending to sit outside the top ten. 
Campelli, an Italian who has been at Deutsche since 2004, would not disclose the bank's long term AUM target but said ""if we can't improve from just outside of the top 10 position, I will be very disappointed.""
The business generated 427 million euros in revenue in the first quarter, around 17 percent of the 2.5 billion euro total brought in by the private and commercial banking division, where the wealth management business sits. 
The first wave of the hiring has started, with new recruits including Michael Rogers, who joined as the new head of the U.S. West Coast business from Merrill Lynch and Marco Pagliara moving from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to be head of Northern and Eastern European wealth management. 
When asked if Deutsche's wider problems at its investment bank were hindering its plans to attract talent, Campelli said: ""We're paying them market rate, there is no need to pay a premium."" He added that the negative news around Deutsche gives their plans to build-up a more stable business more credibility. 
""We need a business model which is stable and based on reliable macro trends and not so reliant on cyclical trends,"" he added.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 03:45AM ET</span>",Japan to tighten export rules for high-tech materials to South Korea: media,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan plans to tighten restrictions on the export of high-tech material used in smartphones and chips to South Korea from July 4 in connection with a dispute over a South Korean ruling on war-time forced labor, the Sankei newspaper reported on Sunday.
The row between Japan and South Korea flared last October when South Korea's Supreme Court ruled that Japan's Nippon Steel must compensate South Koreans for forced labor during World War Two. 
Japan maintains that the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties, and has denounced the ruling as ""unthinkable.""
The materials to be restricted are fluorinated polyimide which is used in smartphone displays, and resist and high-purity hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is used as an etching gas in the making of semiconductors, the paper said. 
Resist is a thin layer used to transfer a circuit pattern to the semiconductor substrate. High-purity HF is used in etching silicon materials.
Japan will stop preferential treatment for these three materials for South Korea, meaning Japanese exporters will need to apply for export permission for each time they want to ship to South Korea, which takes about 90 days, the paper said.
A government announcement on the restriction is expected on Monday, it said.
Japan produces about 90% of fluorinated polyimide and resist worldwide as well as about 70% of etching gas, making it difficult for chipmakers to find alternative supplies, the paper said, pointing to potential impact on South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics.
Japan's industry ministry and finance ministry were not available for comment on Sunday.

In January, Japan demanded talks with South Korea over the forced labor issue but South Korea has not responded, the newspaper said.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 01:25AM ET</span>",Glencore's Congo tragedy highlights security conundrum for miners,"By Edward McAllister and Mitra Taj
DAKAR/LIMA (Reuters) - The deaths of 43 illegal miners at a  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) facility in Congo last week highlighted a growing challenge for mining companies struggling to secure sites from small-scale prospectors digging for cobalt, copper and other minerals.
Many mines span hundreds of square kilometers across rural terrains, a tantalizing prospect for illegal miners, also known as artisanal miners, who break into sites in search of metals, some of which end up in electric cars and other products.
But even as last Thursday's tragedy ratcheted up pressure on companies to make changes to security and community outreach, industry consultants and analysts say the task will be difficult given the geographic constraints and economic challenges faced by the world's estimated 40 million artisanal miners.
""If people do not have work or an industry, they rely on this activity,"" said Patrick Hickey, a mining industry consultant who has worked at mines across Africa.
""Where you can fence off the mine site, you do. Where you can't, you try to use security. But it is difficult.""
Thursday's tragedy occurred in Democratic Republic of Congo's Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) concession, which spans kilometers of flat terrain on the outskirts of Kolwezi in the southern part of the country. The mine is operated by Kamoto Copper Company (KCC), a joint venture between Glencore-controlled Katanga Mining Ltd and the state-owned Gecamines.
Only part of the perimeter, which abuts densely-populated residential areas, is protected by fencing, giving the local population easy access. Young men can often be seen just outside the mine carrying shovels and sacks brimming with freshly-mined ore to nearby trading depots dominated by Chinese buyers.
 Private contractors provide most of the security, but activists say they are often ineffective and easily bought off by the miners in exchange for ignoring trespassers.
About 2,000 illegal miners regularly access the site, Glencore said.
Congo's military plans to deploy troops to the KCC site, as it did in late June when it sent hundreds of soldiers to protect the Tenke copper and cobalt mine, which is owned by China Molybdenum Co Ltd.
""Security is not a highly-paid profession, so if you can get kickbacks from turning a blind eye, it can make you money,"" said Nicholas Garrett of RCS Global, a consultancy which audits mining supply chains.
In South Africa, there are an estimated 30,000 illegal miners providing one of the biggest sources of illicit gold on the continent, with an output of around 14 billion rand ($994.4 million) per year, according to ENACT, which conducts research into transnational organized crime.
 The illegal miners are known in Zulu as ""zama-zamas,"" which loosely translates as ""those who try to get something from nothing.""
Sibanye-Stillwater, which spent millions upgrading its security infrastructure, found almost 1,400 zama-zamas in its Cooke gold mine during a 2017 security sweep.
 ""We have been continually arresting and trying to control access to the mines, but it's been difficult,"" said Sibanye-Stillwater spokesman James Wellsted.
CONCESSIONS
 Governments and industry have been setting aside concessions for artisanal mining, but there are not nearly enough of those concessions to employ all the artisanal miners, many of whom continue to target larger deposits.
Miners operating in risky jurisdictions, as a result, employ a variety of measures - ranging from antagonistic to collaborative - to safeguard operations.
Such steps include the use of private security with military or police backgrounds; fences or other physical structures; regular border patrols; and even allowing artisanal miners access to certain areas of their operations, according to presentations from Barrick Gold Corp, Freeport-McMoRan Inc, Kinross Gold Corp and Newmont Goldcorp Corp.
Even still, artisanal miners slip through surveillance. In 2013, two were killed at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea in a confrontation with police after a large crowd of illegal miners gathered at the mine, Barrick said at the time.
A spokeswoman for Barrick, the world's largest gold miner by market value, declined to comment on the company's latest security measures.
'SHORT-TERM SOLUTION'
Delphin Monga, provincial secretary of the UCDT union, which represents KCC employees, said police fired teargas a few months ago to try to chase off the diggers, but it was only a temporary deterrence.
 Asked whether deploying the army would be an effective deterrent, Monga said: ""Maybe as a short-term solution. But the dissuasive measures taken by the police and army do not intimidate the diggers.""
Some human rights activists say that armed responses to artisanal miners only exacerbate tensions with locals and ignore the underlying problems, which include the failure of large-scale mines to meaningfully contribute to development gains for the impoverished communities.
Artisanal miners ""are the world's hidden suppliers, and they're working in horrible conditions,"" said Karen Hayes of Pact, an NGO working across Africa to bolster supply chain transparency. ""We already buy their minerals, whether we recognize it or not.""
In South America, Fura Gems Inc says securing all of its rural land in Colombia would be virtually impossible, so the emerald miner allows access in some areas, though it has promised to close a network of illegal tunnels.
""A mining company can't do the job police do,"" said Luis Rivera, an executive with Gold Fields Ltd and president of the Institute of Mining Engineers of Peru.

(Reuters) - Motel 6 has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over claims the budget chain routinely provided guest lists from properties in Arizona to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agents, court documents showed on Saturday.
The proposed settlement, outlined in court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Arizona, calls for Motel 6 to abide by a three-year consent decree to not give guest information to immigration authorities without a warrant or subpoena and to provide training on the issue to workers.
A previous settlement over the Arizona properties reached by the two sides was rejected in November 2018 by a federal judge who said it did not go far enough in making sure that the plaintiffs, many of whom may be in the country illegally, would be found and compensated.
""Motel 6 fully recognizes the seriousness of the situation and accepts full responsibility for both compensating those who were harmed and taking the necessary steps to ensure that we protect the privacy of our guests. Since this issue emerged, we’ve taken strong action to make sure a similar issue never happens again in the future,"" a spokesman for the company said in a written statement.
Immigration has become an incendiary issue in U.S. politics amid a surge of immigrants seeking to enter illegally and moves by President Donald Trump to step up deportations and build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.
Local governments dubbing themselves ""sanctuary cities” have resisted cooperating with the Trump administration’s crackdown, and immigration is certain to play a major role in the 2020 presidential campaign.
The lawsuit was filed in January 2018 by the Los Angeles-based Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, on behalf of Motel 6 guests with Latino names after the Phoenix New Times newspaper reported that the chain was providing their names to ICE at two of its properties in Arizona and six in Washington state. 
The new settlement seeks to clarify how the plaintiffs would be found and paid and sets up a fund for that purpose. 
A spokesman for MALDEF could not be reached for comment on Saturday.
In April of this year, Motel 6 agreed to pay $12 million to settle a similar lawsuit filed by Washington state. 

Motel 6 is controlled by the private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, which bought the brand in 2012.

(Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co has recommended that investors in natural gas producer EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) vote in favor of the company's board nominees, putting it at odds with another proxy advisory firm which recommended voting in favor of a competing slate of directors proposed by Toby and Derek Rice. 
""We see no significant outstanding concerns regarding leadership or governance at EQT and we do not believe further board refreshment or oversight is warranted at this juncture,"" Glass Lewis said in a note dated June 28.
The recommendation by Glass Lewis to vote in favor of all 12 of the company's nominees comes after proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday advised EQT investors to vote in favor of all the nominees of shareholders Toby and Derek Rice.
The Rice brothers were part of the founding team at Rice Energy, which was bought by EQT in November 2017. They say EQT management is responsible for the company's underperformance since the deal, and have pushed for an overhaul of its board.
EQT welcomed Glass Lewis' recommendation and said it reaffirmed that the company has the right board, management team and strategy to create significant long-term shareholder value.
""EQT believes shareholders should question the merit of a 3% shareholder seeking to be CEO and replace management and a majority of the board,"" the company said in a statement.
Glass Lewis also said management should be given a reasonable amount of time by the shareholders to achieve targets before seeking further changes.
ISS in its report had recommended that EQT shareholders should support all seven nominees put forward by the Rice brothers and five existing members of the board, sending the company's shares higher.
The Rice brothers also have the support of EQT's fourth and sixth largest shareholders, DE Shaw Group and Kensico Capital Management Corp. 
EQT disagreed with ISS's recommendations and said the Rice nominees were less qualified, less experienced and conflicted.

""We are grateful to those large shareholders who have publicly announced their support for all Rice team nominees,"" the Rice team said, adding it believed the Friday's stock market reaction to the ISS announcement spoke for itself.

(Reuters) - A United Airlines flight made an emergency landing and blew out two tires at New Jersey's Newark Airport on Saturday, causing the airport briefly to suspend flights, officials said.
Flight 2098 took off from New York City's LaGuardia Airport bound for Houston and a short time later experienced hydraulic problems, prompting the emergency landing, Scott Ladd, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said in an email. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the crew of the Airbus A319 reported a brake problem and that two left main tires blew out when landing.
""Our pilots reacted quickly to ensure the safety of the aircraft and our customers, who deplaned using deployed slides after landing,"" United Airlines said in a statement, adding that there were 128 customers on board and no one was injured.
The plane was damaged and Port Authority crews had to clear the runway at Newark Liberty International Airport, Ladd said.
The FAA said it will investigate the incident. 
On June 15, tires on a United Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 blew out as it landed at Newark, causing delays but no injuries.
Two planes from the same airline blowing out tires within two weeks at the same airport was just a coincidence, said aviation analyst Mike Boyd, president and chief executive officer of the Colorado-based Boyd Group International.
""It's just a different set of situations,"" Boyd said by phone, adding that the forced emergency landing in the latest incident was another factor.
""When a pilot wants to get a plane down, he wants to get it down and he could care less about the rubber on the wheels,"" Boyd said. 
The incident caused delays for inbound and outbound flights at Newark, according to tracking firm FlightAware. But by Saturday afternoon, the runway where the plane made its emergency landing had been re-opened, the FAA said.
United said it was making arrangements to get the passengers aboard the plane to their final destinations. 

It also issued a travel waiver for passengers, allowing any of its customers traveling to or from Newark or connecting there to make changes to their flights at no cost.

CEO Christian Sewing flagged an extensive overhaul last month when he promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank to turn the lender around after it failed to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
In addition to the job cuts, Germany's flagship lender is considering trimming its management board, three of the people said. The investment bank would be represented on the board by Sewing rather than having a seat at the table, as is currently the case.
Veteran Garth Ritchie has been heading the investment bank, but a plan under discussion is to promote bankers Stefan Hoops and Mark Fedorcik to lead the division as co-heads, two of the people said. They would report to Sewing.
One of the people described the plans as fluid, with many aspects still not decided.
 Deutsche Bank  declined to comment on the changes. Ritchie, Hoops and Fedorcik declined through a spokesman to comment. 
The bank said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. ""We will update all stakeholders if and when required,"" the bank said.
Ranked as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, Deutsche has been plagued by ratings downgrades, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals, with investment banking often the culprit even though it generates about half of Deutsche Bank's revenue.
RETREAT FROM INVESTMENT BANKING 
After years of failing to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Deutsche Bank is being pushed to retreat from riskier investment banking and focus its effort on mainstream markets. 
Executives and investors hope the overhaul will be radical enough to turn around the bank's fortunes after its shares fell to a record low this month.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Friday that Deutsche was considering cutting between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs.
One of the people on Saturday said that the reduction was expected to be closer to 20,000.
The bank, which had the equivalent of 91,463 employees at the end of the first quarter, has already announced plans to cut headcount to ""well below"" 90,000.
Among other overhaul measures under discussion is the creation of a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets, as well as shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside Europe, sources have said.
It also aims to dispose of up to a quarter of its riskiest assets in the next few years.

Taken together, the measures are part of a significant restructuring of the investment bank, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis after decades of rapid expansion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos was spotted schmoozing in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's booth during the Super Bowl in February, the media world exploded with anticipation about Amazon's imminent domination of sports media.
But two years after first dabbling in live sports streaming, Amazon has yet to settle on a strategy as it continues to experiment and analyze consumer behavior, Marie Donoghue, Vice President of Global Sports Video, told Reuters.
""We're literally at day one in sports, so we're learning and experimenting,"" Donoghue said in New York this week in her first interview after she took over the sports media division of the world's largest online retailer last fall.
The arrival of Donoghue, a nearly twenty-year veteran of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's ESPN cable network and who was responsible for shows including the '30 for 30' series and 'OJ: Made in America,' signaled a new level of seriousness to Amazon's pursuit of live sports. 
While the real impact of her arrival remains to be seen, that hasn't stopped chatter of a big tech takeover of live sports as Amazon,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB),  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube's threaten to loosen TV's grip on one of the last remaining reasons to pay for live television.
Tech companies and startup digital platforms - like DAZN, which in October agreed to pay boxing champion Canelo Alvarez a minimum of $365 million for five years, the richest contract in sports history - are also seen driving up the cost of media rights when major contracts start coming up for renewal in 2021.
Will Amazon lead the pack in pursuing streaming rights for live sports? ""We don't talk about specific rights ... as a matter of course, but also because we're just not sure yet,"" Donoghue said.
Since 2017, Amazon has snapped up digital rights to some of England's Premier League soccer matches, U.S. Open Tennis Championships in the UK and three seasons of Thursday Night Football, among others.
Donoghue said the current focus is on how to enable Amazon Prime subscribers to control nearly every component of their viewing experience, including how, when and where they watch.
As a streaming service, ""we don't have to serve the same content in the same way to everybody,"" she said. 
To figure out which sports products are successful and what to offer next, Amazon is analyzing market research and its own viewership data, as well as consumers' use of its X-Ray tool for digging into details about shows.
It also co-streams Thursday Night Football on its Twitch video game streaming platform, which has an interactive extension that lets viewers predict game developments, including who they think will win.

""We're watching all of that,"" Donoghue said. ""We want to use live sports to drive value for Prime customers.""

It came the day before the US and China announced at the G20 summit in Japan that they would re-start trade talks.
Both countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's imports, which has disrupted global supply lines, upset markets and put a drag on global economic growth.
The Trump administration had threatened to impose new levies to cover nearly all imports from China and pressured Apple and other manufacturers to make their products in the United States if they want to avoid tariffs.
Last week, Apple asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15%-30% of its production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a Nikkei report.
“If true, this suggests to me that Apple has tremendous confidence that the US and China will be able to solve their trade dispute and do so in the near future,” DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in an email.
China is a key market for Apple as well as a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18 percent of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter ended March.
“Like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States,” an Apple spokesman said. “Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.”
Apple’s decision coincides with the end of tax subsidies that it got for making the desktop in a plant in Texas run by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd, according to the Journal.
“(This) serves as a reminder that, relative to the U.S., manufacturing in China remains a lower-cost alternative and benefits from an existing infrastructure, versus having to, potentially, rebuild one in the U.S”, Forte said.

""If I had been the ambassador a year earlier, the takeover wouldn't have taken place,"" Gen Wenbin was quoted as telling the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper, without giving specific reasons for his opposition to the deal.
""It wasn't a good deal for the Chinese side. It was for Switzerland: It got $40 billion. If Switzerland wants Syngenta back, I would convince ChemChina to sell it. But is there anybody at all in Switzerland who wants Syngenta back?""
Basel-based Syngenta was listed on the SIX Swiss Stock exchange when it was bought by ChemChina, so shareholders received the money from the deal that closed in 2017.
After the takeover spurred debate over foreign countries expanding in Switzerland, Swiss politicians are debating a measure in parliament that could require government approval of sales of Swiss companies to foreign entities.
Other big Chinese investments in Swiss companies include HNA Group's purchase of airline caterer Gategroup and ground services and cargo handling firm Swissport.
Gen Wenbin said criticism in Switzerland's media over such transactions had driven potential Chinese investors to look elsewhere.
""They're going to Germany,"" the ambassador told the daily newspaper.
Syngenta did not return a phone call and email seeking comment on Saturday. No one could immediately be reached to comment at the Chinese embassy.

The former Swiss firm is targeting growth through acquisitions in the $17 billion Chinese seed market, where access is restricted for foreign players, as well as new products and collaborations in technology.

(Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co has recommended that investors in natural gas producer EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) vote in favor of the company's board nominees, putting it at odds with another proxy advisory firm which recommended voting in favor of a competing slate of directors proposed by Toby and Derek Rice. 
""We see no significant outstanding concerns regarding leadership or governance at EQT and we do not believe further board refreshment or oversight is warranted at this juncture,"" Glass Lewis said in a note dated June 28.
The recommendation by Glass Lewis to vote in favor of all 12 of the company's nominees comes after proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday advised EQT investors to vote in favor of all the nominees of shareholders Toby and Derek Rice.
The Rice brothers were part of the founding team at Rice Energy, which was bought by EQT in November 2017. They say EQT management is responsible for the company's underperformance since the deal, and have pushed for an overhaul of its board.
EQT welcomed Glass Lewis' recommendation and said it reaffirmed that the company has the right board, management team and strategy to create significant long-term shareholder value.
""EQT believes shareholders should question the merit of a 3% shareholder seeking to be CEO and replace management and a majority of the board,"" the company said in a statement.
Glass Lewis also said management should be given a reasonable amount of time by the shareholders to achieve targets before seeking further changes.
ISS in its report had recommended that EQT shareholders should support all seven nominees put forward by the Rice brothers and five existing members of the board, sending the company's shares higher.
The Rice brothers also have the support of EQT's fourth and sixth largest shareholders, DE Shaw Group and Kensico Capital Management Corp. 
EQT disagreed with ISS's recommendations and said the Rice nominees were less qualified, less experienced and conflicted.

""We are grateful to those large shareholders who have publicly announced their support for all Rice team nominees,"" the Rice team said, adding it believed the Friday's stock market reaction to the ISS announcement spoke for itself.

The company could not immediately be reached for comment late on Saturday. 

The move would be a rare bright spot for the British automotive sector which has been hit by job cuts, plant closure announcements and falling sales in recent months linked to tumbling demand for diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2019 03:07PM ET</span>",Emergency landing by United flight briefly closes Newark Airport,"By Alex Dobuzinskis
(Reuters) - A United Airlines flight made an emergency landing and blew out two tires at New Jersey's Newark Airport on Saturday, causing the airport briefly to suspend flights, officials said.
Flight 2098 took off from New York City's LaGuardia Airport bound for Houston and a short time later experienced hydraulic problems, prompting the emergency landing, Scott Ladd, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said in an email. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the crew of the Airbus A319 reported a brake problem and that two left main tires blew out when landing.
""Our pilots reacted quickly to ensure the safety of the aircraft and our customers, who deplaned using deployed slides after landing,"" United Airlines said in a statement, adding that there were 128 customers on board and no one was injured.
The plane was damaged and Port Authority crews had to clear the runway at Newark Liberty International Airport, Ladd said.
The FAA said it will investigate the incident. 
On June 15, tires on a United Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 757 blew out as it landed at Newark, causing delays but no injuries.
Two planes from the same airline blowing out tires within two weeks at the same airport was just a coincidence, said aviation analyst Mike Boyd, president and chief executive officer of the Colorado-based Boyd Group International.
""It's just a different set of situations,"" Boyd said by phone, adding that the forced emergency landing in the latest incident was another factor.
""When a pilot wants to get a plane down, he wants to get it down and he could care less about the rubber on the wheels,"" Boyd said. 
The incident caused delays for inbound and outbound flights at Newark, according to tracking firm FlightAware. But by Saturday afternoon, the runway where the plane made its emergency landing had been re-opened, the FAA said.
United said it was making arrangements to get the passengers aboard the plane to their final destinations. 

It also issued a travel waiver for passengers, allowing any of its customers traveling to or from Newark or connecting there to make changes to their flights at no cost.

CEO Christian Sewing flagged an extensive overhaul last month when he promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to the investment bank to turn the lender around after it failed to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
In addition to the job cuts, Germany's flagship lender is considering trimming its management board, three of the people said. The investment bank would be represented on the board by Sewing rather than having a seat at the table, as is currently the case.
Veteran Garth Ritchie has been heading the investment bank, but a plan under discussion is to promote bankers Stefan Hoops and Mark Fedorcik to lead the division as co-heads, two of the people said. They would report to Sewing.
One of the people described the plans as fluid, with many aspects still not decided.
 Deutsche Bank  declined to comment on the changes. Ritchie, Hoops and Fedorcik declined through a spokesman to comment. 
The bank said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. ""We will update all stakeholders if and when required,"" the bank said.
Ranked as one of the most important banks in the global financial system, Deutsche has been plagued by ratings downgrades, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals, with investment banking often the culprit even though it generates about half of Deutsche Bank's revenue.
RETREAT FROM INVESTMENT BANKING 
After years of failing to keep pace with Wall Street's big hitters such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Deutsche Bank is being pushed to retreat from riskier investment banking and focus its effort on mainstream markets. 
Executives and investors hope the overhaul will be radical enough to turn around the bank's fortunes after its shares fell to a record low this month.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Friday that Deutsche was considering cutting between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs.
One of the people on Saturday said that the reduction was expected to be closer to 20,000.
The bank, which had the equivalent of 91,463 employees at the end of the first quarter, has already announced plans to cut headcount to ""well below"" 90,000.
Among other overhaul measures under discussion is the creation of a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets, as well as shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside Europe, sources have said.
It also aims to dispose of up to a quarter of its riskiest assets in the next few years.

Taken together, the measures are part of a significant restructuring of the investment bank, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis after decades of rapid expansion.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>","Amazon, after big hire, experimenting with sports media strategy: interview","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos was spotted schmoozing in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's booth during the Super Bowl in February, the media world exploded with anticipation about Amazon's imminent domination of sports media.
But two years after first dabbling in live sports streaming, Amazon has yet to settle on a strategy as it continues to experiment and analyze consumer behavior, Marie Donoghue, Vice President of Global Sports Video, told Reuters.
""We're literally at day one in sports, so we're learning and experimenting,"" Donoghue said in New York this week in her first interview after she took over the sports media division of the world's largest online retailer last fall.
The arrival of Donoghue, a nearly twenty-year veteran of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's ESPN cable network and who was responsible for shows including the '30 for 30' series and 'OJ: Made in America,' signaled a new level of seriousness to Amazon's pursuit of live sports. 
While the real impact of her arrival remains to be seen, that hasn't stopped chatter of a big tech takeover of live sports as Amazon,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB),  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube's threaten to loosen TV's grip on one of the last remaining reasons to pay for live television.
Tech companies and startup digital platforms - like DAZN, which in October agreed to pay boxing champion Canelo Alvarez a minimum of $365 million for five years, the richest contract in sports history - are also seen driving up the cost of media rights when major contracts start coming up for renewal in 2021.
Will Amazon lead the pack in pursuing streaming rights for live sports? ""We don't talk about specific rights ... as a matter of course, but also because we're just not sure yet,"" Donoghue said.
Since 2017, Amazon has snapped up digital rights to some of England's Premier League soccer matches, U.S. Open Tennis Championships in the UK and three seasons of Thursday Night Football, among others.
Donoghue said the current focus is on how to enable Amazon Prime subscribers to control nearly every component of their viewing experience, including how, when and where they watch.
As a streaming service, ""we don't have to serve the same content in the same way to everybody,"" she said. 
To figure out which sports products are successful and what to offer next, Amazon is analyzing market research and its own viewership data, as well as consumers' use of its X-Ray tool for digging into details about shows.
It also co-streams Thursday Night Football on its Twitch video game streaming platform, which has an interactive extension that lets viewers predict game developments, including who they think will win.

""We're watching all of that,"" Donoghue said. ""We want to use live sports to drive value for Prime customers.""

It came the day before the US and China announced at the G20 summit in Japan that they would re-start trade talks.
Both countries have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's imports, which has disrupted global supply lines, upset markets and put a drag on global economic growth.
The Trump administration had threatened to impose new levies to cover nearly all imports from China and pressured Apple and other manufacturers to make their products in the United States if they want to avoid tariffs.
Last week, Apple asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15%-30% of its production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a Nikkei report.
“If true, this suggests to me that Apple has tremendous confidence that the US and China will be able to solve their trade dispute and do so in the near future,” DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in an email.
China is a key market for Apple as well as a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18 percent of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter ended March.
“Like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States,” an Apple spokesman said. “Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.”
Apple’s decision coincides with the end of tax subsidies that it got for making the desktop in a plant in Texas run by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd, according to the Journal.
“(This) serves as a reminder that, relative to the U.S., manufacturing in China remains a lower-cost alternative and benefits from an existing infrastructure, versus having to, potentially, rebuild one in the U.S”, Forte said.

""If I had been the ambassador a year earlier, the takeover wouldn't have taken place,"" Gen Wenbin was quoted as telling the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper, without giving specific reasons for his opposition to the deal.
""It wasn't a good deal for the Chinese side. It was for Switzerland: It got $40 billion. If Switzerland wants Syngenta back, I would convince ChemChina to sell it. But is there anybody at all in Switzerland who wants Syngenta back?""
Basel-based Syngenta was listed on the SIX Swiss Stock exchange when it was bought by ChemChina, so shareholders received the money from the deal that closed in 2017.
After the takeover spurred debate over foreign countries expanding in Switzerland, Swiss politicians are debating a measure in parliament that could require government approval of sales of Swiss companies to foreign entities.
Other big Chinese investments in Swiss companies include HNA Group's purchase of airline caterer Gategroup and ground services and cargo handling firm Swissport.
Gen Wenbin said criticism in Switzerland's media over such transactions had driven potential Chinese investors to look elsewhere.
""They're going to Germany,"" the ambassador told the daily newspaper.
Syngenta did not return a phone call and email seeking comment on Saturday. No one could immediately be reached to comment at the Chinese embassy.

The former Swiss firm is targeting growth through acquisitions in the $17 billion Chinese seed market, where access is restricted for foreign players, as well as new products and collaborations in technology.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2019 12:45AM ET</span>",Mexico's president says big bank loan shows confidence in Pemex,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An $8 billion syndicated loan to Mexico's national oil company Pemex is a sign of confidence by more than 20 banks involved in the operation, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday, after a recent credit downgrade for the firm.
The deal to renew Pemex credit lines and refinance liabilities was announced on Thursday. 
""These actions demonstrate that there is confidence. The banks don't act without information, they don't take a decision like this because they like the government. They know that Pemex is in very good health,"" Lopez Obrador said in a regular news conference. 
He said the terms of the loan reduced interest rates, although he did not specify by how much. He said the financing was available for five years, up from three years under a previous arrangement.
Pemex, saddled with about $106 billion in debt and facing the prospect of a costly credit rating downgrade, announced in February it was working on the financial operation.
Earlier in June, Fitch cut its rating on Pemex's $80 billion of bonds from investment grade to speculative grade, or ""junk,"" with a negative outlook. Many investors expect a second downgrade from Moody's Investors Service to formally confirm Pemex as junk credit. 
""Everybody is questioning, and betting that the economy will go badly, but when these actions happen it helps a lot because it demonstrates confidence,"" Lopez Obrador said.
Syndicated loans are a financing vehicle that spreads the lenders' risk between several institutions. 
Later on Friday, Pemex said in a statement the financial operation does not amount to new debt for the company, as it allows the refinancing of debt up to $2.5 billion and the renewal of two revolving credit lines up to a total of $5.5 billion.

""The interest rate of the operation was closed with Libor +235, which is equivalent, at the close of the operation, to an equivalent fixed rate of 4.15%,"" the statement said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and her former second-in-command at the Silicon Valley blood-testing startup were ordered on Friday to stand trial next year on fraud charges stemming from their claims about the company's technology, court documents show.
During a hearing in federal court in San Jose, California, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila set jury selection to begin in the trial of Holmes, 35, and former Theranos President Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, on July 28, 2020, according to minutes of the proceedings.
Davila ordered the trial to begin in August 2020. It was expected to last three months.
Holmes and Balwani, 54, were indicted in June 2018 on 11 counts of conspiracy and wire fraud. They have pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors say Holmes and Balwani engaged in a pair of schemes to defraud investors, doctors and patients with claims that Theranos had developed a revolutionary new blood testing system. 
Holmes and Balwani are accused of using advertising and solicitations to encourage doctors and patients to use the company's testing laboratory services even though they knew it could not produce accurate and reliable results consistently.
Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who started Theranos at age 19, was celebrated as a rising star of Silicon Valley. In 2015, Forbes magazine anointed her America's youngest self-made female billionaire. 
Balwani joined Theranos in 2009 and ran day-to-day operations until 2016.
Questions were first raised about the accuracy and reliability of her signature blood-testing device in a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal in 2015. This touched off a string of state and federal investigations into the company.

In March of 2018 Holmes settled civil fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under which she was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 09:34PM ET</span>",U.S. banks play cat-and-mouse game with Fed on capital returns,"By Matt Scuffham and Pete Schroeder
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An annual stress test of banks introduced by U.S. regulators after the 2007-09 financial crisis to prevent taxpayer bailouts has become a fight over how quickly lenders can return capital to shareholders.
Helped by a buoyant U.S. economy, tax cuts and record profits, the country's biggest banks are ramping up payouts to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. But their plans to return capital are pushing the boundaries of what regulators will tolerate, analysts and regulatory sources say.
The Federal Reserve on Thursday approved the capital plans of 18 banks in this year's test, although it placed conditions on the U.S. operations of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG after identifying weaknesses in its capital planning.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), one of the best capitalized U.S. banks, had to resubmit its proposal after the Fed assessed its initial plan would result in it falling below the minimum capital it is required to hold to cope with a downturn.
The bank eventually won the regulator's approval for a capital plan that will increase its quarterly dividend to 90 cents per share from 80 cents, starting in the third quarter, and buy back up to $29.4 billion of shares over the next year. 
The Fed began publishing the results of the capital planning check in 2012. It is the second part of the Fed's annual test of banks, assessing what level of cash banks can return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has emphasized that banks are in a much stronger position now than they were before the crisis and has said he believes the amount of capital reserves in the banking system is appropriate.
With the Fed no longer pushing lenders to increase capital reserves each year, and banks growing comfortable with the stress testing process, they may be getting more aggressive with their capital plans, a senior Fed official said Thursday.
As they push to maximize shareholder payouts, banks run a greater risk of seeing their capital levels dip below regulatory minimums when run through a hypothetical economic downturn. That's what happened to JPMorgan this time. After the bank resubmitted its plan with a lower payout rate, it was approved.
The Fed permits banks to adjust their capital plans once after submitting them to stress testing, but only if their initial plans prove to be too aggressive, giving the firms some incentive to push the limit.
""It really allows banks to push to the boundaries,"" said Adam Gilbert, global regulatory leader of PwC's financial services advisory practice. ""It enables them to be strategically aggressive."" 
There is little doubt that banks are becoming more headstrong. Fitch analyst Bain Rumohr said that, for this year, U.S. banks' payout ratios - the percentage of earnings they payout as dividends and share buy backs - have risen to over 100% of earnings, compared with 80% to 90% last year.
In essence, some banks are planning to pay out more in share buybacks and dividends than they will earn in the current year.
JPMorgan has repurchased more than $80 billion worth of stock since July 2016 and has been upping its rate of buy backs each year. Fitch estimates its projected payout ratio to be 110% if it fully executes its share buy-back plan this year.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) received conditional passes in the test last year, meaning they could not increase their capital distributions to shareholders.
Rumohr said he anticipates more banks could be asked to resubmit plans going forward if current market trends continue.
""We wouldn't be surprised to see one to two banks have to resubmit during each year's process,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) held its annual meeting in April, activists insisted it stop financing private prison companies.
On Wednesday, Bank of America did exactly that, distancing itself from a sector that has triggered protests over its links to the Trump administration's immigration policy and concerns about detention center conditions. Hector Vaca, one of the activists at the April annual meeting, declared victory.
Next, he hopes to get SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI) to cut ties with private prisons. SunTrust did not respond to a request for comment. 
In the past, companies usually waited for controversies to lose steam and avoided taking a stance by declining to provide public comments, making changes slowly or not at all. Crisis communications experts say that companies are forced to act more quickly in today's fast-paced news and social media environment.
""It's important to understand that companies in these situations have only bad options,"" U.S.-based crisis management consultant Eric Dezenhall said, adding that ""there is no playbook or everyone would use it.""
Also this week, several hundred people, including employees of  Wayfair Inc  (N:W), rallied in Boston to protest the online retailer's alleged sale of furniture to a Texas detention facility housing migrant children. The spat was fueled when a letter to Wayfair leaders from employees about the sale spread on Twitter.
Wayfair declined to comment on the alleged sale. But it promptly made a $100,000 donation to the American Red Cross to aid humanitarian relief at the border.
The rise in activism accompanies a surge in ESG investing, or investing based on environmental, social and governance factors. Morningstar estimates funds that invest according to non-economic guidelines managed $1.2 trillion at the end of last year.
It has prompted companies to disclose more about how, and with whom, they do business and tackle issues they might have tried to evade in the past.
Last year, a deadly shooting spree at a Parkland, Florida, high school brought long-running arguments about gun control in the United States to the fore once again. This time, some companies that had sold guns for years changed tack.
Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (N:DKS) stopped selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, opting to make it a fully transparent move. The retailer's chief executive, Edward Stack, spoke about the decision on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""
Many praised the company, but not everyone agreed it was the right thing to do. Same-store sales at Dick's declined nearly 2% in the quarter after the decision, as customers citing a violation of their Second Amendment rights to bear arms called for a boycott online.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Kroger's Fred Meyer (N:KR) were among other retailers who also announced they would limit the sales of firearms and ammunition, in their cases only selling to buyers over the age of 21.
Others change course more quietly. Rather than going to the press,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) disclosed its decision to reduce its exposure to private prison companies without fanfare on the 43rd page of a 104 page-long document in January.
Last year, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google  faced internal upheaval over a contract to help the U.S. military analyze aerial drone imagery. The company defused employee uproar over the deal by not renewing the contract. 
""Historically, we've relied on companies to tell us about their ESG performance, but that doesn't work anymore,"" said Witold Henisz, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Younger generations, investors themselves and equipped with more access than ever to information about companies, are at the forefront of a more transparent, activism-fueled corporate universe, he said, stressing the importance of data when it comes to ESG investing.
Millennials are ""even willing to take lower wages if they feel like a company has a strong social purpose,"" Henisz said.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:04PM ET</span>","From wind tunnels to megadeals, the Boeing sales boss facing new MAX storm","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Days after stealing the Paris Airshow with a deal to sell 200 of the grounded 737 MAX, Boeing's sales chief faces fallout from the discovery of a new flaw that will delay the jet's return to service.
Senior vice-president Ihssane Mounir has built a reputation for striking where least expected in the global jet industry, shunning the spotlight.
Last week, he and other Boeing (NYSE:BA) executives scored a major coup in winning British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) - a big Airbus short-haul user - over to an initial $24 billion deal for the 737 MAX.
But the skills which took the 47-year-old from researching wind tunnels to the top of the $150-billion jet market face their toughest test as Boeing struggles to keep its recovery plans intact.
""We have been .. going round the clock to make sure we are working through whatever is needed for customers and the return to service,"" Mounir said. 
The surprise IAG order was the first since the MAX was grounded in March after two fatal crashes, and overshadowed the successful launch of a new Airbus model, the A321XLR.
Analysts say big discounts likely helped win the order from IAG, which on Friday declined comment on the new delay. Critics have accused Mounir of aggressive pricing to win important deals, a claim he denies, saying price is only one tool. 
Stealth, teamwork and a long-standing rapport between Mounir and IAG boss Willie Walsh also played a role, sources said.
The two, who were seen chatting at an airline summit three weeks ago, negotiated with only a handful of people in the know.
Boeing Commercial CEO Kevin McAllister and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg would be closely involved in the deal to help Boeing's cash cow.
""You have got to build trust first by demonstrating commitment. You have to be disciplined in planning. You can’t shoot from the hip and then pull a plan together – no way,"" Mounir said recently when asked about selling jets.
""At the start (of my career) I talked a lot; I was selling too much. Later I learned to listen.""
Listening is what Mounir, who has struck a humble tone in recent meetings and public appearances, will need to do as Boeing faces a new delay in approval of MAX software until September.
Many airlines want compensation, while some will see a new chance to lower prices.
""A deal like IAG's can even hurt your marketing because you have created the phrase 'I want the same deal as BA',"" said an industry official with decades of experience in trading jets.
All this means Mounir is under the spotlight, though he's not afraid of tackling intimidating odds to win deals.
Earlier this year, Mounir was in a battle with Airbus for sales of wide-body jets to IAG and Germany's Lufthansa. 
Outgoing Airbus CEO Tom Enders wanted to halt output of its loss-making A380 to hand a clean slate to successor Guillaume Faury and was reluctant to respond to BA's interest in buying the world's largest airliner at low prices, offering only A350s.
In Frankfurt, Lufthansa wanted to shed some A380s to focus on smaller airports. Mounir saw an opportunity to act creatively and build goodwill on both sides, industry sources say.
    Shuttling between Frankfurt and London, he explored the idea of buying six A380s from Lufthansa and arranging their transfer to BA in a spectacular trade-in, according to the sources.
Buying Airbus jets is part of Mounir's playbook after he bought China Eastern A340s to make room for new Boeing 777s.
This time, the tactic was not needed as BA went with Boeing and Lufthansa split its order. But in a final twist, Airbus itself bought the A380s and may end up leasing them to BA, the sources said. None of the parties or Mounir agreed to comment.
INDUSTRY POKER
The previously unreported scramble over the soon-to-be-axed A380 illustrates the intensity of aircraft industry poker.
Industry insiders compare Mounir's audacious style to former Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who retired last year after selling jets worth $1.7 trillion. Some even joke that Mounir is a new Leahy, but in the wrong company.
""Part of me sees that as flattering but there is a difference in that I am not a one-man show,"" Mounir said.
""I have a great team, people who have grown in the business and are very cohesive. We are a pack at the leadership and we are a pack at the sales level.""
Experts say Leahy also relied on a team though it is being dispersed amid management changes, leaving uncertainty over the continuity of relationships like IAG. Even so, Airbus commercial head Christian Scherer beat order forecasts for the new A321XLR.
A battle now looms over Air France, which is expected to decide on a narrow-body order soon, although Mounir says the focus remains on getting the MAX flying safely.
Born in Rabat, Mounir was appointed sales chief in 2016 after cutting his teeth in markets from Latin America to China.
At 17, speaking no English, Mounir left Morocco for Wichita, Kansas, where he studied engineering and embraced the Midwest.
""His work ethic was exceptional; he is both analytical and extremely personable,"" said Scott Miller, his professor at Wichita State University - a combination that drives business in the ruthlessly competitive but clubby world of plane deals.
The young aerodynamicist seemed headed for academia before research on topics like dynamic wind-tunnel testing caught the eye of Boeing in Seattle, where he joined the ""aero team"" in 1997 and began doing calculations on the 777 mini-jumbo. 
Switching to marketing, his first jet sale was to Ethiopian Airlines: the same carrier that suffered the second of two recent crashes leading to the MAX grounding. He attended an Ethiopian vigil in Seattle in March.
While the MAX crisis is top priority, the battle between planemakers to secure relationships with airlines continues. Ex-General Electric engine sales head McAllister - working a double act with Mounir - has helped open new doors for Boeing.

""Genuinely happy for Boeing to get the big order for the MAX. Kevin and (Ihssane) are good guys,"" AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes, one of Airbus's largest customers, tweeted last week, before adding: ""Aircraft manufacturers should value airlines.""

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 07:52PM ET</span>","Halfway through 2019, tech leads on Wall Street","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Technology stocks are Wall Street's top performers as 2019 hits half-way, with investors betting on lower interest rates, although Apple and chipmakers face turbulence related to the U.S.-China trade war. 
The S&P 500 information technology index has surged 9% in June, its strongest month in three years. That rally, and the S&P 500's (SPX) record high on June 21, reflect investors' increased appetite for risk as they become more confident the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support a slowing economy. 
It also shows that Wall Street is mostly confident that U.S. President Donald Trump, who has shown a dislike for stock market downswings, will ultimately resolve his trade conflict with China.
Looking for evidence of progress on the trade front, investors will closely watch a planned meeting this weekend between Trump and China's president, Xi Jinping, at the upcoming Group of 20 summit in Japan. 
""The risk to the downside is the greatest. If trade talks break down then we could head lower, probably a lot further, and the tech sector could be a leader to the downside,"" said Randy Frederick, Vice President of Trading & Derivatives at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). 
Other investors say their optimism about the tech stocks is grounded in expectations that the sector's earnings growth will outperform the rest of the economy over the next several years.
""Our expectations for genuine progress regarding tariffs at the G20 is quite low,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""Tech is less of a short-term tactical play, and more a belief in the long-term growth potential of the space. Certainly, it's affected by tariffs and regulation, but the growth story is still there."" 
Although just short of its April record high, the technology index is up 26% so far in 2019, leading other sectors by far and easily beating the S&P 500's 17% return. Among June's strong performing technology stocks are Nvidia (O:NVDA), Apple (O:AAPL), Xerox (N:XRX), each up over 13%.
Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Netflix (O:NFLX) all rose more than 7% in June, slightly outperforming the S&P 500's increase of just under 7% as investors increased bets on high-growth, volatile stocks.
Uncertainty related to the trade conflict and Washington's blacklisting of China's Huawei have pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 8% from its record high in April, but it is still up 27% for the year, buoyed by expectations that a slump in global sales is near its bottom and that demand is set to recover.
The benchmark chip index has surged over 5% since Tuesday, when Micron Technologies (O:MU) said it resumed some sales to Huawei and forecast a recovery in memory chip demand in the second half of the year.
Underpinning not just tech, but most of Wall Street's recent strength, is the recently increased confidence that the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as July, with interest rate futures pointing to three rate cuts this year to support already dwindling economic growth. 
The recent strong performance of technology stocks comes even as analysts predict a drop in quarterly earnings for the sector, in part due to uncertainty around the trade war. Many U.S. semiconductor companies rely on China for over half of their revenue. 
Graphic: Tech earnings expectations, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ysg1C5 
Analysts on average expect the S&P 500 IT sector's earnings per share to sink 8% in the second quarter, compared to a 0.3% increase predicted for the S&P 500, according to Refinitiv's IBES data. 
S&P 500 semiconductor companies are seen posting a much deeper 28% slump in second-quarter earnings, and a 20% drop for all of 2019. Analysts on average expect Advanced Micro Devices (O:AMD) and rival Nvidia to post declines of over 40% in earnings per share for the quarter.
A resolution of the trade conflict would lead analysts to increase their earnings estimates for the technology sector to reflect improved global economic conditions, Frederick said.

""The economy really hasn't slowed down that much. That says we're still in a cyclical market and there’s still some upside potential, and tech tends to be one of the leaders when you’re in a cyclical market,"" he said.

The company, which has struggled under a heavy debt burden and years of losses, warned in May that it expected to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after failing to obtain new financing and after the loss of key employees.
Holders of roughly 79% of its outstanding notes have agreed to the restructuring, according to Friday's filing.
The proposed restructuring will reduce the firm's funded debt from roughly $8.35 billion to $2.5 billion, according to the disclosure. Debt holders will receive about a 99% stake in the company that emerges from Chapter 11, according to the filing.
The Chapter 11 case is anticipated to begin on Monday, with the first hearing as early as Tuesday, the filing said.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Wall Street wraps up its best June in decades as G20 convenes,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street advanced in heavy trading on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Dow closing the book on their best June in generations, ahead of much-anticipated trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 summit now underway in Japan.
All three major U.S. stock indexes gained ground at the close of the week, month, quarter and first half of the year, during which time the U.S. stock market has had a remarkable run.
The S&P 500 had its best June since 1955. The Dow posted its biggest June percentage gain since 1938, the waning days of the Great Depression.
From the start of 2019, after investors fled equities amid fears of a global economic slowdown, which sent stock markets tumbling in December, the benchmark S&P 500 jumped 17.3%, its largest first-half increase since 1997.
""The market came to the realization that the world is not going to end,"" said John Ham, financial adviser at New England Investment and Retirement Group in North Andover, Massachusetts. ""Also, (Federal Reserve chair) Powell did a 180 since (the Fed's) last (interest) rate hike, which has put wind in our sails in the first half of the year.""
Trump expressed hopes that his meeting with Xi at the G20 summit will be productive, but said he had not made any promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs.
""Everybody is focused on the Trump/Xi meeting, and most investors are hoping for a ceasefire,"" Ham added. ""At this point it's just a question of how much of a ceasefire we get."" 
""They're two strong leaders who want to save face. They both want to walk away from it claiming victory."" 
Financial stocks led the gains in the S&P 500 and the Dow after the big U.S. banks passed the Federal Reserve's ""stress test,"" with the central bank giving the companies a clean bill of health. The S&P 500 Bank index <.SPXBK> gained 2.4%.
Trading volume spiked amid the annual restructuring of the Russell indexes, traditionally one of the largest trading days of the year.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 73.38 points, or 0.28%, to 26,599.96, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.84 points, or 0.58%, to 2,941.76 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 38.49 points, or 0.48%, to 8,006.24.
All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory.
Financials (SPSY), energy (SPNY) and tariff-vulnerable industrials (SPLRCI) were the biggest percentage gainers.
Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) dropped 0.9% following its announcement that design head Jony Ive is leaving the company. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that the iPhone maker would move its Mac Pro production to China from the United States.
Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year guidance due to healthy beer demand, sending its shares up 4.6%.
In economic news, consumer spending rose moderately in May and prices edged higher, implying a slowdown in economic growth and benign inflation pressures, providing the Fed rationales for a possible interest rate cut in July.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 84 new highs and 51 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.26 billion shares, compared with the 7.11 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 05:34PM ET</span>",Apple moves Mac Pro production to China from U.S.: Wall Street Journal,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is shifting manufacturing of its new Mac Pro desktop computer to China from the United States, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The move comes at a time when the Trump administration has threatened to impose new levies to cover nearly all imports from China and pressured Apple and other manufacturers to make their products in the United States if they want to avoid tariffs.
Last week, Apple asked its major suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving 15% to 30% of their production capacity from China to Southeast Asia, according to a Nikkei report.
""If true, suggests to me that Apple has tremendous confidence that the U.S. and China will be able to solve their trade dispute and do so in the near-future,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in an email.
China is a key market for Apple as well as a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18% of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter ended March.
Apple's Mac Pro, a $6,000 machine used by creative professionals, has been facing waning demand, the Journal said https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-moves-mac-pro-production-to-china-11561728769?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1.
The company does not break out sales numbers for its Mac Pro machines. The desktop is part of the company's Mac line of products, which accounted for less than 10% of Apple's total sales in 2018. In 2018, Apple sold about 18 million Mac products, compared with about 218 million iPhones.
""Like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States,"" an Apple spokesman said. ""Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process.""
Apple's decision coincides with the end of tax subsidies that it got for making the desktop in a plant in Texas run by contract manufacturer Flex Ltd, according to the Journal.
""(This) serves as a reminder that, relative to the U.S., manufacturing in China remains a lower-cost alternative and benefits from an existing infrastructure, versus having to, potentially, rebuild one in the U.S"", Forte said.
The tech giant has tapped contractor  Quanta  Computer Inc (TW:2382) to manufacture the computer and is ramping up production at a factory near Shanghai, the report said https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-moves-mac-pro-production-to-china-11561728769?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1.
Quanta did not respond to a request for comment.

Apple's shares were down marginally at $198.69.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras (SA:PETR4) believes three types of companies, including domestic fuel distribution companies such as Raizen, could be interested in purchasing its refineries, an executive said on Friday.
Speaking at an event in Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras Chief Institutional Relations Officer Roberto Furian Ardenghy said fuel distribution firms, oil producers with operations in Brazil and trading firms could buy some refineries it has on the block.
""Today, we're looking at three segments that could be interested in our facilities. The first segment is distributors, our friends at Raizen, and other companies that are here,"" Ardenghy said.
Petrobras is planning to sell off eight of its refineries in a process Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has said could raise $15 billion. Castello Branco on Thursday said one of the refineries could be sold by the end of the year.
The possible buyers Ardenghy mentioned are essentially those forecast by analysts.  Glencore  PLC (L:GLEN) and Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL], both active in commodities trading, recently entered the fuel distribution business in Brazil.

1330,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>",Boeing's 737 Max Software Outsourced to $9-an-Hour Engineers,"(Bloomberg) -- It remains the mystery at the heart of  Boeing Co  .’s 737 Max crisis: how a company renowned for meticulous design made seemingly basic software mistakes leading to a pair of deadly crashes. Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.
The Max software -- plagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw -- was developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.
Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace -- notably India.
In offices across from Seattle’s Boeing Field, recent college graduates employed by the Indian software developer HCL Technologies Ltd. occupied several rows of desks, said Mark Rabin, a former Boeing software engineer who worked in a flight-test group that supported the Max.
The coders from HCL were typically designing to specifications set by Boeing. Still, “it was controversial because it was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,” Rabin said. Frequently, he recalled, “it took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not done correctly.”
Boeing’s cultivation of Indian companies appeared to pay other dividends. In recent years, it has won several orders for Indian military and commercial aircraft, such as a $22 billion one in January 2017 to supply SpiceJet Ltd. That order included 100 737-Max 8 jets and represented Boeing’s largest order ever from an Indian airline, a coup in a country dominated by Airbus.
Based on resumes posted on social media, HCL engineers helped develop and test the Max’s flight-display software, while employees from another Indian company, Cyient Ltd., handled software for flight-test equipment.
Costly Delay
In one post, an HCL employee summarized his duties with a reference to the now-infamous model, which started flight tests in January 2016: “Provided quick workaround to resolve production issue which resulted in not delaying flight test of 737-Max (delay in each flight test will cost very big amount for Boeing).”
Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March. The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn’t rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn’t working for most buyers.
“Boeing has many decades of experience working with supplier/partners around the world,” a company spokesman said. “Our primary focus is on always ensuring that our products and services are safe, of the highest quality and comply with all applicable regulations.”
In a statement, HCL said it “has a strong and long-standing business relationship with The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and we take pride in the work we do for all our customers. However, HCL does not comment on specific work we do for our customers. HCL is not associated with any ongoing issues with 737 Max.”
Recent simulator tests by the Federal Aviation Administration suggest the software issues on Boeing’s best-selling model run deeper. The company’s shares fell this week after the regulator found a further problem with a computer chip that experienced a lag in emergency response when it was overwhelmed with data.
Engineers who worked on the Max, which Boeing began developing eight years ago to match a rival Airbus SE plane, have complained of pressure from managers to limit changes that might introduce extra time or cost.
“Boeing was doing all kinds of things, everything you can imagine, to reduce cost, including moving work from Puget Sound, because we’d become very expensive here,” said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing flight controls engineer laid off in 2017. “All that’s very understandable if you think of it from a business perspective. Slowly over time it appears that’s eroded the ability for Puget Sound designers to design.”
Rabin, the former software engineer, recalled one manager saying at an all-hands meeting that Boeing didn’t need senior engineers because its products were mature. “I was shocked that in a room full of a couple hundred mostly senior engineers we were being told that we weren’t needed,” said Rabin, who was laid off in 2015.
The typical jetliner has millions of parts -- and millions of lines of code -- and Boeing has long turned over large portions of the work to suppliers who follow its detailed design blueprints.
Starting with the 787 Dreamliner, launched in 2004, it sought to increase profits by instead providing high-level specifications and then asking suppliers to design more parts themselves. The thinking was “they’re the experts, you see, and they will take care of all of this stuff for us,” said Frank McCormick (NYSE:MKC), a former Boeing flight-controls software engineer who later worked as a consultant to regulators and manufacturers. “This was just nonsense.”
Sales are another reason to send the work overseas. In exchange for an $11 billion order in 2005 from Air India, Boeing promised to invest $1.7 billion in Indian companies. That was a boon for HCL and other software developers from India, such as Cyient, whose engineers were widely used in computer-services industries but not yet prominent in aerospace.
Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), which makes cockpit electronics, had been among the first aerospace companies to source significant work in India in 2000, when HCL began testing software there for the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company. By 2010, HCL employed more than 400 people at design, development and verification centers for Rockwell Collins in Chennai and Bangalore.
That same year, Boeing opened what it called a “center of excellence” with HCL in Chennai, saying the companies would partner “to create software critical for flight test.” In 2011, Boeing named Cyient, then known as Infotech, to a list of its “suppliers of the year” for design, stress analysis and software engineering on the 787 and the 747-8 at another center in Hyderabad.
The Boeing rival also relies in part on offshore engineers. In addition to supporting sales, the planemakers say global design teams add efficiency as they work around the clock. But outsourcing has long been a sore point for some Boeing engineers, who, in addition to fearing job losses say it has led to communications issues and mistakes.
Moscow Mistakes
Boeing has also expanded a design center in Moscow. At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in 2008, one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia 18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be connected to the electrical system, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing engineer who headed the engineers’ union from 2006 to 2010.
“Engineering started becoming a commodity,” said Vance Hilderman, who co-founded a company called TekSci that supplied aerospace contract engineers and began losing work to overseas competitors in the early 2000s.
U.S.-based avionics companies in particular moved aggressively, shifting more than 30% of their software engineering offshore versus 10% for European-based firms in recent years, said Hilderman, an avionics safety consultant with three decades of experience whose recent clients include most of the major Boeing suppliers.
With a strong dollar, a big part of the attraction was price. Engineers in India made around $5 an hour; it’s now $9 or $10, compared with $35 to $40 for those in the U.S. on an H1B visa, he said. But he’d tell clients the cheaper hourly wage equated to more like $80 because of the need for supervision, and he said his firm won back some business to fix mistakes.
HCL, once known as Hindustan Computers, was founded in 1976 by billionaire Shiv Nadar and now has more than $8.6 billion in annual sales. With 18,000 employees in the U.S. and 15,000 in Europe, HCL is a global company and has deep expertise in computing, said Sukamal Banerjee, a vice president. It has won business from Boeing on that basis, not on price, he said: “We came from a strong R&D background.”
Still, for the 787, HCL gave Boeing a remarkable price – free, according to Sam Swaro, an associate vice president who pitched HCL’s services at a San Diego conference sponsored by Avionics International magazine in June. He said the company took no up-front payments on the 787 and only started collecting payments based on sales years later, an “innovative business model” he offered to extend to others in the industry.
The 787 entered service three years late and billions of dollars over budget in 2011, in part because of confusion introduced by the outsourcing strategy. Under Dennis Muilenburg, a longtime Boeing engineer who became chief executive in 2015, the company has said that it planned to bring more work back in-house for its newest planes.
Engineer Backwater
The Max became Boeing’s top seller soon after it was offered in 2011. But for ambitious engineers, it was something of a “backwater,” said Peter Lemme, who designed the 767’s automated flight controls and is now a consultant. The Max was an update of a 50-year-old design, and the changes needed to be limited enough that Boeing could produce the new planes like cookie cutters, with few changes for either the assembly line or airlines. “As an engineer that’s not the greatest job,” he said.
Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX)., won the Max contract for cockpit displays, and it has relied in part on HCL engineers in India, Iowa and the Seattle area. A United Technologies spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Contract engineers from Cyient helped test flight test equipment. Charles LoveJoy, a former flight-test instrumentation design engineer at the company, said engineers in the U.S. would review drawings done overnight in India every morning at 7:30 a.m. “We did have our challenges with the India team,” he said. “They met the requirements, per se, but you could do it better.”
Multiple investigations – including a Justice Department criminal probe – are trying to unravel how and when critical decisions were made about the Max’s software. During the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes that killed 346 people, investigators suspect, the MCAS system pushed the planes into uncontrollable dives because of bad data from a single sensor.
That design violated basic principles of redundancy for generations of Boeing engineers, and the company apparently never tested to see how the software would respond, Lemme said. “It was a stunning fail,” he said. “A lot of people should have thought of this problem – not one person – and asked about it.”
Boeing also has disclosed that it learned soon after Max deliveries began in 2017 that a warning light that might have alerted crews to the issue with the sensor wasn’t installed correctly in the flight-display software. A Boeing statement in May, explaining why the company didn’t inform regulators at the time, said engineers had determined it wasn’t a safety issue.
“Senior company leadership,” the statement added, “was not involved in the review.”"

But the real drama is still to come: a meeting between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The leaders were set to meet Saturday local time for an hour in hopes of setting up a process to resolve Sino-U.S. trade differences. The Trump administration has raised tariffs on goods imported from China. China has retaliated by boosting tariffs on U.S. goods, with farm products very hard hit.
The S&P 500 finished with a 0.6% gain and a 6.9% gain for June. The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.5%. The S&P had its best June performance since 1955, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The Dow's 7.2% gain for the month was its best since 1938. The Nasdaq was up 7.4% on the month.
But the finish had a familiar ring to it. The market opened with a big jump only to fall back as the day wore on. The Dow was up as many as 111 points in the session before falling back to a small decline. A last-minute surge of buying pushed the indexes to more respectable finishes.
Pressuring the Dow were components Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which retreated during the day. So, too, did health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which fell in part because of an executive shakeup and worries about what might happen to the private health insurance business after most Democratic candidates spent much of the last two nights criticizing it. Sen. Bernie Sanders vowed to put them all out of business.
But big banks enjoyed a big day after the Federal Reserve said the nation's largest financial institutions passed their annual stress tests and could boost dividend payouts substantially. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were the top Dow performers, with gains of 2.7% and 2.65% respectively. Together, they contributed 56 points to the Dow's gain.
The Nasdaq 100 index was down 10 points at about 3 PM ET (19:00 GMT) with Apple, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cisco and Microsoft contributing cutting 29 points off the index. Late buying for those stocks trimmed the losses. Meanwhile, gains for such stocks as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and chip stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) pushed the index to a 0.2% gain.
Gold was up slightly, with the August contract up 0.1% to $1,413.70 an ounce. Gold was up nearly 8% for the month, nearly 9% for the second quarter and 10.3% for the year.
The gains are tied to falling interest rates and the Federal Reserve's vow to support the economic recovery. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 2% on Friday, a decline of 6.6% for June and 25.5% this year. Investors have worried about a global economic slowdown. In addition, Trump has criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.
WTI oil futures settled down 96 cents to $58.47 a barrel. The August contract Brent oil futures, the global benchmark, closed flat at $66.55 a barrel. The more-active September contract fell 93 cent to $64.74.
Members of OPEC will meet next week on whether to continue cutting production to support prices. Oil prices were up about 2% on the week. For the year, WTI is still up 28.8%, with Brent up nearly 24%."
1332,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 04:40PM ET</span>","StockBeat - Banks Climb After Fed Signs off on Dividend, Buyback Plans","Investing.com - Wall Street banks climbed Friday as investors cheered news the Federal Reserve had given the lenders the nod to dole out large sums of cash to shareholders.
The Fed on Thursday said the banks had passed the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (stress test), paving the way for the banks to go ahead with plans to ramp up dividends and stock buybacks.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were on track to end the day 2.5% higher or more, with the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLF) up more than 1.4%. The ETF's top 10 holdings include JPMorgan, Citi, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Goldman Sachs.
As members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. JPMorgan's and Goldman Sachs' gains contributed 55 points to the Dow's gain of nearly 60 points as of 1:40 p.m. ET ( 17:40 GMT)
JPMorgan revealed plans to buy back $29.4 billion in shares this cycle and raise its quarterly dividend 12.5% to 90 cents a share, taking the total cash returned to shareholders to $40 billion over the next year.
Citigroup said it would target up to $17.1 billion in stock buybacks and bolster its dividend by 13.3% to 51 cents a share.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), up 2.8%, said it will look to buy back $23.1 billion in stock in the next year and increase its dividend 13.3% to 51 cents a share.
The two-part stress tests, the first of which was carried out last week, are administered annually by the Federal Reserve and aim to test whether a large bank is sufficiently capitalized to survive a sudden economic crisis."
1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>",Luxury online reseller The RealReal closes up more than 40% in debut,"(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. online luxury reseller The RealReal Inc (O:REAL) closed up more 40% in their debut on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.4 billion and signaling investor appetite for listings of consumer companies.
The shares opened at $28, above their initial public offering price of $20, and closed at $28.90. 
The offering of 15 million shares was priced at $20, above the expected range of $17 and $19 per share, helping the company raise $300 million in net proceeds.
The personal luxury goods market is expected to grow to between $364 billion and $415 billion in 2025, with millennials expected to represent 40% of the market, according to research firm Bain & Co.
The vast majority of The RealReal's business is in the United States and Chief Executive Julie Wainwright said the company would eventually expand abroad. 
""We have a huge opportunity in front of us. Two-thirds of it’s outside the U.S. so at some point we’ll go overseas but not in the near term,"" Wainwright said in a telephone interview. 
The RealReal is a marketplace for second-hand luxury items including clothing and accessories. People can list their unwanted luxury goods, some that are either used or still have tags on them, and the company then takes a cut when a sale is made.
The RealReal, which started out as a business run from Wainwright's kitchen table, now processes nearly 2 million orders per year. It has expanded its physical presence by opening two brick-and-mortar stores in Manhattan and one in Los Angeles that collect as well as sell goods.
The company has been thriving on the rising sales of second-hand, or vintage, luxury goods - from Chanel handbags and Gucci dresses to Rolex watches - banking on growing millennial interest in the price and environmental benefits of recycled clothing.
Rival resellers are looking to cash in on the booming market, including thredUP, which branched into luxury last year, and established players like Vestiaire Collective.
The top-selling luxury designers on The RealReal's online marketplace include Cartier, Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Gucci, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Rolex, Tiffany and Valentino.
The company posted a net loss of $75.8 million in 2018, compared with a loss of $52.3 million in 2017, on revenue of $207.4 million, up over 55%, its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.

Investors in the San Francisco-based company include Perella Weinberg Partners and Great Hill Partners.

M&T Bank Corp (N:MTB) was the only one of the index's stocks down slightly as at least one analyst said its payout plan was lighter than expected. JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  (N:C) were the group's biggest boosts with gains over 2%, followed by advances of about 2% for  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).
All 18 banks undergoing the Fed's annual stress test were given the all-clear, although the central bank placed conditions on Credit Suisse's (N:CS) U.S. operations after finding weaknesses in its capital planning processes.
The Fed's stamp of approval for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was a major boost since it flunked the test in 2015, 2016 and 2018.
JPMorgan and  Capital One  (N:COF) passed the test though both had to pare back their capital plans, after initial plans showed that each would see capital levels drop below regulatory minimums under a severe economic downturn, according to a senior Fed official.
Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin estimated that the average bank would be returning about 10.5% of its market capitalization in dividends and buybacks from the third quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020. He said total payout ratios for universals averages at about 125% of net income estimates.
Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), JPMorgan, and  Northern Trust  Corp (O:NTRS) had notably larger payouts than Usdin's estimates, while Capital One, Discover Financial Services (N:DFS), and M&T were lightest compared with his estimates. 

Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  State Street  Corp (N:STT), which received conditional passes last year, passed without conditions this year. Goldman Sachs, which is not in the S&P bank index was up more than 3%.

1335,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",Bond Traders Are Eager to Get Past G-20 and Focus on Data Again,"(Bloomberg) -- News from Osaka could ambush markets at any point, so now is the time to give some thought to why economic data in the days ahead -- and especially next Friday’s U.S. jobs report -- will be crucial for bond investors.
The U.S.-China trade dispute that’s the focal point in this weekend’s Group-of-20 meeting has helped push 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest level since 2016. But the strength of American payrolls has been one of the few tethers on the bond bull market. The 3.6% unemployment rate is the lowest since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell got his drivers’ license, by his own testimony. And it’s exhibit A for those who say the near-record economic expansion can continue.
Cracks may be starting to show in the labor market. Data for May showed a big slowdown in payroll growth, adding to concerns about the impact of tariffs against a darkening global economic backdrop. A second straight disappointment could see yields breach their recent lows. For Chuck Tomes at Manulife Asset Management, the biggest risk to market positioning is a strong report that also hints at climbing wage pressures.
“If that came with average hourly earnings surprising to the upside as well, you could see a sharp move in a short period of time,” with yields spiking higher, said the portfolio manager. “If you combine that with positive headlines from the G-20 and a move towards an agreement happening, that could have implications for the U.S. Treasury market and pricing for the Fed.”
Traders are betting the Fed will take more drastic action than the modest cut it seems to be leaning toward as soon as next month. Market pricing reflects expectations the central bank will cut rates by around a percentage point in the coming year.
The market’s view may start to look more likely if the next round of purchasing managers indexes show a further slide in activity in the world’s largest economies. Manufacturing sectors have broadly weakened, and the coming days bring reports from China and Europe. Service-sector data, which have generally held up better, are due Wednesday in the U.S. That’s the day before U.S. markets shut for the July 4 holiday.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital’s head of macro research, Ajay Rajadhyaksha, says that even if there’s a truce in trade hostilities following this weekend and payrolls rebound, U.S. yields are unlikely to rise more than a few basis points.
As long as inflation remains weak globally, and with negative yields making large swaths of non-U.S. markets “uninvestible” at this point, he doubts that much of the rally over the last couple of months will be reversed."
1336,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",Sarepta surges after Pfizer gene therapy data raises safety concerns,"By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - Shares of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc (O:SRPT) surged 15% on Friday after some safety concerns were raised in a small, early-stage study of a competing gene therapy for a rare muscle-wasting disorder from  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE).
Sarepta reported promising data from its study last year and is in a race with Pfizer and  Solid Biosciences  Inc (O:SLDB) to first market a gene therapy for the genetic degenerative disorder that affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 males.
Shares of Pfizer were marginally up in midday trading, while Sarepta shares were up 15% and Solid Biosciences was up about 10%.
Baird analyst Brian Skorney said Pfizer fell way short on both safety and efficacy, making Sarepta' position in the space even stronger. 
Sarepta already has a treatment, Exondys 51, in the market for some form of the disease.
People with the condition lack the protein dystrophin needed to keep muscle cells intact. That can lead to life-threatening damage to the heart, and over time, death, often at a young age.
Pfizer's six-patient study tested two different dosages of the gene therapy in boys in the age group of 6 to 12. Two months after receiving the one-time therapy, mini-dystrophin expression levels ranged from 10% to 60% of normal.
Skorney said all measures of expression looked worse. ""More importantly, it just did not look safe.""
Two Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients in the trial experienced side effects that landed them in the hospital, the company said.
The higher tested dose appeared to be more effective, according to data presented by Pfizer at the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy conference in Orlando, Florida.
Pfizer said it had paused enrollment in the study and then modified the study protocol in order to mitigate future risks of similar safety events.
The company said future trials will use the higher dose, which had triple the concentration of virus with genetic material. The U.S. drugmaker said it also may test an intermediate dose.
Both of the boys who required hospital treatment had received the higher dose.
One had developed a kidney injury. He was hospitalized for 11 days and received two doses of Alexion's (O:ALXN) Soliris, but left the hospital with normal kidney function.

The other suffered nausea and vomiting after the treatment and spent two days in a hospital.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 02:09PM ET</span>",Third Point tells United Technologies that it opposes Raytheon merger,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb said on Friday that his hedge fund Third Point LLC will vote against the planned merger of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) and  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), saying there is no ""strategic rationale for this transaction.""
""We have concluded that the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,"" Loeb wrote in a letter to the board of directors at United Technologies. Reuters saw a copy of the letter.
Loeb sent his letter three weeks after United Technologies announced a $120 billion merger with defense contractor Raytheon, making for one of the largest aero-defense deals ever.
Loeb criticizes management for turning back on plans to sharpen its focus and accountability by breaking itself into three businesses; aerospace, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.
Neither United Technologies nor Raytheon was immediately available to comment.
Calling the planned merger a ""baffling change in UTC’s strategy,"" Loeb wrote ""the rationale for the breakup was to increase focus and accountability. This transaction represents a clear reversal.""
Loeb is now the second powerful Wall Street investor to oppose the deal after rival hedge fund manager William Ackman wrote to United Technologies to complain even before the deal was publicly announced.
Both Loeb and Ackman, widely respected as powerful activist investors, pushed last year for the company to sharpen its focus and supported the planned split into three businesses.
Neither Loeb, whose firm owns 0.75 percent of the company, nor Ackman, whose Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management holds a 0.67 percent, would have the shares to single-handedly derail the deal. But both men said they are confident that other investors are similarly outraged and will also oppose it.
Both men accused United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes of trying to extend his reach with Loeb writing on Friday that a ""sweetheart employment agreement"" for Hayes would ""entrench him for another half a decade ultimately as both CEO and Chairman of the Board!""
Bloomberg first reported that Loeb sent the letter to United Technologies.

United Technologies' deal with Raytheon faces regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Defense Department and big customers like  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) will have a lot of clout in the antitrust review, and may worry about over-reliance on one company for a big suite of products.

As Merlin Entertainments will now merge into Blackstone, the former will no longer be available on the stock market. In doing so, the two companies have made one of Europe's largest private equity deals (deals that are not traded publicly) for years.
Merlin Entertainments said on Friday that the move would give the company more possibilities for ""significant long-term investment"" as well as delivering on growth plans.
Blackstone, the founding family and private equity firm of Lego, is currently undergoing expansion in China where it plans to more than double its number of shops this year. By increasing its shop number to 140, the Danish company will have achieved its most rapid expansion in any market.
Merlin is also looking to China for investment, with three Madame Tussauds operating in the country. In January, the company announced that it was in the advanced stages of talks regarding numerous potential sites for Legoland Parks in the country.
Through its investments in China and elsewhere, Lego is attempting to stabilize its sales. The plastic-brick manufacturer is currently battling with a market that is dominated by digital entertainment products. For the first time in a decade, Lego saw a drop in its sales in 2017.
Merlin Entertainments is currently the second largest operator of visitor attractions after Disney. Some of the brands they operate include Alton Towers, the London Eye and Thorpe Park. Across 120 attractions, spanning 25 countries, Merlin saw 67 million people visit its sites last year.

Top-level talks about the restructuring took place on Thursday and Friday, but no final decisions have been made, a source close to the matter told Reuters.
Deutsche Bank is completing a plan that may eliminate hundreds of positions in equities trading and research, as well as derivatives trading, as part of a broad restructuring, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources. 
Sources told Reuters last week that the bank plans to cut the size of its U.S. equities business, leaving only a skeleton operation in place to service corporate and high-net-worth clients.
Members of Deutsche's supervisory board discussed those plans on a call earlier this month and agreed that large-scale cuts were necessary in the bank's U.S. equities and rates trading businesses, Reuters reported, citing the sources.

Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is trying to convince investors he can turn around Germany's biggest bank, whose shares hit a record low this month. He told investors at the annual meeting last month that Deutsche was prepared to make ""tough cutbacks"" at its investment bank

CITTÀ DI CASTELLO, Italy (Reuters) - Amazon's new recruit comes from a medieval walled town in central Italy and can box and seal at least 600 items of different shapes and sizes every hour. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
That recruit is the CartonWrap, brainchild of CMC, a small firm that is just one of 630 Italian companies making automated packaging machines - one of Italy's fastest growing industries, raking in nearly 8 billion euros in 2018, or about a quarter of the world market.
Machinery is Italy's top export, worth almost 50 billion euros ($57 billion) last year and a rare bright spot for a stagnant economy plagued by low productivity and high unemployment.
And leading the pack is - automated packaging - growing nine times faster than the economy as a whole, according to the trade association UCIMA.
""We doubled our turnover in the last three years and I think we will double it again in the next three years,"" said CMC Chief Executive Francesco Ponti.
His father, Giuseppe, a technician with a local packaging company, founded CMC in 1980 in a domestic garage not far from the frescoed 16th century palazzi of Città di Castello.
It now employs 300 people and has revenues of 50 million euros - thanks mainly to CartonWrap, which measures goods coming down a conveyor belt through a scanner and wraps each in a custom-made box.
Both Amazon (O:AMZN) and Walmart (N:WMT) are customers, though Ponti said client relationships were confidential. Others include the Italian fashion group Gucci, the French retailer Leclerc and the Dutch online shop Bol.com.
FASTER AND CLEANER 
At up to 1,000 boxes per hour, CartonWrap machines not only pack much faster than humans; they also save money by reducing packaging waste, CMC says. 
""We were doing it manually but the problem was handling the volumes,"" Tim Fronzek, co-founder of the German online retailer reBuy.com, which dispatches up to 25,000 items a day, told a CMC customer presentation.
""The machines have allowed us to manage the packaging process more efficiently, and process all outbound shipments in just a few hours with the help of two or three employees.""
The machines may not eat lunch but they do need breaks, for on-site technicians to fix problems and clean away the excess hot glue that can clog the machine.
Production capacity is also limited - CMC can only make five or six machines a month, though it plans to double that soon.
""Scale is a problem for our industry and consolidation is already under way,"" said Maurizio Marchesini, chairman of Marchesini Group, which specializes in packaging for pharmaceutical products. 
While Italian and German companies dominate the automated packaging market, Chinese competition is growing.
The German robotics firm Kuka and the Italian Romaco group have both been bought by Chinese firms in the last three years - and across industrialized countries, humans will soon become redundant on many packaging lines.
Back at CMC, Francesco Ponti is relaxed.
""There are no more people who want to do this job by hand,"" he said. 

""If automation grows, the (number of) people who work in automation grow, and the quality of their work will be much better than it is today.""

WASHINGTON/LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers working for Western intelligence agencies broke into Russian internet search company Yandex in late 2018, deploying a rare type of malware in an attempt to spy on user accounts, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The malware, called Regin, is known to be used by the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing alliance of the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the sources said. Intelligence agencies in those countries declined to comment.
Western cyberattacks against Russia are seldom acknowledged or spoken about in public. It could not be determined which of the five countries was behind the attack on Yandex, said sources in Russia and elsewhere, three of whom had direct knowledge of the hack. The breach took place between October and November 2018.
Yandex spokesman Ilya Grabovsky acknowledged the incident in a statement to Reuters, but declined to provide further details.
""This particular attack was detected at a very early stage by the Yandex security team. It was fully neutralized before any damage was done,"" he said. ""Yandex security team's response ensured that no user data was compromised by the attack.""
The company, widely known as ""Russia's Google"" for its array of online services from internet search to email and taxi reservations, says it has more than 108 million monthly users in Russia. It also operates in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Turkey.
The sources who described the attack to Reuters said the hackers appeared to be searching for technical information that could explain how Yandex authenticates user accounts. Such information could help a spy agency impersonate a Yandex user and access their private messages.
The hack of Yandex's research and development unit was intended for espionage purposes rather than to disrupt or steal intellectual property, the sources said. The hackers covertly maintained access to Yandex for at least several weeks without being detected, they said.
The Regin malware was identified as a Five Eyes tool in 2014 following revelations by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden.
Reports by The Intercept, in partnership with a Dutch and Belgian newspaper, tied an earlier version of Regin to a hack at Belgian telecom firm Belgacom in 2013 and said British spy agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the NSA were responsible. At the time GCHQ declined to comment and the NSA denied involvement.
'CROWN JEWEL'
Security experts say attributing cyberattacks can be difficult because of obfuscation methods used by hackers.
But some of the Regin code found on Yandex's systems had not been deployed in any known previous cyberattacks, the sources said, reducing the risk that attackers were deliberately using known Western hacking tools to cover their tracks.
Yandex called in Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky, which established the attackers were targeting a group of developers inside Yandex, three sources said. A private assessment by Kaspersky, described to Reuters, concluded hackers likely tied to Western intelligence breached Yandex using Regin. 
A Kaspersky spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian government was not aware of this particular attack on Yandex. ""Yandex and other Russian companies are attacked every day. Many attacks come from Western countries,"" he said.
Moscow-based Yandex, listed on the NASDAQ in the United States and the Moscow Exchange, has come under tighter regulatory control by the Russian government after the passage of new internet laws.
U.S. cybersecurity firm Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) said it had also recently discovered a new version of Regin. Symantec declined to discuss where this sample was discovered, citing client confidentiality. 
""Regin is the crown jewel of attack frameworks used for espionage. Its architecture, complexity and capability sits in a ballpark of its own,"" Vikram Thakur, technical director at Symantec Security Response, told Reuters. ""We have seen different components of Regin in the past few months.""

""Based on the victimology coupled with the investment required to create, maintain, and operate Regin, we believe there are at best a handful of countries that could be behind its existence,"" said Thakur. ""Regin came back on the radar in 2019.""

The shares opened at their IPO price of 27 euros ($30.75) and then slipped slightly to 26.64 euros a share. Germany's benchmark DAX index was flat.
Weak demand for German listings forced VW to scale back its IPO of Traton and it priced the offering at the low end of its target range. 
On Wednesday, online fashion retailer Global Fashion Group slashed its initial public offer price, citing ""current market conditions"", in a bid to salvage its stock market listing.
Volkswagen floated 11.5% of Traton's shares in a scaled back initial public offering which had initially sought to list a stake of up to 25% of the shares and put the company's truck business on an independent footing. 
Proceeds from the offering will flow to parent Volkswagen which aims to use the funding to invest in mass producing electric cars.
Traton, which includes the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen trucks businesses wants to create a global trucks operation.
A flotation could give Traton the resources to deepen its relationship with U.S. truck maker  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV), in which it currently owns a 16.85% stake.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google appears to have leveraged Android dominance - India watchdog,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Google (O:GOOGL) appears to have misused its dominant position in India and reduced the ability of device manufacturers to opt for alternate versions of its Android mobile operating system, Indian officials found before ordering a wider probe in an antitrust case.
A 14-page order from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), reviewed by Reuters this week, found Google's restrictions on manufacturers seemed to amount to imposition of ""unfair conditions"" under India's competition law.
Reuters reported last month that the CCI had launched a probe in April against Google for its alleged abuse of Android's dominant position to block rivals, but the contents of the directive detailing the initial assessment upon which that investigation was ordered have not been previously revealed.
The Indian case is similar to one Google faced in Europe, where regulators imposed a $5 billion fine on the company for forcing manufacturers to pre-install its apps on Android devices. Google has appealed against the verdict. 
By making pre-installation of Google's proprietary apps conditional, Google ""reduced the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operated on alternate versions of Android"", the CCI said in the order. ""It amounts to prima facie leveraging of Google's dominance"".
Asked for comment, Google referred Reuters to its statement last month, in which it said Android had enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. Google looked forward to working with the CCI ""to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less"", the company said at the time.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
While the order, dated April 16, called for a wider probe against Google, the watchdog's investigations unit could still clear Google of any wrongdoing.
The amount of any fine that could be imposed on Google if the CCI rules against it was not clear.
ANDROID DOMINANCE
Android, used by device makers for free, features on about 88 percent of the world's smartphones. In India, about 99 percent of the smartphones sold this year used the platform, Counterpoint Research estimates.
In the EU case, regulators said Google forced manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser, together with its Google Play app store, on Android devices, giving it an unfair advantage.
In the Indian case, Google argued that Android was an open source platform and pre-installation obligations were ""limited in scope"", the CCI order said.
The CCI said that complainants in the Indian case - which according to sources involve more than one person - have alleged that Google engaged in abusive behavior similar to the kind outlined in the European case. They said Google was engaged in anti-competitive practices ""with the aim of cementing Google's dominant position"".
Google's ""impugned conduct may help perpetuate its dominance in online search markets while resulting in denial of market access for competing search apps"", the CCI said in its order. 
The investigations arm of the CCI should complete the wider probe in the case within 150 days, the order said, though such cases at the watchdog typically drag on for years.
The CCI also said the role of any Google executive in alleged abuse of the Android platform should also be examined.
The investigation is not the only antitrust headache for the Mountain View, California-based company in one of its key growth markets. Last year, the CCI imposed a fine of 1.36 billion rupees ($20 million) on Google for ""search bias"" and abuse of its dominant position.

Google appealed against that order, saying the ruling could cause it ""irreparable"" harm and reputational loss. That appeal is still pending in an Indian tribunal.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Special Report: Why the military still stands by Venezuela's beleaguered president,"By Brian Ellsworth and Mayela Armas
CARACAS (Reuters) - One of the central mysteries of Venezuela's slow-motion collapse: Why does the military continue to support Nicolas Maduro, the president who has led the once-prosperous South American country into poverty and chaos?
The answer, according to people familiar with Venezuela's military structure, starts with Maduro's late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, the charismatic caudillo who cemented strongman socialist rule in the nation of about 30 million people. 
In a series of actions that began in 1999, the former lieutenant colonel and one-time coup leader began taming the military by bloating it, buying it off, politicizing it, intimidating the rank and file, and fragmenting the overall command.
Once he took office in 2013, Maduro handed key segments of the country's increasingly ravaged economy to the armed forces. Select military officers took control of the distribution of food and key raw materials. A National Guard general and military deputies now manage the all-important national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].
The two leaders also embedded intelligence agents, with the help of Cuba's security services, within barracks, former officers say, instilling paranoia and defusing most dissent before it happens. Intelligence agents have arrested and jailed scores of perceived troublemakers, including several high-profile officers, even for minor infractions.
The overhaul, former military officials say, created a jumbled and partisan chain of command. Top officers, grateful for perks and fearful of retribution, are often more preoccupied with pleasing Socialist Party chiefs than with national defense. Instead of drills and war games, some generals find themselves fielding calls to plant vegetables or clear garbage.
Many lower-ranking soldiers, destitute and desperate like most of Venezuela's working class, have deserted the military in recent years, joining at least 4 million other fellow emigres seeking a better life elsewhere. But few senior officers have heeded the opposition's call for rebellion, leaving the armed forces top-heavy, unwieldy and still standing by Maduro.
""The chain of command has been lost,"" said Cliver Alcala, a former general who retired in 2013 and now supports the opposition from Colombia. ""There is no way to know who is in charge of operations, who is in charge of administration and who is in charge of policy.""
Some commanders, like Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, a four-star general, are nearly as much a face of the administration as Maduro. Padrino is sanctioned by the United States for ensuring Maduro's ""hold on the military and the government while the Venezuelan people suffer,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Department.
Reuters was unable to reach Padrino or other senior officers mentioned in this article. Venezuela's defense ministry didn't reply to email or telephone inquiries. The country's information ministry, responsible for government communications including those of the president, didn't reply to Reuters either. 
Padrino is hardly alone. 
Consider the sheer number of officers awarded flag rank in Venezuela. 
The country's roughly 150,000 Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard troops are a fraction of the more than 1 million who make up the U.S. armed forces. Yet Venezuela, with as many as 2,000 admirals and generals, now boasts as much as twice the top brass as the U.S. military – more than 10 times as many flag officers as existed when Chavez became president. 
The estimate is according to calculations by former Venezuelan officers and the U.S. military.
The result, government opponents say, is a bureaucratic and operational mess, even at the very top. 
Padrino, for instance, is both a general and defense minister. But he can't officially mobilize troops without the consent of Remigio Ceballos, an admiral who also reports directly to Maduro and heads the Strategic Operations Command, an agency created by Chavez to oversee deployments.
""You have a general in chief and an admiral in chief,"" said Hebert Garcia, a retired general who once served under Maduro but now supports the opposition from Washington. ""Which one are you supposed to obey?""
The armed forces could still turn on Maduro, particularly if popular outrage boils over and makes military support for the president untenable. Still, calls by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who in late April unsuccessfully sought to rally the troops against Maduro, thus far remain unheeded.
Guaido in May told reporters his efforts to convert troops are thwarted by the military's fragmented structure and intimidation within its ranks. ""What is preventing the break?"" he asked. ""The ability to speak openly, directly with each of the sectors. It has to do with the persecution inside the Socialist Party, inside the armed forces.""
To better understand the pressures and policies keeping the troops in Maduro's camp, Reuters interviewed dozens of current and former officers, soldiers, military scholars and people familiar with Venezuelan security. In their assessment, the military has evolved into a torpid bureaucracy with few leaders capable of engineering the type of mass mutiny that Maduro's opponents long for.
""REAL POWER""
Venezuela's ""Bolivarian Revolution,"" as Chavez dubbed his remaking of the country, itself has roots in military rebellion. Six years before he was elected president in 1998, Chavez led a failed coup against Carlos Andres Perez, a deeply unpopular president who Congress eventually forced from office.
Once in power, Chavez immediately took steps to enlist the military in his vision for a paternalistic, state-led economy that would share abundant oil wealth with long-neglected segments of Venezuela's population.
With a new constitution in December 1999, Chavez stripped Congress of its oversight of promotion of senior officers. That gave the president ultimate authority to assign flag ranks and empower allied officers.
Because many state and local governments at the time were still controlled by rivals, Chavez also saw the military as a tool that could show his administration hard at work. A new program, ""Plan Bolivar 2000,"" ordered troops to fill potholes, clean highways, refurbish schools and carry out other public works.
The $114 million effort put sizeable sums at the discretion of commanders, giving officers a taste for a new kind of influence. ""What Plan Bolivar 2000 taught officers was that real power doesn't lie in commanding troops, but rather in controlling money,"" said one retired general. The general, who served under Chavez and Maduro, spoke on condition of anonymity.
Soon, some of the funds began to disappear.
Miguel Morffe, a retired major, once worked as a captain in the remote northwestern region of La Guajira. He recalls receiving a request from superiors to provide materials for an unspecified schoolhouse. When Morffe told a lieutenant colonel that he didn't understand where the supplies would be going, the superior told him: ""I need those materials for something else.""
""The school didn't exist,"" Morffe concluded.
Military officials didn't reply to questions about the alleged incident.
By 2001, a raft of corruption allegations plagued the Plan Bolivar program.
Chavez fired General Victor Cruz, the Army's commander in charge of the program. Cruz denied wrongdoing and wasn't charged with any crime at the time. Venezuelan authorities arrested him last year when press reports linked him to funds in an offshore account. A Caracas court in May ordered him to stand trial on charges of illicit enrichment. 
Reuters couldn't reach Cruz for comment or identify his legal counsel.
In 2002, Chavez said he would wind down Plan Bolivar 2000.
Regional elections, he told Chilean sociologist and political activist Marta Harnecker in an interview, had put more allies in mayoral and state offices, where they could now work in unison with the national government. The military, he said, would return to its normal business.
That April, however, a small group of top officers emboldened Chavez to further remake the armed forces. Encouraged by conservative leaders and wealthy elites unhappy with his leftist agenda, the officers staged a coup and briefly arrested Chavez.
But the coup unraveled. Within two days, Chavez was back in power.
He purged the top ranks. More importantly, he reined in several powerful offices, including the Defense Ministry. Henceforth, the ministry would manage military budgets and weapons procurement, but no longer control troops themselves. Chavez created the Strategic Operations Command, the agency that manages deployments.
The move, former officers say, jumbled the chain of command.
He also rethought overall strategy.
Increasingly concerned that Venezuela's oil wealth and leftist policies would make it a target for invasion, particularly by the United States, Chavez pushed for the military to integrate further with the government and society itself. 
""We're transforming the armed forces for a war of resistance, for the anti-imperialist popular war, for the integral defense of the nation,"" he said at a 2004 National Guard ceremony.
Military leaders soon had to pledge their allegiance to Chavez and his Bolivarian project, not just the nation itself. Despite resistance from some commanders, the ruling party slogan, ""Fatherland, Socialism or Death,"" began echoing through barracks and across parade grounds.
As of 2005, another factor helped Chavez tighten his hold on power. Oil prices, years before fracking would boost global supply, soared along with the notion the planet's reserves were dwindling. For most of the rest of his time in power, the windfall would enable Chavez to accelerate spending and ensure popular support.
Oil money also helped him strengthen relationships with like-minded countries, especially those seeking to counterbalance the United States. Venezuela purchased billions of dollars in arms and equipment from Russia and China. It secured medical and educational support through doctors, teachers and other advisors arriving from Cuba, the closest ally of all.
Cubans came with military know-how, too.
A ""cooperation agreement"" forged between Chavez and Fidel Castro years earlier had by now blossomed into an alliance on security matters, according to two former officers. Around 2008, Venezuelan officers say they began noticing Cuban officials working within various parts of the armed forces.
General Antonio Rivero, who the previous five years had managed Venezuela's civil protection authority, says he returned to military activities that year to find Cuban advisors leading training of soldiers and suggesting operational and administrative changes. 
The Cubans, he told Reuters, advised Chavez to rework the ranks, once built around strategic centers, into more of a territorial system, spreading the military's presence further around the country. Rivero was stunned at one training session on military engineering. A Cuban colonel leading the session told attendees the meeting and its contents should be considered a state secret.
""What's happening here?"" Rivero said he asked himself. ""How is a foreign military force going to possess a state secret?""
Rivero left Venezuela for the United States in 2014.
Cuban officials didn't respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
The island's influence soon would become apparent in day-to-day operations.
In Cuba, the military is involved in everything from public works to telecommunications to tourism. In Venezuela, too, ruling party officials increasingly began ordering officers to take part in activities that had little to do with military preparedness. Soldiers increasingly became cheap labor for governors and mayors.
In 2010, a former general working in the Andes, a western region on the Colombian border, was overseeing a complex mobilization of 5,000 troops for a month of combat training. The general spoke on condition that he not be named.
Another general, from a nearby command, called and asked him to halt the exercises. The state governor, the other officer told the general, wanted to reroute the troops - to install energy-efficient light bulbs in homes.
When the general refused, Army Commander Euclides Campos issued a formal order to scrap the training. ""This would sound shocking to any military professional, but it's exactly how the Venezuelan armed forces work,"" the former general said.
Reuters was unable to reach Campos for comment.
""TRAITORS NEVER!""
Chavez, stricken by cancer, died in 2013. Maduro, his vice president and hand-picked replacement as the Socialist party candidate for president, won the election to succeed him.
The new president continued naming new flag officers and appointed even more military officials to helm agencies. By 2017, active and former military figures had held as many as half of Maduro's 32 cabinet posts, according to Citizen Control, a Venezuelan non-profit that studies the armed forces.
In 2014, just as a collapse in oil prices torpedoed Venezuela's economy, Maduro further fragmented the military structure.
Following the advice of the Cubans, former military officers say, Maduro created new command centers nationwide. He appointed senior officers to run new commands in each of the 23 states and Caracas, the capital, as well as eight regional commands above those. His public speeches are now increasingly peppered with terms like ZODI and REDI, acronyms for the new commands.
Near military facilities, new brass abounded.
""Before, seeing a general was like seeing a bishop or an archbishop, he was an important figure,"" recalls Morffe, the retired major. ""Not long ago, I saw one in an airport. He walked past a group of soldiers and they didn't even salute.""
Flag officers now oversee some areas that were once slivers of larger commands, in areas so remote that they have few human inhabitants. The largest landmass in the Western Maritime and Insular Command, overseen by an admiral, is a rocky archipelago with little vegetation and no permanent residents. 
The officer, Vice Admiral Rodolfo Sanchez, didn't respond to a Reuters phone call to his office.
The lopsided, partisan structure has led to mission creep, former officers say.
In the Andes command, which oversees three states, six generals once oversaw roughly 13,000 troops, according to officers familiar with the region. Today, at least 20 generals are now managing ranks that have dwindled to as few as 3,000 soldiers, according to officers familiar with the region.
Last August, three of the generals, including the regional commander, met with municipal officials in the state of Tachira, a hotbed of protests against Maduro in recent years. Days earlier, the government had said explosives used in a drone attack on a military parade in Caracas had been smuggled through Tachira from Colombia.
""All of us together can solve this problem,"" Major General Manuel Bernal told the assembled officers and a group of onlookers, including a Reuters reporter.
Bernal wasn't talking about the drones, however. Or even national security, once a major issue in the Andean region, where Colombia's guerrilla war long posed a threat. Instead, the generals had gathered to talk about trash overflowing at a landfill. They deployed soldiers to clear garbage and put out a fire there. 
A communications official for the Andes command didn't respond to a Reuters request to speak with Bernal about the episode.
Military bosses show few signs of shying away from such directives. In the weeks since Guaido's failed call to arms, senior officers have reiterated their commitment to Maduro.
""We will continue fulfilling our constitutional duties, fulfilling duties under your command,"" Defense Minister Padrino told Maduro alongside troops gathered in Caracas in early May.
""Loyal always!"" Padrino shouted.

The troops responded in unison: ""Traitors never!""

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",The best first half for financial markets ever,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - What a six months for financial markets. Global equities have piled on $8 trillion, bonds are on fire, oil prices have surged by almost a quarter and a Greek bank is one of the world's best performing stocks.
Everything added together it may well be the best first half of a year ever and one that not even the most wily investor would have predicted after the dire end to 2018 and what has happened since. 
The world's two top economies are slugging it out in a full-blown trade war and the recession warning klaxons are blaring, but still the performance numbers and milestones are astonishing. 
The $8 trillion surge in global stocks is the result of a near 15% leap in MSCI's world index (MIWD00000PUS). That is challenging the dot.com boom days of 1997 as the best H1 in its near 40-year history.
Wall Street is up 18%, Europe 13% and China has jumped 20%, which is a lot of what it lost year even factoring in it has given back 5% since the trade tensions erupted again in early May.
Oil has raced almost 25% higher following its best first quarter since 2009. That has helped Russia's rouble top the currency charts and though industrial metals have buckled badly in Q2, safe-haven gold is now scaling a six-year high. 
""It has been really impressive,"" said Swiss fund managers Pictet's chief strategist Luca Paolini about the rebound from last year's beating. ""All sectors, all markets, all asset classes are in positive territory and that is rather unusual."" 
(Graphic: World stocks straining for best start to a year ever - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FE0mYC)
A mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell? Perhaps. But there have been two important drivers. 
One was China showing it was serious about monetary and fiscal stimulus for its $14 trillion economy. The second of course has been the screeching change of direction by the Federal Reserve which suddenly looks set to cut U.S. interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
It has lit a fire under bond markets which have gone off like a rocket.
U.S. Treasuries, the world's benchmark government IOUs, have made a whopping 7 percent as their yields have fallen almost 70 basis points this year. That followed a 37 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018, whereas in the five quarters prior to that they had consistently risen. 
German Bunds - Europe's go-to safe asset - have had their best H1 in two years, making roughly 5.5% as the European Central Bank has reversed course too. The yield on 10-year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in March and has since scored record lows.
(Graphic: Global markets in H1 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FEK8yw)
MY BIG FAT GREEK RALLY 
A statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that Greek banks -- remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back -- have been some of the world's best performing stocks this year. 
The country's biggest lender Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) is up 250% and the smaller Attica Bank (AT:BOAr) is up 343%. Athens has also been Europe's best bourse this year, though it all trails the 550% gain vegan darling Beyond Meat  has cooked up since its May stock market floatation. 
(Graphic: European markets in H1, Greece has smashed it - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FEGg0s)
Cryptoassets are back in vogue too with Bitcoin up 220% after its 2018 fall from grace and despite almost daily Brexit chaos and the loss of another prime minister, UK Gilts have returned 4.5%.
More risky high-yield debt, local-currency emerging market bonds and corporate debt have all brought in between 8%-9% and currency markets have been on the turn too.
""It is very unusual to see this breadth of strength,"" said HSBC Asset Management's chief global strategist, Joseph Little. ""The question is, has it been too fast and too furious. It's a very good question."" 
The Fed's pirouette means the dollar index (DXY) is about to experience its first quarterly loss in over a year, with the yen up over 2.5% and the euro (EUR=) now back in the black having had its weakest Q1 since 2015.
The oil rally means the Canadian dollar -- up 4% -- and Norwegian crown -- up 1.5% -- have also done well, but as usual the wilder swings have been in emerging markets.
Argentina's peso  and Turkey's lira , 2018's punchbags, have taken another beating though it was mainly earlier in the year when worries about both countries' political and economic trajectories started to bite again. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the Russian rouble, another big petrocurrency, is up 10.5%. Egypt's pound  and the Thai baht  are 7.2% and 5.2% higher, while Mexico's peso  is now only 2% better off having been sapped by the recent run in with Donald Trump over migrants breaking the border. 
FANGS VERY MUCH 
Wall Street's rally has left the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC) enjoying the view at record highs with the so-called FANG tech stocks providing much of the altitude again.
Facebook (O:FB) has surged 44%, Amazon (O:AMZN) 27 percent, and streaming giant Netflix (O:NFLX) has soared more than 38%.
Despite the fierce tensions with China over Huawei, the tech sector (SPLRCT) still tops the S&P 500 too and Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are the top two performers on the Dow Jones (DJI) having both leapt over 30%.
In contrast, China's tech sector <.CSIINT> is now up 28% year-to-date compared to 46% at the end of Q1 while online behemoth  Alibaba  (K:BABA) has handed back 5% of the 30% it had made.
""The next couple of weeks will set the tone for the second half. If trade talks momentum is gained, it would be hugely positive for risk assets,"" Stefan Hofer, chief investment officer, LGT Bank Asia said.
""This is the most important (period) since the Global Financial Crisis. I can't emphasize that enough.""

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:16AM ET</span>",Nissan ex-chief Ghosn cancels hastily arranged Tokyo press conference,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn abruptly canceled plans on Friday for what would have been his first press conference since his arrest in November, after his daughters expressed concern it could invite retaliation by Japanese authorities, his lawyers said. 
""In Japan we just don't know what terrible thing will happen next, not just limited to rearrest,"" one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters outside his office. 
The lawyer said consequences could also include loss of bail, but did not give further details. The Japanese government's chief spokesman Yoshihide Suga has said that Ghosn is being treated in accordance with Japanese law.
Hironaka canceled the briefing at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan (FCCJ) only two hours after journalists were informed of the event. 
Had it gone ahead, Ghosn would have spoken as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hosted national leaders at the G20 leaders gathering in Osaka, including U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. 
Ghosn's wife Carole has called on Macron to raise the issue of her husband's treatment in Japan. 
Japanese courts have dismissed appeals by Ghosn to ease a bail restriction that bans him from contacting his wife. His lawyers have argued that that condition violates Japan's constitution and international law on family separations.
Hironaka said the decision to hold the press conference on Friday came after Ghosn's latest attempt to seek court permission for a one-off meeting with his wife failed, and was unrelated to the timing of the G20.
Ghosn's legal team have nonetheless taken note of the leaders' gathering. 
Another of his lawyers, Takashi Takano, penned a statement on Tuesday that criticized Abe for promoting Japanese openness when it ""fiercely guarded its private commercial entities, even through use of basic sovereign powers, including criminal investigation and penal sanction"". 
Once among the world's most feted auto executives, Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan over charges including enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan. 
Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a boardroom coup. 
He has accused ""backstabbing"" former colleagues of conspiring to oust him from Nissan in order to derail a closer alliance between the Japanese automaker and  Renault , its top shareholder.
The scandal has rocked the industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and Renault SA (PA:RENA). 

Since his initial arrest in November last year, Ghosn has been charged four times for crimes which also include underreporting his Nissan salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books during his time at the helm of Japan's No. 2 automaker.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>","Rent the Runway, Nordstrom team up to boost convenience, attract customers","By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and Rent the Runway announced a partnership on Thursday that aims to draw more foot traffic into the department store while making the clothing rental service more convenient so it can improve service to existing customers and attract new ones.
Rent the Runway ""drop-off boxes,"" where subscribers can quickly scan and return rented items, will be placed inside four Los Angeles-based Nordstrom stores, three of which are smaller ""Nordstrom Local"" stores billed by the chain as ""a convenient drop-in hub"" closer to residential areas.
Los Angeles is Rent the Runway's fourth largest market, where there is a ""particularly high density of subscribers living or working close to the Nordstrom Locals in West Hollywood, Brentwood and Downtown LA,"" the clothing rental company said.
The idea, executives from both retailers told Reuters, is to make it more convenient for Rent the Runway subscribers to drop off rented items and explore other offerings at Nordstrom Local stores, where shoppers can consult personal stylists for fashion and beauty services, have clothes altered or make quick returns.
The partnership between the Seattle, Washington-based retailer and clothing rental service, based in New York City, is the latest example of how retailers are teaming up to fend off fierce competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and fast-fashion brands like Inditex's Zara (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb).
In April, struggling upscale U.S. retailer Neiman Marcus took a minority stake in online luxury reseller Fashionphile.
""We're excited to see the amount of customers that end up using the service with Rent the Runway as well as the customers we're able to introduce into our service programs like styling,"" said that Shea Jensen, Nordstrom's senior vice president of customer experience.
""Rent the Runway obviously serves a growing customer base,"" she added.
Last month, the department store operator reported disappointing quarterly results, hurt by the rollout of a new loyalty program and slow sales of full-priced women's clothing.
Maureen Sullivan, chief operating officer at Rent the Runway, said she expects the partnership to improve customer loyalty and ultimately help the company grab more market share.
""We'll expect to see over time some loyalty improvement,"" said Sullivan, adding that ""by having these physical drop-off boxes... we're able to activate even more subscribers.""

Since launching the Rent the Runway drop-off box service with WeWork in October 2018, the company has seen over an 180% increase in returns directly from customers, the company said.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 09:33AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Western intelligence hacked 'Russia's Google' Yandex to spy on accounts - sources,"By Christopher Bing, Jack Stubbs and Joseph Menn
WASHINGTON/LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers working for Western intelligence agencies broke into Russian internet search company Yandex in late 2018, deploying a rare type of malware in an attempt to spy on user accounts, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The malware, called Regin, is known to be used by the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing alliance of the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the sources said. Intelligence agencies in those countries declined to comment.
Western cyberattacks against Russia are seldom acknowledged or spoken about in public. It could not be determined which of the five countries was behind the attack on Yandex, said sources in Russia and elsewhere, three of whom had direct knowledge of the hack. The breach took place between October and November 2018.
Yandex spokesman Ilya Grabovsky acknowledged the incident in a statement to Reuters, but declined to provide further details.
""This particular attack was detected at a very early stage by the Yandex security team. It was fully neutralized before any damage was done,"" he said. ""Yandex security team's response ensured that no user data was compromised by the attack.""
The company, widely known as ""Russia's Google"" for its array of online services from internet search to email and taxi reservations, says it has more than 108 million monthly users in Russia. It also operates in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Turkey.
The sources who described the attack to Reuters said the hackers appeared to be searching for technical information that could explain how Yandex authenticates user accounts. Such information could help a spy agency impersonate a Yandex user and access their private messages.
The hack of Yandex's research and development unit was intended for espionage purposes rather than to disrupt or steal intellectual property, the sources said. The hackers covertly maintained access to Yandex for at least several weeks without being detected, they said.
The Regin malware was identified as a Five Eyes tool in 2014 following revelations by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden.
Reports by The Intercept, in partnership with a Dutch and Belgian newspaper, tied an earlier version of Regin to a hack at Belgian telecom firm Belgacom in 2013 and said British spy agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the NSA were responsible. At the time GCHQ declined to comment and the NSA denied involvement.
'CROWN JEWEL'
Security experts say attributing cyberattacks can be difficult because of obfuscation methods used by hackers.
But some of the Regin code found on Yandex's systems had not been deployed in any known previous cyberattacks, the sources said, reducing the risk that attackers were deliberately using known Western hacking tools to cover their tracks.
Yandex called in Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky, which established the attackers were targeting a group of developers inside Yandex, three sources said. A private assessment by Kaspersky, described to Reuters, concluded hackers likely tied to Western intelligence breached Yandex using Regin. 
A Kaspersky spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Russian government was not aware of this particular attack on Yandex. ""Yandex and other Russian companies are attacked every day. Many attacks come from Western countries,"" he said.
Moscow-based Yandex, listed on the NASDAQ in the United States and the Moscow Exchange, has come under tighter regulatory control by the Russian government after the passage of new internet laws.
U.S. cybersecurity firm Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) said it had also recently discovered a new version of Regin. Symantec declined to discuss where this sample was discovered, citing client confidentiality. 
""Regin is the crown jewel of attack frameworks used for espionage. Its architecture, complexity and capability sits in a ballpark of its own,"" Vikram Thakur, technical director at Symantec Security Response, told Reuters. ""We have seen different components of Regin in the past few months.""

""Based on the victimology coupled with the investment required to create, maintain, and operate Regin, we believe there are at best a handful of countries that could be behind its existence,"" said Thakur. ""Regin came back on the radar in 2019.""

The shares opened at their IPO price of 27 euros ($30.75) and then slipped slightly to 26.64 euros a share. Germany's benchmark DAX index was flat.
Weak demand for German listings forced VW to scale back its IPO of Traton and it priced the offering at the low end of its target range. 
On Wednesday, online fashion retailer Global Fashion Group slashed its initial public offer price, citing ""current market conditions"", in a bid to salvage its stock market listing.
Volkswagen floated 11.5% of Traton's shares in a scaled back initial public offering which had initially sought to list a stake of up to 25% of the shares and put the company's truck business on an independent footing. 
Proceeds from the offering will flow to parent Volkswagen which aims to use the funding to invest in mass producing electric cars.
Traton, which includes the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen trucks businesses wants to create a global trucks operation.
A flotation could give Traton the resources to deepen its relationship with U.S. truck maker  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV), in which it currently owns a 16.85% stake.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google appears to have leveraged Android dominance - India watchdog,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Google (O:GOOGL) appears to have misused its dominant position in India and reduced the ability of device manufacturers to opt for alternate versions of its Android mobile operating system, Indian officials found before ordering a wider probe in an antitrust case.
A 14-page order from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), reviewed by Reuters this week, found Google's restrictions on manufacturers seemed to amount to imposition of ""unfair conditions"" under India's competition law.
Reuters reported last month that the CCI had launched a probe in April against Google for its alleged abuse of Android's dominant position to block rivals, but the contents of the directive detailing the initial assessment upon which that investigation was ordered have not been previously revealed.
The Indian case is similar to one Google faced in Europe, where regulators imposed a $5 billion fine on the company for forcing manufacturers to pre-install its apps on Android devices. Google has appealed against the verdict. 
By making pre-installation of Google's proprietary apps conditional, Google ""reduced the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operated on alternate versions of Android"", the CCI said in the order. ""It amounts to prima facie leveraging of Google's dominance"".
Asked for comment, Google referred Reuters to its statement last month, in which it said Android had enabled millions of Indians to connect to the internet by making mobile devices more affordable. Google looked forward to working with the CCI ""to demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less"", the company said at the time.
The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.
While the order, dated April 16, called for a wider probe against Google, the watchdog's investigations unit could still clear Google of any wrongdoing.
The amount of any fine that could be imposed on Google if the CCI rules against it was not clear.
ANDROID DOMINANCE
Android, used by device makers for free, features on about 88 percent of the world's smartphones. In India, about 99 percent of the smartphones sold this year used the platform, Counterpoint Research estimates.
In the EU case, regulators said Google forced manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser, together with its Google Play app store, on Android devices, giving it an unfair advantage.
In the Indian case, Google argued that Android was an open source platform and pre-installation obligations were ""limited in scope"", the CCI order said.
The CCI said that complainants in the Indian case - which according to sources involve more than one person - have alleged that Google engaged in abusive behavior similar to the kind outlined in the European case. They said Google was engaged in anti-competitive practices ""with the aim of cementing Google's dominant position"".
Google's ""impugned conduct may help perpetuate its dominance in online search markets while resulting in denial of market access for competing search apps"", the CCI said in its order. 
The investigations arm of the CCI should complete the wider probe in the case within 150 days, the order said, though such cases at the watchdog typically drag on for years.
The CCI also said the role of any Google executive in alleged abuse of the Android platform should also be examined.
The investigation is not the only antitrust headache for the Mountain View, California-based company in one of its key growth markets. Last year, the CCI imposed a fine of 1.36 billion rupees ($20 million) on Google for ""search bias"" and abuse of its dominant position.

Google appealed against that order, saying the ruling could cause it ""irreparable"" harm and reputational loss. That appeal is still pending in an Indian tribunal.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Special Report: Why the military still stands by Venezuela's beleaguered president,"By Brian Ellsworth and Mayela Armas
CARACAS (Reuters) - One of the central mysteries of Venezuela's slow-motion collapse: Why does the military continue to support Nicolas Maduro, the president who has led the once-prosperous South American country into poverty and chaos?
The answer, according to people familiar with Venezuela's military structure, starts with Maduro's late predecessor, Hugo Chavez, the charismatic caudillo who cemented strongman socialist rule in the nation of about 30 million people. 
In a series of actions that began in 1999, the former lieutenant colonel and one-time coup leader began taming the military by bloating it, buying it off, politicizing it, intimidating the rank and file, and fragmenting the overall command.
Once he took office in 2013, Maduro handed key segments of the country's increasingly ravaged economy to the armed forces. Select military officers took control of the distribution of food and key raw materials. A National Guard general and military deputies now manage the all-important national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].
The two leaders also embedded intelligence agents, with the help of Cuba's security services, within barracks, former officers say, instilling paranoia and defusing most dissent before it happens. Intelligence agents have arrested and jailed scores of perceived troublemakers, including several high-profile officers, even for minor infractions.
The overhaul, former military officials say, created a jumbled and partisan chain of command. Top officers, grateful for perks and fearful of retribution, are often more preoccupied with pleasing Socialist Party chiefs than with national defense. Instead of drills and war games, some generals find themselves fielding calls to plant vegetables or clear garbage.
Many lower-ranking soldiers, destitute and desperate like most of Venezuela's working class, have deserted the military in recent years, joining at least 4 million other fellow emigres seeking a better life elsewhere. But few senior officers have heeded the opposition's call for rebellion, leaving the armed forces top-heavy, unwieldy and still standing by Maduro.
""The chain of command has been lost,"" said Cliver Alcala, a former general who retired in 2013 and now supports the opposition from Colombia. ""There is no way to know who is in charge of operations, who is in charge of administration and who is in charge of policy.""
Some commanders, like Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, a four-star general, are nearly as much a face of the administration as Maduro. Padrino is sanctioned by the United States for ensuring Maduro's ""hold on the military and the government while the Venezuelan people suffer,"" according to the U.S. Treasury Department.
Reuters was unable to reach Padrino or other senior officers mentioned in this article. Venezuela's defense ministry didn't reply to email or telephone inquiries. The country's information ministry, responsible for government communications including those of the president, didn't reply to Reuters either. 
Padrino is hardly alone. 
Consider the sheer number of officers awarded flag rank in Venezuela. 
The country's roughly 150,000 Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard troops are a fraction of the more than 1 million who make up the U.S. armed forces. Yet Venezuela, with as many as 2,000 admirals and generals, now boasts as much as twice the top brass as the U.S. military – more than 10 times as many flag officers as existed when Chavez became president. 
The estimate is according to calculations by former Venezuelan officers and the U.S. military.
The result, government opponents say, is a bureaucratic and operational mess, even at the very top. 
Padrino, for instance, is both a general and defense minister. But he can't officially mobilize troops without the consent of Remigio Ceballos, an admiral who also reports directly to Maduro and heads the Strategic Operations Command, an agency created by Chavez to oversee deployments.
""You have a general in chief and an admiral in chief,"" said Hebert Garcia, a retired general who once served under Maduro but now supports the opposition from Washington. ""Which one are you supposed to obey?""
The armed forces could still turn on Maduro, particularly if popular outrage boils over and makes military support for the president untenable. Still, calls by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who in late April unsuccessfully sought to rally the troops against Maduro, thus far remain unheeded.
Guaido in May told reporters his efforts to convert troops are thwarted by the military's fragmented structure and intimidation within its ranks. ""What is preventing the break?"" he asked. ""The ability to speak openly, directly with each of the sectors. It has to do with the persecution inside the Socialist Party, inside the armed forces.""
To better understand the pressures and policies keeping the troops in Maduro's camp, Reuters interviewed dozens of current and former officers, soldiers, military scholars and people familiar with Venezuelan security. In their assessment, the military has evolved into a torpid bureaucracy with few leaders capable of engineering the type of mass mutiny that Maduro's opponents long for.
""REAL POWER""
Venezuela's ""Bolivarian Revolution,"" as Chavez dubbed his remaking of the country, itself has roots in military rebellion. Six years before he was elected president in 1998, Chavez led a failed coup against Carlos Andres Perez, a deeply unpopular president who Congress eventually forced from office.
Once in power, Chavez immediately took steps to enlist the military in his vision for a paternalistic, state-led economy that would share abundant oil wealth with long-neglected segments of Venezuela's population.
With a new constitution in December 1999, Chavez stripped Congress of its oversight of promotion of senior officers. That gave the president ultimate authority to assign flag ranks and empower allied officers.
Because many state and local governments at the time were still controlled by rivals, Chavez also saw the military as a tool that could show his administration hard at work. A new program, ""Plan Bolivar 2000,"" ordered troops to fill potholes, clean highways, refurbish schools and carry out other public works.
The $114 million effort put sizeable sums at the discretion of commanders, giving officers a taste for a new kind of influence. ""What Plan Bolivar 2000 taught officers was that real power doesn't lie in commanding troops, but rather in controlling money,"" said one retired general. The general, who served under Chavez and Maduro, spoke on condition of anonymity.
Soon, some of the funds began to disappear.
Miguel Morffe, a retired major, once worked as a captain in the remote northwestern region of La Guajira. He recalls receiving a request from superiors to provide materials for an unspecified schoolhouse. When Morffe told a lieutenant colonel that he didn't understand where the supplies would be going, the superior told him: ""I need those materials for something else.""
""The school didn't exist,"" Morffe concluded.
Military officials didn't reply to questions about the alleged incident.
By 2001, a raft of corruption allegations plagued the Plan Bolivar program.
Chavez fired General Victor Cruz, the Army's commander in charge of the program. Cruz denied wrongdoing and wasn't charged with any crime at the time. Venezuelan authorities arrested him last year when press reports linked him to funds in an offshore account. A Caracas court in May ordered him to stand trial on charges of illicit enrichment. 
Reuters couldn't reach Cruz for comment or identify his legal counsel.
In 2002, Chavez said he would wind down Plan Bolivar 2000.
Regional elections, he told Chilean sociologist and political activist Marta Harnecker in an interview, had put more allies in mayoral and state offices, where they could now work in unison with the national government. The military, he said, would return to its normal business.
That April, however, a small group of top officers emboldened Chavez to further remake the armed forces. Encouraged by conservative leaders and wealthy elites unhappy with his leftist agenda, the officers staged a coup and briefly arrested Chavez.
But the coup unraveled. Within two days, Chavez was back in power.
He purged the top ranks. More importantly, he reined in several powerful offices, including the Defense Ministry. Henceforth, the ministry would manage military budgets and weapons procurement, but no longer control troops themselves. Chavez created the Strategic Operations Command, the agency that manages deployments.
The move, former officers say, jumbled the chain of command.
He also rethought overall strategy.
Increasingly concerned that Venezuela's oil wealth and leftist policies would make it a target for invasion, particularly by the United States, Chavez pushed for the military to integrate further with the government and society itself. 
""We're transforming the armed forces for a war of resistance, for the anti-imperialist popular war, for the integral defense of the nation,"" he said at a 2004 National Guard ceremony.
Military leaders soon had to pledge their allegiance to Chavez and his Bolivarian project, not just the nation itself. Despite resistance from some commanders, the ruling party slogan, ""Fatherland, Socialism or Death,"" began echoing through barracks and across parade grounds.
As of 2005, another factor helped Chavez tighten his hold on power. Oil prices, years before fracking would boost global supply, soared along with the notion the planet's reserves were dwindling. For most of the rest of his time in power, the windfall would enable Chavez to accelerate spending and ensure popular support.
Oil money also helped him strengthen relationships with like-minded countries, especially those seeking to counterbalance the United States. Venezuela purchased billions of dollars in arms and equipment from Russia and China. It secured medical and educational support through doctors, teachers and other advisors arriving from Cuba, the closest ally of all.
Cubans came with military know-how, too.
A ""cooperation agreement"" forged between Chavez and Fidel Castro years earlier had by now blossomed into an alliance on security matters, according to two former officers. Around 2008, Venezuelan officers say they began noticing Cuban officials working within various parts of the armed forces.
General Antonio Rivero, who the previous five years had managed Venezuela's civil protection authority, says he returned to military activities that year to find Cuban advisors leading training of soldiers and suggesting operational and administrative changes. 
The Cubans, he told Reuters, advised Chavez to rework the ranks, once built around strategic centers, into more of a territorial system, spreading the military's presence further around the country. Rivero was stunned at one training session on military engineering. A Cuban colonel leading the session told attendees the meeting and its contents should be considered a state secret.
""What's happening here?"" Rivero said he asked himself. ""How is a foreign military force going to possess a state secret?""
Rivero left Venezuela for the United States in 2014.
Cuban officials didn't respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
The island's influence soon would become apparent in day-to-day operations.
In Cuba, the military is involved in everything from public works to telecommunications to tourism. In Venezuela, too, ruling party officials increasingly began ordering officers to take part in activities that had little to do with military preparedness. Soldiers increasingly became cheap labor for governors and mayors.
In 2010, a former general working in the Andes, a western region on the Colombian border, was overseeing a complex mobilization of 5,000 troops for a month of combat training. The general spoke on condition that he not be named.
Another general, from a nearby command, called and asked him to halt the exercises. The state governor, the other officer told the general, wanted to reroute the troops - to install energy-efficient light bulbs in homes.
When the general refused, Army Commander Euclides Campos issued a formal order to scrap the training. ""This would sound shocking to any military professional, but it's exactly how the Venezuelan armed forces work,"" the former general said.
Reuters was unable to reach Campos for comment.
""TRAITORS NEVER!""
Chavez, stricken by cancer, died in 2013. Maduro, his vice president and hand-picked replacement as the Socialist party candidate for president, won the election to succeed him.
The new president continued naming new flag officers and appointed even more military officials to helm agencies. By 2017, active and former military figures had held as many as half of Maduro's 32 cabinet posts, according to Citizen Control, a Venezuelan non-profit that studies the armed forces.
In 2014, just as a collapse in oil prices torpedoed Venezuela's economy, Maduro further fragmented the military structure.
Following the advice of the Cubans, former military officers say, Maduro created new command centers nationwide. He appointed senior officers to run new commands in each of the 23 states and Caracas, the capital, as well as eight regional commands above those. His public speeches are now increasingly peppered with terms like ZODI and REDI, acronyms for the new commands.
Near military facilities, new brass abounded.
""Before, seeing a general was like seeing a bishop or an archbishop, he was an important figure,"" recalls Morffe, the retired major. ""Not long ago, I saw one in an airport. He walked past a group of soldiers and they didn't even salute.""
Flag officers now oversee some areas that were once slivers of larger commands, in areas so remote that they have few human inhabitants. The largest landmass in the Western Maritime and Insular Command, overseen by an admiral, is a rocky archipelago with little vegetation and no permanent residents. 
The officer, Vice Admiral Rodolfo Sanchez, didn't respond to a Reuters phone call to his office.
The lopsided, partisan structure has led to mission creep, former officers say.
In the Andes command, which oversees three states, six generals once oversaw roughly 13,000 troops, according to officers familiar with the region. Today, at least 20 generals are now managing ranks that have dwindled to as few as 3,000 soldiers, according to officers familiar with the region.
Last August, three of the generals, including the regional commander, met with municipal officials in the state of Tachira, a hotbed of protests against Maduro in recent years. Days earlier, the government had said explosives used in a drone attack on a military parade in Caracas had been smuggled through Tachira from Colombia.
""All of us together can solve this problem,"" Major General Manuel Bernal told the assembled officers and a group of onlookers, including a Reuters reporter.
Bernal wasn't talking about the drones, however. Or even national security, once a major issue in the Andean region, where Colombia's guerrilla war long posed a threat. Instead, the generals had gathered to talk about trash overflowing at a landfill. They deployed soldiers to clear garbage and put out a fire there. 
A communications official for the Andes command didn't respond to a Reuters request to speak with Bernal about the episode.
Military bosses show few signs of shying away from such directives. In the weeks since Guaido's failed call to arms, senior officers have reiterated their commitment to Maduro.
""We will continue fulfilling our constitutional duties, fulfilling duties under your command,"" Defense Minister Padrino told Maduro alongside troops gathered in Caracas in early May.
""Loyal always!"" Padrino shouted.

The troops responded in unison: ""Traitors never!""

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",The best first half for financial markets ever,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - What a six months for financial markets. Global equities have piled on $8 trillion, bonds are on fire, oil prices have surged by almost a quarter and a Greek bank is one of the world's best performing stocks.
Everything added together it may well be the best first half of a year ever and one that not even the most wily investor would have predicted after the dire end to 2018 and what has happened since. 
The world's two top economies are slugging it out in a full-blown trade war and the recession warning klaxons are blaring, but still the performance numbers and milestones are astonishing. 
The $8 trillion surge in global stocks is the result of a near 15% leap in MSCI's world index (MIWD00000PUS). That is challenging the dot.com boom days of 1997 as the best H1 in its near 40-year history.
Wall Street is up 18%, Europe 13% and China has jumped 20%, which is a lot of what it lost year even factoring in it has given back 5% since the trade tensions erupted again in early May.
Oil has raced almost 25% higher following its best first quarter since 2009. That has helped Russia's rouble top the currency charts and though industrial metals have buckled badly in Q2, safe-haven gold is now scaling a six-year high. 
""It has been really impressive,"" said Swiss fund managers Pictet's chief strategist Luca Paolini about the rebound from last year's beating. ""All sectors, all markets, all asset classes are in positive territory and that is rather unusual."" 
(Graphic: World stocks straining for best start to a year ever - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FE0mYC)
A mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell? Perhaps. But there have been two important drivers. 
One was China showing it was serious about monetary and fiscal stimulus for its $14 trillion economy. The second of course has been the screeching change of direction by the Federal Reserve which suddenly looks set to cut U.S. interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
It has lit a fire under bond markets which have gone off like a rocket.
U.S. Treasuries, the world's benchmark government IOUs, have made a whopping 7 percent as their yields have fallen almost 70 basis points this year. That followed a 37 basis point fall the last quarter of 2018, whereas in the five quarters prior to that they had consistently risen. 
German Bunds - Europe's go-to safe asset - have had their best H1 in two years, making roughly 5.5% as the European Central Bank has reversed course too. The yield on 10-year debt dropped below zero percent for the first time since 2016 in March and has since scored record lows.
(Graphic: Global markets in H1 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FEK8yw)
MY BIG FAT GREEK RALLY 
A statistic likely to make most jaws drop is that Greek banks -- remember all that euro debt crisis and capital controls stuff a few years back -- have been some of the world's best performing stocks this year. 
The country's biggest lender Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) is up 250% and the smaller Attica Bank (AT:BOAr) is up 343%. Athens has also been Europe's best bourse this year, though it all trails the 550% gain vegan darling Beyond Meat  has cooked up since its May stock market floatation. 
(Graphic: European markets in H1, Greece has smashed it - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FEGg0s)
Cryptoassets are back in vogue too with Bitcoin up 220% after its 2018 fall from grace and despite almost daily Brexit chaos and the loss of another prime minister, UK Gilts have returned 4.5%.
More risky high-yield debt, local-currency emerging market bonds and corporate debt have all brought in between 8%-9% and currency markets have been on the turn too.
""It is very unusual to see this breadth of strength,"" said HSBC Asset Management's chief global strategist, Joseph Little. ""The question is, has it been too fast and too furious. It's a very good question."" 
The Fed's pirouette means the dollar index (DXY) is about to experience its first quarterly loss in over a year, with the yen up over 2.5% and the euro (EUR=) now back in the black having had its weakest Q1 since 2015.
The oil rally means the Canadian dollar -- up 4% -- and Norwegian crown -- up 1.5% -- have also done well, but as usual the wilder swings have been in emerging markets.
Argentina's peso  and Turkey's lira , 2018's punchbags, have taken another beating though it was mainly earlier in the year when worries about both countries' political and economic trajectories started to bite again. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the Russian rouble, another big petrocurrency, is up 10.5%. Egypt's pound  and the Thai baht  are 7.2% and 5.2% higher, while Mexico's peso  is now only 2% better off having been sapped by the recent run in with Donald Trump over migrants breaking the border. 
FANGS VERY MUCH 
Wall Street's rally has left the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq (IXIC) enjoying the view at record highs with the so-called FANG tech stocks providing much of the altitude again.
Facebook (O:FB) has surged 44%, Amazon (O:AMZN) 27 percent, and streaming giant Netflix (O:NFLX) has soared more than 38%.
Despite the fierce tensions with China over Huawei, the tech sector (SPLRCT) still tops the S&P 500 too and Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are the top two performers on the Dow Jones (DJI) having both leapt over 30%.
In contrast, China's tech sector <.CSIINT> is now up 28% year-to-date compared to 46% at the end of Q1 while online behemoth  Alibaba  (K:BABA) has handed back 5% of the 30% it had made.
""The next couple of weeks will set the tone for the second half. If trade talks momentum is gained, it would be hugely positive for risk assets,"" Stefan Hofer, chief investment officer, LGT Bank Asia said.
""This is the most important (period) since the Global Financial Crisis. I can't emphasize that enough.""

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:16AM ET</span>",Nissan ex-chief Ghosn cancels hastily arranged Tokyo press conference,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn abruptly canceled plans on Friday for what would have been his first press conference since his arrest in November, after his daughters expressed concern it could invite retaliation by Japanese authorities, his lawyers said. 
""In Japan we just don't know what terrible thing will happen next, not just limited to rearrest,"" one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters outside his office. 
The lawyer said consequences could also include loss of bail, but did not give further details. The Japanese government's chief spokesman Yoshihide Suga has said that Ghosn is being treated in accordance with Japanese law.
Hironaka canceled the briefing at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan (FCCJ) only two hours after journalists were informed of the event. 
Had it gone ahead, Ghosn would have spoken as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hosted national leaders at the G20 leaders gathering in Osaka, including U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. 
Ghosn's wife Carole has called on Macron to raise the issue of her husband's treatment in Japan. 
Japanese courts have dismissed appeals by Ghosn to ease a bail restriction that bans him from contacting his wife. His lawyers have argued that that condition violates Japan's constitution and international law on family separations.
Hironaka said the decision to hold the press conference on Friday came after Ghosn's latest attempt to seek court permission for a one-off meeting with his wife failed, and was unrelated to the timing of the G20.
Ghosn's legal team have nonetheless taken note of the leaders' gathering. 
Another of his lawyers, Takashi Takano, penned a statement on Tuesday that criticized Abe for promoting Japanese openness when it ""fiercely guarded its private commercial entities, even through use of basic sovereign powers, including criminal investigation and penal sanction"". 
Once among the world's most feted auto executives, Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan over charges including enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan. 
Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a boardroom coup. 
He has accused ""backstabbing"" former colleagues of conspiring to oust him from Nissan in order to derail a closer alliance between the Japanese automaker and  Renault , its top shareholder.
The scandal has rocked the industry and exposed tensions in the automaking partnership between Nissan and Renault SA (PA:RENA). 

Since his initial arrest in November last year, Ghosn has been charged four times for crimes which also include underreporting his Nissan salary and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books during his time at the helm of Japan's No. 2 automaker.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:06AM ET</span>","Rent the Runway, Nordstrom team up to boost convenience, attract customers","By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and Rent the Runway announced a partnership on Thursday that aims to draw more foot traffic into the department store while making the clothing rental service more convenient so it can improve service to existing customers and attract new ones.
Rent the Runway ""drop-off boxes,"" where subscribers can quickly scan and return rented items, will be placed inside four Los Angeles-based Nordstrom stores, three of which are smaller ""Nordstrom Local"" stores billed by the chain as ""a convenient drop-in hub"" closer to residential areas.
Los Angeles is Rent the Runway's fourth largest market, where there is a ""particularly high density of subscribers living or working close to the Nordstrom Locals in West Hollywood, Brentwood and Downtown LA,"" the clothing rental company said.
The idea, executives from both retailers told Reuters, is to make it more convenient for Rent the Runway subscribers to drop off rented items and explore other offerings at Nordstrom Local stores, where shoppers can consult personal stylists for fashion and beauty services, have clothes altered or make quick returns.
The partnership between the Seattle, Washington-based retailer and clothing rental service, based in New York City, is the latest example of how retailers are teaming up to fend off fierce competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and fast-fashion brands like Inditex's Zara (MC:ITX) and H&M (ST:HMb).
In April, struggling upscale U.S. retailer Neiman Marcus took a minority stake in online luxury reseller Fashionphile.
""We're excited to see the amount of customers that end up using the service with Rent the Runway as well as the customers we're able to introduce into our service programs like styling,"" said that Shea Jensen, Nordstrom's senior vice president of customer experience.
""Rent the Runway obviously serves a growing customer base,"" she added.
Last month, the department store operator reported disappointing quarterly results, hurt by the rollout of a new loyalty program and slow sales of full-priced women's clothing.
Maureen Sullivan, chief operating officer at Rent the Runway, said she expects the partnership to improve customer loyalty and ultimately help the company grab more market share.
""We'll expect to see over time some loyalty improvement,"" said Sullivan, adding that ""by having these physical drop-off boxes... we're able to activate even more subscribers.""

Since launching the Rent the Runway drop-off box service with WeWork in October 2018, the company has seen over an 180% increase in returns directly from customers, the company said.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Federal court to hear 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli's appeal,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli will urge a federal appeals court on Friday to overturn his criminal conviction for defrauding investors in hedge funds he founded.
Shkreli, 36, was found guilty of securities fraud and conspiracy in August 2017 by a federal jury in Brooklyn. His lawyers have argued in court filings that the verdict must be overturned because the jury received improper instructions. 
They are expected to argue their case before a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan shortly after 10 a.m. (1400 GMT)
Shkreli, who was sentenced to seven years in prison in March 2018 by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto and is at a federal prison in Pennsylvania, is not expected to appear himself.
Shkreli, born in Brooklyn to Albanian immigrant parents, became nationally known after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent, to $750 per pill. The move brought him the nickname ""Pharma Bro"" and drew criticism from activists and legislators.
Shkreli was indicted in December 2015 on fraud charges related to two hedge funds and a drug company he had founded years before Turing.
He was ultimately convicted of defrauding investors in the funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses, and of scheming to prop up the stock price of the drug company, Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX).
In addition to his prison sentence, Shkreli was ordered to forfeit more than $7 million.
Shkreli's lawyers said at his trial that he never intended to take investors' money, and in fact ultimately paid them back. 
In papers filed with the 2nd Circuit, the lawyers argued that the jury should have been told that, for Shkreli to be guilty of securities fraud, he must have made false statements ""for the purpose of causing some loss to another.""
Prosecutors countered in a filing that the securities law required no such instruction.
Retrophin fired Shkreli in 2014, and later filed a $65 million lawsuit accusing him of breaching his duty of loyalty to the company. Shkreli filed a $30 million lawsuit against three of his former Retrophin colleagues last month, accusing them of wrongfully forcing him out.

Retrophin announced earlier this month that both lawsuits had been settled.

1371,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 06:58AM ET</span>","Go Short U.S. 10-Year Notes Say Chart Gurus at RBC, JPMorgan","(Bloomberg) -- The relentless slide in Treasury 10-year yields may be about to end and it could be time to go short, according to technical analysts at RBC Capital Markets and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
U.S. yields will probably rise in the short term, though they are probably still in a longer-term downtrend, RBC Capital’s Technical Strategist George Davis wrote in a note Thursday.
“The one common theme that stands out for 10-year yields is valuations -- with overbought readings and study divergences presenting the scope for short-term corrections to materialize,” Davis wrote. “We view such corrections as a buying opportunity in bonds based on established downtrends for yields.”
Davis’s analysis largely echoes that of JPMorgan Technical Analyst Jason Hunter, who sees “the most overbought weekly momentum and sentiment conditions in years, and the developing price pattern continues to favor a short-term mean reversion to higher yields in the weeks ahead.”
The U.S. benchmark yield has fallen almost 70 basis points this year as the Federal Reserve turned more dovish and trade tensions added to concern about slowing global growth. Markets are also on edge before a planned meeting on Saturday between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping at the Group-of-20 meeting at Osaka.
Hunter said in the note that the “overwhelming technical setup” is countered by headline risks from the G-20 and upcoming economic data, so he’s holding off re-entering short positions to see if a more developed reversal pattern sets up over the next week or so.
Louis Capital Markets Technical Analyst Andy Dodd sees an engulfing candle in the U.S. 10-year yield -- a signal that the decline is near exhaustion. At the same time, the longer-term trend for yields remains lower, he said, meaning he will be on the lookout for signs that another leg of the downtrend is about to begin.
The move higher might not be so small, according to RBC and JPMorgan.
A close above 2.06% for the 10-year yield would trigger corrective momentum toward 2.11% and 2.17%, and an increase to 2.17% and 2.29% would be an opportunity to rebuild long positions, according to RBC. JPMorgan expects “material buying interest” in the mid-to-low 2.20s if a backup develops.
The 10-year yield was little changed at 2.02% as of 10:28 a.m. in London Friday.

1372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>","Xi Fires Shots at U.S. Before Trump Meet, Without Mentioning Him","(Bloomberg) -- As Chinese President Xi Jinping prepares for one of the most important meetings of his seven-year rule, he appears to have Donald Trump on the brain -- even if he won’t say so directly.
In conversations with other leaders ahead of his sit down tomorrow with the U.S. president on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan, Xi spared no opportunity to paint the U.S. as the bad guy in China’s spiraling trade conflict, while avoiding the provocative step of naming Trump personally.
In remarks to African leaders this morning, Xi took a not-so-subtle swipe at Trump’s policy slogan, ""America first."" Warning against ""bullying practices,"" Xi said that “any attempt to put one’s own interests first and undermine others’ will not win any popularity.”
Xi then used remarks on the digital economy to call for a ""fair and equitable market environment"" and the ""completeness and vitality of global supply chains."" It comes as Trump singles out Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co., arguing its connections to the government mean it could allow Beijing to spy through its equipment, and urging countries to avoid the company while developing 5G networks.
Last night, Xi told South Korean President Moon Jae-in that he opposed protectionism as well as any ""external” influence on the two countries’ relationship.
Xi’s verbal shadow-boxing with Trump underscores the delicate balance he needs to strike: He must avoid coming across at home as weak in dealing with the U.S. president but he also can’t risk worsening the trade war by provoking Trump’s personal ire. While Trump has hammered China with multiple rounds of tariffs, he maintains he enjoys a personal friendship with Xi and has spoken of the Chinese leader with admiration.
Read more: Xi’s G-20 Dilemma: How to Win Over Trump Without Changing China
""There’s a clear desire on the part of Xi and the Chinese side more generally to express their dissatisfaction with the way the U.S. side has handled negotiations,"" said Trey McArver, co-founder of Beijing-based research firm Trivium China. But ""he’s still about to meet with the guy,” McArver added. ""It speaks to the difficult position Xi is in: Wanting to get a deal done but also wanting to set some ground rules for negotiations.""
Xi’s comments at the G-20 fit that broader pattern. Chinese state media has published defiant editorials blaming the U.S. for the trade impasse and proclaiming Chinese strength, but avoided citing Trump or other trade officials by name. Beijing has issued veiled threats about cutting off the supply of rare earths to the U.S., but officials have stopped short of specifics.

It’s still unclear how much of a breakthrough may come tomorrow, or whether a fresh truce is even possible. China’s top trade negotiator Vice Premier Liu He met U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer today for talks at a hotel in Osaka, an official said.
Either way, past experience lends credence to Xi’s approach. On the campaign trail and in the White House, Trump has variously criticized opponents for being short, ugly and boring. After taking office, he described Kim Jong Un as ""rocket man,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as ""dishonest and weak,” and London Mayor Sadiq Khan as a ""national disgrace.”
Xi has more often been the object of Trump’s verbal affections. Trump has called him a ""great guy” and a ""good man.” He described Xi as the ""king of China” after Xi’s decision to abolish presidential term limits last year, has boasted of serving him ”the most beautiful chocolate cake” and had his grandchildren perform songs for the Chinese leader and his wife.
At times, Beijing has reciprocated with flattery of its own. At the G-20 meeting two years ago in Hamburg, a senior official said Chinese negotiators had ""read with respect Mr. Trump’s books on the art of the deal.” Diplomats made early overtures to the First Family, inviting Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner on trips to China at galas at the Chinese Embassy in DC.

Still, Chinese officials have begun to harden their rhetoric as the trade war drags on. The foreign ministry recently accused Secretary of State Michael Pompeo of propagating ""lies and fallacies,” while the Communist Party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper described Republican Senator Marco Rubio -- who has proposed legislation to prevent Huawei from seeking damages in U.S. patent courts -- as an “anti-China clown.”
But for all that, Trump himself and his lead trade negotiators have been spared personal insult by Beijing. That’s even after the U.S. president officially defined China as a “strategic competitor” last year, hiked tariffs multiple times and stepped up efforts to kneecap flagship Chinese companies from Huawei to ZTE (HK:0763). China’s economy is already growing at its slowest pace since the 1990s.
As Xi prepares for his third high-stakes G-20 meeting with Trump, he may be asking himself once again: how much is a friendship worth?

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 06:47AM ET</span>","Tesla says single battery module caused car fire in Shanghai, has changed vehicle settings","BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said on Friday a single battery module caused a car to catch fire in Shanghai and it had revised its vehicle settings to further protect its batteries following an investigation into the incident. 
The company said in a statement posted on its Weibo social media account that the joint investigation team had conducted an investigation and analysis of the battery, software, manufacturing data and vehicle history. 
The investigation found no system defect, and the initial findings show the incident was caused by a single battery module located at the front of the vehicle, Tesla said. 
Japanese battery manufacturer Panasonic (T:6752) supplies Tesla with battery cells, but not modules, which are a group of cells joined together. 
The company has revised the charge and thermal management settings on Model S and Model X vehicles via an over-the-air (OTA) software update, to help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity, the statement said. 
A parked Tesla Model S caught fire in Shanghai on April 21. 
Tesla has said its EVs are about 10 times less likely to experience a fire than petrol-powered cars. 
Tesla's local competitor Nio Inc (N:NIO) said on Weibo on Thursday that some battery modules in its cars might have safety issues as well, and that it would recall 4,803 units after three fire incidents in China. 
Safety of electric vehicles is a growing issue in China, the world's largest new energy vehicle (NEV) market, where 1.3 million NEVs were sold last year. 

China's industry ministry asked carmakers this month to carry out safety investigations on waterproof protection, high-voltage harnesses, in-vehicle charging devices, and battery boxes in their cars.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Wealth managers head to Singapore as China concerns dim Hong Kong's lure,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and John Geddie
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some foreign wealth managers are scrapping plans to open offices in Hong Kong in favor of Singapore, as the rich begin to move funds from the Chinese territory where a new extradition bill has stoked public unrest, people familiar with the matter said.
A mid-sized European private wealth advisory firm has abandoned a plan to set up its Asia arm in Hong Kong and will instead aim to launch it in Singapore, its London-based chief executive told Reuters.
""We have been watching the situation in Hong Kong for the last few weeks and what we are seeing there doesn't give us much confidence,"" said the chief executive, on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
""For me, the most important thing is stability for clients because you don't want to go and invest $1 million-$2 million to set up operations and then one day you need to shut it down because your clients don't feel safe to operate in that market.""
Some Hong Kong tycoons have begun moving their personal wealth offshore as concerns deepen over a government plan to allow extraditions of suspects to face trial in China for the first time, Reuters reported earlier this month.
The bill, which would cover Hong Kong residents and foreign and Chinese nationals living or traveling through the city, has been suspended. But protesters are now demanding it be scrapped amid broad concern it may threaten the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong's global financial status.
For the wealthy, a key worry is that Beijing may eventually be able to seize their assets, leading them to weigh moving their assets offshore. Wealth managers mostly go where their clients prefer to park their riches.
The uncertainty over the bill clouds the outlook for Hong Kong as a wealth management hub, one of the main pillars of growth in the former British colony, which has been losing ground to Singapore in recent years.
In a survey published by trade publication Asian Private Banker last year, 58% of the respondents ranked Singapore as the most preferred offshore wealth management hub, followed by Hong Kong and Switzerland, respectively.
The survey said Singapore had become particularly attractive because, compared to Hong Kong, it was ""less connected to Mainland China from a regulatory, political, and financial perspective"".
Rahul Sen, a London-based global leader for private banking at headhunter Boyden, said three of his multi-office wealth advisory clients decided in the last few weeks to hire teams of bankers in Singapore after initially considering Hong Kong.
""New teams that are being set up, they are asking why should they align with Hong Kong when the future of Hong Kong itself as an independent wealth hub is uncertain,"" Sen said.
PROPERTY INVESTMENTS
The head of Singapore's central bank said on Thursday that there were no signs of ""any significant shift of business or funds"" from Hong Kong to Singapore.
Singapore property brokers, though, said they are seeing increased inquiries and visits from Hong Kong-based groups including real estate fund managers and family offices, or private investment vehicles of the rich. 
Ian Loh, head of investments and capital markets at Knight Frank Singapore, said the investors are looking at a range of properties – including offices and hotels - starting at around S$200 million ($147.74 million) and going to over S$500 million.
Real estate in Singapore is an attractive asset class for rich individuals due to its affordability and growth outlook.
Singapore prime office monthly rents climbed 24% on the year in Q1 2019 to hit $81.2 per square meter, according to research by Knight Frank. Rents in central Hong Kong rose 3.2% to $221.5 per square meter over the same period.
""The events of recent weeks are likely to add more momentum to a trend that has emerged over the last 18 months where Hong Kong-based private investors and family offices have been looking actively at Singapore property assets,"" said Chris Marriott, CEO of Savills in Southeast Asia.
Some analysts said it remained to be seen if bigger financial institutions would move assets out of Hong Kong or bypass it.
""Singapore could be one of the beneficiaries as Hong Kong investors and high net worth individuals look to shift their funds out of Hong Kong,"" said Jenny Ling, director of office services at Colliers International.
​""(But) the likelihood of a knee-jerk reaction among companies to immediately vacate Hong Kong en masse as a result of the unrest is probably quite low.""

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",French market watchdog to London: stop trading EU shares after Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should give investment firms clarity by signaling an end to the trading of European shares in the City of London after it leaves the European Union in October, a French regulator has said.
Analysts say a showdown over share trading between Brussels and Switzerland is a reminder to London what it could face after Brexit if it clashed with the bloc in financial regulation.
The EU has refused to renew Switzerland's regulatory ""equivalence"" which allows investment firms in the bloc to trade on Swiss exchanges directly. Bern is retaliating with an order that Swiss shares can only be traded on Swiss exchanges from Monday.
In a sign that European regulators' attitudes toward Britain are hardening, Natasha Cazenave, head of international policy at French markets watchdog AMF, said trading in EU-listed shares should take place inside the bloc after Brexit.
Shares in some of the biggest companies from across the EU are currently traded on their home exchange and in London on pan-European platforms Cboe (Z:CBOE), Aquis (L:AQX) and Turquoise (L:LSE).
Cboe alone accounts for over 20 percent of trading in German, Dutch, Belgian, French, Swedish, and Spanish shares.
The bloc's markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), ruled in May that in the event of a no-deal Brexit in October, investment firms in the EU must trade about 6,000 EU-listed shares on exchanges in the bloc.
This would force funds and other users to redirect trading from London to the EU.
Cazenave said the AMF ""strongly supports"" ESMA's stance, saying it could also form the basis for future relations between the EU and Britain in share trading.
""It's a pragmatic and straightforward approach, that provides clarity to stakeholders on what would be required in the event of a no-deal Brexit,"" Cazenave told Reuters.
""Hopefully Britain will reciprocate,"" Cazenave said.
The EU ruling is known as a share trading obligation (STO), but Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has yet to formulate its own.
Reciprocating would mean Britain adopting an STO that required UK investment firms to trade UK shares in Britain, but made no reference to where EU shares should be traded, some of which have a dual listing in London.
Cazenave said a situation where a UK STO and an EU STO do not overlap could become the ready-made basis of cross-border share trading between Britain and the EU in future.
It would mean Britain not having to seek the same type of equivalence share trading deal from Brussels after Brexit that has come unstuck for Switzerland.
Britain has said it should have no problem obtaining equivalence from Brussels for UK exchanges to continue serving EU customers. FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey has said that investors should have a choice on where to trade.
Aquis has described ESMA's STO as a ""land grab"" by an EU wanting to build up its own capital market after Brexit by splitting liquidity and damaging prices.
It, along with Cboe and Turquoise, have set up new hubs in Amsterdam and Paris to cater for any post-Brexit situation that arises.
""Fragmentation is due to Brexit and not Europe,"" Cazenave said.
A senior exchange official said Brexit has made the EU realize how the STO, meant to be a technical provision, is a powerful political tool in Brussels' armory.

""It's a warning shot to Britain about what happens if you don't get a Brexit deal. It's mutual self-destruction if both sides apply hard STOs and won't be beneficial to anybody,"" the official said.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",European shares move higher ahead of pivotal G20 meeting,"By Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - European stocks edged higher on Friday, as investors treaded cautiously ahead of a critical G20 meeting where the outcome of U.S-China trade talks will be closely monitored against the backdrop of a slowing global economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump is set to hold a high-profile meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, and markets are nervous over whether the outcome of that meeting will produce progress in ending the year-long trade war that has dented growth in global markets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was up 0.16% by 0800 GMT, and Frankfurt's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) outperformed other major indexes, rising 0.39% on the strength of top lender  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""People don't know what to think before the upcoming meeting, so we're likely to see a lot of instability, uncertainty and a general lack of direction which will be resolved only at the end of the weekend,"" said Josh Mahoney, market analyst at IG in London.
""I'd err on the side of caution, we aren't going to see a major breakthrough on trade but maybe we will see plans for further discussions down the line and that in itself could give some sort of boost to markets to say it's not necessarily over quite yet.""
Hopes of a deal were muddied by a report saying Xi would give Trump a set of conditions to be met by the United States before reaching any settlement, with sentiment further dampened by a threat that the U.S. may move ahead with further tariffs on Chinese goods after the weekend summit. 
The uncertainty in markets caused by conflicting reports on trade in the week leading up to the G20 meet in Japan stalled a rally in stocks this month, and set the main index on pace to post its first weekly loss in June.
Still the benchmark index is up about 3.5% in June on expectations that major central banks would be more accommodative to counter the impact of the tariff dispute that helped the STOXX 600 index recoup most of its steep losses in May.
Deutsche Bank rose 3.1% after it passed an annual health check by the U.S. Federal Reserve, clearing a second rigorous hurdle at a critical time for the German lender in tests that measure banks' ability to weather a major economic downturn. 
""Deutsche Bank was one of the leading lights of European banking, and the idea now is that if we are seeing increased stability in the firm, there is potential for them to be pairing up with another bank, so it's a value play right now,"" Mahoney said.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were steady on Friday as uncertainty ahead of a meeting on trade between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping deterred traders from making bold directional bets.
After stock markets slipped in Asia, European shares were marginally higher, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.08%. Germany's DAX index was the biggest gainer, up 0.36% percent on the day.
Trump and Xi will meet on the sidelines of a Group of 20 (G20) summit this weekend in Osaka, Japan, for talks that could help resolve a year-long trade war between China and the United States, as signs proliferate of rising risks to global growth.
MSCI's All Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up just 0.04% on the day. 
The index was set to break a three-week streak of gains but also on course for its best month since January, gaining nearly 6% in June as equities rallied globally on the back of a pivot towards easier monetary policy from major central banks.
That shift came after a breakdown in trade negotiations between the United States and China earlier this year, and has markets betting on an interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve as early as the next policy meeting in July.
On Thursday, China's central bank pledged to support a slowing economy, ahead of the release of data that is expected to show China's factory activity shrank for a second consecutive month in June.
""Market participants are taking a cautious approach ahead of this high-level meeting as hopes for a material breakthrough are low,"" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.
""This is a stellar opportunity for the two leaders to find some common ground and unless they do so, equities will likely push lower as a prolonged period of tariffs on each other's exports will take a heavier toll on both economies and global growth.""
Currency markets also reflected caution, with the Japanese yen reversing a three-day losing streak against the dollar. 
The U.S. currency was down 0.1% against a basket of peers and set to turn in its worst monthly performance since the start of 2018. Bets on interest rate cuts from the Fed have pushed the dollar index down 1.7% this month.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei stock index ended down 0.29%.
Chinese blue chips fell 0.24% on Friday and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.32%. Australian shares shed 0.71%.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that Trump had agreed to no preconditions for the meeting with Xi and is maintaining his threat to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods.
Kudlow also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that China was insisting on lifting sanctions on Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd as part of a trade deal and that the Trump administration had tentatively agreed to delay new tariffs on Chinese goods.
""I'm not sure the Americans can deliver what the Chinese want and the Chinese don't want to deliver what the Americans want,"" said Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro, adding that he sees an ""extend and pretend"" outcome, in which Chinese and U.S. officials agree to continue talks, as the most likely outcome of the weekend meeting.
Regardless of the outcome (of the talks), McKenna said, ""we will not be in a holding pattern on Monday morning.""
Elsewhere in Europe, euro zone government bond yields hovered near record lows in many cases ahead of the release of inflation data for the bloc. 
With the euro zone expected to record inflation of 1.2% for the month of June when data is released at 1000 GMT on Friday -- well short of the European Central Bank's target of just below 2% -- investors held on to government bonds in early trade. 
In commodity markets, trade worries continued to weigh on oil, with U.S. crude losing 0.3% to $59.26 a barrel and global benchmark Brent crude down 0.36% to $66.31 per barrel. 

The weak dollar and uncertainty over global trade saw gold rebound after dipping below $1,400 per ounce on Thursday. Spot gold was last traded at $1,414.15 per ounce, up 0.35%, but down from earlier highs.

1381,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 05:04AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Activists Chalk up Another Win With Merlin Buyout,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Another day, another victory for activist U.S. investors in Europe.
Merlin Entertainments (LON:MERL), the U.K.-based theme park operator famous for its Legoland parks and various London tourist attractions, has agreed to sell itself to a consortium including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and the owners of Danish toymaker Lego for some 4.77 billion pounds ($6.06 billion), or 5.9 billion pounds including debt.
That’s a smart turnaround for the ValueAct hedge fund, which built a 9.3% stake earlier in the year and pressured Merlin to find a private buyer, saying that the shares were worth 30% more than the market thought. As it is, the purchase price is 36.8% above where it was just over a month ago, the day before ValueAct made its splash.
The move comes a day after Elliott Management triggered a sharp rally in German chemicals group Bayer (DE:BAYGN) by taking a $1.1 billion stake in it.
Merlin’s shares have languished over the last 18 months, as it has plowed almost all of its cash into expansion, notably through the construction of Peppa Pig theme parks in the U.S. and, latterly, China. Weak consumer sentiment in the U.K. and a high-profile accident at one of its theme parks haven't helped either.
Merlin was by far the top performer in London after early trading Friday, rising 14% to a 21-month high while the FTSE 100 index rose 0.2%. Other indexes were broadly higher after a raft of price data from across the euro zone gave no clear picture of a rise in inflation, strengthening the case for stimulus from the European Central Bank.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 0.75 points, or 0.2% to 382.96, although it was still on course to end the week 0.5% lower. Switzerland’s SMI stood out as the lone loser on the day, after the EU decided to restrict EU-based investors' access to the Swiss exchange in a broader dispute over access to each other's markets.
Elsewhere, Adidas (DE:ADSGN) shares haven’t been dismayed by a rare earnings miss from rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), which the U.S. company reported after the bell on Thursday. Adidas shares were up 2.3%.
And Traton (DE:8TRA), Volkswagen’s truck unit, made an underwhelming start to life as a public company. Its shares slipped over 1% after VW priced the IPO at 27 euros a share. As previously noted, the proceeds of the sale are less important to VW than the need to give its various units more independence and freedom to respond to the differing challenges that they face. Having initially eyed selling a stake of as much as 25%, the German group ended up scaling the placement down to a mere 11.5%.
(Correction: the original version of this article incorrectly stated that a 2015 crash at one of Merlin's parks had involved fatalities.)"
1382,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 04:56AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia's hometown ambitions could clip wealth fund's wings,"By Saeed Azhar and Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) risks being pulled deeper into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s domestic projects, curbing its international ambitions and tying its fortunes closer to its home market, four sources familiar with its strategy said.
Unusually for a sovereign wealth fund, which typically is solely focused on generating wealth for future generations, PIF has a two-pronged mandate - it is also expected to develop domestic projects that will reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil. That means PIF acting as a cornerstone investor on some major hometown ventures with foreign investors expected to join in.
The projects include a high-tech economic zone dubbed NEOM planned for an area close to the size of Belgium, an entertainment park outside Riyadh called Qiddiya being built on a site 2-1/2 times larger than Disney World, and a luxury tourist resort off the Red Sea coast that will span more than 90 islands.
With the exception of Six Flags, a U.S. theme park group, which signed a deal to operate at Qiddiya, no other foreign partners or investors have been publicly announced for the ventures. Six Flags did not respond to a request for comment.
Now, two years after the projects were announced, there is a risk they could be delayed or scaled back if foreign funding does not materialize because PIF won’t be able to put up all the money required in the current timeframe, according to two of the sources.
PIF’s domestic responsibilities also make it more challenging for the $300 billion fund to resume its previous frenetic pace of overseas investment. It has not made any foreign investments so far this year, according to Refinitiv data.
PIF declined to comment on the involvement of foreign capital and the impact the domestic projects could have on its plans. It said it was still aiming to have a quarter of its assets invested abroad by next year, and half by 2030 compared to 15% currently.
PIF also said significant progress had been made in financing plans for the domestic projects.
""Each Giga-Project is developing tailored partnership and financing models, through discussions and coordination between PIF, the respective management teams and lending institutions,” the fund said.
It declined to say how much it has invested so far or the amount of financing being discussed. PIF does not release information about its financial performance.
The fund lost out on an estimated $100 billion windfall when the initial public offering of oil giant Saudi Aramco was shelved last year. It has partially filled the gap by raising debt and selling a stake in a petrochemicals company.
As the world’s largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia has the means to step in if private funding doesn’t materialize for the projects. The state could inject fresh capital into PIF or finance the ventures from the central government budget but analysts said it would likely want to avoid that.
“The government has not stated any intention to inject fresh funding into the PIF and we think it will try to limit its on-budget exposure, conscious of still-high fiscal deficits and wanting to try to preserve its balance sheet strengths,” said Krisjanis Krustins, a director of sovereigns at Fitch Rating agency.
The government's communications office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
DIVERSIFICATION
Saudi authorities have said NEOM, tucked away in the desert kingdom's northwest corner, will cost $500 billion. Estimates have not been released for Qiddiya or the Red Sea Project, but a source familiar with the latter said its initial phase would cost $2.5 billion.
Local media have reported the cost of the infrastructure alone for Qiddiya would reach up to 30 billion riyals ($8 billion) and the project would eventually be worth tens of billions of riyals. Reuters could not independently verify these figures.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen people for this story, including bankers, lawyers and corporate advisers. Most of them declined to be named because of sensitivities around PIF, which is chaired by the 33-year-old crown prince, who also controls the kingdom's economic, energy and security policies.
Cyrille Urfer, who used to lead PIF’s investments in global public markets, said it was inevitable the fund would play a major role in the crown prince’s plans to diversify the economy away from crude.
""At the end of the day, the owner and the one who takes the decision is the Saudi government, and PIF is the tool that is supervising the execution of these projects,"" said Urfer, who now works at Geneva-based asset manager Unigestion.
The Red Sea Development Company, set up to develop the tourism scheme, said it was talking to banks for financing but declined to provide details. Two banking sources told Reuters the company had so far only approached local lenders.
For international investors, reputational risk is a factor when investing in Saudi Arabia. British billionaire Richard Branson suspended his directorship of the Red Sea Project after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year by operatives close to the crown prince.
Last week, the United Nations called for the crown prince to be investigated after it said there was credible evidence linking him to the killing. The government rejected the report.
A spokeswoman for Branson’s company, Virgin, told Reuters his position had not changed.
The Qiddiya Investment Company said it had been in talks with potential investors for the last year.
""We expect this pattern will increase significantly as more of the detailed plans of the project become known,"" the company said in a statement.
MULTI-DECADE
Since the crown prince took charge of PIF in 2015, it has transformed from a staid state holding company into an aggressive purchaser of assets. It has doubled in size, bought stakes in companies such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), committed half the funding for a planned $40 billion infrastructure fund with U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX), and allocated $45 billion to a technology fund run by Japan’s SoftBank.
For a factbox on PIF’s investments click on
Still, PIF has some way to go before it fulfils the crown prince's ambition for it to be the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. It is currently one-third the size of Norway's wealth fund – the global leader – which invests all its assets abroad.
The PIF could invest in a second technology fund currently being raised by SoftBank. But with Saudi Arabia estimated to be running a larger budget deficit this year due to higher government spending, people familiar with PIF say it is unlikely to contribute a large amount, if any.
PIF has declined to comment on its intentions for the second technology fund. Son has said initially SoftBank would likely be the only investor.
To raise funds for its investments, PIF sold a 70% stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) to Aramco in March for $69 billion and borrowed $11 billion from the loan market. It will get half of the SABIC proceeds when the deal closes next year and the rest will be paid over two years.
PIF plans to borrow at least another $8 billion later this year via a bridge loan.
A NEOM spokesman said funds for the mega-zone would come from PIF, the finance ministry, investments from local private investors, foreign direct investment, public-private partnerships and other international financial institutions and banks.
""PIF will need the help of many investors,"" said a person who advised it on projects, including NEOM.
SoftBank is considering investing or partnering in the Saudi projects although no money has yet been committed, a source familiar with the matter said.
Three bankers who looked at the three projects say foreign money has been put off so far by a lack of detail on what protections financiers would have in the event of a default and scepticism about when they would see returns.

A PIF strategy paper puts the projects' expected return at 8.5% without specifying a timeline. It describes them as ""multi-decade"" endeavors.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",Failure at a big Indian non-bank lender could cause large damage: central bank,"By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Failure of a large Indian non-banking financial company could cause as much damage as the collapse of a big commercial lender, the Reserve Bank of India said, stressing a need for greater surveillance of these firms.
The central bank issued the warning in its latest Financial Stability Report, released on Thursday night, in which it also forecast that the proportion of debt-burdened commercial banks' non-performing assets (NPAs) would fall slightly by March next March.
A series of defaults last year by a financing firm, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), led to the government taking over its operations. 
That was followed by defaults by some other non-banking financial firms (NBFCs), also known as shadow banks, triggering a surge in borrowing costs and causing a freeze in much of their lending.
Dewan Housing Finance, one of India's largest housing finance companies (HFC), had multiple defaults on interest payments. It has stopped taking deposits and delayed some debt payments, citing cashflow problems.
While the RBI has taken measures in recent months to address the sector's liquidity issues, the stability report marks the first time it has spelled out publicly the extent of the risks to the overall financial system from such defaults.
It said solvency contagion losses to the banking system due to ""idiosyncratic HFC/NBFC failure"" show that the failure of largest such institutions ""can cause losses comparable to those caused by the big banks"", underscoring the need for greater surveillance.
CONTAGION RISKS
However, the risks of contagion to the banking system have lessened because the public-sector banking system is now better capitalised, the report said.
The Financial Stability Report is published by the RBI in June and December.
The central bank said bank borrowings have risen. Their share of total borrowings was 29.2% in March 2019 versus 23.6% a year earlier and 21.2% in March 2017.
""This indicates that banks are compensating for the reduced market access for NBFCs in the wake of stress in the sector,"" the RBI said.
In the commercial paper market, which was heavily relied on by the NBFCs and HFCs, absolute issuance has declined sharply relative to its level before the IL&FS defaults, the RBI said.
Consequently NBFCs and HFCs now rely more on long-term bank loans for their funding, which could be unsustainable, it added.

""IL&FS stress episode brought the NBFC sector under greater market discipline as the better performing companies continued to raise funds while those with asset-liability management and/or asset quality concerns were subjected to higher borrowing costs,"" the RBI wrote in the report.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 03:45AM ET</span>",Japan overhauls buyout guidelines to protect minority shareholders,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry has overhauled its guidelines for mergers and acquisitions to better protect minority shareholders in the case of management buyouts, a move that comes amid a renewed focus on shareholder rights in corporate Japan.
The recommendations, revised for the first time in 12 years, call for an independent committee to be set up by the target company in the case of management buyouts, to assess whether the deal is fair. 
""Inevitably there is a conflict of interest between ordinary shareholders and corporate management in a transaction where management buys shares from other shareholders,"" the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said in the new guidelines published on Friday. 
""Management can benefit directly by lowering the price it pays to shareholders who are the sellers.""
The independent committee should consist of outside directors as well as experts to review the transaction terms, the ministry said. The guidelines should also apply to transactions where a company with a majority control of an affiliate attempts to buy that affiliate, the ministry said.
Activist investors have been gaining momentum in Japan and have complained about what they see as poor performance as well as returns from cash-hoarding firms, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe advocating strengthening corporate governance.
But companies are often able to ignore minority investors, given the longstanding practice of cross-shareholding, where firms hold stakes in each other to cement business ties.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian advertisers are on track to spend more than $400 million during this year's ICC Cricket World Cup, looking to cash in on a mania that is smashing viewing records in the world's biggest market for the sport.
About 1.5 billion people are expected to watch the tournament worldwide, more than 15 times the audience for the Super Bowl of American football.
From ride-hailing firm Uber (N:UBER) to tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and snacks maker Mondelez (O:MDLZ), companies are banking on television, radio and online campaigns, as well as live fan events, to woo cricket-mad consumers.
""We might have different religions, but cricket is the biggest one,"" said Shashi Kumar, a 34-year-old in the southern technology hub of Bengaluru, who said the game unites the country and brings people together. 
The surge in advertisement spending during the six-week tournament that runs until July 14 could boost consumer demand and help India's economy run out its slowest period of growth in four years, analysts say. [nL4N2373FI]
""Brands would not like to lose the opportunity to capitalize on this frenzy,"" said Vinita Pachisia, senior vice-president at media agency Carat India, part of the Dentsu Aegis Network.
Although a niche sport with just 10 participating countries, versus 79 in the FIFA soccer championship, cricket's popularity in the Indian subcontinent means companies allot about half of their marketing budget to the World Cup. Sponsors and media buyers say they expect more than 800 million Indians to watch this year, but there are no official projections. Four years ago, 635 million watched, mainly on television, as online streaming was in its infancy in India. The much-anticipated match between arch rivals India and Pakistan on June 16 prompted 206 million fans to tune in to official broadcaster Star network, a unit of Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), to watch India win.
Star's streaming platform, Hotstar, said the 15.6 million concurrent users for the match was its highest tally for a one-day international game. 
'WORLD CUP MANIA'
The matches start later in India's day and run through prime time, while the return to a round-robin format cuts the chances of an early knockout of favorites Australia, India and New Zealand. 
They are also being broadcast in six more Indian languages this year, as well as Hindi and English.
Greater television and internet access and India's success under captain Virat Kohli have helped push spot advertising rates up by 40% to 60% from four years ago, media buyers say.
They estimate this year's advertising spend of more than $400 million will be nearly double of 2015.
Smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930), which is giving away Amazon Echo devices with high-end TV sets, said it doubled sales of big-screen TV sets in the month before the tournament began on May 30, versus last year.
 Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which operates in eight World Cup countries, ran a contest offering tickets to the games in Britain as prizes, while  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), maker of Cadbury's chocolates, launched a special variety.
The ""World Cup Mania"" sale of Amazon.Com Inc's (O:AMZN) rival Flipkart, a unit of Walmart (N:WMT), offers discounts on televisions, and its digital payments unit Phone Pe is running promotions online. 
""We want to reach the next 250 million Indians who are on the internet, but not using digital payments yet,"" said the unit's chief executive, Sameer Nigam. 
Spot TV advertising slots for the June 16 match cost up to 2.5 million rupees ($36,000), versus a package for all games ranging between 1 million and 1.5 million rupees, media buyers say.
Some companies are also sponsoring fanzones.
A thousand fans watched the India-Pakistan match at a brew pub in the southern technology hub of Bengaluru, in an event sponsored by Bira 91, a recent entrant to the beer market, backed by U.S.-based Sequoia Capital. 

""We wanted to pick up a sport which had very very wide appeal to Indian consumers and there is nothing comparable to cricket,"" said Chief Executive Ankur Jain.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",Defense contractor consolidation a security concern: U.S. Air Force acquisition head,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The number of major U.S. defense contractors has shrunk to the point of becoming a national security concern, according to the U.S. Air Force's acquisition head, who said his service needed to have more frequent competitions to benefit smaller companies.
The comment came after U.S. President Donald Trump this month expressed concern that United Technologies Corp's plan to (N:UTX) combine its aerospace business with that of  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN) could harm competition and make it more difficult to negotiate defense contracts. The $121 billion deal would be the sector's biggest-ever merger.
Will Roper, assistant secretary of the U.S. Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics, said when his service was formed in 1947, over a dozen companies could make airplanes.
""Right now we are down to just a couple of companies who can build tactical airplanes for us. We need to do everything in our power to start opening up that envelope again,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of a defense technology conference in Singapore on Friday.
He said U.S. Air Force tenders for major equipment typically required so much design effort that it was unaffordable for all but the very biggest defense contractors to compete.
""For competition to be positive it has to occur frequently enough that the winners are happy but the losers don't have to fundamentally change their company,"" he said.
Roper, who oversees an annual budget of more than $40 billion, said because the United Technologies-Raytheon deal was not finalised, the U.S. Air Force did not have a position on it.
But he said the service was focused on funding start-ups and working with smaller companies like Kratos Defense and Security Solutions Inc (O:KTOS), which is developing the $2 million to $3 million Valkryie combat drone designed to fly alongside crewed aircraft.
The Valkyrie is ""attritable"", which Roper said is defined as expensive enough to be lethal but cheap enough to take the risk that it will not return from a mission.
""In my mind the cap was a missile defense interceptor cost, so nothing more than, say, $10 million,"" he said.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) in February unveiled a larger unmanned fighter-like jet developed in Australia, and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) is also investing in attritables.
Roper said there would be room in the market for different types of the drones, which could fight alongside F-35s and F-15s controlled by those jets' pilots.

""I think that we will have large systems that are designed to have many takeoffs and landings but not be kept for decades,"" he said. ""I think we'll have very small systems that are somewhere between a weapon and a very small drone that I think of as more reusable weapons.""

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 01:55AM ET</span>",U.S. dominates second-quarter global M&A as mega deals roll on,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mega deals set the pace for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) globally in the second quarter of 2019, as large U.S. companies defied trade row jitters and seized on strong equity and debt capital markets to agree on transformative combinations.
Global M&A volume reached $842 billion in the second quarter, down 13% and 27% from the first quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2018 respectively, according to preliminary data from financial data provider Refinitiv. 
Geopolitical risks that weighed on dealmakers' confidence, such as the trade dispute between the United States and China and the potential for a military confrontation between the United States and Iran, were partly offset by supportive financing markets that made big acquisitions possible.
This quarter's volume would have been significantly lower were it not for U.S. mega deals, given that total deal count globally fell to its lowest quarterly level since the 2008 financial crisis, Refinitiv data showed. 
""The vast majority of transforming deals worth more than $10 billion have taken place in the U.S. This means Europe is lagging behind, and while U.S. companies are doubling in size, their European counterparts risk losing their competitive edge,"" said JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) global M&A co-head Hernan Cristerna.
Among the top deals this quarter were the $121 billion agreed merger of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Corp's airspace division with U.S. contractor  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc's (N:ABBV) $63 billion agreement to acquire peer Allergan Plc (N:AGN), and Occidental Petroleum Corp's (N:OXY) $38 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC).
U.S. M&A totaled $466 billion in the second quarter, down just 3% from a year ago. Dealmaking in Europe, however, plunged 54% to $152 billion, while Asia M&A dived 49% to $132 billion.
Some attempts at big European mergers, such as a tie-up of auto makers  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles BV (MI:FCHA) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), as well as of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), failed amid political resistance and concerns over regulatory scrutiny.
""Every quarter that goes by without progress in combining European companies and helping them adjust to technological and geopolitical disruption means there will be pent-up supply and demand for deals down the line to achieve that adjustment,"" said Perella Weinberg Partners LP founding partner Paulo Pereira. 
Cross-border M&A also suffered because of the trade jitters. It has been over 400 days since a cross-border deal of more than $20 billion has been announced, said  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) global M&A co-head Cary Kochman.
""The ease with which corporates approached globalization has waned. In its place are regional models and the realignment of domestic supply chains,"" said Kochman.
Dealmaking by private equity firms soared to $136 billion, almost an all-time high, as cheap debt fueled leveraged buyouts.
Some dealmakers now say they see confidence in smaller companies to explore M&A following the wave of mega deals, which may lead to a bump in the number of transactions.
""What we have seen so far this year is a steady number of mega deals, and all signs suggest this will continue,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Americas head of M&A Tom Miles.

""But what is also beginning to happen is that smaller and mid-sized companies, that were nervous about pursuing deals early in the year, are now feeling comfortable enough with the economic environment to also explore M&A,"" Miles added.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 01:54AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Morgan Stanley likely to gain majority control of China securities JV in H2 - sources,"By Kane Wu and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is likely to get regulatory approval for owning a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture in the second half of this year, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The U.S. investment bank's joint venture informed the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) a couple of months ago about plans to changes in equity holding, subject to regulatory approval, the people said.
Morgan Stanley is seeking to raise its holding in the venture with Chinese partner Huaxin Securities to 51% from 49%. The venture's offerings includes underwriting and sponsoring of stock and bond sales.
The approval is likely to come in the second half of the year, the people said, with one saying it is likely to be as soon as the fourth quarter.
The timeline for possible approval to ownership changes in the joint venture has not been reported before.
When approved, Morgan Stanley will join rivals  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) and UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) in owning controlling stakes in onshore securities joint ventures in China under liberalized rules announced in November 2017.
The move by Morgan Stanley comes even as the United States and China have waged a year-long trade war marked by tit-for-tat import tariffs on each other's goods. The likely approval, however, will be another indication that China is nevertheless pushing ahead with its agenda to open up its financial sector, after JPMorgan's approval in March.
China has in recent months allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in domestic joint ventures across mutual funds, insurance and brokerage businesses.
Earlier in June, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman said he wanted majority ownership of a joint venture in China, but that regulators has not signed off on the idea. Morgan Stanley also has a fund management joint venture in the country. Gorman did not identify which venture he was referring to.
Morgan Stanley's senior Hong Kong bankers in recent months have been working on integrating its operations with the joint venture's, another person said. Those efforts are progressing ""at full speed"", the person said.
The outcome of Sino-U.S. talks to reach a trade deal could, however, impact the approval timeline, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss regulatory matters with media.
A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong declined to comment. The CSRC has not responded to a Reuters request for comment. 
MORE SERVICES
Shanghai Fortune, the parent of Huaxin, said in a June 13 regulatory filing that it planned to divest of a 2% stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities through a bidding process for no less than 376.2 million yuan ($54.72 million).
The firm did not disclose possible bidders, but such a process is usually a means of transferring additional shares to an existing joint venture partner. After winning the auction, the bidder would still need regulatory approval.
Morgan Stanley raised its stake in the venture to 49% from 33.3% in 2017, betting on strong deals momentum. Before easing ownership rules in late 2017, China allowed foreigners to own a maximum 49% in such ventures.
That lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for Wall Street banks, and became a key issue in Washington's push to persuade Beijing to open up its market for wider foreign participation.
The lifting of the cap on foreign stakes to 51% has allowed Western banks to buy more shares from their partners in existing joint ventures or enter into new partnerships.
JPMorgan and Nomura became the latest to win regulatory approval to set up majority-owned brokerage joint ventures in March this year. UBS received approval in November to hold a majority stake in its existing joint venture.
Management control would allow foreign banks including Morgan Stanley to offer more services through their joint ventures and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share, bankers have previously said.

The proceeding will evaluate findings in the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) Safety and Enforcement Division (SED) investigation into whether PG&E violated any rules during the wildfires, CPUC said Thursday.
The regulator said an investigation into the wildfires by SED found that PG&E failed to follow best industry practices, and that there were ""various deficiencies in its vegetation management practices and procedures and equipment operations in severe conditions.""
""PG&E's violations during the 2017 fire siege are extensive and disturbing, and go to basic requirements, such as the failure to maintain adequate records,"" said CPUC Commissioner Clifford Rechtschaffen. 
""We will consider all appropriate sanctions in response.""
The CPUC also ordered the utility to provide a report on its operations of its electric facilities and to take ""immediate corrective action.""
PG&E said it was reviewing the CPUC's order and SED's findings in the wildfires, adding that it would ""fully cooperate"" with the investigation.
CPUC also asked PG&E to create a mobile application for the public to report issues with utility poles.
The San Francisco-based utility filed for bankruptcy in January, citing potential civil liabilities in excess of $30 billion from the North Bay fires and a separate 2018 blaze that killed 85 people.
""We understand and recognize the CPUC's concerns, and acknowledge that while we have implemented significant additional wildfire mitigation measures following the devastating 2017 and 2018 wildfires, there is still more work todo and we are committed to doing it the right way,"" PG&E said in a statement.

PG&E has named a new chief executive officer and revamped its board this year. It has also said it would significantly expand the practice of shutting off power to communities at risk of wildfire when conditions demand it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shares in Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc fell by 1.6% after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission disclosed it has opened an investigation into whether the company misled the agency in its failed effort to win approval for a $3.9 billion bid to purchase Tribune Media Co.
In a June 25 letter to Sinclair posted Wednesday on the FCC’s website, the government agency's media bureau directed Sinclair to answer a series of questions by July 9.
On Thursday, the letter had been removed from the FCC's website.
The FCC did not explain why the letter had been removed but in a statement Thursday said the ""Media Bureau is in the process of resolving an outstanding issue regarding Sinclair’s conduct as part of the last year's FCC’s review of its proposed merger with Tribune. The Bureau believes that delaying consideration of this matter would not be in anyone's interest.""
Sinclair said Thursday ""this is part of an ongoing discussion initiated by Sinclair to work with the FCC to respond to certain allegations raised"" last year by the FCC when it referred the issue for a hearing.
Sinclair could face fines from the FCC. In 2017, the FCC fined Sinclair $13.38 million for failing to disclose that programing on local TV stations that looked like news stories was sponsored by a cancer institute.
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said Thursday that ""any settlement negotiated behind closed doors will leave us with more questions than answers about one of the nation’s largest broadcasters. The FCC should hold a hearing in public on these questions and do it now.""
Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair, which has 192 stations, in August. A month earlier the FCC referred the deal for a hearing, questioning Sinclair’s candor over the planned sale of some stations and suggesting Sinclair would effectively retain control over them.
An administrative judge in March dropped plans for a hearing into allegations that Sinclair may have misled regulators. Judge Jane Halprin added however that the allegations “are extremely serious charges that reasonably warrant a thorough examination.”
U.S. President Donald Trump backed the deal and its collapse potentially ended Sinclair’s hopes of building a national conservative-leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s Fox News.
Nexstar Media Group Inc said in December it will buy Tribune in a $4.1 billion deal that would make it the largest regional U.S. TV station operator. The deal is still under review by the Justice Department and the FCC.

In May, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co said it would sell its interests in 21 regional sports networks and Fox College Sports to Sinclair for $9.6 billion.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 09:27PM ET</span>","Apple design chief Jony Ive, Steve Jobs' confidant, to leave and start own firm","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Jony Ive, a close creative collaborator with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs whose iPhone and other designs fueled Apple's rise to a $1 trillion company, will leave later this year to form an independent design company.
Apple said Ive will continue work on its products at his new venture, but shares fell as much as 1.5% to $197.44 in after-market trading, wiping about $9 billion from the firm's value.
Ive spent nearly three decades at Apple, leading the design of the candy-colored iMacs that helped Apple re-emerge from near death in the 1990s to the iPhone, regarded by some experts as one of the most successful consumer products of all time.
""It's the most significant departure of somebody who was a core part of the growth story"" under Jobs, said Ben Bajarin, analyst with Creative Strategies. 
Ive joined Apple in 1992 and led Apple's design teams since 1996. He became chief design officer in 2015.
Ive's new company will be called LoveFrom, the Financial Times reported, quoting Ive as saying it would be based in California ""for now."" Ive told the newspaper he would work on Apple devices in addition to unspecified ""personal passions"" and non-Apple projects.
""I have the utmost confidence in my designer colleagues at Apple, who remain my closest friends, and I look forward to working with them for many years to come,"" Ive said.
Ive's departure comes amid falling iPhone sales, including a record drop in Apple's most recent quarter. Sales of some newer hardware products such as the Apple Watch and its wireless AirPods headphones are expanding, but Apple has turned its attention to growing its services business, which includes Apple Music and iCloud.
Nehal Chokshi, an analyst with Maxim Group, said that despite Ive's key role in Apple history, his departure will not hurt the iPhone maker.
""I would view it as Jony Ive looking to get paid market rates for his design expertise from Apple, with the right to allow other companies - not competitors to Apple - to leverage that expertise,"" Chokshi said.
CONTINUITY AFTER JOBS 
Jobs deeply involved himself in Apple's design process, sometimes visiting Apple's design studios daily to offer Ive feedback. Chief Executive Tim Cook, to whom Ive now reports, has not done the same.
After Jobs' death, pundits questioned whether Apple could continue Jobs' pace of new products. Ive became a symbol of continuity, bridging the Jobs and Cook eras.
But Alan Cannistraro, chief executive of online video discovery platform Rheo who previously worked at Apple for a dozen years, said Apple employees knew Ive had taken on fewer day-to-day design duties in the past several years. Around 2015, Cannistraro would often see Ive at a high-end fitness gym on Market Street in San Francisco doing mid-morning workouts.
""When I would see him there, two days a week or more, that just told me he had taken a step back,"" Cannistraro said.
Ive came to oversee both hardware and software design at Apple, but the company laid the groundwork for his departure over several years. During 2015, Ive handed off some duties to other executives while he finished Apple's new corporate headquarters, Apple Park.
One of those executives was Alan Dye, who Apple on Thursday said will become vice president of human interface design. The company appointed Evans Hankey as vice president of industrial design. Both have ""played key leadership roles"" in Apple's design team for years, the company said.
Cannistraro, the former Apple employee, said Hankey stood out as ""exceptional"" among Apple's already strong design teams. Around 2008, as Apple readied new iMacs, Hankey dug in on an idea to make Apple products talk to each other as a home control system.
The effort, which was never released, was not part of Hankey's official duties. But she took an interest anyway because of her “very long-term vision kind of role – looking for seeds that could turn into something bigger, or maybe plant some seeds, too,” Cannistraro said.
The elevation of Dye and Hankey could reignite the connection between Apple's design teams and senior executives. Both will report to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB), who will in turn hand off logistics and supply chain duties to Sabih Khan, newly named senior vice president of operations. 
Meantime, Williams, who oversaw development of the Apple Watch, ""will spend more of his time working with the design team in their studio,"" Apple said.
Williams has gained clout in Apple's product development process, but that does not necessarily mean he is poised to become chief executive in the near future, Maxim Group's Chokshi said.

""I don't see Tim Cook retiring anytime soon,"" Chokshi said.

It reiterated that it would defend itself against the class action, although it said the lead applicant had not made any claim against his franchisee employer and no franchisee employer was party to the action.
Instead, employees are seeking compensation against Domino's for alleged underpayment by franchisee employers.
The suit, filed by law firm Phi Finney McDonald in the Federal Court of Australia, alleges that Domino's misled franchisees by telling them not to pay delivery drivers and in-store workers according to minimum standards.
Fast food employees are entitled to a minimum weekly wage of A$813.60 ($565.86), according to requirements set by the Australian Fair Work Commission.
The Australia-listed Domino's, which is the largest franchisee of the Domino's Pizza (N:DPZ) brand outside the United States, operates in seven countries with over 2,000 stores.
The class action was filed on behalf of Australian employees who were employed as delivery drivers or in-store workers between June 24, 2013 and Jan. 24, 2018, Phi Finney McDonald said.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Boeing sees fix for latest 737 MAX software flaw in September,"By David Shepardson, Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will take until at least September to fix a newly identified problem on its grounded 737 MAX, a company official told Reuters, meaning the workhorse jet's return to service will be delayed until October at the earliest, significantly longer than most airlines had expected. 
Boeing shares closed 3% lower on Thursday, after the Chicago-based company told air carriers that it would complete the latest software update for the 737 MAX by September after a new issue arose last week during a simulator test.
That is later than most airlines had expected: American Airlines (O:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker said on June 12 it was ""highly likely"" flights would resume by mid-August. Most airlines have taken the MAX off their schedules until early September. 
Once Boeing completes the update, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration must review the fix and the results of a certification test flight that will not be scheduled until at least September, a process that will take at least two to three weeks. The new timeline means the plane is not likely to resume flying commercially until at least October, leading to thousands more flight cancellations. 
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) has said it will need 30 days after the FAA grants approval before it can resume flights.
The FAA declined to comment Thursday on the timeline but said on Wednesday it is ""following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 MAX to passenger service. The FAA will lift the aircraft’s prohibition order when we deem it is safe to do so.""
Boeing is grappling with the fallout of two crashes of its 737 MAX jet within five months, killing a combined 346 people and prompting a worldwide grounding in March and a slew of litigation.
Boeing has been working on an upgrade for a stall-prevention system known as MCAS since the first 737 MAX crash on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October, when pilots were believed to have lost a tug of war with software that repeatedly pushed the nose down.
A new problem with MAX software emerged last week when FAA test pilots were reviewing potential failure scenarios of the flight control computer in a MAX simulator, a Boeing official told Reuters.
Under one scenario where a specific fault in a microprocessor caused an uncommanded movement of the plane's horizontal tail, it took pilots too long to recognize a loss of control known as runaway stabilizer, the Boeing official said. 
Southwest, the world’s largest MAX operator with 34 jets and dozens more on order, said on Thursday it was extending 737 MAX cancellations until early October.
American Airlines and United Airlines (O:UAL), which also operate the MAX in the United States, have pulled the planes from their schedules into early September and said they had no further comment on Thursday. 
 Air Canada  (TO:AC), another large MAX operator, said it was ""still reviewing"" whether to extend its flight cancellations beyond September.
SETTLEMENT TALKS
Meanwhile on Thursday, Boeing lawyers said they were negotiating settlements with the families of dozens of Lion Air crash victims, meaning the planemaker can avoid prolonged and potentially costly court litigation.
However, the families of some victims of the second 737 MAX crash on Ethiopian Airlines on March 10 are not ready to settle, their lawyers told a Chicago judge on Thursday.
""There are families who insist on knowing what Boeing knew, when they knew it, what they did about it and what they're going to do about it to prevent events like this in the future,"" attorney Robert Clifford, who represents families of several Ethiopian Airline victims, said at a court hearing. 
A judge granted a request by Clifford and other plaintiff lawyers for discovery over objections by Boeing, meaning the planemaker must turn over documents about the MAX.
A status hearing on the Ethiopian litigation is scheduled for Sept. 17.

Boeing has said it estimates over $1 billion in costs just from its 737 MAX production slowdown as deliveries of its top-selling jet remain frozen. The estimate does not include potential compensation to victims and airlines.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Asia bankers bet on Alibaba, follow-on fundraising amid trade gloom","By Julie Zhu and Jennifer Hughes
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's army of equity capital bankers are betting on a stream of listed companies seeking fresh funds, including Alibaba's plans for an up to $20 billion Hong Kong share sale, as trade tensions continue to weigh on the big business of taking firms public.
Proceeds from IPOs in Asia-Pacific halved in the six months ended June to $22.5 billion, data from Refinitiv shows. 
Overall equity capital raising volumes fell by 26%, even as companies including newly-listed technology stocks sought fresh funds via follow-on offerings and convertible bonds. 
Bankers said IPO volumes were weakened by volatile markets amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. 
""Investors have become more cautious about valuations,"" said Li Hang, head of global equity capital markets and syndicate at investment bank CLSA. 
""They show less interest in deals and tend to wait longer instead of giving an early indication of interest unless it's a must-hold stock,"" he added.
Not even one IPO made the biggest 10 equity market deals so far this year in Asia-Pacific. The $1.2 billion initial public offering by Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group Co Ltd <600989.SS> in Shanghai in April was the 11th biggest equity deal.
The two biggest equity deals were the $6 billion and $3.9 billion raised via convertible bonds by China Citic Bank (SS:601998) and Ping An Bank (SZ:000001), respectively.
Hong Kong exchange was still the busiest in the region for IPOs, with $7.3 billion to its credit, Refinitiv data shows. 
That includes the $1 billion raised by generic drugmaker Hansoh Pharmaceutical (HK:3692) but not the up to $1.24 billion expected for logistics property developer ESR Cayman, which pulled its deal this month amid shaky markets.
""There are a lot fewer elephant-sized IPOs in the pipeline and the long list of smaller deals will need a more stable market backdrop for many of them to complete,"" said Alex Abagian, co-head of Asia Pacific equity capital markets at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
ALIBABA SPURS HOPES
By far the largest upcoming deal is the expected Hong Kong listing by  Alibaba  (K:BABA) (N:BABA), which would be the biggest secondary share sale globally in seven years. 
The U.S.-listed e-commerce giant has filed confidentially for the deal, expected in the coming months. 
Alibaba's plan is also notable for being the first tech company to use a 2018 rule change in Hong Kong aimed at tempting New York-listed Chinese companies to list closer to home. 
The Hong Kong exchange is taking a patient approach to hope that others might follow Alibaba's lead. 
""It's a complicated matter for these companies,"" said Christina Bao, HKEX's head of global issuer services. There are ""a lot of moving pieces - not just within the company but also in the capital markets and in the macro environment"".
Follow-on and convertible offerings have dominated Asia's equity capital raising this year, helped by companies' need for financing despite market turmoil and the fact that many recent tech IPOs raised less than they had hoped. 
Chinese EV maker NIO raised $650 million via a convertible bond in January, just four months after a $1.15 billion IPO, while game streaming group Huya Inc (N:HUYA) raised $327 million in a follow-on share offering in April.
While convertible activity has quietened as interest rates eased, the products are popular in a rising rate environment and bankers believe the boom in such fund raising will continue. 

""If you're a high growth company, having alternative sources of capital to tap into - such as convertible bonds - to fund that growth is important,"" said David Binnion, co-head of equity capital markets in Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 06:50PM ET</span>",U.S. judge limits bondholders' claim on Puerto Rico pension system assets,"(Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge on Thursday ruled that bondholders' claim on the assets of Puerto Rico's public employee pension system ended when the system filed for bankruptcy in May 2017.
The ruling is a setback for owners of nearly $3 billion of bonds sold by the system after a U.S. Appeals Court in January determined they had a legally enforceable claim as of December 2015 on assets pledged by the pension fund to pay off the debt. 
But Judge Laura Taylor Swain decided the claim on employer contributions to the Employees Retirement System did not extend into bankruptcy.
The judge is hearing cases involving the U.S. Commonwealth's attempt to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. 
After completing restructurings for Puerto Rico's sales tax-backed debt and its Government Development Bank, the island's federally created financial oversight board is addressing core government debt. The board recently announced an agreement with a court-appointed committee representing more than 167,000 retirees that includes reductions in certain pension payments.
Robert Gordon, a partner at Jenner & Block and the retiree committee's lead counsel, called Swain's latest ruling ""very important and appropriate.""
""In combination with the plan support agreement recently reached by the Official Retiree Committee with the oversight board and other plan support agreements recently made, it appears that momentum is developing toward a plan of adjustment for Puerto Rico,” he said in a statement.
The board has said a plan was coming soon even though Puerto Rico's government opposes pension cuts it includes and only a small percentage of bondholders have agreed to a restructuring of general obligation and Public Buildings Authority debt.
Prior to its bankruptcy filing, Puerto Rico’s pension system liquidated almost all of its cash assets and the government moved to a pay-as-you-go system in which pension benefits are paid out of the island’s general fund.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",U.S. dependence on China's rare earth: Trade war vulnerability,"(Reuters) - Rare earth elements are used in a wide range of consumer products, from iPhones to electric car motors, as well as military jet engines, satellites and lasers.
Rising tensions between the United States and China have sparked concerns that Beijing could use its dominant position as a supplier of rare earths for leverage in the trade war between the two global economic powers.
China supplied 80% of the rare earths imported by the United States from 2014 to 2017.
China is home to at least 85% of the world's capacity to process rare earth ores into material manufacturers can use, according to research firm Adamas Intelligence.
It would take years to build enough processing plants to match China's processing capacity of 220,000 tonnes - which is five times the combined capacity of the rest of the world.
Alternative processing plants would struggle to compete with China's low costs in the future, should trade tensions abate.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS USED IN?
Rare earths are used in rechargeable batteries for electric and hybrid cars, advanced ceramics, computers, DVD players, wind turbines, catalysts in cars and oil refineries, monitors, televisions, lighting, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and glass polishing.
Several rare earth elements, such as neodymium and dysprosium, are critical to the motors used in electric vehicles. 
Some rare earth minerals are essential in military equipment such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, missile defense systems, satellites, as well as in lasers.
Since 2010, the government and private industry have built up stockpiles of rare earths and components that use them, according to Eugene Gholz, a former senior Pentagon supply chain expert, who teaches at the University of Notre Dame.
Some manufacturers have also scaled back their use of such elements, or substituted them for other metals, he said.
WHICH COMPANIES ARE MOST DEPENDENT ON CHINESE SUPPLIES?
Companies such as  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and BAE Systems Plc (L:BAES) all make sophisticated missiles that use rare earths metals in their guidance systems, and sensors. Lockheed and BAE declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) uses rare earth elements in speakers, cameras and to make phones vibrate.
The United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS AND WHERE DO THEY OCCUR?
Rare earth metals are a group of 17 elements - lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium - that appear in low concentrations in the ground.
Although they are more abundant than their name implies, they are costly to process. Graphic: Rare earth production, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2I4ixHG 
Importers made limited efforts to reduce rare earth consumption and dependence on China after a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan in 2010. Japan accused China of halting rare earth supplies for political reasons, sparking recognition worldwide of the risks of dependence on one supplier. China denied it had halted supplies.
California's Mountain Pass mine is the only operating U.S. rare earths facility. But MP Materials, owner of Mountain Pass, ships the roughly 50,000 tonnes of rare earth concentrate it extracts each year from California to China for processing. China has imposed a tariff of 25% on those imports during the trade war.
Australia's  Lynas Corp  Ltd (AX:LYC) in May said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Texas-based Blue  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN) to build a rare earth processing facility in the United States. 
Lynas this month said it was stockpiling production of neodymium praseodymium, used in industrial magnets, for strategic customers, but did not name them.
Rare earths are also mined in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia and Vietnam. 
HOW ARE RARE EARTHS AFFECTED BY U.S. TARIFFS?
So far, the U.S. government has exempted rare earths from tariffs on Chinese goods.
OPTIONS TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CHINESE IMPORTS
The U.S. Commerce Department earlier in June recommended the United States take urgent steps to boost domestic rare earth production, warning that a halt in Chinese supplies could disrupt global supply chains.
The report recommended short-term measures such as stockpiling and longer-term measures to explore, develop and process more rare earth.
The U.S. Defense Department is also seeking federal funds to increase domestic rare earth production. Senators in May introduced legislation to encourage the sector's development.
As yet, recycling is not a significant source of rare earth minerals.
HOW HAVE RARE EARTHS PRICES REACTED TO THE RISING TENSIONS?
Having held largely steady for the past several months, the export prices of an array of rare earth elements have rallied strongly since Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to a rare earth processing firm in southern China on May 20.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 05:55PM ET</span>",Ram tough: FCA turns up the heat on GM and Ford in U.S. truck sales war,"By Nick Carey, Paul Lienert and Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - At Planet Ford, which boasts it is the No. 1 Ford volume dealer in the Houston area, customers shopping for a 2019 F-150 pickup truck can get discounts from  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) of more than $8,000 - and that is just the start. 
The dealership's website lists a dozen other ways for truck buyers to get a price cut: being a student, a member of the military or a first-responder organization, a season-ticket holder for the National Football League's Houston Texans, or a member of the Farm Bureau.
""Ford is a sponsor of the Houston Rodeo, and offers an additional $1,000 rebate on the F-150 to people who volunteer with the rodeo,"" said Aaron Smith, general sales manager at Planet Ford.
Rodeo fans would feel right at home watching the frenzied competition in the U.S. large pickup truck market. 
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), General Motors Co (N:GM) and Ford escalated a price war in June in one of the few vehicle market segments on the planet that offers substantial profits - and one in which the three Detroit automakers enjoy an oligopoly, shielded by heavy tariffs on foreign competition. 
During the past month, dealers for FCA's Ram truck brand, GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks and Ford's F-series truck line have been offering discounts of up to 30% or more off the list price. The GMC brand is promoting June as ""Truck Month,"" signaling to consumers that deep discounts are on offer until the close of the sales reporting period, July 1.
U.S. automakers report June and second-quarter sales next week. 
DRAMATIC DISCOUNTS
While the heavy discounts are available in much of the country, not all dealers are offering such deals. More popular limited-production models such as Ford's F-150 Raptor are selling for full retail price.
Overall, discounts on light-duty pickup trucks in June have averaged $5,250, 11% higher than the year-to-date average of $4,726, according to market research firm J.D. Power.
The price-cutting is unusual because FCA's Ram brand and GM's Chevrolet and GMC brands launched new versions of their large pickups within the last year. Normally, automakers avoid major discounts on freshly redesigned vehicles. 
But these are not normal times. FCA Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said last year he wants to move the Ram pickup line into second place in U.S. sales, displacing Silverado and closing the gap with Ford's F-series, the segment leader for 42 years.
The new Ram has received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch (30.5 cm) display screen, and sales are up nearly 22% this year through May, selling 22,000 more vehicles than the Silverado. 
""Clearly, FCA is trying to grab market share while GM is still ramping up,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs.
FCA said in a statement on Thursday the automaker will ""stick with what works for us.""
BALANCED APPROACH 
GM is under pressure to deliver as much as $10 billion in free cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019 to hit its full-year target, amid stagnant U.S. demand and plummeting industry sales in China. 
GM will report second-quarter U.S. sales on July 2. Automotive News estimated Silverado sales fell 11.8% through May, while sales of the higher-priced GMC Sierra were up 4%.
""We will defend our franchise and we will do it the right way,"" said Barry Engle, head of GM's North American operations. ""We're not going to just roll over and allow our truck business to be taken away from us.""
Engle said Silverado sales numbers in part reflect an effort to build more higher-margin Sierras aimed at buyers willing to spend extra dollars on a luxury truck.
Ford, which has the oldest pickup truck in the market, had flat F-series sales through the end of May. 
""It's a bit unprecedented,"" said Ford's truck marketing manager, Todd Eckert, of the heavy discounting so early in the life cycle of his rivals' trucks. 
Ford will defend its position, but not at any cost, he said: ""It's about having a balanced approach.""
Because incentives erode profit margins, the automakers continue to juggle discounts against diminished margins.

""This is a segment that has been profitable for all of us,"" said GM's Engle. ""We’d like to keep it that way.""

Tomorrow, investors will be looking for and news, comments or, not entirely unlikely, insults coming from the beginning of the G20 meeting tomorrow in Japan.
Here's the top three things that could rock markets
1. Consumer Spending, Inflation to Ramp up Rate-Cut Expectations?
Consumer spending and inflation data due Friday will likely bring the Federal Reserve into focus amid growing expectations the central bank is set to deliver its first rate cut since December 2008 at its July meeting.
Personal income for May is forecast to have slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in the prior month while personal spending is expected to have increase by 0.4%.
The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have risen 0.2% in May, with the annual rate remaining at 1.6%.
Trade will also be in focus as the G20 powwow is underway, with the bulk of the spotlight likely to be on the meeting this weekend between U.S. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping, set for Saturday. President Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin are expected to meet Friday.
2. Rig Counts on Tap
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which remains near-record highs.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. rose by 1 to 789.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
But even with U.S. crude production flirting with record highs, supplies fell for a second-straight week last week, the EIA reported Wednesday, underpinning oil prices, which are up roughly 3% this week.
As well as falling domestic crude stockpiles, rising U.S.-Iran tensions have also kept crude prices climbing.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 0.1% higher at $59.43 a barrel.
3. Constellation Brands Earnings on Deck 
Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) will report its fiscal-first-quarter earnings before the market opens.
The earnings update comes as the alcoholic-beverage giant's efforts to revive its struggling wine and sprit brands have seemingly come up short, with management recently taking a decision to sell some of its brands.
Constellation Brands is expected to report earnings of $2.09 a share on revenue of $2.06 billion, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
The company’s guidance will also be closely watched as investors are keen to get a sense of the company's outlook amid slowing beer demand."

Gottlieb stepped down abruptly as the FDA chief in March this year, a role he had held since May 2017.
He was well-regarded by public health advocates and won bipartisan support for his efforts https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fda-gottlieb/u-s-fda-chief-tough-on-e-cigarettes-steps-down-abruptly-idUSKCN1QM2GZ to curb use of flavored e-cigarettes by youths. 
Unlike his predecessors, who said drug pricing was not the purview of the FDA, Gottlieb waded into the intensifying debate about the high cost of medicines for U.S. consumers and had the agency actively looking into possible solutions.
Gottlieb ran into fierce opposition from anti-regulation groups such as Americans for Tax Reform and former FDA officials, who said the agency's regulatory efforts would destroy thousands of jobs.
Pfizer has also appointed Gottlieb to the board's regulatory and compliance as well as the science and technology committees.

1410,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 05:17PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Rises Modestly as Investors Play G20 Waiting Game,"Investing.com - Thursday was a day of waiting, a day where investor reluctance to make big bets was first and foremost.
The reason, of course, was that President Trump and China President Xi Jinping are supposed to talk about a possible trade deal Saturday at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. And it was hard to gauge how the talks will come out.
As a result, the S&P 500 closed up a modest 0.4%. The Dow fell 0.0.4%, held back by news of more problems with getting Boeing's (NYSE:BA) troubled 737 Max jet back into the air. Boeing fell 2.9% and subtracted 74 points from the Dow by itself. Boeing is off 18.4% from its all-time high of $446.01, reached just before the second of two fatal 737 Max crashes.
The Nasdaq Composite was up a more robust 0.7%, largely because of gains for chip stocks and drugstore chain Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA).
Investors were unsettled by Larry Kudlow, Trump's chief economic advisor. Kudlow said the U.S. could impose more tariffs on China if there isn't any progress. A day earlier, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said a trade deal was 90% done. At the same time, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday no deal was possible until the United States lifts its ban on technology sales to telecommunications giant Huawei. The Kudlow comments cut a Dow rally of as many as 71 points to a loss 10 points.
Offsetting the global trade uncertainty, small-cap stocks had a strong day. The Russell 2000 index US SmallCap 2000 rose 1.9%. Many of its components aren't vulnerable to trade disputes.
The waiting (and the uncertainty) extended to gold and oil prices, which were little changed. The August contract for gold futures settled down $3.40 to $1,412 an ounce. WTI crude futures finished up a whopping 5 cents to $59.43.
Interest rates in the United States were mostly lower. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield fell to 2.005% from Wednesday's 2.049%, still at levels last seen in the fall of 2016.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares moved 2.1% lower after the package shipper warned that the trade disputes were affecting its business.
After the close,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) shares slipped after the Dow component's fiscal fourth-quarter profit missed estimates. Revenue for the athletic-apparel-and-equipment maker, however, was higher.
Futures trading suggests a similar kind of trading day on Friday.
As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 is up 6.3% for June and 3.2% for the second quarter. For the year, the index is up 16.7%. The Dow is up 6.9% for the month and 2.3% for the quarter while the year-to-date gain is 13.7%. The Nasdaq is up 6.9% for the month, 3.1% for the quarter and 20% for the year."
1411,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank passes Fed stress test in boost for its U.S. operations,"By Pete Schroeder and Matt Scuffham
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) on Thursday passed an annual health check by the Federal Reserve, clearing a second hurdle at a critical time for the German lender in tests administered by the U.S. central bank that measure banks' ability to weather a major economic downturn.
However, the Federal Reserve placed conditions on Credit Suisse's (N:CS) U.S. operations after finding weaknesses in its capital planning processes.
The results provide a boost to the Wall Street operations of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, which have been plagued by litigation, underperformance and regulatory investigations.
The tests assess whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans, including using extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes beyond being a cushion against losses. They are designed to avoid the taxpayer bailouts prevalent in the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The Fed's stamp of approval gives Deutsche a major boost as it works on a restructuring plan. Deutsche flunked the test in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Another failure would have further damaged confidence among clients and investors at a time when Chief Executive Christian Sewing is battling to turn around the bank, whose shares hit a record low this month.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, ordered  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to address weaknesses in its capital adequacy process by October, and restricted its capital distributions to last year's levels until those weaknesses are addressed. The Fed said it had identified ""weaknesses in the assumptions used by the firm to project stressed trading losses that raise concerns about the firm's capital adequacy and capital planning process."" It gave no further detail.
The Fed approved the capital plans of the 16 other banks that underwent this year's test, which includes the nation's largest lenders like JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM), Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  (N:C).
The Fed said in a statement that the nation's largest banks all have strong capital levels and ""virtually all"" are meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.
The test results also show that JPMorgan and Capital One both had to pare back their capital plans, after initial plans submitted to the Fed showed that each would see capital levels drop below regulatory minimums under a severe economic downturn, according to a senior Fed official. 
Deutsche Bank’s passing grade reflected the significant progress the bank had made in addressing its weaknesses around capital planning, although some issues remain, according to a senior Fed official. 
Deutsche's Sewing told investors at the annual shareholders' meeting last month that the bank planned to make ""tough cutbacks"" at its investment bank to appease investors unhappy with its underperformance. Those plans are likely to see the bank's U.S. equities business shrunk to a skeleton operation, Reuters reported this month.
The stress test outcome means that Deutsche is now free to make payments to its German parent without approval from the Fed, a restriction which was imposed following the stress test failure last year.
Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, while Credit Suisse made big cuts. However, Deutsche's efforts to compete with U.S. rivals have been hampered by litigation and regulatory investigations.
Deutsche is currently facing U.S. government probes into possible money laundering lapses. The bank has said it is cooperating with investigators.
All the 18 banks easily cleared the first portion of the Fed's annual stress test last week, showing they would easily have enough capital to keep lending during a severe economic downturn.
The second test was more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans.
Deutsche was the only bank to fail the test last year after the Fed identified ""widespread and critical deficiencies"" in the bank's capital planning controls. Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  State Street  Corp (N:STT), which received conditional passes last year, passed without conditions this year.
This year's tests are more streamlined following a Fed review of the process. Roughly half as many banks were tested in 2019 compared to 2018, as the Fed moved to a two-year testing cycle for smaller firms.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed higher in a broad-based rally on Thursday as investors looked to the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan this weekend for progress in the long-running U.S.-China trade dispute, which has whipsawed markets for months.
The benchmark S&P 500 snapped its four-day losing streak, closing within 1% of its all-time high, reached a week ago.
The Dow closed slightly lower, dragged down by  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
Optimism fueled by a China Morning Post report that the world's two largest economies have agreed to a tentative trade war truce was dampened by a Wall Street Journal article saying that Chinese President Xi Jinping will present President Donald Trump with a set of conditions to be met by the United States before reaching any settlement.
Expectations of a deal were muddied further when White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the United States may move ahead with further tariffs on Chinese goods after the two leaders meet this weekend at the Group of 20 summit in Japan. Trump and Xi are expected to discuss a way forward regarding tariffs and other issues when they meet.
""Today's trading is a G20 pregame,"" said Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon's Lockwood Advisors in New York. ""Given the tone of today's markets, people believe there will be some diminishment of trade tensions coming out of the meeting."" 
""No pair of geopolitical rivals in history have had more connection to each other's economies,"" Forester added. ""There's a lot of pressure to get this right.""

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, is weighing the creation of a new engineering design center in Montreal, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a move fueled by the company's planned acquisition of Bombardier's CRJ regional jet business.
The engineering design center will start with ""a couple hundred"" workers to support the development of its smaller Spacejet model, the 65- to 76-seat M100 jet, in collaboration with sites in Japan and Seattle, the source added. 
""Mitsubishi is considering putting a new development site, an engineering facility into Montreal,"" said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.
""It would make sense, if the CRJ transaction closes, Mitsubishi would have a bigger (presence) in the area.""
Mitsubishi is expected to take a decision, which is not yet firm, in the next few months, the source added.
Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman Dan Lochmann said by telephone from Japan that the company has ""not made any decisions yet,"" on Montreal, ""but the area is certainly one with excellent talent that we would like to make the best use of.""
This week, Mitsubishi Heavy agreed to buy Bombardier's money-losing CRJ regional jet business for $550 million in cash, in a boost to Japan's plane-making ambitions, while marking the Canadian plane and train maker's exit from commercial aviation.
The CRJ acquisition would end production of Bombardier's aging regional jets in late 2020, but give Mitsubishi access to the Canadian company's aftermarket sales, engineering expertise and U.S.-based heavy maintenance centers. Mitsubishi would be better-placed to attract Bombardier's engineers through the Montreal center.
Mitsubishi is trying to certify its 88-seat regional jet, the Spacejet M90, for delivery in 2020 after seven years of delays. 
Mitsubishi faces the technical challenge of developing the M100 with a larger, more fuel-efficient engine, while meeting the size and weight rules that would make it attractive in the United States, the world's largest regional jet market.
Pilot agreements at the largest U.S. carriers restrict planes heavier than 86,000 pounds (39 tonnes) and with more than 76 seats from being outsourced to regional affiliates which are less costly to operate. Some of the agreements set the seating limit even lower at 65 seats.

Although bigger than the M70 jet it replaces, Mitsubishi has said the M100 will save weight by using new materials.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 02:48PM ET</span>","Ford to cut 12,000 jobs in Europe by end 2020","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Ford (N:F) said it will cut 12,000 jobs in Europe by the end of next year to try to return the business to profit, part of a wave of cost reductions in an auto industry facing stagnant demand and huge investments to build low emission cars.
The challenge of investing in electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles while having to overhaul combustion engines to meet new clean-air rules, has forced Europe's carmakers to slash fixed costs and streamline their model portfolios.
Ford Europe has been losing money for years and pressure to restructure its operations increased after arch-rival General Motors (M:G) raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP).
Ford said it would close three plants in Russia, a plant in France and Wales, and cut shifts at factories in Valencia, Spain and Saarlouis, Germany. 
Following the sale of the Kechnec Transmission plant in Slovakia, to Magna, Ford's manufacturing footprint will be reduced to 18 facilities by end-2020, from 24 today.
""We have largely concluded consultations with social partners regarding restructuring actions,"" Stuart Rowley, president, Ford of Europe told Reuters.
About 12,000 jobs will be affected at Ford's wholly owned facilities and consolidated joint ventures in Europe by the end of 2020, primarily through voluntary separation programs. 
Around 2,000 of those are fixed salaried positions, which are included among the 7,000 salaried positions Ford is reducing globally, the carmaker said. The rest are workers on hourly contracts or agency workers.
FALLING DEMAND
Ford has 51,000 employees in Europe or 65,000 when joint ventures are included.
In January Ford announced a sweeping business review which included the prospect of plant closures and discontinuing loss-making vehicle lines to pursue a 6% operating margin in Europe.
But demand for cars in Europe is falling, European automobile manufacturers' association ACEA said on Thursday, predicting that European passenger car registrations will shrink by 1% in 2019 to 15 million cars, revising its previous forecast of 1% growth.
Car sales will stagnate or decline in the next three years, AlixPartners said in a survey of the industry published this week. Manufacturers balancing sales of electric and combustion engined cars will see margins hit particularly hard, the survey said. 
Ford said it intended to double the profitability of its commercial vehicle business in Europe in the next five years, supported by a restructured Ford Sollers joint venture in Russia and a strategic alliance with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
Earlier this year Ford said it would seek to exit the multivan segment and focus on developing electrified versions of more profitable ""crossover"" and sports utility vehicles. 
European passenger vehicle development, including for battery electric vehicles, will be centered in Cologne, the carmaker said.

Ford also said it expected to triple passenger car imports into Europe by 2024 by selling Mustang and Explorer vehicles, including a Mustang-inspired electric car in late 2020.

(Reuters) -  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) agreed to pay $94.3 million to settle federal and state regulatory charges it routinely overcharged mutual fund customers and other clients over roughly 17 years by adding hidden markups on back-office expenses.
Thursday's settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey resolve allegations that State Street overbilled clients by more than $170 million related to its custody of their assets.
The SEC said roughly 5,000 clients incurred more than $110 million of the overcharges when State Street tacked on markups for sending messages through SWIFT, a secured international payments network used by banks and other financial companies.
""Fund expenses make a big difference to mutual fund investors and advisers,"" Paul Levenson, director of the SEC office in Boston, said in a statement. ""They have a right to receive honest information about what they're paying for.""
State Street will pay a $40 million civil fine plus $48.8 million of disgorgement and interest in the SEC settlement, and a $5.5 million civil fine to Massachusetts.
It did not admit or deny wrongdoing, and was credited by the SEC for disclosing its conduct and cooperating. State Street previously set aside money to cover both settlements.
""We regret these invoicing errors and the impact on our clients,"" State Street said in a statement.
State Street is one of the world's largest custodial banks, which provide services such as accounting, asset valuations, currency trading, portfolio servicing and stock lending.
The Boston-based company had $32.6 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of March 31, as well as $2.81 trillion of assets under management.
State Street said it began reviewing customer invoices in 2015, and has since reimbursed most customers affected by the overcharges, while also improving its billing processes.
It has said it was cooperating with probes by the U.S. Department of Justice's civil and criminal divisions into its invoicing, which Thursday's settlements do not cover.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In July 2016, State Street agreed to pay $530 million to settle regulatory probes and private lawsuits claiming it overcharged clients on foreign currency transactions.

The Fed is widely expected by investors to cut interest rates in July, with some looking for a 50 basis-point move.
“It is too early, from my perspective, to know whether we should use the tool at all and what magnitude of the tool we should apply,” Daly said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Michael McKee.
U.S. central bankers left the benchmark lending rate unchanged at their June 18-19 meeting, while pivoting toward a rate cut. The central bank said in its statement that “uncertainties’’ about the outlook have increased and that it will “closely monitor’’ incoming information.
Daly is a non-voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year. Fed policy makers are next scheduled to meet July 30-31.
Fed chairman Jerome Powell in his press conference June 19 explained that the committee was becoming less optimistic that inflation would move back to the 2% target soon. Fed officials revised their forecast lower to just 1.5% this year, and 1.9% for 2020.
“We are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations,” Powell said in his press conference.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voting member who dissented in favor of a quarter-point cut this month, also cited too low inflation as a reason why he favors a reduction of borrowing costs now."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - America's trade war with China is once again poised to switch off the nation's last television factory.
The United States had 150 television manufacturers in the 1950s, with factories and suppliers employing hundreds of thousands of workers across the country. 
Those sets had hundreds of parts and were often sold in wooden cases the size of kitchen stoves. A modern flat screen, by contrast, has 70% of its value packed into the glass panel, and production is now almost entirely in Asia.
Today, there is only one U.S. assembly plant and it is more symbolic than substantive.
Element Electronics opened the plant in an old shirt factory in Winnsboro, South Carolina, in 2014, chiefly to supply televisions to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) for the retailer's highly publicized buy-American campaign. It employs 250 workers.
The televisions at the plant are assembled entirely with Chinese components. Element applies the finishing touches in South Carolina, such as the insertion of printed circuit boards. It also tests the sets. Even most of the boxes and other packaging come from China. The labels state: ""Assembled in the USA,"" not ""Made in the USA,"" although the difference is lost on most consumers.
The mostly Chinese origin of these televisions has become a matter of survival for Element for the second consecutive year.
Last summer, President Donald Trump's administration announced it would impose tariffs on Chinese television components among the many goods affected by a deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington. 
The extra cost of the tariffs would mean the plant would not be able to compete on price with televisions imported from Mexico and Asia. Element appealed for relief, arguing that the items should be removed from the tariff list. 
The company announced it would have to shut down because of the added cost of tariffs, and notified its workers they were being laid off.
The plant stopped production, but the company won a last-minute reprieve when the U.S. government dropped television parts from its list. In the end, no workers were laid off.
Now the tariff threat is back. Trump's administration is preparing to impose 25% tariffs on the last $300 billion worth of Chinese goods not already covered by trade-war duties. Televisions and components are on the list.
FUTURE IN DOUBT 
Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this week at the G20 summit in Japan could determine whether those tariffs are imposed. In the meantime, the plant's future is again in doubt.
""We'll appeal - our lawyers will work on that,"" said Michael O'Shaughnessy, the company’s chief executive. 
China is only part of Element's trade problem. The company has also struggled to compete with television importers from Mexico because of tariff rules.
Mexican television plants also assemble components mostly from Asia. Those TVs are then exported across the U.S. border duty-free because they are included in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Element, however, previously had to pay a 4.5% tariff on their main components from China - a duty that existed long before Trump started his trade wars. Last year, Congress passed a bill that exempted a number of goods, including TV components, from those tariffs.
About 40% of televisions imported to the United States in recent years come from Mexico, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. 
Paul Gagnon, an expert on the industry's supply chain at research firm IHS Markit, said the business has tiny margins, so manufacturers are constantly hunting for the lowest cost locations to do final assembly.
Element almost got a boost from another set of Trump trade tariffs. The U.S. president's threat to put tariffs on Mexican goods, in an attempt to force Mexico to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants, might have given Element a big price advantage over the Mexican plants. But Trump dropped the threat after Mexico promised measures to tighten its borders.
O'Shaughnessy said he supports the administration's efforts to level the playing field with China and other trading partners and feels businesses that create jobs in the United States should not face a disadvantage just because they rely on imported parts.
In the meantime, this is the busiest time of year for all television manufacturers, as they gear up for the holiday sales surge at the end of the year.
""We're doing the things we can today to bring in a little more parts than we normally would,"" said O'Shaughnessy, ""So we have a buffer against the unknown."" 

The company is also continuing to hire. It aims to have 300 employees by the end of the summer, O'Shaughnessy said, as business remains strong and is growing.

1424,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 01:44PM ET</span>","StockBeat - KB Home Surges on Earnings Beat, Boosts Homebuilders","ETInvesting.com – KB Home soared Thursday, triggering a wave of buying across homebuilders after the company topped quarterly results on the top and bottom lines.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $0.51 a share on revenue of $1.02 billion, beating estimates compiled by Investing.com for earnings of $0.39 and $943 million, respectively, sending its share price more than 6.5%.
The upbeat results were driven by a strong spring selling season, with net orders rising 15% year on year to 4,064.
""We are pleased with our second-quarter performance, as we made significant progress on our Returns-Focused Growth Plan. Two of the key objectives of this plan are to grow our business and strengthen our balance sheet,” CEO Jeffrey Mezger said. ""This quarter's results demonstrate further achievement in both areas, with average community count growth of 17% year over year - our most substantial increase in four years - and a 930-basis-point reduction in our debt to capital ratio, to 45.8% over the same period.""
KB Home forecast third-quarter housing revenue of $1.1 billion to $1.18 billion, which Wedbush said was below analysts' mean estimate at the time of $1.22 billion.
But that did little to dent optimism as the Wedbush lifted its price target on the homebuilder to $25 from $22, insisting “the good news of KBH's community count growth in F2Q19 outweighs the bad news of FY19 revenue guidance below our old estimate.”
The better-than-expected quarter from KB Home lifted optimism in the sector, with DR Horton (NYSE:DHI),  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) and PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) on track to end the day higher.  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) was also up 1%. The company fell 1.4% on Wednesday after warning growth will slow later this year.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>","StanChart, HSBC sharpen EU focus to help clients cut path through Brexit, red tape","By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Just as Britain moves to sever its ties with the European Union, two of its biggest banks, HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), are building up their operations in the bloc in a bid to win more business helping clients grappling with red tape and Brexit.
HSBC (L:HSBA) this month launched an internal 'Europe Means Business' campaign aimed at building internal awareness of its capabilities in the region and prompting staff to pitch the Asia-focused bank's abilities to clients in other markets.
Meanwhile StanChart has in the last year and a half increased its staff in Frankfurt from 90 to 200, its head of corporate and institutional banking Simon Cooper said.
""Brexit was the catalyst for us to set up a local subsidiary in Europe ... but strategically it makes sense anyway,"" said Cooper, adding that StanChart plans to hire 'tens' more in the German financial hub, as well as in Paris.
The loss of some EU market access for British financial firms resulting from Brexit means many large companies that have traditionally run all their European finances from London, now need a bank that can help them operate between multiple hubs.
For HSBC and StanChart, which make more than two thirds of their revenues in Asia and have seen Europe as less important, that means refocusing on the world's largest trading bloc.
Europe and the Americas contributed just 11 percent of StanChart revenues in 2018, while for HSBC, Europe including its very large British business, contributed 30 percent.
Both banks hope to lean on existing relationships in their strongholds in Asia, as well as a growing client base in other parts of the world to feed their European operations. 
Their bids for more European business are aimed not so much at investment banking such as advice on mergers, but the more day-to-day activities of trade finance and cash management known as 'transaction banking'.
This is a lucrative business, with overall revenues for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region climbing to $10 billion in 2018, from $9.5 billion the previous year, data from industry analytics firm Coalition shows.
HSBC vies for a top 3 spot in competing for that pot with U.S. rivals  Citigroup  (N:C) and JP Morgan (N:JPM), while StanChart ranks between seventh and tenth, Coalition data reveals.
OPPORTUNITY BECKONS
Firms working in Europe are seeking guidance on dealing with evolving EU regulations such as a new payment services directive which is set to transform banking by allowing customers to manage their finances through third party providers.
On the flipside, StanChart is also targeting smaller corporates in EU countries that have significant business in its core markets of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Cooper said.
""A quick analysis showed there are something like 1,000 companies in Germany that operate in three or more of our markets, we're very under-penetrated among this European client base and so there's a real opportunity there,"" he said.
For HSBC, the renewed focus on Europe is less about hiring new staff in its 12 continental EU markets than galvanizing them to work more closely together, James Emmett, the bank's Chief Executive for the region, said. 
""Our priority is to build the leading international bank in Europe, and we have a unique opportunity to do that because the franchise is already in place,"" he said.
Emmett said that companies from countries including China and the U.S. are increasingly seeking to work with a single bank in continental Europe to manage their cash flow, financing and other needs, especially as Brexit looms. 

""Chinese companies, for example, aren't saying they'll pull out of the UK into Europe, but they want us to help them manage between the two,"" Emmett said.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 12:41PM ET</span>",U.S. states unsure how to halt online sales of abortion pills amid clinic crackdown,"By Gabriella Borter
NEW YORK (Reuters) - American women faced with new restrictions on abortions passed by a dozen U.S. states this year are turning to abortion pills from foreign online suppliers, and the states say there is little they can do to stop it.
In the year before many of these new restrictions passed Republican-controlled state legislatures, over 20,000 U.S. women sought the pills online from providers willing to defy U.S. federal rules over sale of the drugs that induce miscarriage.
One of them was Kayla, a 24-year-old Mississippi mother of two who terminated a pregnancy in January. She and her husband decided they could neither afford to raise another child nor get an abortion at the nearest clinic in Memphis, Tennessee.
""I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't have access to that,"" said Kayla, who asked to be identified only by her first name. ""I would probably right now be six months pregnant and miserable. It was my lifesaver.""
Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in U.S. society. Opponents cite religious beliefs about the sanctity of life, while abortion-rights activists say bans rob women of control over their bodies and futures. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has imposed strict rules on distribution and use of abortion pills, but state pharmaceutical regulators said they have no effective way of tracking and policing online orders from foreign doctors and pharmacies.
""We would only know that if someone were to report it to us,"" said Larry Hadley, pharmacy board director in Kentucky, one of six states that passed a law this year banning abortion after six weeks, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.
Pharmacy board officials in Alabama, Ohio, Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and North Dakota also said they were not aware of shipments of the drugs from unlicensed, foreign providers or how they would take action against them.
From March 2018 through March 2019, some 21,000 U.S. women sought the abortion-inducing pills misoprostol and mifepristone from the Austria-based website AidAccess.org, according to a University of Texas at Austin study.
""It's reasonable to expect that as states make it even more difficult for people to access clinic-based abortion care, more people will seek alternatives including self-managed abortion,"" said Jill Adams, executive director of reproductive rights legal group If/When/How.
In another measure of growing interest PlanCPills.org, a website that rates the safety of online pill providers, said the number of visitors has surged to as high as 8,000 people a day, up from a baseline of about 1,000 over the past few months. 
FDA WARNINGS
The FDA has sent warning letters to foreign online providers, threatening seizure and injunctions unless they stop selling the abortion pills to American women.
""We remain very concerned ... because this bypasses important safeguards designed to protect women's health,"" an FDA spokesman said in an email.
But some medical experts describe FDA regulations of these drugs as excessive. They cite studies published in medical journals showing that they pose a relatively low health risk and cause far fewer deaths among U.S. women than natural childbirth.
There is currently only one FDA-approved product, which the agency requires be dispensed in a medical office, clinic or hospital. 
The pills, typically taken in the first trimester of pregnancy, thin the uterine lining to prevent the embryo from staying implanted and cause the uterus to contract, inducing a miscarriage. They should not be confused with the ""morning after"" pill that prevents pregnancy.
Risks from the abortion pills include possible heavy bleeding and, in rare cases, the abortion may fail, requiring follow up with surgical abortion, according to the Mayo Clinic, a prominent U.S. hospital system.
Of the 3.7 million women who took the FDA-approved brand of mifepristone to terminate a pregnancy between September 2000 and December 2018, 24 died from complications, according to FDA records. 
AidAccess founder Rebecca Gomperts, a medical doctor based in Austria, received a letter from the FDA in March warning her to stop prescribing abortion pills. She has ignored it.
""I am responding to an urgent medical need of my patients,"" Gomperts said in a phone interview. ""I have a medical duty to do so and I do it.""
The abortion pills are typically priced at a fraction of the hundreds of dollars for a clinic abortion. Gomperts occasionally waives the cost entirely for women who cannot afford it. 
Gomperts said she writes prescriptions for the pills for women who are less than nine weeks pregnant that are then filled by an Indian pharmacy. About three out of four women who contact her opt against the pills for a variety of reasons, she said.
Officials in Arkansas, Indiana, Tennessee, Utah and Mississippi declined to comment or did not respond to calls.
In Texas, where the number of abortion clinics has shrunk by nearly half since 2013, Kerstin Arnold, general counsel for the Texas State Board of Pharmacy, said the state had no way of regulating pharmacies outside the United States.

""I don't even know where we would go trying to enforce that,"" she said.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>","Bayer lifted by new plan to tackle glyphosate lawsuits, Elliott approval","By Tassilo Hummel and Ludwig Burger
BERLIN (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) shares jumped on Thursday after it revealed plans aimed at resolving multi-billion dollar lawsuits linked to glyphosate, a move welcomed by activist shareholder Elliott, which has taken a sizeable stake in the chemicals company. 
Shares in the German group, which have lost more than a fifth of their value since March, rose 8.7% to 60.86 euros, for their biggest daily gain in a decade. The company's market capitalization rose by 4.8 billion euro on the day.
Bayer said on Wednesday it had hired an external lawyer to advise its supervisory board and has set up a committee to help to resolve the glyphosate litigation issue.
Marks Manns, a fund manager at Union Investment, one of Bayer's largest German shareholders, said the share price was likely bolstered by anticipation of an earlier settlement.
""Investors want more certainty as quickly as possible. But it is for management to weigh up a quick settlement against how many billions you could save by holding out. I don't want a settlement at all costs,"" he said, adding that Bayer's negotiation position was for now highly unfavorable.
The company's shares have been under pressure following its $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which brought with it massive legal issues after more than 13,400 plaintiffs alleged the company's glyphosate weedkiller caused cancer - a claim Bayer contests.
Deka Investment, another major German shareholder said taking more legal expertise on board was ""the right step"", and was mainly a token of acknowledgement by the supervisory board of shareholder criticism. 
Elliott Associates on Wednesday welcomed Bayer's steps, as it revealed for the first time its holding in Bayer shares worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.25 billion).
In a statement, Elliott also said Bayer's recent moves helped to resolve uncertainty linked to the glyphosate issue and lead to settlements with limited financial costs. 
""Elliott believes that Bayer's discounted share price today does not reflect the significant underlying value of its constituent businesses, or the potential value realization opportunity that is in excess of 30 billion euros,"" it said.
Major shareholders have criticized Bayer for its handling of the glyphosate issue which resulted in a vote of disapproval of its top management at April's annual general meeting.
Janus Henderson, one of the company's top shareholders, welcomed the measures taken by Bayer as ""sensible"" and said they may lead to an earlier-than-expected settlement.
""It is unlikely to be a smooth ride from here"" though as the company remains embroiled in lengthy litigation, said Dean Cheeseman, portfolio manager of its UK-based Multi-Asset Team.
Janus Henderson expects Bayer will lose its next glyphosate trial, which is scheduled for August in Missouri, the first one outside of California.

But the appeal processes starting later in the year ""represents their best chance to change momentum in sentiment,"" he said.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 12:08PM ET</span>",Airlines urge regulators to work together to return 737 MAX to service,"By Alistair Smout and Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airlines on Thursday urged global regulators to coordinate on measures needed to bring the grounded 737 MAX jetliner back into service, as Boeing (N:BA) grappled with a new technical glitch and investors sold shares of suppliers over fears of more disruption.
Airlines are now warning of the prospect of flights being disrupted beyond the end of the busy summer period when the grounding of over 300 MAX jets and a delivery halt affecting at least 100 more has caused cancellations and high leasing bills.
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March in the wake of two accidents in five months, which prompted Boeing to redesign part of an automated software system suspected of playing a role in the crashes that also involved faulty sensor data.
The International Air Transport Association, a body representing some 290 airlines and over 80% of global traffic, said technical requirements and timelines for the safe re-entry to service of the 737 MAX should be aligned.
The statement came a day after an IATA summit to discuss the grounding of Boeing's top-selling passenger jet - the second such meeting held in recent weeks.
It also followed news on Wednesday, first reported by Reuters, that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had identified a new risk that Boeing must address on the 737 MAX before it can start flying again. 
The FAA did not elaborate on the latest setback, but sources familiar with the matter told Reuters it was discovered during a simulator test last week. It was not yet clear if the issue could be addressed with a software upgrade or would require a more complex hardware fix.
Boeing shares fell 4% to $359.78 in pre-market trade, while shares of some suppliers, such as Britain's Senior Plc (L:SNR), also dropped sharply. 
Downgrading its rating on Senior to ""equal weight"",  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it expected a widespread ""supplier reset"" following the grounding of the 737 MAX, with the impact on 2020 results not yet factored into analysts' consensus forecasts. 
""Aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators,"" IATA said. 
""Aviation cannot function efficiently without this coordinated effort, and restoring public confidence demands it,"" IATA added, calling also for global alignment on additional training requirements for 737 MAX flight crew.
Travel firm TUI (DE:TUIGn) said on Thursday it did not expect an additional financial impact after the FAA's latest warning on the 737 MAX. TUI has already taken a 300 million euro ($341 million) hit to remove the jet from its summer schedules.
China was first to ground the MAX after a March 10 crash in Ethiopia within five months of a similar crash off Indonesia, killing a combined 346 people.
Once regulators approve the MAX for flight, airlines must remove the jets from storage and implement new pilot training, a process that will differ for each airline but that U.S. carriers have said will take at least one month.

Some airlines and regulators have argued that pilots should be trained in a MAX simulator before flying, though Boeing's minimum training requirements do not call for flight simulators, according to draft proposals.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>",Uncertainty hangs over ADP sale as Macron faces delicate decisions,"By Richard Lough and Inti Landauro
PARIS (Reuters) - Bankers are telling potential buyers of the French state's majority holding in airports operator ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) that there is little clarity on the timing or size of the sale, underscoring how risky the transaction has become for President Emmanuel Macron.
The proposed sale of all or part of the state's controlling 50.6% share in ADP, which operates Paris Charles de Gaulle to the north of the capital and Orly to the south, is the most eye-catching of the slate of privatizations planned by Macron in a country that cherishes the protection of public services.
The sell-offs — utility Engie and lottery monopoly FDJ are also potentially on the block — are integral to Macron's drive to curb government involvement where he believes the private sector would better deliver investment and change.
But the ADP sale has united opponents. They accuse President Emmanuel Macron of ""flogging the family silver"" and warn of the perils of economic liberalism, citing Margaret Thatcher's unpopular reforms in 1980s Britain.
This month opponents launched a petition that could lead to a referendum on the ADP privatization next year -- a risky proposition for a president shaken by a public rebellion over his pro-business policies and perceived as indifferent to the working class. The ballot would be held as re-election looms.
Three bankers advising clients over ADP said there was no clear idea how much would be sold or when. Macron's government has put the plans on ice for at least the nine-month period opponents have to try to garner 4.7 million backers — 10% of the electorate -- to secure their referendum.
""This sale is on hold for a while,"" said George Holst of  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), which is advising ADP. The project ""will depend on the government's will to impose its political line in a clear way.""
A second Paris-based banker advising a potential buyer said they were not aware of any current contact between government and interested parties.
""We have told our client the process is delayed, perhaps even canceled. We're all on standby,"" they said.
Macron had counted on the ADP sale to service France's debt and build up a fund to finance innovation. The state's shareholding is worth almost 8 billion euros at current market prices. Selling the entire stake would command a premium, while selling a smaller block might be more politically palatable.
The weekly newspaper Canard Enchaîné reported Macron had decided to scrap the sale but that no announcement would come until the referendum bid had run its course.
""The public does not understand the privatization,"" Macron is quoted as telling a visitor to his office. ""We must take our time. We mustn't act as if the referendum did not exist."" 
In Japan for a G20 gathering, Macron sidestepped a question on the report: ""I am not going to say today what I intend to do."" 
""NEW-AGE THATCHERISM""
At the heart of the matter is a decades-old debate in France over what role the state should have in the economy. 
Boris Vallaud, a Socialist Party spokesman, described the privatization plan as a ""grotesque economic mistake"". 
""ADP is not a business like others: it is a tool of national sovereignty, it is the hub of Air France, it is a strategic asset,"" he told Reuters days after launching the petition near Charles de Gaulle airport. 
With Vallaud that evening was an unusual grouping of legislators, including communists and moderate socialists who accuse Macron of placing corporate profit ahead of national interest, and conservatives loyal to the Gaullist tradition of a strong government overseeing strategic assets.
""This plan, like others from Macron, feels like new-age Thatcherism,"" Vallaud said.
Opponents of ADP's privatization draw parallels with the sale of the motorway network in the mid-2000s, an unpopular move that still leaves many complaining of unfair toll hikes.
""With the highways, we saw that when you privatize it is no longer the common good that prevails, it is the pursuit of profit,"" said 60-year-old petition signatory Martine Louaire. 
Conglomerate Vinci was the big winner of the autoroute privatization and wants to build upon its 8% stake in ADP.
Supporters of the privatization dismiss opponent's claims that France would be handing customs and border control over to private interests, and argue the private sector is better placed to transform Charles de Gaulle into a world-leading hub. 
On sale would effectively be the airports' shopping centers, hotels, car-parks and aircraft landing tariffs, said Roland Lescure, a lawmaker from Macron's party and rapporteur on the legislation that permits the government to sell its holding. 
Lescure said the government would have the final say over landing tariffs if a dispute with the concession-holder erupted. The plan, he said, had become mired in mistruths and wrongly politicized.
""It became a political fireball that everybody wanted to play with, especially in the context of the ‘Yellow Vest’ protests.""
MARKET CONDITIONS
ADP would be a big prize for Vinci. 105 million passengers use Paris' two main airports annually. ADP booked 4.5 billion euros of revenue in 2018.
But as opposition has mounted to the company's privatization, Vinci chief executive Xavier Huillard has downplayed the importance of ADP to the company's strategy.
Vinci had opportunities to grow its airport concession business with or without ADP, Huillard said in February, just as he finalized a 2.9 billion pound ($3.68 billion) swoop for control of Britain's London Gatwick.
ADP chief executive Augustin de Romanet rejected the suggestion Macron's government is having second thoughts.
""The impression I have is that this (referendum bid) is not creating any trouble inside the finance ministry or the prime minister's office,"" Romanet told reporters this week. 
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said he still believes in the privatization. 
Although the delay pushes delicate political decisions closer to an expected Macron re-election bid in 2022, Lescure said the president would not stop reforming France. 
More of a concern, he said, will be the market. 

""I hope the delay is not going to change market conditions.""

(Reuters) - Shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) fell 3% on Thursday after the U.S. aviation regulator found a new flaw in the 737 MAX jet, potentially delaying the aircraft's return to service and piling more pressure on the planemaker's suppliers.
Boeing was forced to ground its jet worldwide earlier this year following two fatal crashes, sending shockwaves through the global aviation sector.
The single-aisle 737, the world's most-sold commercial aircraft, is central to Boeing's future with more than 5,000 orders and a backlog valued at nearly $500 billion at list prices. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Christopher Keyworth said any further delay in the return of the jet to service could have financial implications for aircraft parts suppliers as well as airlines, which have already warned of a hit to their 2019 profits due to the groundings.
""We now anticipate a widespread 'supplier reset', with FY20E impact not yet factored into consensus,"" Barclays analyst Christopher Keyworth wrote in a note, downgrading UK-based aero supplier Senior Plc (L:SNR) to ""equal weight"".
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not elaborate on the latest setback, but sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the flaw was discovered during a simulator test last week. 
It was not yet clear if the issue could be addressed with a software upgrade or would require a more complex hardware fix.
""While we expect BA to eventually reinstate the MAX and return to targeted, normalized cash flows, we think the timeframe is unknowable,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Spingarn said.
""For now, we think investors should expect continued volatility as BA and the regulators work behind closed doors to ferret out any additional issues.""
Up to Wednesday's close, Boeing shares have lost about 11% of their value since the deadly crash of the Ethiopian Airline 737 MAX jet on March 10. This compares with a 6% increase in the S&P 500 index (SPX) during the same period.

Yet Boeing's stock trades at 20.1 times forward earnings, a slight premium to its European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which trades at 18.6 times.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) on Thursday released the findings from its consultations with outside experts into its content review process, providing a glimpse into how its plans for a proposed ""external oversight board"" might take shape.
Facebook has been soliciting feedback over the past six months from more than 650 people at workshops in 88 countries on its draft plan for the board, which it says will function as an independent court of appeals on content decisions.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has said decisions about acceptable speech on Facebook's suite of social networks - used by some 2.4 billion people worldwide - should not rest in the company's hands alone.
The company will finalize the board's charter in August, it said.
According to the report, attendees at the workshops broadly agreed that Facebook employees should not sit on the board. The company also should not be able to remove members without cause, and should clarify how it would define ""cause,"" they said.
Other popular proposals were that the board should be able to choose its own cases; that board decisions should establish precedent for future cases; and that the board should have the power to influence Facebook's content policies.
Attendees expressed concerns over the board's independence, both from state actors and the company itself.
Facebook has long faced criticism for doing too little to block hate speech, incitements to violence, bullying and other types of content that violate its ""community standards.""
It has stepped up enforcement of those standards over the past year, employing more than 30,000 people to monitor content and focus on improving ""safety and security"" on the platforms, many of them low-paid contractors.

But the company continues to struggle with high-profile controversies over content posted on its site, such as the live streaming of a shooting that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump had said a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping was possible this weekend, though he was prepared to impose tariffs on virtually all remaining Chinese imports if the talks fail.
The Wall Street Journal then cited Chinese officials as saying that Beijing was insisting on the removal of a ban on the sale of U.S. technology to Huawei as part of any rapprochement.
""But the truce cake seems to have been baked,"" the Morning Post quoted one of its sources as saying.
Hopes that the world's two biggest economies would finally reach an agreement remained just strong enough to raise MSCI's broadest index of world shares almost 0.2% (MIWD00000PUS) after four days of losses. 
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) had led an early advance by Europe with a 0.7% jump, then pulled back almost to flat again as data showed euro zone economic sentiment has fallen to its lowest point in nearly three years. (EU)
Wall Street futures were still higher despite more woes for planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) (N). Asia finished strongly, with China's blue-chip index (CSI300) closing up 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) and Japan's Nikkei (N225) ending 1.4% and 1.2% higher. [.T][.SS]
""The market is focusing on the hope that there will be a trade truce,"" said ING's chief EMEA FX and rates strategist, Petr Krpata. ""We still think, though, that it would be temporary and that things will get worse again over the summer before they get better.""
The trade row has already rattled investors, who have ditched shares for the safety of bonds and gold this year. It has also prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to shift 180 degrees from raising interest rates in December to now signaling a cut as soon as next month.
Many traders still expect the market to remain in a narrow range until after the G20 meeting, where Trump is also holding bilateral talks with other nations.
""Overall it seems more likely that tariffs are hiked than not, following the meeting, though the timing of this may be confused by a desire for positive optics,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note.
LESS THAN 50
China's central bank on Thursday promised again more support for the economy if it's needed.
Trump, meanwhile, had weighed back into U.S. monetary policy, accusing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday of doing a ""bad job"" and ""out to prove how tough he is"" by not cutting interest rates.
Markets are convinced the Fed will indeed ease at its next meeting in July, but had to scale back bets on a half-point cut following cautious comments from various policy makers.
Futures  are 100% priced for a cut of 25 basis points next month, and imply a 22% chance of 50 basis points.
The probability of a less aggressive Fed and expectations of a Sino-China trade truce helped nudge up bond yields and ease the selling pressure on the U.S. dollar, which hovered at 96.300 (DXY) against a basket of currencies, up from a three-month low of 95.843. [/FRX]
The dollar gained against the yen to 108.13 , after reaching a low of 106.77. The euro also eased to $1.13505 (EUR=), down from $1.1412.
Gold broke a six-session winning stretch and slipped to $1,403.94 per ounce .
Oil prices ran into profit-taking, having gained overnight on a larger-than-expected drawdown in crude inventories as exports rose to a record high and refined-product inventories unexpectedly fell. [O/R]

Brent crude (LCOc1) futures fell 55 cents to $65.92. U.S. crude (CLc1) lost 47 cents to $58.91 a barrel.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 09:01AM ET</span>",Uber targets expansion in fast-growing West African markets,"By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS (Reuters) - Global ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is in talks with regulators over plans to expand into two West African countries and provide a boat service in Nigerian megacity Lagos, a company executive said on Thursday.
In much of sub-Saharan Africa there are low levels of personal car ownership, rapidly expanding populations and a lack of efficient mass transport systems in fast-growing cities.
Uber, which said it has 36,000 active drivers in sub-Saharan Africa, operates in a number of countries in East and South Africa but is largely absent from West Africa, aside from Nigeria and Ghana. 
The firm has identified the region as a target for potential expansion, Chief Business Officer Brooks Entwistle told Reuters. He said the company was in talks with regulators in Ivory Coast and Senegal regarding the possible launch of services. 
""Both Abidjan and Dakar are logical opportunities for us,"" said Entwistle, adding that discussions were at an early stage. He did not disclose further details.
""We have talked about West Africa today as being a big growth priority for us and launch priority for us moving forward,"" said Entwistle. 
Ivory Coast and Senegal have two of the world's fastest growing economies, according to the International Monetary Fund. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, is also the continent's most populous nation. 
A number of motorcycle ride-hailing firms have also targeted West Africa as an area for expansion in the last few months.
Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos, a megacity of around 20 million inhabitants built on a lagoon where Uber began operating in July 2014, is beset by heavy congestion. 
Entwistle, who spoke to Reuters during an interview in Lagos, said the company was in talks with state regulators about providing a transport system on the city's waterways as a way of bypassing its choked roads.
""We are looking at the waterways here, which are very interesting to us as it relates to a potential service,"" said Entwistle. 
The company has launched a boat service in the Indian city of Mumbai in the last few months. 
""We did launch Uber Boat in Mumbai and we have watched the product develop. It's in its early stages and we think there is high relevance here,"" he said, referring to Lagos. 
The Uber executive, who described Lagos as ""one of the great growth opportunity cities in the world"", said the company has also held discussions with a bus firm and regulators in the city. 
He said the talks were in line with a global push by the company to develop products that can work alongside public transit systems. 
Entwistle said the combination of population growth and congestion made Lagos, and other cities in the region, attractive.
The United Nations predicts that Nigeria's population will more than double to 400 million by 2050, which would make it the third most populous country in the world after China and India. 

Uber faces stiff competition in African cities from Estonian ride-hailing firm Bolt, which until early 2019 was called Taxify. Bolt has grabbed business largely by taking a smaller cut from drivers using its app.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 08:33AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trade tensions put energy transition at risk - BP chairman,"By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Trade tensions risk throwing the global economy's transition to greener energy into disarray and could hurt energy companies' preparations toward it,  BP  (LON:BP) Chairman Helge Lund said as leaders of the world's largest economies gather for talks in Japan. 
Lund, in his first interview since taking office in January, said BP would rather see a rapid, orderly phasing out of fossil fuels than a delayed and disorganized transition.
The former chief executive of Norwegian oil group Equinor said BP as well as rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and ExxonMobil (N:XOM) would have a vital role to play to ensure a successful transition to low carbon economies.
""It is better for us to see a path that goes rapidly,"" Lund said. ""It will be very difficult for the oil and gas companies but that is a better and a preferred solution than an uncontrolled sudden change maybe 10, 15 years into the future.""
London-based BP, like some of its peers, has taken steps toward meeting the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming, including setting targets to reduce carbon emissions from its operations, link them to managers' pay and ensure that investments are in line with the accords. 
But many investors say BP will have to do more, including tackling emissions from the fuels and products it sells to millions of customers daily, known as Scope 3 emissions, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. 
Lund said however that such Scope 3 targets would tie BP's hands to make future investments, whether in renewable energy or oil and gas. He nevertheless said the company's thinking around Scope 3 was likely ""to evolve over time.""
BP invested around $500 million in renewable power, electric vehicle charging points and other low-carbon technologies last year, a fraction of its annual spending of $15 billion.
And the pressure on companies and governments to do more to curb greenhouse gases is rising as carbon emission levels show no sign of decreasing.
Investors managing more than $34 trillion in assets, nearly half the world's invested capital, this week demanded urgent action from governments on climate change, piling pressure on leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies meeting this week.
France has said it will not accept a final G20 communique that does not mention the Paris climate change agreement.
""The long-term framework around the energy transition is important. Over time it is much easier for big companies like BP if we have a stable global framework for trade and investments,"" Lund told Reuters at BP's London headquarters.
Lund said an unprecedented level of cooperation was needed between companies and governments to bring greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the end of the century. 
He urged governments to introduce a price on carbon emissions to allow phasing out fossil fuels, even though only a handful of such schemes have been introduced around the world.

SOUND INVESTMENT
BP has faced a wave of protests by climate activists, including a blockade on its London office and protests at events the company sponsors.
Big investors, including Norway's sovereign wealth fund, are reviewing shareholdings in some oil and gas drillers, though not in BP and its largest rivals.
Lund, who took part in discussions on a climate resolution with a group of investors earlier this year, believes most investors understand that modern societies are almost built on hydrocarbons.
BP forecasts that even with a rapid increase in wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy, fossil fuels will account for the majority of energy supply for decades to come. 
Lund also warned that attempts to curb fossil fuels too fast could harm societies.
""It takes time to change energy systems ... If you try to build down the oil and gas industry quicker than you are able to build up a carbon neutral system you will pull societies back.""
Lund said large oil companies would be vital for the transition due to their large balance sheets, technical expertise and innovation skills.
""To be a strong contributor in the long term we have to stay financially strong, we have to be a good investment.""
Lund also said: “There is another dimension that we need to think about and that is if you believe that BP and other integrated oil and gas companies understand energy markets, they have significant balance sheets, they have technical capabilities, they have innovation capabilities, they can take risks - so in my mind business and these companies play an incredibly important role in the energy transition.”
SUCCESSION
Lund, 56, faces the task of leading BP through the energy transition and also overseeing the succession to Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who took the helm in 2010 following the crisis over the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Dudley also steered BP through the oil industry's worst downturn in decades so that the company is now producing strong profits which reached a five-year high last year of $12.7 billion.
""Bob is a very good leader, I am not sure where BP would have been without him,"" Helge said.
BP's board would ensure that when Dudley, who turns 65 next year, steps down, there will be ""at least a number of candidates who can compete for the job,"" he added. 
Lund, a former consultant and political adviser in the Norwegian parliament rejected suggestions he could replace Dudley to become the next CEO.
""I've been CEO for three companies. I thought about this when I left BG whether I should try to get one more (CEO) job or try to get a different life and I decided on the latter and I think it is rewarding,"" he said.

1450,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Ford to Cut 20% of European Workforce in Sweeping Overhaul,"(Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. will eliminate about 20% of its workforce across Europe in a sweeping overhaul that reflects the challenges facing carmakers in the region.
The restructuring, which has been announced piecemeal, will involve reducing its manufacturing footprint in Europe to 18 facilities by the end of 2020 from 24 at the beginning of this year. Germany, the U.K. and Russia will be hardest hit by the cuts, which total about 12,000 regular staff as well as workers employed at joint ventures, Ford said Thursday.
“Separating employees and closing plants are the hardest decisions we make,” Stuart Rowley, Ford’s president of Europe, said in a statement. “We are moving forward and focused on building a long-term sustainable future.”
Ford, struggling in the region’s crowded and mature market for years, has been particularly hard hit by falling car sales in the U.K. as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the country’s exit from the European Union. Underscoring the industry’s woes, the European automakers’ lobby group on Thursday lowered its forecast for the region, predicting that deliveries will likely fall 1% this year. That compares with a previous prediction of 1% growth.
Ford announced in January a major revamp for Europe, but at the time didn’t specify the full extent of the job cuts. As part of the changes, six plants will be closed or sold by the end of next year, including the Bridgend engine plant in South Wales, a transmission plant in France and an assembly site in Russia.
Tough Targets
Ford said that European operations are “on track” for significant improvement this year. Over the long term, the company is pushing to lift the division’s profit margin to 6% -- lower than a previous goal of 8%.
“Even with these measures, it’s very hard to see Ford returning anywhere close to 6%-8% margins in Europe,” said Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst Evercore ISI.
The company’s woes aren’t limited to Europe. At its annual shareholder meeting in May, investors voiced their grievances over falling market share, the speed at which the company is cutting costs and the long way the stock still has to go to recoup steep losses over the last few years.
The challenges are forcing automakers to consider partnerships that would have once been unthinkable. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG may approve expanding an alliance with Ford when it meets in two weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.
In addition to grappling with sluggish demand, carmakers are scrambling to meet stiffer environmental regulations starting in 2020. Based on its 2018 carbon-dioxide emissions, Ford faces a potential penalty of around 2.56 billion euros ($2.91 billion), according to researcher JATO Dynamics.
Consultant AlixPartners predicted that the automotive industry would need to invest more than 245 billion euros over the next five years globally to comply with tougher guidelines, even as worldwide demand stagnates or shrinks.
Ford said Thursday that every model line in Europe will include an electrified option and said a future family of battery-powered vehicles will be assembled in Europe. The Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker will add at least three new nameplates to its lineup over the next five years and may pare more slow-selling or gas-guzzling variants.
“Where a product line either does not contribute to our cash flow or is adverse to our CO2 compliance, we will consider actions,” Rowley said in an interview.

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Russell remake and G20 leave Wall Street primed for blowout volume,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. equity markets are set up for a blast of volume on Friday, as investors prepare for news on the U.S.-China trade dispute from the Group of 20 meeting and the annual reconstitution of the Russell indexes, traditionally one of the largest trading days of the year. 
The rebalance of the Russell indexes happens each year and becomes final on the fourth Friday in June. Stocks are added or deleted from Russell's family of indexes, including the Russell 1000 (RUI) large cap and Russell 2000 (RUT) small cap, prompting fund managers to adjust portfolios to reflect new weightings.
This telegraphed adjustment increases demand for buying and selling stocks, resulting in additional trading volume, which crests right before the market close on the fourth Friday.
This year's rebalance happens to coincide with the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, that will be highlighted by a meeting on Saturday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, putting investors on alert for any signs of a thaw or further breakdown in trade relations between the two world's two largest economies.
While the meeting between the two leaders will not take place until well after U.S. markets have closed on Friday, many expect there will be news on the trade front ahead of the meeting, similar to comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Wednesday.
The timing has fueled comparisons to the rebalancing of Russell's indexes in 2016, which came on the heels of the vote for Britain to leave the European Union and resulted in nearly 15.3 billion shares traded in U.S. exchanges when all was said and done. That number has only been bested since by the 15.33 billion shares traded on Dec. 21, when the Nasdaq (IXIC) confirmed it was in a bear market and the S&P 500 (SPX) was en route to its worst December performance since 1931. 
""It is always one of the biggest trading days of the year,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York. ""To me the one really different thing is this G20 meeting, and we are seeing the effect it has on market sentiment and anything can happen in Osaka."" 
Passive funds will rebalance on the day of the reconstitution to minimize any tracking error, while active managers try to take advantage of any price dislocations earlier, resulting in a surge of volume toward the market close as the reconstitution becomes final.
""People are gaming this out kind of through the month of June and trying to figure out what goes in and where,"" Colas said. 
As of Dec. 31, 2017, about $9 trillion was benchmarked to or invested in products based on Russell U.S. indexes, according to FTSE Russell's most recent data. Approximately $1.2 trillion are in passive investment products such as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.
Ivan Cajic, Virtu Financial's Americas director of index and ETF research, projects turnover across the Russell 3000 <.RUA> to total about $70 billion.
According to Nasdaq, last year's rebalance resulted in nearly 1.19 billion shares, representing $39.26 billion, changing hands during its ""closing cross"" in 0.935 second.
Due to the size of the trade and the number of stocks involved, FTSE Russell takes steps to be transparent to market participants regarding its methodology for inclusion, which includes factors such as market capitalization, home country and company structure, while also releasing preliminary lists of stocks that may be affected.
Those steps allow Russell to continue with the rebalance despite events that may cause additional market volatility. 
""(Brexit) was the test, I use that as an example,"" said Rolf Agather, managing director of North America applied research at FTSE Russell. ""People say, 'Well you have the Brexit vote on the same day, what is Russell going to do?' We follow the rules and it works out pretty well."" 
While Russell has not made any major changes to its methodology for inclusion this year, many market participants will be watching the placement of many of the recent initial public offerings.
Because many of these companies waited to go public, their size is likely to put them right into Russell's large-cap indexes. Virtu's Cajic noted that stocks such as Uber Technologies (N:UBER),  Lyft  (O:LYFT) and Beyond Meat (O:BYND) have contributed to volatility across the names expected to be added to the Russell 1000 (RUI), which have underperformed stocks that are expected to be removed from the index. 
Generally, stocks being added to an index would see an uptick in price while those being removed would show a decline.
Recent IPOs must have debuted before Russell's ""rank day"" this year of May 10 to be eligible in the rebalance. Russell adds IPOs after the rank day on a quarterly basis, and any IPOs that missed the cutoff, such as Slack Technologies (N:WORK), will have to wait until the next rank date, of Aug 17. 
""Clearly for small-cap investors, they would’ve liked to have opportunities to own some of these stocks,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. 

""You want stocks that have these good growth prospects and the fact they stayed private for so much longer, now they are out of their market cap,"" he said. ""They never got a chance to swing at that particular pitch.""

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>",European car lobby cuts 2019 sales forecast to 1% fall,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's automotive lobby on Thursday cut its forecast for passenger car registrations this year to a 1% fall from a 1% rise, blaming slower growth and business concerns over Britain's impending exit from the European Union.
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said it now expected car sales in the European Union to just exceed 15 million this year.
""It goes without saying that any additional barriers, costs or delays as a result of Brexit will pose a serious threat to jobs and growth in the auto industry, both in the UK as well as in the EU,"" ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said in statement.
""Aside from the uncertainty due to Brexit and changing macroeconomic conditions, this represents a natural stabilization of the market.""
In its industry guide published on Thursday, ACEA said production of vehicles in Europe dropped 0.2% from 2017 to 2018, amid a global decline of 0.6%.
Production of passenger cars in the EU was down 1.4% in 2018 from the year before, it added.
The bloc produces about a quarter of the world's passenger cars, led by Germany's strong auto manufacturing industry, employing some 13.8 million Europeans, according to ACEA.
For the second year in a row, carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars grew, rising 1.9% from the year before.
Jonnaert said that put European carmakers at risk of not meeting the bloc's 2020 emissions reduction targets.
""The prospect of fines for not reaching the 2020 CO2 target is to varying degree a serious concern for carmakers,"" he said, adding the increase was due partly to a rise in sales of higher-emitting petrol cars following a scandal over diesel pollution.
The share of new diesel passenger cars has decreased since 2015, when Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted it had cheated U.S. emissions tests by using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide.
In 2018, petrol engines powered more than half of new passenger cars in the EU, while diesel accounted for 35.9%. Hybrid electric, electrically-chargeable and other alternatively powered cars accounted for 7.4%.

1455,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",H&M Gains as Retailer Shows Early Progress Toward Turnaround,"(Bloomberg) -- Hennes & Mauritz AB (ST:HMb) surged after the struggling Swedish clothing retailer showed progress coping with a buildup of unsold garments, raising hopes that the worst may be over after a three-year slump in earnings.
Inventory dropped slightly as a proportion of sales, easing to 18.2% at the end of May from a record 18.9% as of last August, H&M said Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson said H&M still aims to boost operating profit this year. The stock rose as much as 11% Thursday in Stockholm.
A pickup in revenue growth at the start of the third quarter, helped by a heat wave in Europe, is boosting optimism that the retailer may have returned to a level of sales growth that could gradually put the inventory issue behind it. H&M pledged to reduce discounts for a fourth consecutive quarter as it aims to reduce its 40-billion kronor ($4.5 billion) buildup of unsold garments.
Analysts pointed to the June revenue growth of 12% as the trigger for the share gain. The stock can be volatile because short sellers have targeted H&M, betting against almost a fifth of the freely traded shares.
Better Composition
The retailer said that the composition of inventory has improved, implying it will become easier to sell the garments. The family-controlled company has a goal of eventually reducing stock-in-trade to 12% to 14% of sales, a level last seen three years ago. When asked in an interview if that could take four of five years, CEO Persson said it should be less than that, saying he’s “confident” H&M is heading in the right direction.
“H&M is improving its offer, which should lead to a sales and earnings recovery in time, albeit with execution risk in an ongoing tough competitive environment,” wrote Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC Europe.
The company has recently been offering discounts of up to half off on summer clothes, offering $1.99 camisole tops, $25.99 faux leather biker jackets and skinny jeans for $8.99.
H&M also cut this year’s store expansion plan by 26% while pledging more investment in e-commerce. H&M now expects 130 net store openings, further decelerating from a rate that exceeded 400 in recent years. Most of the new H&M shops will be outside of Europe and the U.S. as the retailer seeks faster-growing markets.
H&M has been plowing investment into e-commerce, adding online sales in Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia and Egypt this year.
The Swedish retailer is trying to catch up after Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) SA made it possible to order clothes from its chains from virtually anywhere in the world. H&M’s e-commerce reach extends to about 48 markets.
Inditex has forecast sales growth of 4% to 6% this year on a like-for-like basis as the Spanish retailer outperforms rivals such as Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS).
H&M is also trying to catch up with Inditex’s lead in RFID, a technology that allows retailers to track the location of clothes in stores and warehouses to boost efficiency. The Swedish retailer said it now uses RFID in 15 markets. Zara uses it in all its stores.
The Swedish retailer said it plans to launch H&M on Indian e-commerce platform Myntra and its & Other Stories chain on China’s Tmall by this autumn.
H&M warned that the weak krona is still pushing up buying costs as the retailer buys the bulk of its garments in Asia, where prices are linked to dollars. The krona was on average about 10% weaker against the dollar in the second quarter.
Pretax profit dropped 1.3% in the three months through May, missing analysts’ estimates and declining an eighth consecutive quarter.

The low approval comes in the wake of a rare public rebuke for Saikawa from international proxy firms. International Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis earlier this month had urged shareholders to vote against him, citing the need to break with the scandal-plagued era of his former boss, Carlos Ghosn.
Saikawa, a former Ghosn lieutenant, trailed well behind the 99.1% votes in favor of Jean-Dominique Senard, chairman of Nissan partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). The two men had a public spat this month over Nissan's governance reforms that raised concerns about the future of the automaking alliance.
Nissan released the breakdown of votes from the annual shareholders meeting in a filing to Japan's financial watchdog.
Saikawa's standing among shareholders has eased somewhat from the last vote two years ago, when his directorship was endorsed by 79.9% of shareholders who voted. Only Ghosn had a lower approval at that time, receiving 75.4%.
Nissan shareholders on Tuesday voted in favor of a new governance structure and board to address lax auditing revealed after the arrest of Ghosn over financial misconduct allegations. Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in Tokyo and out on bail, denies all the charges against him.
In a separate filing, Nissan said it would forgo paying Ghosn deferred retirement benefits totaling 4.44 billion yen ($41 million), along with 2.27 billion yen in share-related rights, after it accused its former chairman of underreporting his salary from the automaker. 
Ghosn's planned compensation for the year to March totaled 1.65 billion yen, comprising 410 million yen which had been paid, and a payment of 1.24 billion yen which would have been paid after retirement. 
Nissan canceled the latter payment after firing Ghosn as chairman following his arrest in Japan in November. 

Ghosn has been charged with five counts of financial misconduct, and has essentially been under house arrest in Tokyo while he faces trial next year.

Investing.com -- Shares in German chemicals giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN) are soaring Thursday after activist investor Paul Singer’s Elliott Management unveiled a $1.1 billion investment in the company.
The news came on the heels of Bayer’s announcement on Wednesday that it had hired John Beisner, a renowned litigation lawyer, to advise it on its handling of thousands of lawsuits against it in relation to health problems allegedly caused by glyphosate, the active ingredient in its Roundup weedkiller. Roundup became a Bayer brand when it bought  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) for $66 billion, a deal that completed last year.
By 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), the company’s stock was up 7.8%, way ahead of the rest of a Dax index that was up 0.6% on reinforced hopes of rate cuts from the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve, and on hopes that the U.S. will put off the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports, which are due to come into effect next week. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.1%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.3% at 381.18.
Elliott issued a statement on Wednesday saying that it expects Beisner to help Bayer find “a timely, fair resolution to its complex litigation challenges.”
That in itself would be welcome for Bayer shareholders, who voted in record numbers against the performance of the company’s management at this year’s shareholder meeting, only to have the supervisory board refuse to act on their resolution.
But for Elliott, it’s only a starter before the main course. The activist said it reckons Bayer’s market value should be 30 billion euros higher and issued a thinly-veiled warning that it wants to see more of its businesses spun off or sold to realize that value.
“Elliott looks forward to the Company building upon today's announcement, and making a credible commitment to the exploration of long-term value creative levers beyond the immediate litigation and governance enhancements,” it said.
That’s where things will get tricky for CEO Werner Baumann. While Bayer has shuffled its corporate portfolio a bit in recent years – it spun off coatings business Covestro and is looking to sell its animal health business by the end of the year -- it has an unwieldy conglomerate structure, spanning pharmaceuticals, crop science and consumer health.
Elliott can be expected to pressure Baumann into doing more, faster, to simplify the company. That will go against the grain of a management given to empire-building, but the reality is that the Monsanto acquisition has been a failure, and that, despite the protection from Baumann’s allies on the supervisory board, Elliott will make management pay for it."

(Reuters) - The anticipation of a trade truce between the United States and China put European stock markets on pace to break a four-day losing streak on Thursday, with Frankfurt's DAX outperforming as shares of Germany's chemicals giant Bayer rallied.
The South China Morning Post, citing sources, said Washington and Beijing were laying out an agreement that would help avert the next round of tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese imports.
The news eased investor nerves heading into the highly anticipated G20 summit, where the two sides will try to resolve a drawn out dispute that has roiled markets for the past year and resulted in the STOXX 600 posting its worst monthly performance in over two years in May.
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX (GDAXI) jumped 0.70% and helped charge a 0.26% gain in the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) by 0755 GMT.
""There seems to be some optimism about trade talks between Xi and Trump over the weekend and the possibility that there will be a deal or in any case Trump will not impose tariffs on all Chinese imports,"" said Simona Gambarini, a markets economist at Capital Economics in London.
The STOXX 600 is set to post its first weekly loss this month, as heightening tensions between U.S. and Iran, trade uncertainty between the world's two largest economies and a less than expected dovish message from the Federal Reserve pressured markets this week. Still, the benchmark index is up nearly 4% in June recouping most of May's sell-off.
Bayer (DE:BAYGn) surged 6.2% after the group hired a lawyer and formed a committee to address glyphosate litigation and as activist shareholder Elliott Associates revealed a 1.1 billion euros stake. 
The biggest gainer on the STOXX 600 index was H&M (ST:HMb), up 10.3% after the Swedish fashion retailer said sales of its summer collections had gotten off to a good start and that it was selling more clothes at full price.
Its upbeat note drove a 1.80% rise in the retail sector, which was closely followed by the auto sector's (SXAP) 1.4% gain and the basic-resources sector's (SXPP) 1.3% rise as the tariff reprieve triggered relief for companies most at risk from slower global trade.

On the flip side, Chr Hansen (CO:CHRH) tumbled 12.1% after the Danish food ingredients maker cut its revenue outlook for the year, hit by a disappointing performance at its food coloring and animal health businesses in the latest quarter.

1459,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Tencent Leads China's Effort to Slap Age Ratings on Games,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s biggest game developers including Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) have stepped up efforts to build a system to rate games for different ages, as the government tightens its control over a $38 billion industry it accuses of fomenting teenage addiction.
More than 10 of the country’s top gaming firms -- including Tencent, NetEase Inc. and Perfect World -- have teamed up to devise a system to assign games to one of four age categories, according to a proposal carried on the People’s Daily’s website. The effort is led by the online edition of the state-backed newspaper, often regarded as the mouthpiece of the Communist Party.
The rare instance of collaboration among often fierce rivals underscores the industry’s eagerness to pander to Beijing after a devastating 2018 crackdown. The proposed system will assign categories for players -- from the ages of 6, 12, 16 and 18 upward -- to titles based on content, genres and in-app purchases, among other things. Children under six are not recommended to play games on their own, according to draft rules.
It’s unclear how developers and publishers intend to enforce the ratings. The system is expected to be rolled out nationwide after an expert committee of researchers, press members and gaming executives have had time to assess and provide feedback, according to the People’s Daily’s online edition.
China doesn’t have a self-regulating organization that assigns ratings to games like the U.S. Entertainment Software Rating Board. The ESRB, for instance, slaps ratings such as “A” -- adults, or 18 and above -- “Teen” or “Everyone” on games based primarily on age.
Publishers are required to obtain government licenses for games sold domestically. But the process was suspended for nine months last year as Beijing attempted to reduce screen time for teenagers. That freeze, which wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off Tencent’s market value, spurred industry players to appease regulators by imposing stricter time limits on minors, while cleaning up content."
1460,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 04:01AM ET</span>",Huawei shrugs off Verizon patent talks as 'common' business,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei pegged its patent talks with U.S. carrier Verizon (N:VZ) as ""common"" business activity and said such negotiations should not be politicized, days after a senator filed legislation to prevent the Chinese firm from seeking damages in U.S. courts.
The company has demanded that Verizon pay licensing fees for more than 230 of the telecoms equipment maker's patents and is seeking over $1 billion, a person has told Reuters, against a background of mounting U.S.-China trade tensions. 
Republican Senator Marco Rubio has described Huawei's demand as ""baseless"" and filed the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which places a broad ban on the use of U.S. federal money to buy Huawei products citing national security concerns.
""We simply don't believe Marco Rubio's amendment could be passed as law,"" Huawei's chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said at the company's Shenzhen headquarters on Thursday.
Intellectual property (IP) rights ""should not be politicized"", Song said. ""IP is a private property issue and should be free from the competition, trade talks and any other allegations that countries have between them."" 
Song added that Huawei has been discussing patent licensing with companies in the United States, Europe and other parts of the world on a regular basis.
While the measure proposed by Rubio is several steps from becoming law, lawmakers have successfully used the NDAA in the past to crack down on the Chinese firm.
Huawei, the world's biggest telecommunications equipment maker and No.2 smartphone maker, denies its products pose a security threat and has sought to fight back in U.S. courts since Washington put it on an export blacklist last month. 
ROYALTIES
It recently sued the U.S. government over the NDAA.
The Chinese firm also sued CNEX Labs Inc, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets involving a memory control technology by the California semiconductor designer and poaching of employees.
A U.S. jury on Wednesday cleared CNEX, while awarding the U.S. firm no damages on its own trade theft claims. 
Analysts have said Huawei may be more inclined to monetize its U.S. patents now that the market ban and supplier ban imposed by Washington is expected to cost the firm $30 billion in revenue.
However, Song said Huawei has no intention of weaponizing the company's IP rights, echoing founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei from earlier this month.
Huawei, which has received over $1.4 billion in licensing revenue since 2015, is against charging exorbitant royalties, Song said, adding the firm had never been asked by a court to pay damages for malicious IP theft.
In 2017, a jury found Huawei misappropriated trade secrets from T-Mobile (O:TMUS) and ordered it to pay $4.8 million to the U.S. telco for breaching a handset supply contract between the two companies. The jury, however, did not find Huawei's misappropriation ""wilful and malicious"". 
""We are not going to be a company with a major source of revenue from royalties,"" Song said, adding that Huawei will remain focused on its core business for its top line.
Huawei paid more than $6 billion in royalties to legally implement IP of other companies and has been granted 87,805 patents, of which 11,152 are U.S. patents, Song said.

Huawei has the most 5G standard essential patents in the world, according to consultancy IPlytics.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 11:55PM ET</span>","Icahn steps up fight with Occidental over deal, wants board seats","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Arundhati Sarkar
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday ratcheted up his fight with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) over its pending purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) by calling for a special shareholder meeting where he hopes to win board seats.
In a regulatory filing, Icahn said he planned to oust and replace four Occidental directors and change the company's charter through a stockholder consent solicitation to prevent it from ever engineering a similar takeover again.
Responding to the filing, Occidental said it will review the latest materials filed by Icahn, and looks forward to addressing them in ongoing conversations with shareholders.
Icahn, one of industry's most powerful activist investors, cast himself as one of the deal's most fervent critics by charging that Occidental's $38 billion bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental's future if oil prices sink.
The deal has been approved by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and is expected to close in the second half of the year.
Icahn's move on Wednesday put fresh pressure on Occidental's management and Chief Executive Vicki Hollub at a critical time and has sparked speculation that Occidental may try to settle with him.
""It is important to add new directors to Occidental's Board of Directors to oversee future extraordinary transactions like the Anadarko transaction and to ensure that they are not consummated without stockholder approval when appropriate,"" Icahn said in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday.
Icahn owned a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30. 
While the move was notable, it hardly came as a surprise as Icahn had been hinting for weeks that he might push for a special meeting where other shareholders would be able to express their frustration with management.
In May he sued Occidental in Delaware court, and earlier this week he went out of his way to criticize the Occidental-Anadarko deal while discussing the merger of major casino operators Caesars Entertainment Corp and Eldorado Resorts Inc.
""The recent Occidental Petroleum fiasco is a great example of how CEOs and boards will go to great lengths, including 'betting the company' to serve their own agendas,"" Icahn said in a statement about the Caesars-Eldorado merger. ""If their bet is successful, they and possibly their shareholders win, but if it is unsuccessful, only the shareholders lose.""
While Icahn has said publicly that the Occidental-Anadarko deal likely would not be derailed, his filing illustrates how he wants to make sure that nothing similar happens again.
He said Occidental lacks effective corporate governance and that its directors made mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition of Anadarko, according to the filing.
Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting.
The oil and gas producer's bid for Anadarko topped one by  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and includes a $10 billion financing deal with Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa)
The merger of the two U.S. shale producers would increase Occidental's debt to around $40 billion. Icahn, in his lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery in May, sought access to the oil producer's financial records and details of negotiations.

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has identified a new risk that Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co must address on its 737 MAX before the grounded jet can return to service, the agency said on Wednesday.
The risk was discovered during a simulator test last week and it is not yet clear if the issue can be addressed with a software upgrade or will require a more complex hardware fix, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The FAA did not elaborate on the latest setback for Boeing, which has been working to get its best-selling airplane back in the air following a worldwide grounding in March in the wake of two deadly crashes within five months.
The new issue means Boeing will not conduct a certification test flight until July 8 in a best-case scenario, the sources said, but one source cautioned it could face further delays beyond that. The FAA will spend at least two to three weeks reviewing the results before deciding whether to return the plane to service, the people said.
Last month, FAA representatives told members of the aviation industry that approval of the 737 MAX jets could happen as early as late June. 
The world's largest planemaker has been working on the upgrade for a stall-prevention system known as MCAS since a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October, when pilots were believed to have lost a tug of war with software that repeatedly pushed the nose down. 
A second deadly crash in March in Ethiopia also involved MCAS. The two accidents killed a total of 346 people. 
""On the most recent issue, the FAA's process is designed to discover and highlight potential risks. The FAA recently found a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate,"" the FAA said in the statement emailed to Reuters. ""The FAA will lift the aircraft’s prohibition order when we deem it is safe to do so."" 
Boeing said in a securities filing late on Wednesday that the FAA has asked it to address through software changes a specific flight condition not covered in the company's already-unveiled software changes.
The U.S. planemaker also said it agreed with the FAA's decision and request, and was working on a fix to address the problem.
""Boeing will not offer the 737 MAX for certification by the FAA until we have satisfied all requirements for certification of the MAX and its safe return to service,"" Boeing wrote in the filing.
INTENSE SCRUTINY 
Boeing's aircraft are being subjected to intense scrutiny and testing designed to catch flaws even after a years-long certification process.
Two people briefed on the matter told Reuters that an FAA test pilot during a simulator test last week was running scenarios seeking to intentionally activate the MCAS stall-prevention system. During one activation it took an extended period to recover the stabilizer trim system that is used to control the aircraft, the people said.
It was not clear if the situation that resulted in an uncommanded dive can be addressed with a software update or if it is a microprocessor issue that will require a hardware replacement.
In a separate statement, Boeing said addressing the new problem would remove a potential source of uncommanded movement by the plane's stabilizer.
A hardware fix could add new delays to the plane's return to service.
The FAA also said on Wednesday that it continues ""to evaluate Boeing's software modification to the MCAS and we are still developing necessary training requirements. We also are responding to recommendations received from the Technical Advisory Board. The TAB is an independent review panel we have asked to review our work regarding 737 Max return to service.""

American Airlines Group Inc and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co earlier canceled flights through early September as a result of the grounding. On Wednesday, United Airlines said it also was removing MAX flights from its schedule through Sept. 3.

China has been trying to make it easier for small firms to get access to bank loans in a bid to rejuvenate its slowing economy and weather a trade war with the United States. 
The country's cabinet, the State Council, unveiled new measures on Wednesday to cut financing costs for smaller firms.
However, Hu Zejun, head of China's National Audit Office, said in an annual budget review submitted to the National People's Congress and published late on Wednesday that the push has yet to have a substantial impact. 
""Due to risk prevention, there are still some problems for bank financing, such as a relative high threshold (to obtain loans), lengthy procedures, and a long waiting period,"" he said.
He said three of the big five Chinese commercial lenders had also illegally charged 230 million yuan ($33.44 million) in financing fees, ""failing to ease the corporate burden"" on firms.
The audit office also uncovered dozens of violations in the disbursement of retirement funds and unemployment insurance, with several officials accused of ""misappropriating"" million of yuan of state money. 
As well, the audit revealed an imbalance between resource development and ecological restoration, Hu said, noting that 3,2487 firms in four provinces were found to have illegally extracted 594 million cubic meters of water last year.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","Back to the futures: fearing another crash, investors pile into EU derivatives","By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are piling into European equity futures at a record pace, preferring derivatives to cash markets, in a sign they are worried the market is hurtling towards a major rout amid concerns about a slowing global economy and the trade war.
Open interest -- a measure of a market's liquidity -- in the Eurostoxx futures index hit record highs on a monthly basis of 4.61 million lots on Monday, up from 4.48 million in May and almost 1 million lots higher than a year ago.
The total has fallen in recent days to 3.91 million contracts, which is still well above five-year averages. Open interest in May was a record and April was the third highest on record.
The jump reflects bets in either direction -- investors use a short futures position to hedge against a long cash bet or go long futures to get exposure to the rally in the benchmark index without taking a long-term cash position.
Futures have become more popular in recent years as funds have launched absolute return or multi-asset strategies that often seek to capture moves in headline indexes rather than exposure to individual stocks.
As a deeper pool of liquidity, it is easier for investors to buy and sell futures.
Open interest can fluctuate sharply each month, particularly towards the end of a quarter when investors either close out or roll over positions.
Activity in futures also typically rises during periods of market tumult. Turnover in the Eurostoxx 50 soared in December from November and during the global financial market rout when implied volatility shot up.
But recent months have seen a pronounced pick-up in open interest even though volatility has remained relatively stable -- a signal that investors are seeking to protect against a market crash.
The rise is all the more significant because volumes in cash equities in Europe have fallen amid tighter regulation, worries about Brexit, political upheaval in the euro zone and a broad economic slowdown.
In January-May, cash equity volumes across 15 European exchanges fell 16% from a year earlier, their slowest pace for those months since 2014, exchange data analyzed by UBS shows.
For Edmund Shing, global head of equity and derivatives strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), the surge in open interest shows uncertainty about the direction of stock markets after the unexpectedly strong and prolonged rally so far this year.
""Investors are still frozen in the markets headlights and the default is to do nothing,"" he said. ""They don't want to get stuck in cash equities and are hedging via futures.""
The pan European STOXX 600 is up more than 13% so far this year, putting it on track for its best year since 2013.

UNPOPULAR RALLY
The data also underscores the idea among investors that this has been an unpopular rally, lacking the conviction that has propelled Wall Street higher for the past 10 years -- its longest bull-run in history.
Investors have pulled $137 billion from global equities so far this year, more than half -- $76 billion -- from Europe.
For Stephane Barbier de la Serre, macro strategist at Makor Capital Markets in Geneva, it's another sign the market is nearing the end of its super-long cycle. 
With caution pervading markets, investors prefer equity index futures rather than punting on individual cash stocks or benchmark cash indices because they are more liquid.
""People are still concerned about downside risk. They feel like they have to be in the market because if not, you can miss these types of rallies, but they are going with a very cautious approach,"" said UBS equity analyst Michael Werner.

""If you talk to investors and fund managers, people are happy things are up after an abysmal Q4, but they are still very concerned about the macro threats and trade war tariffs.""

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 05:25PM ET</span>",Buffett-backed Axalta Coating Systems to explore a sale,"(This version of the June 19 story corrects to show investigation was by external counsel in paragraph 5)
By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Axalta Coating Systems Ltd, the U.S. coatings company whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, said on Wednesday it had formed a board committee to explore a sale of the company.
The move was driven by the company's desire to proactively stay on top of a wave of consolidation sweeping the paints and coatings industry, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. 
Axalta shares jumped 14 percent on the news to $29.52 a share, giving the company a market capitalization of about $7 billion.
Axalta rebuffed acquisition approaches in 2017 from Akzo Nobel NV and Nippon Paint Holdings Co Ltd. Since then, the company has lost about a fifth of its market value, even though the S&P 500 Index has risen more than 9 percent during the same period, as demand in Axalta's key automotive market weakened.
Axalta also got new management in December, after an investigation of previous Chief Executive Officer Terrence Hahn's conduct by external counsel that Axalta characterized as ""inconsistent with the company's policies."" Axalta never disclosed the investigation's findings. Hahn was replaced with the company's chief financial officer, Robert Bryant.
Axalta, a former division of DuPont (NYSE:DD), said its board had formed a strategic review committee to be chaired by the independent presiding director Mark Garrett, and include Bryant and independent director Samuel Smolik. There is no certainty of any deal, Axalta cautioned.
The Philadelphia-based company also said it has hired Evercore and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) as financial advisers to assist in the review. 
Axalta's coatings are used in the refinishing of cars, buildings and pipelines. Its corporate peers include Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW), Akzo Nobel, PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG), BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and RPM International Inc.
PPG is currently on an acquisition spree, snapping up smaller coatings companies, while paints maker Akzo Nobel last year decided to focus on its core business by selling its specialty chemicals division Nouryon to buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP and Singaporean wealth fund GIC.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 05:18PM ET</span>",EPA breathes new life into controversial Alaska mining project,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it would reconsider a 2014 decision that had stopped development of Alaska's Pebble Mine, the world's biggest undeveloped copper and gold project.
The move restarts a review that had been put on hold since early 2018, and comes as the Trump administration works to reduce regulation over extractive industries and boost domestic development of minerals, especially those used in electric vehicles.
EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold signed a memo on Tuesday directing staff to reconsider a decision five years ago under President Barack Obama that restricted the mine's disposal plans under the auspices of the Clean Water Act.
Shares of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, the project operator, jumped 28% to close at 78 cents Canadian in Toronto.
""Today's step is a move toward good government decision making, which we owe under the law to both the public and project proponents,"" Leopold said in a statement.
The review was paused in January 2018 for further environmental studies, the EPA said at the time.
The Pebble Mine would, if brought online, produce 70 million tons of gold, molybdenum and copper ore a year and create a pit 1,970 feet (600 meters) deep. A new road, pipeline and power plant would be built, according to the mine plan.
The site is near Lake Iliamna in southwestern Alaska between the headwaters of two rivers that drain into Bristol Bay.

The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers had last February released a draft environmental impact statement on the project, which did not recommend any action pending a final environmental impact statement next year. A decision on a construction permit is expected in mid-2020.

1475,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are three things that might rock the markets June 27.
1. Home Sales and Claims
Top-tier economic data is on calendar for tomorrow in the form of pending home sales, jobless claims and GDP.
Pending homes sales for May will take on added scrutiny following yesterday’s unexpected drop in new home sales. The National Association of Realtors will issue its latest data on pending home sales at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). On average, economists predict that pending home sales rose 1.1% in May, compared with a 1.5% decline in April.
On the jobs front, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance. The report is due at 8:30 am ET (13:30 GMT) for the week ended June 23. Economists are expecting jobless claims rose to 220,000 from 216,000 the prior week.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT). Economists, on average, expect an unchanged reading at 3.1%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
2. Walgreens, ConAgra Foods,  Nike  Earnings on Deck
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is set to report earnings before U.S. markets open. Guidance will likely be closely watched as the backdrop for health care stocks has been far from pretty.
Health care companies have come under increasing scrutiny over drug prices, raising fears that regulatory pressures look set to continue following President Donald Trump's executive order, signed on Monday, that aimed to lower healthcare costs by improving price transparency.
As well as the impact of regulatory headwinds, consumer market challenges in the U.S. and U.K. have also weighed on Walgreens.
Analysts expect the retail and health care company to report earnings of $1.44 a share on revenue of about $34.5 billion for the fiscal third quarter.
ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) is also set to release earnings before the bell, with analysts keen to see whether the boost from its Pinnacle Foods acquisition will continue drive growth and help offset higher transportation and input costs. ConAgra Food is expected to deliver earnings of $0.41 a share on revenue of about $2.7 billion.
Nike (NYSE:NKE), meanwhile, will report its earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter after the U.S. closing bell. In the run up to the athletic apparel’s earnings, some have touted optimism.
""Based on numerous channel checks, and commentary by retailers and other brands, it is clear to us that, due to a strong product pipeline across distribution channels,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analysts said in a note. ""Nike has just begun taking share from other brands, and such share taking will continue for the foreseeable future,”
Nike is expected report earnings of 66 cents a share on revenue of $10.16 billion.
3. Natural Gas Supply Data on Watch
Natural gas futures will be in spotlight Thursday when the Energy Information Administration is expected to report gas storage fell by 104 billion cubic feet last week.
Natural gas futures fell 0.31% to $2.28 on Wednesday, following a strong start to the week on expectations for higher demand after Bespoke Weather Services’ forecast for a hotter first week of July.
“The totality of the data, while not as strong as last week in terms of balances, is improved today,” Bespoke said. “Production is starting off slightly lower than the starting point the last few days, and we see a little improvement in preliminary burns this morning.”"
1476,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:47PM ET</span>","Stocks - Techs, Energy Lead Market Despite Rising Rates","Investing.com - Stocks struggled for much of Wednesday, fighting off the effects of higher interest rates and rising oil prices.
But technology stocks were clear winners, thanks to a bullish outlook from chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).
The S&P 500 closed down 0.12%, giving up a small gain in the last 30 minutes of trading. The Dow Jones industrials ended down 0.04% after rising as much as 112 points, or 0.4%, in the morning. The Nasdaq Composite index added 0.32%. But the tech-heavy index gave up two-thirds of an early gain by the close.
Micron jumped more than 13% thanks to its outlook that suggested a global glut of semiconductors was fading. Micron was the top performer in the Nasdaq 100 index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which was up 3.2%. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the top performer among the Dow stocks. Graphics chip maker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 5.1%.
The chip stocks pulled all things technology higher, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) showing gains.
At the same time, energy shares moved higher as oil prices gained on a shocking decline in domestic oil supplies. Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) was up 5.6%. Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) added 6.7%.
Those gains were offset by the investors fleeing from staples stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and healthcare and health insurance stocks. Plus, stocks vulnerable to interest rate increases, such as utilities, were hit as the 10-Year Treasury yield moved above 2% on the day, ending at 2.05%. The Dow Jones Utility Average fell 2%.
The rate increase was probably due to signals from the Federal Reserve that a widely-expected interest-rate cut in July won't be as big as expected or as President Donald Trump is demanding. The President wants a half-point cut in the federal funds rate, now at 2.25% to 2.5%. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests the central bank will cut the fed funds rate to 2% to 2.25% in July, with another rate cut in September.
President Trump is headed to Tokyo night for the two-day G-20 summit, where he and his trade negotiators will try to negotiate a new deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a meeting set for Saturday. He'll also meet privately with Russia President Vladimir Putin on Friday.
With Wednesday's close, there are just two trading days left in the second quarter. The S&P 500 is up nearly 6% for June but only 2.9% for the quarter, thanks to a nasty pullback in May. It is still up 16.4% for the year. The Dow, up nearly 7% for June, is up 2.4% for the quarter and 13.8% for the year. The Nasdaq has risen 6.2% so far in June and 19.3% for the year. But the index is up just 2.4% for the quarter."
1477,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:44PM ET</span>",S&P 500 dips as healthcare declines counter tech gains,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Wednesday as gains in technology stocks were offset by a drop in healthcare shares, and investors parsed mixed messages over prospects for a deal to end a trade war between the United States and China.
Technology shares led the Nasdaq higher while the Dow Jones Industrial average posted a nominal loss. 
U.S. stocks struggled for direction throughout the session as market participants pondered whether a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Japan would yield any progress in the two country's protracted tariff dispute.
The market initially perked up after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was quoted by CNBC interview as saying the trade deal between the United States and China is ""about 90%"" complete. His comments were later restated to show he was using the past tense to describe progress in the talks.
Trump later said that while it was ""absolutely possible"" to avoid imposing additional tariffs on imported Chinese goods, he was ""very happy where we are now.""
""(Trade) optimism has been unwound as the day has gone on,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
""Last week the market had a clear path of what to focus on: A rate cut in July and Trump and Xi meeting at the G20 to discuss reopening trade negotiations,"" Pavlik added. ""What has happened since is this government has muddied the waters and confused the market.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.4 points, or 0.04%, to 26,536.82, the S&P 500 lost 3.6 points, or 0.12%, to 2,913.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.25 points, or 0.32%, to 7,909.97.
A rise in crude prices boosted energy stocks. Energy and tech companies were the biggest percentage gainers among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, while defensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples saw the largest losses.
Chipmakers led the tech rally. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index rose 3.2% after Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) posted upbeat results and forecast a recovery in chip demand. Micron's shares jumped 13.3%.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares advanced 2.2% after the iPhone maker confirmed that it bought self-driving startup Drive.ai and after Trump suggested in an interview that the European Union was out of line with its lawsuits against U.S. tech firms, saying that the United States was the one that should be taking action.
EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday hit Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) with demands that the chipmaker drop its exclusivity clauses with TV and modem makers as part of its ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, Broadcom's shares gained 1.8%
 General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500, dropping 4.5% after the packaged food company missed quarterly sales estimates, hit by lower snacks demand in North America.
In economic news, new orders for non-defense capital goods rose more than economists expected in May, suggesting some stabilization in business spending, which had shown signs of weakness amid trade jitters and bloated inventories. But overall orders for durable goods dropped, driven by a 28.2% plunge in non-defense aircraft orders, partly due to Boeing's move to cut production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 94 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.69 billion shares, compared to the 6.99 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>",Investors pile into U.S. money funds for nine straight weeks -iMoneyNet,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors shifted more cash into money market funds for nine consecutive weeks, suggesting they are somewhat nervous even as Wall Street is hovering at all-time highs, according to a private report released on Wednesday.
Assets of money market funds, which are considered nearly as safe as bank accounts, increased by $19.13 billion to $3.156 trillion in the week ended June 25, the Money Fund Report said.
During this nine-week stretch, total fund assets have risen by $146 billion.
Taxable money market fund assets grew by $17.92 billion to $3.020 trillion, while tax-free assets climbed by $1.21 billion to $135.74 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
(For a graphic on 'U.S. money fund assets' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Em6)
Money managers' allocation to global equities dropped by 32 percentage points from May to a net 21% underweight, the lowest allocation to stocks since March 2009, a survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) released last week showed.
On the other hand, their average allocation rose to 5.6% from 4.6% - the biggest jump since the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.
Even in light of those defensive moves by institutional investors, the S&P 500 hit a record high last Thursday on expectations the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates as early as next month to counter risk from global trade tension and sluggish domestic inflation.
Average yields on money funds were resilient even as U.S. bond yields have fallen on bets that Fed would lower key lending rates to preserve the current economic expansion.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds held at 1.99%, its lowest level so far this year. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds shrank by one day to 29.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds jumped to 1.41%, its highest since early May from 1.25%. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds was unchanged at 27 days.

Axalta rebuffed acquisition approaches in 2017 from Akzo Nobel NV and Nippon Paint Holdings Co Ltd. Since then, the company has lost about a fifth of its market value, even though the S&P 500 Index has risen more than 9 percent during the same period, as demand in Axalta's key automotive market weakened.
Axalta also got new management in December, after an investigation of previous Chief Executive Officer Terrence Hahn's conduct by external counsel that Axalta characterized as ""inconsistent with the company's policies."" Axalta never disclosed the investigation's findings. Hahn was replaced with the company's chief financial officer, Robert Bryant.
Axalta, a former division of DuPont (NYSE:DD), said its board had formed a strategic review committee to be chaired by the independent presiding director Mark Garrett, and include Bryant and independent director Samuel Smolik. There is no certainty of any deal, Axalta cautioned.
The Philadelphia-based company also said it has hired Evercore and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) as financial advisers to assist in the review. 
Axalta's coatings are used in the refinishing of cars, buildings and pipelines. Its corporate peers include Sherwin-Williams Co (NYSE:SHW), Akzo Nobel, PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG), BASF SE (DE:BASFN) and RPM International Inc.
PPG is currently on an acquisition spree, snapping up smaller coatings companies, while paints maker Akzo Nobel last year decided to focus on its core business by selling its specialty chemicals division Nouryon to buyout firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP and Singaporean wealth fund GIC.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 05:18PM ET</span>",EPA breathes new life into controversial Alaska mining project,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it would reconsider a 2014 decision that had stopped development of Alaska's Pebble Mine, the world's biggest undeveloped copper and gold project.
The move restarts a review that had been put on hold since early 2018, and comes as the Trump administration works to reduce regulation over extractive industries and boost domestic development of minerals, especially those used in electric vehicles.
EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold signed a memo on Tuesday directing staff to reconsider a decision five years ago under President Barack Obama that restricted the mine's disposal plans under the auspices of the Clean Water Act.
Shares of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, the project operator, jumped 28% to close at 78 cents Canadian in Toronto.
""Today's step is a move toward good government decision making, which we owe under the law to both the public and project proponents,"" Leopold said in a statement.
The review was paused in January 2018 for further environmental studies, the EPA said at the time.
The Pebble Mine would, if brought online, produce 70 million tons of gold, molybdenum and copper ore a year and create a pit 1,970 feet (600 meters) deep. A new road, pipeline and power plant would be built, according to the mine plan.
The site is near Lake Iliamna in southwestern Alaska between the headwaters of two rivers that drain into Bristol Bay.

The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers had last February released a draft environmental impact statement on the project, which did not recommend any action pending a final environmental impact statement next year. A decision on a construction permit is expected in mid-2020.

1484,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here are three things that might rock the markets June 27.
1. Home Sales and Claims
Top-tier economic data is on calendar for tomorrow in the form of pending home sales, jobless claims and GDP.
Pending homes sales for May will take on added scrutiny following yesterday’s unexpected drop in new home sales. The National Association of Realtors will issue its latest data on pending home sales at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). On average, economists predict that pending home sales rose 1.1% in May, compared with a 1.5% decline in April.
On the jobs front, the Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance. The report is due at 8:30 am ET (13:30 GMT) for the week ended June 23. Economists are expecting jobless claims rose to 220,000 from 216,000 the prior week.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will report its final reading on first-quarter gross domestic product at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT). Economists, on average, expect an unchanged reading at 3.1%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
2. Walgreens, ConAgra Foods,  Nike  Earnings on Deck
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is set to report earnings before U.S. markets open. Guidance will likely be closely watched as the backdrop for health care stocks has been far from pretty.
Health care companies have come under increasing scrutiny over drug prices, raising fears that regulatory pressures look set to continue following President Donald Trump's executive order, signed on Monday, that aimed to lower healthcare costs by improving price transparency.
As well as the impact of regulatory headwinds, consumer market challenges in the U.S. and U.K. have also weighed on Walgreens.
Analysts expect the retail and health care company to report earnings of $1.44 a share on revenue of about $34.5 billion for the fiscal third quarter.
ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) is also set to release earnings before the bell, with analysts keen to see whether the boost from its Pinnacle Foods acquisition will continue drive growth and help offset higher transportation and input costs. ConAgra Food is expected to deliver earnings of $0.41 a share on revenue of about $2.7 billion.
Nike (NYSE:NKE), meanwhile, will report its earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter after the U.S. closing bell. In the run up to the athletic apparel’s earnings, some have touted optimism.
""Based on numerous channel checks, and commentary by retailers and other brands, it is clear to us that, due to a strong product pipeline across distribution channels,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analysts said in a note. ""Nike has just begun taking share from other brands, and such share taking will continue for the foreseeable future,”
Nike is expected report earnings of 66 cents a share on revenue of $10.16 billion.
3. Natural Gas Supply Data on Watch
Natural gas futures will be in spotlight Thursday when the Energy Information Administration is expected to report gas storage fell by 104 billion cubic feet last week.
Natural gas futures fell 0.31% to $2.28 on Wednesday, following a strong start to the week on expectations for higher demand after Bespoke Weather Services’ forecast for a hotter first week of July.
“The totality of the data, while not as strong as last week in terms of balances, is improved today,” Bespoke said. “Production is starting off slightly lower than the starting point the last few days, and we see a little improvement in preliminary burns this morning.”"
1485,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:47PM ET</span>","Stocks - Techs, Energy Lead Market Despite Rising Rates","Investing.com - Stocks struggled for much of Wednesday, fighting off the effects of higher interest rates and rising oil prices.
But technology stocks were clear winners, thanks to a bullish outlook from chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU).
The S&P 500 closed down 0.12%, giving up a small gain in the last 30 minutes of trading. The Dow Jones industrials ended down 0.04% after rising as much as 112 points, or 0.4%, in the morning. The Nasdaq Composite index added 0.32%. But the tech-heavy index gave up two-thirds of an early gain by the close.
Micron jumped more than 13% thanks to its outlook that suggested a global glut of semiconductors was fading. Micron was the top performer in the Nasdaq 100 index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which was up 3.2%. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the top performer among the Dow stocks. Graphics chip maker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 5.1%.
The chip stocks pulled all things technology higher, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) showing gains.
At the same time, energy shares moved higher as oil prices gained on a shocking decline in domestic oil supplies. Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) was up 5.6%. Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) added 6.7%.
Those gains were offset by the investors fleeing from staples stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and healthcare and health insurance stocks. Plus, stocks vulnerable to interest rate increases, such as utilities, were hit as the 10-Year Treasury yield moved above 2% on the day, ending at 2.05%. The Dow Jones Utility Average fell 2%.
The rate increase was probably due to signals from the Federal Reserve that a widely-expected interest-rate cut in July won't be as big as expected or as President Donald Trump is demanding. The President wants a half-point cut in the federal funds rate, now at 2.25% to 2.5%. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests the central bank will cut the fed funds rate to 2% to 2.25% in July, with another rate cut in September.
President Trump is headed to Tokyo night for the two-day G-20 summit, where he and his trade negotiators will try to negotiate a new deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a meeting set for Saturday. He'll also meet privately with Russia President Vladimir Putin on Friday.
With Wednesday's close, there are just two trading days left in the second quarter. The S&P 500 is up nearly 6% for June but only 2.9% for the quarter, thanks to a nasty pullback in May. It is still up 16.4% for the year. The Dow, up nearly 7% for June, is up 2.4% for the quarter and 13.8% for the year. The Nasdaq has risen 6.2% so far in June and 19.3% for the year. But the index is up just 2.4% for the quarter."
1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:44PM ET</span>",S&P 500 dips as healthcare declines counter tech gains,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Wednesday as gains in technology stocks were offset by a drop in healthcare shares, and investors parsed mixed messages over prospects for a deal to end a trade war between the United States and China.
Technology shares led the Nasdaq higher while the Dow Jones Industrial average posted a nominal loss. 
U.S. stocks struggled for direction throughout the session as market participants pondered whether a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Japan would yield any progress in the two country's protracted tariff dispute.
The market initially perked up after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was quoted by CNBC interview as saying the trade deal between the United States and China is ""about 90%"" complete. His comments were later restated to show he was using the past tense to describe progress in the talks.
Trump later said that while it was ""absolutely possible"" to avoid imposing additional tariffs on imported Chinese goods, he was ""very happy where we are now.""
""(Trade) optimism has been unwound as the day has gone on,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
""Last week the market had a clear path of what to focus on: A rate cut in July and Trump and Xi meeting at the G20 to discuss reopening trade negotiations,"" Pavlik added. ""What has happened since is this government has muddied the waters and confused the market.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.4 points, or 0.04%, to 26,536.82, the S&P 500 lost 3.6 points, or 0.12%, to 2,913.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.25 points, or 0.32%, to 7,909.97.
A rise in crude prices boosted energy stocks. Energy and tech companies were the biggest percentage gainers among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, while defensive utilities, real estate and consumer staples saw the largest losses.
Chipmakers led the tech rally. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index rose 3.2% after Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) posted upbeat results and forecast a recovery in chip demand. Micron's shares jumped 13.3%.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares advanced 2.2% after the iPhone maker confirmed that it bought self-driving startup Drive.ai and after Trump suggested in an interview that the European Union was out of line with its lawsuits against U.S. tech firms, saying that the United States was the one that should be taking action.
EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday hit Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) with demands that the chipmaker drop its exclusivity clauses with TV and modem makers as part of its ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, Broadcom's shares gained 1.8%
 General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500, dropping 4.5% after the packaged food company missed quarterly sales estimates, hit by lower snacks demand in North America.
In economic news, new orders for non-defense capital goods rose more than economists expected in May, suggesting some stabilization in business spending, which had shown signs of weakness amid trade jitters and bloated inventories. But overall orders for durable goods dropped, driven by a 28.2% plunge in non-defense aircraft orders, partly due to Boeing's move to cut production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 7 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 94 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.69 billion shares, compared to the 6.99 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors shifted more cash into money market funds for nine consecutive weeks, suggesting they are somewhat nervous even as Wall Street is hovering at all-time highs, according to a private report released on Wednesday.
Assets of money market funds, which are considered nearly as safe as bank accounts, increased by $19.13 billion to $3.156 trillion in the week ended June 25, the Money Fund Report said.
During this nine-week stretch, total fund assets have risen by $146 billion.
Taxable money market fund assets grew by $17.92 billion to $3.020 trillion, while tax-free assets climbed by $1.21 billion to $135.74 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.

Money managers' allocation to global equities dropped by 32 percentage points from May to a net 21% underweight, the lowest allocation to stocks since March 2009, a survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) released last week showed.
On the other hand, their average allocation rose to 5.6% from 4.6% - the biggest jump since the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.
Even in light of those defensive moves by institutional investors, the S&P 500 hit a record high last Thursday on expectations the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates as early as next month to counter risk from global trade tension and sluggish domestic inflation.
Average yields on money funds were resilient even as U.S. bond yields have fallen on bets that Fed would lower key lending rates to preserve the current economic expansion.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds held at 1.99%, its lowest level so far this year. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds shrank by one day to 29.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds jumped to 1.41%, its highest since early May from 1.25%. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds was unchanged at 27 days.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's vice president of production at its Fremont factory, Peter Hochholdinger, has left after three years with the electric-car maker, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Hochholdinger, a former production executive at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, is the latest high-profile executive to leave Tesla in the past two years as the automaker struggles to ramp up production of Model 3, which is seen as crucial for its long-term profitability.
He was tasked with improving production for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle as well as helping build a cost-effective manufacturing program for the Model 3 sedan, the company had said https://reut.rs/2KFSyd2 in his appointment memo.
At Volkswagen, Hochholdinger spent 22 years supervising the production of Audi A4, A5 and Q5 models. When Audi set up a new production facility in Mexico, he served as an adviser.
Both Tesla and Hochholdinger did not respond to requests for comment.
Demand for Tesla cars has been one of the major concerns of investors amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. The company reported a 31% fall in first-quarter deliveries and warned that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, however, said last month that the company was on course to deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter.
Musk reiterated the claim on Tuesday after automotive news website Electrek reported that the company faces delivery bottlenecks at the close of the second quarter.
Electrek was also the first to report https://electrek.co/2019/06/26/tesla-loses-head-of-production on Hochholdinger's exit from Tesla.
Earlier on Wednesday, Wedbush analysts lowered their current quarter delivery forecast to 84,000 units from an earlier forecast of 88,000 units, adding that Tesla hitting its quarterly delivery target is an ""unlikely event"".

Shares of the company, which is expected to report its second-quarter delivery and production numbers in July, were down marginally at $218.65.

Bayer has seen its share price tumble in the wake of its $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which brought with it massive legal issues after more than 13,400 plaintiffs alleged the company's glyphosate weedkiller caused cancer.
Bayer, which acquired Monsanto last year, says studies and regulators have deemed glyphosate and Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller safe for human use, but the German company has struggled to contain the reputational and legal fallout.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that German farmers would stop using glyphosate eventually, a stance which is at odds with the Leverkusen-based company's view.
Activist shareholder Elliott Associates said it welcomed Bayer's new steps to improve supervision of litigation issues, as it revealed for the first time its holding of Bayer shares. 
Bayer said it has hired U.S. lawyer John H. Beisner from Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom LLP to advise the Supervisory Board on matters related to the glyphosate litigations, including trial tactics and mediation. 
""His appointment is intended to add fresh and independent perspectives to the advice given to the Board of Management,"" Bayer said in a statement.
""We are convinced that with his expertise, John H. Beisner will provide very valuable and concrete advice on the ongoing litigation as well as the mediation,"" Bayer's Chairman Werner Wenning, said in the statement.
Bayer also said a new Supervisory Board committee, comprised of eight supervisory board members, will consult with the Board of Management and make recommendations on litigation strategy.
The company appears to have changed its approach to litigation, from taking a ""we will prevail, we will fight to the end"" attitude to seeking a settlement more quickly as a way to reassure investors and employees, a person familiar with the discussion told Reuters on Wednesday.
Elliott Associates revealed that it holds Bayer shares and financial instruments equivalent to 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) worth of Bayer stock. Bayer's market value is 52.2 billion euros.
It is the first time that Elliott has acknowledged holding a significant stake in the German company. Reuters last year reported that Elliott had amassed a stake of under 3%, citing people familiar with the matter.
Elliott has a stake equivalent to 2.1% of Bayer shares, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
""Elliott welcomes these steps, and is confident that today’s statement marks a step change in Bayer’s approach to addressing the legal challenges currently facing the company,"" Elliott said in a separate statement. 
Elliott said it believes that the creation of the special committee will provide a new level of oversight and a fresh perspective to a litigation strategy, which it said needs a radical overhaul.
Elliott also said Bayer could do more to maximize long-term value for all its stakeholders, saying the company had an opportunity to unlock more than 30 billion euros in value. 
""Elliott looks forward to the company building upon today's announcement, and making a credible commitment to the exploration of long-term value creative levers beyond the immediate litigation and governance enhancements,"" it said.
Elliott wants Bayer to resolve its litigation issues as an immediate priority and is not pushing the company to pursue deeper structural changes right away, the source said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The machinists union said on Wednesday it opposes a tentative labor contract reached this week with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, potentially impeding the Boston-based conglomerate's efforts to avoid labor unrest during a difficult period.
""Our recommendation is to reject,"" Brian Bryant, general vice president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) told Reuters. ""It's what we consider a concessionary contract."" 
The IAM, one of 11 unions representing 6,600 workers that would be covered by the deal, has workers in GE's profitable aviation and healthcare businesses, not the power unit that has dragged down GE's profits in recent years.
GE and leaders representing the unions reached the tentative four-year agreement on Monday, following 21 days of talks. The lead and largest union at GE, known as the IUE-CWA, can pass the agreement if 50 percent plus one member vote to approve it. 
""We hope that the IUE will also vote it down and lead to more negotiations,"" Bryant said. 
GE said balloting is expected to take place by July 11. The contract provides $1.80 in wage increases over four years, no medical premiums increases in 2020 and $4,500 in cash payments.
Bryant said workers would lose some overtime they now receive when starting shifts early or staying late at jet engine factories.
Paul Lalli, head of labor negotiations at GE, said in a statement on Wednesday that the company had ""achieved our goal of creating a fair deal that provides good wages and meaningful benefits for our employees while addressing the unique challenge we face today to return GE to a position of strength."" 
The company was not immediately available to comment on the IAM decision.
IUE-CWA leaders said earlier this week that they endorse the contract and will recommend it to their members. IUE-CWA leaders did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
GE has been laying off thousands of workers worldwide as it restructures in the wake of a $22.8 billion loss last year, caused largely by a write down in the power unit.

Among the unions covered by the agreement the IUE-CWA is the largest and the IAM is the second-largest. The agreement covers workers at facilities Massachusetts, Ohio, Kentucky, Kansas, New York and Wisconsin, GE said.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 02:45PM ET</span>",China's shutout of Canadian meat scrambles global pork flow,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - China's decision to block imports of Canadian meat has set off a global chain reaction in pork trading but it will do little to curb overall demand as a disease ravaging the Chinese hog herd elevates prices, industry experts say.
China said on Tuesday it wants the Canadian government to temporarily stop allowing meat shipments to China after bogus pork export certificates were discovered. 
The move disrupts a lucrative pork trade for Canada, the world's third-biggest shipper, and comes as China turns to meat imports after African swine fever killed millions of its pigs.
Canada and China are also embroiled in a dispute after the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co was detained in Vancouver on a U.S. arrest warrant. 
""It's a big loss, a huge market,"" said Martin Lavoie, CEO of Canada Pork International, an export marketing group. ""You have alternative markets but (replacing) the volume of China, that's the challenge.""
China bought C$310 million ($236.32 million) worth of Canadian pork from January through April, making it Canada's third-largest market by value. It is Canada's largest pork market by volume.
Canadian pork exporters are likely to find other buyers, such as Mexico, the United States and the Philippines, but may have to accept lower prices, Lavoie said. Canadian pork processors include Olymel, HyLife and Maple Leaf Foods.
Buyers for specialty products such as pig feet may be hard to find, Lavoie said.
In the short term, more European pork is likely to flow into China, he said. The European Union is the world's biggest pork exporter, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The United States, the second-biggest global pork exporter, is unlikely to benefit, since it is subject to a 62% Chinese tariff, said Brett Stuart, president of U.S. advisory group Global AgriTrends. 
Canadian pork that would normally ship to China could instead end up in the United States or competing with U.S. pork in Japan or South Korea, he said, but added the disruptions are unlikely to affect the direction of world prices.
“Global pork prices are moving sharply higher because of this surge in demand from China. It’s just beginning,"" Stuart said.
In Canada, though, farmers fear that the prices they receive may dip. Industry officials are concerned China's action may cost the sector C$10 million per week, said Manitoba hog farmer Rick Bergmann, chair of the Canadian Pork Council group.
China's move also applies to beef, but Canadian sales to China amounted to less than 3% of Canada's beef exports last year.
An investigation by Beijing into Canada's export certificates revealed as many as 188 ""counterfeit"" veterinary health documents and the existence of ""obvious safety loopholes,"" according to the Chinese Embassy in Canada.
Ottawa has called in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate, but the Canadian government is not convinced the fraudulent meat shipments come from Canada.

1495,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>",Stockbeat - Micron's Upbeat Outlook Lifts Gloom on Chip Stocks,"Investing.com – Micron’s better-than-expected results and news that the chipmaker had resumed shipments to Chinese telecommunications-equipment maker Huawei stoked expectations that memory demand is returning, sending chip stocks soaring higher Wednesday.
Micron (NASDAQ:MU) reported better-than-expected fiscal third quarter results and highlighted signs of recovery in global DRAM semiconductor memory demand. Shares were up more than 13%, tops among stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index. The big gain has pushed the stock up more than 13% for June and nearly 17% for the second quarter.
“We have seen early signs of bit-demand recovery in most (dynamic random access memory) end markets,” Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron’s president and chief executive, told analysts on a conference call. “Based on our assessment of customer inventory improvement, we anticipate robust bit-demand growth for the industry in the second half of the calendar year compared to the weak demand in the first half.”
The rosier outlook boosted optimism for semis on Wall Street that the worst may be over chip companies following two years of falling memory prices amid a glut in inventories.
Advanced Micro Devices (NA/SDAQ:AMD), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were about 4% higher. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed about 3.4%.
In a sign the U.S. ban on Huawei will be not be as restrictive as initially feared, Micron said it had determined it could lawfully restart shipments to the Chinese company.
That helped lift sentiment on other U.S. chip companies that count Huawei as a customer, with Qualcomm and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported to have also resumed shipments.
But some have been quick to temper the optimism, pointing to Micron’s longer inventory lead times and narrowing margin growth, which are at an 11-quarter low.
Micron ended the quarter with about 150 days of inventory on the books, compared with a peak of 100 days in the last downturn."
1496,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 02:13PM ET</span>",U.S. court to decide which of two Venezuelan boards runs Citgo Petroleum,"(Reuters) - A U.S. court will decide whether a board of directors appointed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or one backed by his rival, opposition leader Juan Guaido, runs the eighth-largest U.S. refiner, Citgo Petroleum Corp. 
A lawsuit filed on Tuesday by Maduro's administration in Delaware Chancery Court seeks to reassert its control over Citgo, along with other U.S. subsidiaries of Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA .
Citgo, Venezuela's most important foreign asset, has been caught in a tug-of-war as U.S. President Donald Trump's government has tried to use the company as leverage to topple Maduro.
The lawsuit seeks control over Citgo's nearly $30 billion in revenue by having the court recognize the five-person board handpicked by Maduro as legally appointed. 
Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled legislature, assumed a rival interim presidency in January, denouncing Maduro as a usurper who had secured re-election last year in a vote widely considered fraudulent.
In February, he appointed an ad-hoc PDVSA board with rights to nominate new directors for its U.S. units PDV Holding, Citgo Holding and Citgo Petroleum.
But Maduro, a socialist who says he is the victim of an attempted U.S.-led coup, retains the support of the armed forces and PDVSA, and still controls most state functions.
As president, he has full authority under PDVSA's bylaws to name its board of directors, the lawsuit states. It notes that the Guaido-appointed board has already been invalidated by Venezuela's Supreme Court, which remains loyal to Maduro.
Luisa Palacios assumed the position of Citgo's chairwoman under Guaido and has been running the company along with Venezuelan and U.S. executives, who are currently looking for a new CEO for the refining firm.
Citgo's previous government-appointed chief, Asdrubal Chavez, lost control of the unit and his Venezuelan board members were fired.
""PDVSA and its wholly owned subsidiaries are currently experiencing a crisis of leadership due to multiple parties asserting the right to name the board of directors,"" the Maduro administration said in the complaint filed Tuesday.
Citgo and PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
The action against the Palacios-led board seeks ""declaratory and injunctive relief to determine the proper composition"" of the boards of directors for Citgo and the other two companies.

Washington, which backs Guaido, imposed sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA in late January, aimed at curbing exports to the United States and upping the pressure on Maduro to step aside. Since then, oil shipments have declined about 40%.

1497,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 02:09PM ET</span>",Resurgent health insurer stocks face test at Democratic debates,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. health insurers that have rebounded in the past two months could come under pressure this week as Democrats square off in their first presidential debates, with healthcare policy reform potentially high on the agenda.
Support for government-run ""Medicare for All"" plans from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and other left-leaning politicians and candidates shook the stocks earlier this year, and has contributed to the overall sector's underperformance, despite the recent recovery. 
The debates take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Florida - with 10 candidates taking part each night - as Democrats vie for their party's nomination for president in 2020. Other debates are expected in July and later in the fall.
The stocks have also faced uncertainty because of changes proposed by the Trump administration involving how the industry uses drug discounts and policies regarding disclosure of hospital and physician pricing. 
Of all healthcare companies, insurer stocks have ""the most to win or lose"" from the debates, said Martin Jarzebowski, sector head of healthcare for Federated Investors. 
""They have already been hit the hardest when you looked at all of the different Medicare for All proposals,"" Jarzebowski said.
With a variety of healthcare reform ideas - some more radical than others - clouding their prospects, health insurer stocks have lagged this year. The S&P 1500 managed care sub index is up barely over 1% in 2019. That trails a 7.5% rise for the broader S&P 500 healthcare sector and the 16.5% gain for the S&P 500, a common barometer of the overall stock market.
Since mid-April, however, the S&P 1500 managed care index has climbed over 15%, through Tuesday's close, nearly doubling the increase of the overall healthcare sector over that time, while the S&P 500 has barely gained.
Among health insurer stocks over that time, Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) climbed 20%, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) rose 14% and Molina Healthcare increased nearly 25%.
Investors seem more confident that the chances are small that the 2020 elections will result in a government-run healthcare system that eliminates the role of private insurers, according to analysts.
“The markets are pretty comfortable that something like a single payer system isn’t going to happen (anytime soon),"" said Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research and consulting firm Capitol Street.

BIDEN BOUNCE
Jarzebowski also noted that the rebound in insurer shares came as former Vice President Joe Biden, who is seen as likely to favor more moderate healthcare reforms, officially entered the race and has been leading in polls.
The companies also ""printed solid numbers"" in their first-quarter results, said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
""The weakness had been more political risk than any kind of fundamental risk to their business,"" Manuelian said.
Democrats will likely focus on three healthcare policy themes, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote in a note ahead of the debates: expanding access to coverage; improving affordability; and attacking prescription drug costs.
How the health insurer stocks perform following the debates may depend on which candidates are perceived as having done well, said Michael Newshel, an analyst with Evercore ISI.
""If someone that is pounding the table for Medicare for All, no compromise, are they getting rewarded for that in the polls?"" said Newshel. ""Or is there clearly some room for some candidates to talk about incrementalism and not get punished for that?"" 
Indeed, some candidates might be more likely to embrace improvements to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a change that could be viewed more favorably than wholesale system reform.
One candidate whose position may be closely watched, according to Wilkes, is U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has gained some steam in recent polls. 
""Is she for Medicare for All or does she support building upon and expanding the ACA?"" Wilkes said.
And some proposals could benefit insurers, such as the ability for adults 55-years-old or younger to ""buy in"" to Medicare, the federal government health plan for which people now must be at least 65 to be eligible. That could particularly help insurers such as  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM), which specializes in private Medicare Advantage plans, Newshel said.

“As these stocks sold off, there hasn’t be any differentiation, in terms of their product mix,"" he said.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Autonomy founder Lynch denies wrongdoing in HP fraud case,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Mike Lynch, once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates, denied all claims against him on Wednesday when he kicked off what is expected to be a month-long testimony in his multibillion-dollar fraud battle with Hewlett-Packard (HP). 
HP is suing Autonomy founder Lynch along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion after the 2011 sale of the British company to the Silicon Valley group went disastrously wrong. HP paid $11 billion for Autonomy.
Lynch denies any wrongdoing and says HP's mismanagement was responsible for the failure of the acquisition, a deal that was designed to transform HP from a computer and printer maker into a software-focused enterprise services firm.
He was asked by HP's lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz if he had fraudulently inflated Autonomy's revenue to meet or beat market forecasts, and in the process misled auditors, the audit committee, analysts, investors and the market in general.
Lynch replied: ""That is incorrect"". 
""It's important to get some perspective,"" he said.
The 54-year-old entrepreneur, a leading light in the British tech scene who has previously held an advisory role for the government, said no one was disputing the amount of cash Autonomy was taking to the bank. 
Autonomy was ""one of the most successful companies that England had ever produced,"" he said.
HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion a year after the takeover, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. 
HP's lawyers have told the court that Autonomy inflated its true value through a series of fraudulent transactions, such as selling hardware at a loss and so-called round-trip deals - a type of barter with no real commercial rationale - masterminded by Lynch. 
HP's Rabinowitz said on Wednesday the trial needed to establish whether any underlying wrongdoing had taken place at Autonomy, and on a second level whether Lynch was responsible for any wrongdoing. 
Rabinowitz said Lynch had an iron grip on Autonomy's finances, including approving relatively small deals. He said Autonomy's auditor Deloitte had noted that Lynch wanted to approve all purchase orders over $30,000, which it said was a ""very unusual level of control"" for a FTSE 100 CEO. 
Lynch said in practice this did not happen, adding a review of emails showed he had only approved between one in 10 and two in 10 of the transactions as many were repeat contracts. 
Asked by Rabinowitz if he thought there had been any wrongdoing at the company, Lynch replied that he had ""come to learn of some examples"" where someone had behaved improperly. 

However he reiterated his defense that Autonomy had been destroyed due to management incompetence, politics and infighting at HP.

The books are covered for the full deal size, the bookrunner said. People close to the deal said earlier on Wednesday that the price range for the IPO was expected to be set at the lower end of the marketing range.
Although markets are still receptive to IPOs given low volatility, sentiment for new listings is shaky. Global Fashion Group on Wednesday drastically cut the offering price of its IPO in a last ditch bid to woo investors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Record highs in the U.S. stock market and the anticipation of equity-friendly interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year are prompting top-performing large-cap fund managers to seek out unloved stocks in hopes of further gains. 
They are now making bets on stocks ranging from financial companies like  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp that may see their margins hit by lower interest rates; cyclicals like FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) that are tied to trade with China; to healthcare companies like Teladoc Health Inc that face the risk of further regulatory overhauls after the 2020 elections. They expect that these contrarian bets will pay off at a time when the benchmark S&P 500 is on pace for its best first six months of the year since 1997. 
""You're seeing really good companies trade at valuations that are crazy cheap right now,"" said Mark Mulholland, portfolio manager of the Matthew 25 fund, which is up 28.1% since the start of the year, well above the 17.3% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time. 
Mulholland has been adding to his positions in companies including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and FedEx, and is starting to look for a natural gas pipeline company as the energy sector continues to wane, all in search of macro trends that he can buy into at a cheap price. FedEx, for instance, is part of his play on e-commerce at a time when he is avoiding traditional bricks and mortar stores. 
""In three to five years, without question, FedEx will be a player in retail to some degree"" whether through a partnership with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) or another large company, he said. 
Shares of the company are down nearly 2.5% for the year and trade at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 13.4. 
Joseph Dennison and Anthony Zackery, two of the portfolio managers of the Zevenbergen Growth Fund, said that they have been seeing opportunities in healthcare companies like diagnostics company Exact Sciences Corp and telehealth company TelaDoc Health Inc. Though both companies are up more than 25 percent for the year, volatility in the healthcare sector due to the prospects of a Democratic victory in the 2020 presidential election and a Democratic takeover of the Senate has continued to offer opportunities to add to their positions, Dennison said. 
""There are a lot of trades that happen in baskets and people don't always dig through the weeds and find the companies that are growing organically,"" said Dennison, whose fund is up 37.3% for the year. 
The broad stock market rally has been a boon for active fund managers, who are posting stronger performance numbers this year despite shedding more market share to passive index funds, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at independent research firm CFRA. Approximately 47% of large-cap active funds are beating the S&P 500 this year, compared with 36% that beat the index last year, he said. 
Brian Yacktman, whose YCG Enhanced fund is up 26.7% for the year to date, said that the market's expectations of at least two interest rate cuts over the next 12 months left financial companies at attractive valuations given their growth rates. He has been building his position in companies like Charles Schwab and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, both of which are down more than 1 percent for the year to date due to expectations that their margins will suffer as interest rates fall. 

""If the Fed does cut rates and investors push prices down further, that's no problem, we will buy more,"" he said. ""We're investing in the things that people are scared to invest in.""

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 12:04PM ET</span>",Fate of opioid litigation hinges on government 'police power',"By Mike Spector and Nate Raymond
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - The fate of thousands of lawsuits seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic hinges in part on a thorny legal question: Can a company use a bankruptcy to stop lawsuits from cities and states? 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross is expected in July to decide whether to halt more than 160 active lawsuits brought by state attorneys general, cities and counties against opioid manufacturer Insys Therapeutics Inc. When it filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware earlier this month, Insys requested the cases be paused. 
A bankruptcy filing would normally halt active litigation immediately, giving a company such as Insys time to reorganize and preserve money that would otherwise be spent fighting the cases. 
But a longstanding exception in U.S. bankruptcy law can keep the lawsuits alive if they are enforcing government officials’ “police or regulatory power.” The exception holds that government actions seeking to enforce laws related to matters such as public health and safety are not automatically stopped by a company's bankruptcy filing as other lawsuits are. 
State and local officials are suing Insys and other drugmakers in an attempt to address harm from an opioid crisis that has killed nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017. More than half these deaths resulted from prescription painkillers, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2EgfT0n
“Criminal enterprises … should not be permitted to shield themselves from the consequences of their misconduct by running to bankruptcy court and obtaining the equivalent of a stay that allows them to evade justice,” said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh in a Tuesday legal filing opposing Insys’s request to halt lawsuits. 
The opioid crisis ""is a national public health emergency,"" they said in the filing, which other state attorneys general supported, including those in New York, New Jersey and Arizona. “The interests of the public therefore are served by allowing these police powers actions of the states to continue unfettered by the injunctions that Insys seeks.”
A spokesman for Insys, which faces trials in Maryland and Minnesota beginning in August, declined to comment beyond the company's court filings. 
Insys already had reached a $225 million settlement before filing for bankruptcy with the U.S. Justice Department, admitting to illegal conduct in resolving claims that it bribed doctors to write prescriptions, including medically unnecessary ones, for a fentanyl spray called Subsys designed to treat cancer pain.
The Chandler, Arizona-based company still faces, overall, more than 1,000 lawsuits raising similar allegations of deception and fraud in marketing its opioids. The misconduct occurred under a prior management team that has since ""entirely turned over"" and Insys is now committed to lawful marketing practices, the company said in court papers.
Insys contends in bankruptcy-court filings that Judge Gross should halt the lawsuits against it regardless of any exceptions, lest the company drain limited financial resources fighting cases on multiple fronts. 
Allowing the cases to continue would leave less money for creditors, including the very government officials seeking to hold it to account, Insys contends, adding that its request is not an attempt to escape liability. 
It had less than $40 million in the bank when filing for bankruptcy and predicts spending up to $9 million through December to continue fighting lawsuits, according to court papers.
The judge’s ruling is expected to influence whether another opioid manufacturer facing 2,000 lawsuits - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP - decides to file for bankruptcy protection, according to a person familiar with the matter and legal experts. A Purdue spokesman declined to comment. 
A ruling allowing the Insys litigation to proceed could discourage Purdue from seeking bankruptcy protection, while pausing the cases might signal that Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings are a viable way to halt lawsuits and take advantage of breathing room to reach a broader settlement with plaintiffs, according to the person familiar with the matter and several legal experts.
Insys lawyers are attempting to persuade government officials to agree to voluntarily halt their cases, according to a bankruptcy-court filing. Insys is nearing a deal that would effectively halt some of those legal claims against the drugmaker that are consolidated in an Ohio federal court, said Paul Hanly, a lead lawyer for plaintiffs in the opioid litigation.
An Insys spokesman declined to comment on the potential agreement. 
Insys has some legal precedent backing its approach. In 2017, a bankruptcy judge sided with Takata Corp when temporarily halting lawsuits brought by Hawaii, New Mexico and the U.S. Virgin Islands against the Japanese supplier of automobile airbags that exploded, finding that allowing the litigation to continue threatened the company’s reorganization. That would have harmed creditors, including those seeking to hold Takata accountable for widespread deaths and injuries, the judge ruled.
The ruling allowed Takata to focus on completing a sale to a rival, creating a combined company called Joyson Safety Systems. A Joyson representative declined to comment. The Minnesota and Maryland attorneys general argued in their legal filing on Tuesday that Insys has not demonstrated the kind of exceptional circumstances present in the Takata case - an unprecedented automotive recall - that warranted halting government lawsuits.
While the outcome in the Insys case is not critical for opioid manufacturers with stronger balance sheets that face lawsuits, such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), it holds significance for the likes of OxyContin maker Purdue, according to several legal experts.
In March, Reuters reported that Purdue was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection to address lawsuits alleging it pushed prescription painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks, according to people familiar with the matter. Purdue's CEO later confirmed the company was considering a bankruptcy filing. 

The company has denied allegations it contributed to the opioid crisis, pointing to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving labels on its drugs carrying warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain.

""She hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I've ever met,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox Business Network in an apparent reference to EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Her office declined to comment.
Europe's competition authority has taken a tough stance against Google, handing down three fines totaling more than $9 billion in recent years.
In a 2017 deal with the EU, Google agreed to pay $2.7 billion to resolve claims it unfairly steered business toward its shopping platform. In March, it was fined $1.7 billion in a case focused on illegal practices in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016.
""What she does to our country. She's suing all our companies. We should be suing Google and Facebook, and all that, which perhaps we will,"" he said. ""They're suing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for billions of dollars. They're suing everybody.""
""They make it almost impossible to do two-way business,"" Trump said, reprising his frequent complaint that Europe treats the United States worse than China when it comes to trade.
The EU's antitrust system is different from that of the United States, with authorities launching investigations and then issuing rulings. Targeted companies can then challenge those rulings legally.
Trump also reiterated his view that social media companies were discriminating against conservatives.
The U.S. government is gearing up to investigate whether Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Facebook and Google misuse their massive market power, sources told Reuters earlier in June, setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world's largest companies.
""They should be sued,"" Trump said.

The White House said on Wednesday it would host a social media summit on July 11. It was not immediately clear who would be in attendance.

Consumers have been moving away from granola and snack bars, once a staple breakfast food, as they become more conscious of high sugar content in them.
To counter slowing demand for packaged food, companies have been revamping and tweaking flavors and recipes to offer consumers healthier options. 
General Mills, which makes Cheerios and Chex Mix, unveiled versions of its yogurt brands in sea salt caramel and dark chocolate raspberry flavors. It also refreshed store displays.
Still, sales of cereal and yogurt were flat in the quarter and that of snacks declined. 
""We are very focused and frankly not satisfied with the performance on both Nature Valley and Fiber One, and that's really what we need to turn around in the coming year,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said. 
Last month, Harmening noted that Fiber One, which used to be a part of the diet of half the U.S. population, is now only 2%.
The company said it would now focus on new variations of granola and snack bars, a strategy that has worked for yogurts.
""Last year our new product innovation (for Nature Valley) wasn't what we wanted it to be and we look to correct that this year,"" Harmening said in an interview with Reuters. 
Organic net sales, which excludes revenue from acquisitions, fell 2% to $2.34 billion in the quarter for its North America retail segment - its lowest in nearly three years.

Net sales rose 7% to $4.16 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $4.24 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The rise was largely fueled by a 38% increase in sales of Blue Buffalo pet foods.
The company bought Blue Buffalo last year to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on snack, cereal and yogurt businesses. It now expects Blue Buffalo's net sales to grow between 8% and 10% in fiscal 2020.

General Mills earned 83 cents per share, excluding one-time items, above the estimate of 77 cents.

Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry, once known for its phones, has pivoted to selling software such as those used in mobiles and by automakers, hoping to find a more stable source of revenue. The company also supplies technology to companies developing driverless cars.
But revenue from its Internet of Things business, which houses its enterprise software and technology solutions, rose only 5% to $137 million, coming in below estimates of $151.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""IoT appeared to have underperformed. Given (technology solutions) revenue stream is typically stable and growing, any shortfall would have been from enterprise software,"" Raymond James analyst Steven Li said.
Overall adjusted revenue rose 23% to $267 million in the first quarter, benefiting from the company's recent $1.4 billion bet on cybersecurity firm Cylance.
""Excluding Cylance, revenue was down slightly,"" Li said.
BlackBerry in February completed its acquisition of California-based Cylance, whose software uses machine learning to preempt security breaches.
In the quarter, adjusted revenue from Cylance was $51 million, above the average analyst estimate of $48.8 million.
The company's net loss narrowed to $35 million, or 9 cents per share, in the quarter ended May 31, from $60 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 1 cent per share, in line with analysts' estimates.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Senior steel industry executives on Wednesday urged the European Commission to strengthen measures to protect against a surge in imports triggered by U.S. tariffs, saying the future of the European industry was under threat, particularly in Britain.
Chief executives, including from Outokumpu, Salzgitter, and a division chief at ArcelorMittal said the EU safeguard measures have not been effective and a 5% increase in quotas from the start of July will add to pain the European industry faces.
Steel-making in Britain has particular issues as it grapples with higher energy costs than in other countries, they said, as well as the uncertainty surrounding its decision to leave the European Union.
The EU steel industry in 2018 was challenged by a 12 percent increase in imports of finished steel products in a market that grew by only 3.3 percent, industry body Eurofer said. 
The increase in imports happened despite safeguard measures designed to limit incoming steel following Washington's 25 percent import tariffs, which have effectively closed the U.S. market.
EU quotas are set at the average level of imports in 2015-2017 plus 5%, with further 5% hikes envisaged on July 1 and a year later.
The executives want the Commission, the EU executive, to scrap or postpone the 5% increase and to introduce other changes, notably to the way developing countries are treated. 
""Do you want a Europe without steelmaking or do you want a Europe that is the world leader in modern steelmaking?"" Geert van Poelvoorde, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe Flat, told reporters. ""Will it be with us or without us? This is what is at stake.""
Developing countries are exempt from the safeguards as long as their imports of a given product were not more than 3% of imports. 
But Outokumpu chief Roeland Baan said that Indonesia had in a year transformed into a ""stainless steel superpower"" and seized a 28.5% share of the EU market. 
The Commission is reviewing the scheme, with results expected in October. 
""I do believe that in October, the Commission will take into account our points and they will put that into the revision of the safeguards,"" Baan said.
The Commission had no immediate comment.
Outokumpu has operations around the world, including in Britain, which Baan said was particularly challenging because of energy costs.
""The chance of Britain not having a steel industry is real,"" he said, adding that would lead not just to the loss of thousands of jobs, but to the loss of expertise.
The industry had asked the British government for a ""steel deal"" under which industry would invest in return for help with energy costs, he said.

The British government had no immediate comment.

The protest, in the online furniture retailer's home city of Boston, marks the latest outpouring of anger over Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on illegal and legal immigration. It has drawn the support of high-profile Democrats including U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Massachusetts U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.
The 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT) walkout follows a letter signed by more than 500 employees earlier this week that said an order for more than $200,000 of bedroom furniture was destined for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas that would house migrant children seeking asylum.
It demanded that Wayfair stop selling to migrant detention camps and that it give profits of the sale, which they claim amount to $86,000, to a Texas-based non-profit agency offering legal services to immigrants.
""This is a peaceful voluntary walkout & we encourage any Wayfairians to join us,"" protest organizers said on a Twitter account named @wayfairwalkout. ""We oppose & reject the behavior of our government at the Southern (NYSE:SO) Border.""
Wayfair did not respond to a request for comment. The @wayfairwalkout account referred Reuters to the company and Reuters was not able to confirm it was created by Wayfair employees.
Wayfair management rejected the petition's demands in an internal memo on Tuesday, according to the Boston Globe.

""No matter how strongly any one of us feels about an issue, it is important to keep in mind that not all employees or customers agree.""

Criticism has mounted this week over the detention of migrant children in overcrowded, squalid conditions.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone could have an instant payments system shared by all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020, finance industry officials said, as lenders face more competition from the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other tech firms. 
Real-time payments have been possible in the 19-country currency bloc since 2017, but only about half of the euro zone's banks have joined the scheme that underpins these transactions and it is mostly used for domestic payments.
The project could now accelerate as banks feel the heat of new competitors like Facebook, which last week unveiled plans for a cryptocurrency that would offer seamless payments to its users worldwide.
""The clock is ticking,"" said Etienne Goosse, director general of the European Payments Council (EPC), that brings together large European banks, including Spain's Santander (MC:SAN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Goosse said that regardless of Facebook's success with its move into payments, big technology firms were here to stay and banks needed to move more quickly.
He said the big tech firms had the advantage of being global unlike the fragmented European banking industry.
""They come with a global solution, under a global brand offering many things that the consumers seem to find wonderful,"" Goosse said when asked about the impact of Facebook's plans for crypto currency Libra.
""So we have no time.""
The EPC standard for instant payments has so far been adopted by some 60% of lenders and payment services providers in the euro zone, Goosse said, adding that it could be spread to all banks in the bloc by the end of 2020.
Without full coverage, some bank customers could experience transaction failures if transfers involve banks outside the system, which would reduce trust in the new service, another EPC official said.
Instant payments allow transactions between individuals and businesses to complete in a matter of seconds. Traditional transfers take at least one day before the payment is credited.
CLEARING HURDLE
Other industry officials confirmed that 2020 was a credible target. But for the system to work across borders existing clearing and settlement mechanisms should cover the whole euro zone. These mechanisms make sure money is correctly transferred between parties.
Several private clearing houses use the EPC standard for instant payments like EBA Clearing, which brings together Europe's largest banks, or national counterparties like Spain's Iberpay or Italy's Nexi (MI:NEXII). 
The European Central Bank in November launched its own settlement system for real-time transactions, known as TIPS, which stands for  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Instant Payment Settlement.
But each of these different systems cover only a few dozen banks, making instant payments often impossible among lenders that are not members of the same clearing houses.
""The challenge now is to make these mechanisms interoperable,"" said Piet Mallekoote, the CEO of the Dutch Payment Association. The Netherlands has already made instant payments available to all bank customers in the country via a project backed by seven major domestic banks, including ING and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd). 
But even if a payments system is rolled out across the euro zone this may not be enough to attract customers away from fintech providers with easy to use apps.

Facebook can already tap into its established social media and chat services, but banks would need to agree on applications like mobile payments or use customers' existing payment cards to convince them to use banks' instant payment services.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian medical education group Afya SA hopes to raise at least $250 million in an initial public offering, three sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, the latest in a series of South American companies to seek U.S. listings.
The company's shares will trade on the Nasdaq in July, the sources added, requesting anonymity because discussions of the offering's size are still private.
Afya, which has been backed by Brazilian private equity firm Crescera Investimentos SA since 2016, intends to use the proceeds of the offering to acquire schools, enter new markets and develop products, according to a Monday filing, which did not mention the share offering size.
Besides raising funds to fuel Afya's growth, the company's partners intend to partially sell their stake in the educational group.
Afya, which has nearly 27,000 students, reported first-quarter net revenue of $37.1 million and net income of $12.7 million.
It will join the ranks of other listed Brazilian for-profit education companies such as Arco Platform Ltd, a seller of educational systems.
Afya will also become part of a wave of listings by high-growth Brazilian firms and tech startups in the United States, where it can take advantage of the large number of investors that specialize in fast-growing companies. That was the case of card processors StoneCo Ltd and PagSeguro Digital Ltd and Arco Platform.
Besides traditional graduation programs, Afya offers continuing medical education through digital and physical channels.
Investment banking units of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), UBS Group AG, Banco BTG Pactual SA, XP Investimentos SA and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) will manage the share offering.
Plans for IPO were first reported by Reuters in April.
Afya did not immediately comment on the matter.

1525,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",FedEx Rises as Courier Sees E-Commerce Gain in `Transition Year’,"(Bloomberg) -- FedEx (NYSE:FDX) climbed as the courier predicted a “transition year’’ for fiscal 2020, with an improving outlook for e-commerce profits tempered by concerns over international trade tensions.
Revenue per package in the ground-delivery operation rose 2.2% in the quarter ending May 31 as volume growth accelerated to 8.8%, FedEx said in a statement late Tuesday. That signaled progress in the courier’s push to extract higher profits from the surge in home deliveries driven by online shopping.
FedEx is stepping up efforts to become the low-cost provider of e-commerce deliveries, paring jobs and partnering with companies such as  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG). to add pickup and drop-off sites. But FedEx is struggling to shore up its Express air-delivery division -- the unit most threatened by escalating trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China.
“The utilization of the ground network and the opportunity they feel that they have with e-commerce to significantly grow is the positive that people are taking out of this,” said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, which owns FedEx shares. “But certainly, we didn’t hear anything positive about China. We didn’t hear anything positive about Europe.”
The shares advanced 2.1% to $159.25 before the start of regular trading Wednesday in New York. The shares had dropped 3.3% this year through Tuesday, while rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). was little changed and a Standard & Poor’s index of industrial companies advanced 19%.
Weak Forecast
FedEx has been struggling to keep up with Wall Street’s expectations as the company pours money into making deliveries more efficient and struggles with a cloudy trade outlook.
Adjusted earnings for the current fiscal year will drop by “a mid-single-digit percentage” from $15.52 a share in the year just ended, FedEx said in the statement. Analysts were expecting $16.15 in fiscal 2020 -- an estimate that had already been whittled down from $20 about six months ago.
“Our fiscal 2020 performance is being negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production, especially at FedEx Express,” said Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf.
That impact extended a longstanding sense of frustration at FedEx with President Donald Trump’s willingness to stoke trade tensions, said Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith.
“Clearly, we’ve been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade, particularly with the Trump administration,” Smith said on a conference call with analysts and investors. “We have become a protectionist country.”
New Weapon
FedEx fired a new weapon in the simmering U.S.-China trade war this week, suing the Trump administration to block enforcement of trade restrictions that have placed the company in Beijing’s crosshairs.The federal lawsuit came after the White House barred U.S. companies from selling technology to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.
While trying to comply, FedEx employees mistakenly flagged packages involving Huawei. Now China is considering adding the courier to a list of so-called unreliable entities.
E-Commerce Challenge
Closer to home, the next 12 months will be pivotal for FedEx as it seeks to stem the decline in profit margins at the company’s ground unit. Recent moves include extending deliveries to seven days a week and reducing reliance on the U.S. Postal Service.
FedEx’s Express business cut ties with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). as the largest online retailer muscles into the delivery business. FedEx said it would focus on more profitable customers.
The challenge for FedEx -- and UPS -- is that deliveries to homes, where drivers often handle a single package at each stop, tend to be less profitable than business deliveries, where they might pick up or drop off several parcels.
“Fiscal year 2020 is in many ways a transition year for FedEx as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e-commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our cost to serve in the U.S.,” said Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Subramaniam.
Those efforts are softening the blow from the weak profit forecast for fiscal 2020 -- but the pressure will remain on FedEx to show sustained gains from the rise of online shopping.
“FedEx is not out of the woods,” Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note to investors, “but base expectations are lower and if there is any shift towards a more optimistic macro environment, we expect shares to move higher from current levels.”

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 07:25AM ET</span>",Airlines and regulators meet to discuss Boeing 737 MAX un-grounding efforts,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airlines and regulators are gathering at a closed-door summit in Montreal on Wednesday to exchange views on steps needed for a safe and coordinated return of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX jets to the skies following two deadly crashes.
The meeting, organized by industry trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA), comes as airlines grapple with the financial impact of a global grounding of nearly 400 737 MAX jets that has lasted three months. 
Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, has yet to formally submit proposed 737 MAX software and training updates to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which will kick-start a re-certification process that could take weeks.
IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac has said ""shoring up trust among regulators and improving coordination"" within an industry that grounded the MAX planes on different dates in March would be priorities at Wednesday's summit.
It is the second such meeting organized by IATA.
China was first to ground the MAX after a March 10 crash in Ethiopia within five months of a similar crash off Indonesia, killing a combined 346 people, while the United States and Canada were the last. 
Regulators including Transport Canada, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the FAA will join airlines at the meeting, representatives from the authorities told Reuters.
Once regulators approve the MAX for flight, airlines must remove the jets from storage and implement new pilot training, a process that will differ for each airline but that U.S. carriers have said will take at least one month.
Some airlines and regulators have argued that pilots should be trained in a MAX simulator before flying, though Boeing's minimum training requirements do not call for flight simulators, according to draft proposals.
""Training is up to each regulator. When the MAX returns to the skies, with the updated software and required training, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,"" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said. 
Boeing's software fix is meant to make a system known as MCAS, which played a role in both crashes, less powerful. 
Still, Air Canada has said its 400 MAX pilots, about 10 percent of its pilot force, will train in the simulator. Air Canada is the only North American carrier that currently owns the MAX simulator. 

U.S. carriers have discussed putting pilots in scenarios similar to the 737 MAX crashes as part of recurring training.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Woodford learned little from financial crisis: UK lawmaker,"By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Neil Woodford, one of Britain's best-known money managers, appears to have failed to learn lessons about risk from the financial crisis a decade ago, a lawmaker said on Wednesday, echoing criticism by regulators of his strategy.
The 3.7 billion pound ($4.7 billion) LF Woodford Equity Income Fund was frozen on June 3 because it could not meet redemption requests and has since said it will switch to investing in larger, listed companies.
Hundreds of thousands of small savers have money tied up in the fund, which analysts say could be frozen for months.
Neil Woodford's use of illiquid assets shows ""he seems to have learnt little from the financial crisis"", lawmaker Nicky Morgan, chair of parliament's Treasury Select Committee, told an Investment Association conference on Wednesday.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, said on Tuesday that Woodford had taken full advantage of flawed European Union laws in investing in unlisted or barely traded stocks, totaling a fifth of the fund's investments at the time of suspension.
""There will at the very least be a reassessment of rules around liquid assets and illiquid assets with respect to funds,"" said Julian Roberts, analyst at Jefferies, adding that it was possible that the fund could close. 
In line with Bailey's testimony to the committee on Tuesday, Morgan told conference delegates that had a more flexible principles-based system been in place to regulate UK retail funds, Woodford's fund may not have pushed liquidity limits.
Morgan also said she would back tighter regulation of 'best buy lists' used by fund supermarkets such as  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), which has 300,000 clients exposed to the suspended fund. It had the fund in its best buy list until the day of suspension. 
STAKE SALES
Woodford is on the verge of appointing PJT Park Hill, a division of the investment bank PJT Partners Inc, to offload stakes in private companies such as Atom Bank and Oxford Nanopore, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters late on Tuesday.
The equity income fund only publishes its top 10 holdings but British biotech firm Oxford Nanopore was its 9th biggest holding at end-May, making up 3% of the portfolio. Hedge funds would be likely buyers of the fund's biotech assets, one industry source said.
Woodford has sold nearly 200 million pounds in the fund's UK listed assets to meet the fund's redemption requests, which include a demand from Kent County Council, in southern England, for the return of a 263 million pound investment by its pension fund. The fund suspension will be reviewed on July 1.
Woodford also had a 7% stake in WeBuyAnyCar owner BCA Marketplace, which received an offer for 1.91 billion pounds on Wednesday from private equity firm TDR Capital, boosting its shares. 
Assets under management in Woodford's other open-ended fund, the income focus fund, have fallen below 300 million pounds, down 38% since June 3, according to Morningstar data. Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity International have cut investment in the fund, although it does not have unlisted assets.

Woodford's only listed fund, Woodford Patient Capital Trust, which has heavy investments in unlisted stocks, is trading near record lows but was up 0.15% at 0952 GMT.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 06:36AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Switzerland and the EU face a battle of the bourses,"By Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) - A row over a stalled partnership treaty between Switzerland and the European Union is about to touch off a battle over share trading rules that could cause market ructions across Europe from July 1.
The pact with Switzerland that Brussels has sought for a decade and which was negotiated over 4-1/2 years would effectively cement the non-EU member state's participation in the EU single market, the biggest outlet for Swiss exports.
But political resistance to the treaty in Switzerland has held up the process. As a result, a frustrated EU says it will not recognize the Swiss stock market's rules as ""equivalent"" to its own beyond the end of June.
The Swiss government has responded with countermeasures, including a new system from July 1 that requires foreign stock exchanges to get Swiss permission to host trading in Swiss stocks.
Wilful, as well as negligent, violations of the Swiss requirements could result in criminal charges and even jail.
WHAT THE NEW RULES MEAN
The EU's decision not to recognize the Swiss stock market regulations' so-called equivalency beyond the end of June will effectively prevent EU-based banks and brokers from trading on Swiss exchanges. They traditionally generate more than half the turnover on Swiss stock markets.
The new Swiss regime, which aims to head off a possible liquidity crunch and to steer share trading to Swiss markets, requires foreign exchanges to get Swiss permission to host trading in Swiss stocks. Trading venues outside the EU would get a green light to carry on as before.
Barring an unlikely last-minute deal, pan-European stock trading platforms Aquis Exchange Plc, Cboe Europe and the London Stock Exchange will not be able to host trading in Swiss equities from July 1.
Such venues host a third of Swiss equities trading volume.
WHO COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE SWISS BAN?
Foreign trading venues, including stock exchanges and so-called multilateral trading facilities will be affected. Switzerland will let them host trading in Swiss-registered companies like Nestle, Roche and Novartis only if the foreign venues' regulations do not curb trading of Swiss stocks in Switzerland.
Markets outside the EU will not be affected. Once Brexit takes effect, British share trading platforms could be certified provided their regulation does not interfere with trading on Swiss markets.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO VIOLATORS?
Wilful and negligent violations of the Swiss rules could result in criminal charges. Sanctions can target foreign trading venues as well as their management or board of directors. Intentional violations can trigger imprisonment of up to three years or a fine; negligence could be punished with a fine.
WHY IS THE EU-SWISS TREATY SO CONTROVERSIAL?
The Swiss/EU deal would have Switzerland routinely adopt changes to single market rules. It would also create a more effective platform to resolve trade disputes and open a path to new trade deals such as an electricity union.
The pact would be an over-arching accord above a patchwork of 120 separate deals that already govern bilateral Swiss/EU ties and which emerged after Swiss voters in 1992 rejected plans to join the European Economic Area. These individual agreements were crafted when Switzerland still aimed to join the EU, a goal it has since dropped.
But the trade deal has become tangled up in domestic politics in Switzerland, which has parliamentary elections on Oct. 20. Those opposed to the EU trade deal range from the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) to the center-left Social Democrats (SP) and their allied labor unions.
The anti-EU SVP resents giving Brussels any say in Swiss affairs, while the left is dead set against diluting Swiss labor rules meant to protect Europe's highest wages from potential cut-rate EU workers on temporary cross-border assignments. That is a key demand from Brussels, which wants to avoid being soft on the Swiss with a potentially messy Brexit looming.
HOW LONG MIGHT THE STANDOFF LAST?
In theory, indefinitely, but both sides have said they are open to talks to break the logjam. In effect, the next deadline for Switzerland to sign the treaty and start the ratification process is the end of October.
That is when European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a self-declared Swiss ally, leaves office and when a no-deal Brexit seems increasingly likely. But Swiss officials say there is no point signing a deal that is doomed to fail in parliament or get shot down by voters under the Swiss system of direct democracy.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen's truck unit Traton is expected to price its initial public offering (IPO) this week toward the lower end of the marketing range, people close to the matter said.
While demand is sufficient for the stock market flotation to go through, investors are cautious on price, they said.
""Investors are taking advantage of the fact that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) needs to show progress in its corporate restructuring after calling off the IPO in March and relaunching it now,"" one of the people said.
Books are oversubscribed for all the shares on sale, two people said.
Traton declined to comment, while Volkswagen had no immediate comment.
Markets are still receptive to IPOs as volatility remains at relatively low levels, although roughly where it stood in March when Volkswagen pulled the previous IPO attempt, citing market uncertainty.
Global Fashion Group on Tuesday delayed its listing amid subdued investor demand.
Volkswagen said earlier this month it aimed to raise 1.55-1.9 billion euros ($1.8-$2,2 billion) by selling 10%-11.5% of Traton, having scaled back earlier ambitions to list up to a 25% stake.
It has set a 27-33 euros per share price range, which would value Traton at Traton at 13.5-16.5 billion euros, a discount to some industry peers.

The carmaker plans to invest proceeds in transforming its auto production as it readies the launch of dozens of electric vehicles over the coming years and deepens an alliance with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) is expected to seek to permanently shut its oil refinery in the city after a massive fire caused substantial damage to the complex, two sources familiar with the plans said on Tuesday.
Shutting the refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, would cost hundreds of jobs and squeeze gasoline supplies in the busiest, most densely populated corridor of the United States.
The refinery, which could still change its plans, is also expected to begin layoffs of the 700 union workers at the plant as early as Wednesday, the sources said. The layoffs could include about half of the union workforce, with the remaining staff staying at the site until the investigation into the blast concludes, the sources said.
PES is expected to file a notice of intent with state and federal regulators as early as Wednesday, setting in motion the process of closing the refinery, the sources said. 
A spokesperson for Philadelphia Energy Solutions on Tuesday night declined to comment on the potential closure and layoffs.
The 335,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) complex, located in a densely populated area in the southern part of the city, erupted in flames in the early hours on Friday, in a series of explosions that could be heard miles away. 
The cause of the fire was unknown as of Tuesday, though city fire officials said it started in a butane vat around 4 a.m. (0800 GMT). It destroyed a 30,000-bpd alkylation unit that uses hydrofluoric acid to process refined products. Had the acid caught fire, it could have resulted in a vapor cloud that can damage the skin, eyes and lungs of nearby residents.
Before the fire, the refinery had suffered from years of financial struggles, forcing it to slash worker benefits and scale back capital projects to save cash. It went through a bankruptcy process last year to reduce its debt, but its difficulties continued as its cash on hand dwindled even after emerging from bankruptcy in August.
After bankruptcy,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Asset Management and Bardin Hill became the controlling owners, with former primary owners  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and Sunoco Logistics, an Energy Transfer subsidiary, holding a minority stake. 
Workers were picking up large debris out of nearby waterways on Monday, according to pictures seen by Reuters, while other pictures showed the charred remains of control rooms and burned components.
The blaze was the second in two weeks at the complex, spurring calls from Philadelphia's mayor for a task force to look into both the cause and community outreach in the wake of the incidents. A spokesperson for Mayor Jim Kenney declined to comment on the potential closure of the plant.
Investigators on the scene are dealing with unstable structures that need to be certified by engineers, slowing down the inquiry, city officials said. The investigation could ultimately take months or perhaps years, they said. 
The state Department of Environmental Protection said they have concerns about the integrity of storage tanks on site, the agency said on Tuesday. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board is also investigating the incident.
U.S. gasoline futures rose as much as 5.4% on Wednesday to $1.9787 a gallon, the highest since May 23. The front month price was at $1.945 at 0551 GMT. Futures are up 8.9% since Thursday's close. 
The rally in U.S. gasoline futures has pushed U.S. gasoline prices above European and Asian markets, raising the prospects for U.S. imports. 

“Chances are that (the wider price spread) could open up the arbs between U.S. Gulf/Europe and PADD 1,“ said Matthew Chew, principal oil analyst at IHS Markit, referring to the Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) 1, the designation the U.S. government uses for the East Coast in its weekly oil storage report.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 05:08AM ET</span>","Fed's Powell resists pressure for hefty rate cut, sends global stocks down","By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks fell while the dollar rose on Wednesday as comments from U.S. Federal Reserve dampened excitement about an aggressive rate cut as early as July from the world's most important central bank. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard on Tuesday pushed back on market expectations and presidential pressure for a significant U.S. interest rate cut of half a percentage point as soon as its next meeting. 
Powell said the central bank is ""insulated from short-term political pressures"". But he said he and his colleagues are currently grappling with whether uncertainties around U.S. tariffs, Washington's conflict with trading partners and tame inflation require a rate cut.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3% to its lowest level in a week, while Germany's Dax was down 0.15%.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.16%, while U.S. futures indicated a flat to lower open. 
The dollar rebounded and gold prices retreated after Powell's comments which pulled the dollar up from three-month lows against a basket of other currencies in the previous session at 95.843. It was up 0.1% at 96.273.
Equity markets have rallied this month in anticipation that Fed policymakers would cut rates, but Powell's remarks cast doubt on those expectations when he referred to the Fed's independence. 
According to latest data from CME Group's FedWatch program, federal funds futures implied that traders now see a 27% chance of the Fed lowering rates by half a percentage point in July, compared to 42% on Monday.
However, not all see the comments as evidence of a policy u-turn. Richard Dias, multi asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said the Fed had effectively backed itself into a corner, making a cut in July or September highly likely. 
""They are in a weird dichotomy, so many cuts are priced in and the market has rallied on this news and the bond market has rallied so if they don't deliver what they have telegraphed, their credibility will be impinged,"" he said, adding that he expected a cut of 25 basis points.
""They would never do 50 bps, we are not in a recession,"" he said. 
A modest sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, which often sets the tone for other major bond markets, failed to have much of a spill over into the euro zone. Ten-year Treasuries fell to 1.98% on Tuesday, before rising to above 2% on Wednesday.
European bond yields remained pinned to all-time lows, unmoved by the apparent shift in tone from the Fed. Germany's 10-year benchmark bond yield held around -0.32%. 
And with the seemingly insatiable bid for bonds continuing, Austria opened books on a 100-year bond, a tap of its existing September 2117. 
Market hopes are also pinned on progress in an ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China.
The U.S. hopes to re-launch trade talks with Beijing after Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping meet in Japan during the G20 summit on Saturday but Washington will not accept any conditions on tariffs, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.
Pictet's Dias said he did not expect an immediate resolution.
""Everyone is desperate for a deal, but why would they do it then? It is a lot more than just trade, trade is a red herring, what matters is technology and I don't know how we are going to agree on this,"" he said. ""What incentive does Donald Trump have to do a deal now anyway, it is better to drag it out until before the election and show a big win.""
Gold pulled back from the almost six-year highs hit on Tuesday amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, slipping more than 1% on Wednesday.
The New Zealand dollar edged higher after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) stood pat on monetary policy, keeping rates at a record low 1.50%. But the kiwi's gains were limited as the central bank expressed concern towards economic risks at home and abroad.
""Overall, today's announcement provides a strengthened signal that another cut is coming, most likely soon, unless there is a marked improvement in the global outlook,"" wrote economists at HSBC.
The kiwi last traded 0.2% higher at $0.6651.

U.S. crude oil futures advanced roughly 2% to touch a four-week high of $59.10 per barrel after data showed a decline in U.S. crude stocks.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 05:07AM ET</span>",Japan watchdog to recommend $24 million fine for Nissan over Ghosn pay: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's markets watchdog will likely recommend that the financial regulator fine Nissan Motor Co up to 4 billion yen ($37 million) over the alleged underreporting of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn's compensation, a source said. 
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) will likely recommend the fine on the basis that Ghosn's alleged underreported salary had a ""significant"" impact on investor decisions regarding the company, the source said, declining to be identified.
A spokesman for the SESC declined to comment on specific cases, while Nissan was not immediately available for comment. 
The SESC is expected to formally start its investigation before the end of the month, when it examines Nissan's latest annual filings, the source said. 
If Nissan files documentation to the SESC before the formal investigation begins and recognizes that previous reporting was incorrect, it may receive a reduced fine of around 2.4 billion yen, the source said.
Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo in November over allegations of financial misconduct, including understating his salary by around 9.1 billion yen ($84.71 million) over a period of nearly a decade and temporarily transferring personal financial losses to the books of Nissan, Japan's No. 2 automaker. 
Since then, he has also been accused of enriching himself by around $5 million at Nissan's expense. 
Ghosn, who has been released from detention pending his trail, denies all of the charges.
The fine, which was earlier reported by domestic media, would cover a four-year period through March 2018, the source said. Due to the statute of limitations, Nissan is not liable for any underreporting before that period.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are treading water after early trading on Wednesday, with one eye already on the weekend’s G20 summit meeting that will show how much, or how little, the U.S. and China care about ending their trade dispute.
A report by Bloomberg that the U.S. is willing to cancel tariffs on $300 billion worth of previously unaffected imports from China, which are scheduled to come into force next week, has eased concerns about an immediate escalation of the dispute, but has not been enough to encourage much new risk-taking ahead of the weekend.
By the same token, markets have read mixed messages into a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the European close on Tuesday, in which Powell defended the principle of central bank independence – a sign of his unwillingness to take orders from President Trump on where interest rates should be set – but otherwise reaffirmed the Fed’s bias toward easing if the economy shows any further sign of slowing.
By 4:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the main indexes were mixed, ranging from a 0.3% drop in Switzerland a to a similar-sized rise in Spain. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.2% at 382.64, on course for a fourth straight day of – admittedly relatively modest – losses.
Among the notable blue-chip movements, industrial group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) was up over 5% on a report in the German newsletter Platow-Brief that Finland's KONE (HE:KNEBV) is preparing a bid for its elevator business, a deal that would unlock much of the value in the group.
Tobacco stocks were relatively unmoved by news that San Francisco had become the first U.S. city to ban vaping, a move that, if replicated elsewhere across the U.S., could seriously dent demand for the industry’s great hope for the future.  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) was down 0.4%, but Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) was up 0.9%.
And Europe’s oil and gas stocks were broadly higher after the American Petroleum Institute reported a large draw in U.S. crude inventories last week, adding to indications that oil prices may be finding a floor after a steep drop in the second quarter.  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) were both up 0.5%, while Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) led the way with a 1.0% gain."

With the financial crisis almost a decade behind, a continued “biting headwind” of new rules set by financial watchdog Finma and other regulators is a drag on profitability, he said.
“The majority of foreign analysts and investors find the Swiss system increasingly difficult to understand,” Ermotti said late Tuesday in a speech in Zurich. “The Swiss finish has gone from being a seal of approval to a burden.”
Switzerland’s Finance Ministry is weighing tougher capital requirements for the biggest firms playing a key role in the financial system, a move backed by the Swiss National Bank. Strict capital rules -- which build on international standards and are known as the “Swiss finish” -- have proved a thorn in the side of the nation’s biggest banks as they shift into growth mode after years of painful restructurings.
UBS (NYSE:UBS) was little changed little changed as of 9:04 a.m. in Zurich.
Its not the first time Ermotti has taken aim at local regulation. In 2017, the CEO told Bloomberg Markets that “people should never take things for granted,” including staying in Switzerland. Ermotti has led UBS since 2011, a time during which he trimmed down huge trading floors at Switzerland‘s largest bank and steered the institution increasingly towards wealth management.
“Big is bad, small is good,” Ermotti said was the message he received from regulators. “I am criticizing the constant fear-mongering.”

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 04:37AM ET</span>","Singapore aims to create 10,000 tech jobs in three years","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore on Wednesday said it has plans to create up to 10,000 jobs in the technology sector over three years in an initiative to establish the city-state as a global hub for the industry.
The plan will be spearheaded by a new government office called Digital Industry Singapore (DISG), which consolidates efforts by various existing public bodies to encourage investment from foreign tech firms, support local business, and work with the industry to shape future policy. 
Armed with lucrative grants and incentives, the island nation has in recent years been focusing on tech firms, investors and top talent - a sector that could help combat some of the slowest growth rates the city-state has seen in a decade. 
""DISG will seek to achieve our mission to establish Singapore as a global-Asia technology hub,"" said Kiren Kumar, chief digital industry officer, DISG.
The new government office expects to create up to 10,000 jobs within the technology sector over the next three years including roles in engineering, software development and finance.
DISG also said it will assist companies in areas such as ride-hailing, e-commerce, fintech, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. 
While Singapore's low taxes, political stability and robust legal system and infrastructure have attracted foreign firms for decades, a recently passed fake news law has put it at odds with the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) who fear it could hinder free speech and innovation.

Despite large investments, Singapore only has one local ""unicorn"" - a start-up worth over $1 billion - in ride-hailing firm Grab, according to research firm CBInsights, while neighboring Indonesia has four.

(Reuters) - European shares fell for the fourth straight session on Wednesday, as bets on an aggressive half-point cut in U.S. interest rates next month collapsed following a more measured than expected message from Federal Reserve officials.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the central bank is ""insulated from short-term political pressures"", pushing back on pressure from President Donald Trump to cut interest rates and saying a cut next month is not locked in.
Markets still firmly expect the U.S. central bank to ease policy but comments from Powell and others were enough to weaken bets on the decisive new support for growth that has driven stock markets 4% higher this month.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3% by 0756 GMT. Banking stocks, which unlike consumers, retailers or manufacturers tend to benefit from higher interest rates, outperformed.
""There is a lot of digesting of Fed commentary from last night. Both Powell and (St Louis Fed chief James) Bullard poured cold water over expectations for a more than 25 bps rate cut in July,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities in London.
""If you look at expectations for the full year we're still at around three rate cuts, so the longer picture is unchanged, it's the dialing back of some of the expectations which is partly behind the reason for the rotations we're seeing.""
European markets saw their biggest sell-off in more than two years in May, hit by a cocktail of concerns over trade tensions, the global economic cycle and Brexit, and traders say the mood is still shaky. 
The next big set piece is this weekend's G20 summit, starting on Friday, eyed for a return to top level talks between the United States and China on the trade tensions that have dominated stock market thinking for the past year. 
One bright spot was better-than-expected results overnight for one of the chip world's big players, U.S.-based Micron (NASDAQ:MU) Technologies. That supported semiconductor companies globally, with European players Infineon, Siltronic, and Ams AG up between 0.7% and 3.5%.
""That's a relief move but I'm not sure if it's going to have huge amount of legs going forward unless the European chipmakers can say something similar in their outlook as we go through earnings season,"" Taylor said. 
Energy stocks gained 0.5%, posting the biggest gains among major European sectors, as oil prices rose 1% in the face of worries about U.S.-Iran relations.
German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) gained 3%, and was among the biggest gainers on the main index, on a report of a possible offer from Kone for the company's elevator business.

Following closely behind, Adidas (DE:ADSGN) rose 2.4% after Berenberg raised its rating on the sporting goods company's shares to ""buy"".

""The Renault-Nissan alliance is a jewel in the industry,"" Macron told French expatriates in Tokyo. 
""We created a giant which we must not only preserve but develop synergies and alliances to strengthen it in the face of international competition."" 
His comments appeared to leave open the possibility both of a deeper integration of the 20-year-old Renault-Nissan alliance, which has been shaken by the scandal over its former chief Carlos Ghosn, and tie-ups with other manufacturers.
Last month,  Renault  and Italian-American group Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced they were in merger talks. But the discussions were called off after FCA grew frustrated with the role the French state was playing, especially its need to secure agreement from Nissan over how to move the merger forward.
Since the break-off of the FCA talks, Renault executives have been looking to rebuild ties with Nissan, which is keen to reduce the influence the French state has in the alliance via its 15% stake in Renault.
Renault owns 43% of the Japanese automaker, which in turn holds a 15%, non-voting stake in its partner.

Nissan on Tuesday threw cold water on hopes for a quick fix to strained relations with France's Renault SA (PA:RENA), saying inequality between the partners could unravel their two-decade-old automaking alliance.

Lionel Desclee, who was hired earlier this year as CEO of Walmart Japan, said in a speech to employees on Wednesday that Walmart would remain invested in Seiyu.
""We also have a longer-term aspiration to list a minority stake of our business in Japan,"" he said in a speech, according to a Walmart Japan statement.
""We believe a Japan listing would empower Seiyu to accelerate the journey of building a strong, innovative local value retailer both in-stores and online, while still enjoying the benefits of being powered by Walmart,"" he was also quoted as saying. No time-frame for a listing was mentioned. 
Walmart first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6 percent stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008.
But Japan has proven a difficult market for Walmart and other foreign entrants such as  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) PLC and  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA. Japanese media reported last year that Walmart considered selling Seiyu, and that a sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.69 billion to $4.48 billion).
Consumers in Japan demand fresh food and efficient customer service, and the country's supermarket industry is highly competitive and its margins razor thin after years of deflation.
Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, was also quoted in the statement as supporting a potential public listing of Seiyu with Walmart retaining majority ownership.

Under Walmart, Seiyu has closed unprofitable stores. It also teamed up with Rakuten Inc last year to launch an online grocery venture, facing off against rivals such as Amazon's Fresh service.

Formerly known as Fred. Olsen Energy, Dolphin had debt of just over $1 billion at the end of 2018 and a net loss for the year of almost $300 million, according to its annual report.
Once a dominant supplier of drilling rigs to oil and gas firms exploring the North Sea, Dolphin was hit hard by the a collapse in oil prices from 2014 to 2016 as well as competition from newcomers that drove down rig rates.
Failure to forge a consensus among creditors will likely lead banks and other secured lenders to decide the company's fate, including potential asset sales.
Major lenders include Danske Bank, DNB, SEB and Swedbank, as well as funds advised by Strategic Value Partners LLC and its affiliates.
""Regretfully, the creditors of Dolphin Drilling ASA have not been able to agree on the terms for a consensual restructuring, and the secured creditors have demanded payment of all amounts outstanding under the secured debt of the company,"" Dolphin said in a statement.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 02:50AM ET</span>","Chinese developers tap PE funds, securitization as bond financing tightens","By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese developers are increasingly tapping alternate options to raise cash, including private-equity (PE) funds and securitization tied to commercial properties, as regulators tighten the screws on popular financing channels. 
While resorting to alternate channels will put more pressure on funding costs, developers said the move comes as Beijing is slowing approvals for onshore and offshore bond issuances to curb aggressive bidding for land, after premiums paid spiked in the first quarter.
Approvals for asset-backed securities packaging different receivables, another popular financing channel, were also tightened a few weeks ago, homebuilders said.
Even though most major developers have already acquired the quota needed for bond issuance at the start of the year and ""are not short in credits"", they still need to ""keep looking for different ways to raise funds"", said an official at a developer.
""Developers cannot rely on just one or two channels,"" he added, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. ""The industry has always been playing this game; regulators close one door, we find another open door."" 
The developer he works for is planning to launch commercial mortgage-backed securities and has also submitted an application to form a real estate investment trust. 
Regulations in China on securitization linked to commercial properties have not been tightened yet as it is not popular among residential developers who do not own a large commercial portfolio. 
Another developer said it plans to invest in more projects via onshore private-equity funds this year.
The cost is higher than bond financing, but it would help lower the company's gearing, said the developer, which did not want to be named as the plans are not yet public.
PRIVATE-EQUITY FUNDS
Financing via private-equity funds is, however, not limited to onshore. China Evergrande Group raised a $100 million fund in Hong Kong last month specifically for a redevelopment project in the southwest city of Guiyang, according to a presentation document seen by Reuters.
While financing via offshore funds is not uncommon for Evergrande, it is rare among major players, analysts said.
Evergrande is the third-largest developer in China by sales, after Country Garden and Vanke.
""When the traditional channels are tightened, more developers seek this kind of project financing,"" CRIC Hong Kong's head of research, David Hong, said.
""Cost of the alternative channels is more expensive ... some small to mid-sized developers may go back to trust loan, but the problem is its cost is too high, raising the financing risk.""
The Chinese securities regulator did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment on financing curbs for developers.
Analysts and developers, however, do not see a financing squeeze lasting much longer, as they expect a weaker economic growth exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war and lower land premiums in the coming months to prompt Beijing to ease curbs. 

""There's a lot of variables to the trade war between China and the U.S.; when big uncertainties happen again, the central government may loosen up the tightening on the real estate sector,"" CRIC's Hong said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Tuesday confirmed that it has acquired self-driving shuttle firm Drive.ai.
Technology news website The Information reported earlier this month that the iPhone maker was considering acquiring the firm as a move to bring aboard some of its engineering talent to boost Apple's own self-driving efforts.
One of hundreds of startups pursuing autonomous vehicles, Drive.ai had been running a small fleet of test shuttles in Texas, The Information reported. But the startup told California regulators that it plans to lay off 90 people in a permanent closure. The San Francisco Chronicle earlier reported the closure.
In Silicon Valley, it is common for larger companies to acquire struggling startups primarily to hire their engineers, a move known in the industry as an ""acqui-hire."" 
Apple is vying against rivals such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo to develop self-driving vehicles. In the past year, Apple has revamped its efforts, bringing former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc engineering chief Doug Field to oversee the operation, which includes more than 5,000 workers.

Apple is also working on key components such as sensors in addition to holding talks with potential suppliers.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 09:17PM ET</span>",Longtime Trump aide Stephanie Grisham will succeed Sanders as press secretary,"By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Stephanie Grisham, communications director for first lady Melania Trump and a longtime aide to President Donald Trump, will succeed Sarah Sanders as White House press secretary, Mrs. Trump announced on Tuesday.
Melania Trump announced the development in a tweet to conclude the president's search for a press secretary after Sanders decided to resign and go back home to Arkansas earlier this month.
Grisham, 42, a fixture in the Arizona Republican Party, was one of Trump's first hires for his presidential campaign - as a press aide in 2015.
She served as a deputy press secretary in the White House when he took office in January 2017 and eventually moved over to the first lady's operation, and she has been fiercely loyal to the Trumps.
A clue that the president was leaning toward Grisham for the job came when aides said she had been added to the White House team going with Trump to the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, and Seoul, South Korea, this week.
The fact that Mrs. Trump announced the appointment, instead of the president himself, showed that the first lady was willing to part with Grisham.
Grisham will have the dual role of press secretary and communications director. Sanders had essentially been doing both roles as well, without the communications director title.
Melania Trump's tweet said: ""I am pleased to announce @StephGrisham45 will be the next @PressSec & Comms Director! She has been with us since 2015 - @potus & I can think of no better person to serve the Administration & our country. Excited to have Stephanie working for both sides of the @WhiteHouse. #BeBest""
Grisham was viewed internally as the candidate with the best rapport with President Trump, a key requirement.
Trump told reporters he offered Grisham the job on Tuesday morning.
""I think she's going to do a great job,"" he said. ""It's a big job. It's a very big job.""
With his tweets and multiple exchanges with reporters, Trump is in many ways his own press secretary and communications director, and Sanders' role grew to being a senior adviser.
There have been some internal discussions about bringing back the daily press briefing but whether Trump would allow it remained unclear. He all but ended the practice and it has been more than three months since the last one.
The other top candidate had been Sanders' principal deputy press secretary, Hogan Gidley. The president said Gidley had recommended Grisham for the job, and that Gidley will be staying in his deputy role. 
Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, had been considered as well but was in the midst of a move home to New York. Former State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert withdrew herself from consideration.
Michael Anton, former spokesman at the National Security Council, had also been under consideration.
Gidley tweeted his congratulations to Grisham.
""Amazing announcement! So proud and blessed to have my good friend @StephGrisham45 working with our team. She is a rockstar and perfect to fill Sarah’s shoes!"" he said.
Sanders is contemplating a political future in Arkansas, considering a 2022 run for state governor, a position once held by her father, Republican Mike Huckabee.
The New York Times said Grisham in 2013 was charged with driving under the influence, speeding and driving with an invalid license, charges that were reduced in 2014.
The Times said Grisham was pulled over again in Arizona in December 2015 and charged with driving under the influence, and pleaded guilty, was fined and ordered into a treatment program.

Grisham told The Times she had completed what she described as a safety class and paid the fines, and that she disclosed the episodes to the White House before going to work there.

(Reuters) - Wayfair Inc came under pressure on Tuesday after hundreds of employees were reported to be planning a walkout over the retailer's alleged sale of more than $200,000 in bedroom furniture for a Texas detention facility for migrant children.
Shares of the company fell 5.3% to $144.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
A Twitter account under the handle @wayfairwalkout, created this month with a following of more than 13,000 including high-profile Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called for the work stop on Wednesday.
Wayfair, headquartered in Boston, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The @wayfairwalkout account referred Reuters to the company and Reuters was not able to confirm it was created by Wayfair employees.
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter: ""I stand with hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for.""
An image of a letter to Wayfair leaders from employees said that an order for more than $200,000 of bedroom furniture was destined for a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas that would house migrant children seeking asylum.
Criticism has mounted this week over the detention of migrant children in overcrowded, squalid conditions.
""In response to a recent letter signed by 547 employees, our CEO said that the company would not cease doing business with contractors furnishing border camps,"" @wayfairwalkout tweeted.
It demanded that Wayfair stop selling to migrant detention camps and that it give profits, which they claim amount to $86,000, to a Texas-based non-profit agency offering legal services to immigrants.
Screenshots on Twitter of a letter to employees that said it was from the retailer's ""leadership team"" read, ""...We believe it is our business to sell to any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate.""
The walkout, scheduled to take place on Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. ET in Boston's Copley Square (NYSE:SQ), is the latest example of employees protesting workplace social issues. 
In June 2018, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google faced internal upheaval over a contract to help the U.S. military analyze aerial drone imagery. 
The hashtag ""#wayfairwalkout"" was top trending in the United State on Twitter as of Tuesday evening. 
""Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children,"" tweeted Ocasio-Cortez. ""They asked the company to stop. CEO said no. Tomorrow, they're walking out.""

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>","Kinder Morgan wins Texas court challenge, removing obstacle to $2 billion gas pipeline","By Liz Hampton
DENVER/HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI) can begin work on a $2 billion natural gas pipeline without having the Texas energy regulator approve its proposed route, a state judge ruled on Tuesday.
The decision removes a challenge to the state's licensing process that lets gas pipeline companies determine their own route and acquire land without a landowner's consent. Texas is in the midst of a pipeline-construction boom with multibillion-dollar projects under way to bring shale oil and gas to market.
A Travis County District court ruled the Texas Railroad Commission, the state's oil and gas regulator, is not required to set standards for routing the pipelines or private land-takings, Judge Lora Livingston wrote on Tuesday. The state allows gas pipeline operators that qualify as utilities to use eminent domain to take land for the public good. 
""The court finds no authority for the proposition that the legislature has granted authority to the Commission to oversee the rights granted,"" she wrote. She also granted Kinder Morgan's request to dismiss it from the lawsuit. 
A group of Texas landowners and officials had sued to block construction, arguing the oil and gas regulator failed to seek public input or properly supervise the routing of Kinder Morgan's Permian Highway Pipeline, which will carry 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas roughly 400 miles (645 km) from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Kinder Morgan had asked the court to throw out the landowners' lawsuit, arguing it was up to the state legislature, not the court, to change the pipeline permitting process.
""The court's finding validates the process established in Texas for the development of natural gas utility projects,"" Tom Martin, a Kinder Morgan executive, said on Tuesday.
U.S. shale gas production in July is projected to hit a record 81.4 billion cubic feet per day, which would be an 18th consecutive monthly increase. Shale oil could hit 8.52 million barrels per day that same month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Landowners argued that the pipeline will cross ""sensitive environmental features,"" such as endangered species habitats, sites of historical significance and residential subdivisions, according to a filing.
The Texas Real Estate Advocacy and Defense Coalition, which advocates for Texas landowner rights, said it was weighing an appeal and additional legal actions in other venues.
The ruling ""is unfortunate but not unexpected,"" said Travis Mitchell, mayor of Kyle, Texas, a co-plaintiff. ""We will be working to determine the best path forward. We're certainly not giving up."" 

A spokeswoman for the Railroad Commission of Texas declined to comment.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 08:57PM ET</span>","FedEx profit beats estimates, warns of pain in 2020 from trade war","By Sanjana Shivdas and Melissa Fares
(Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, but warned that U.S.-China trade tensions and the non-renewal of its contract with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) would hurt its fiscal 2020 performance.
Shares of the company recouped from initial losses and were last up 1.4% at $157.76 in extended trading.
The United States and China have waged an 11-month trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each others’ goods, roiling financial markets, disrupting supply chains and crimping global economic growth prospects.
""Our fiscal 2020 performance is being negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production, especially at FedEx Express,"" Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a statement.
FedEx forecast a mid-single-digit percentage point decline in adjusted earnings for fiscal 2020. 
""If we see these tariffs rise to say 25% as the Trump administration has talked about ... one of the biggest losers in the American economy would be FedEx,"" said Matthew White, a transportation and package delivery industry specialist.
""Trade weakness is very hard to predict, as it can be caused by both policy and sentiment. Unfortunately, FedEx is seeing negative effects of both.""
The shipping giant, which gets about a third of its revenue from outside the United States, has drawn Chinese ire over shipping mistakes involving several packages. Most recently, a package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an ""operational error.""
Telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. 
FedEx on Monday sued the U.S. government, saying it should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products that violated the Trump administration ban.
E-COMMERCE
Earlier this month, FedEx decided not to renew its contract with Amazon, which represented less than 1.3% of its total revenue in the last calendar year, for U.S. cargo delivery through FedEx Express, the unit that delivers packages on planes.
FedEx described the decision as a strategic move that would allow it to focus on the broader e-commerce market, a group that would include rivals of Amazon scaling up one- and two-day delivery.
""The big emphasis going forward is going to be on e-commerce, which FedEx says will pressure yield,"" said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. ""They're right, especially for Express, and since they will be doing more residential deliveries, that will cost more as well.""
FedEx also said the cost of integrating Dutch delivery company TNT Express into the company was now expected to be about $1.7 billion through fiscal 2021. Fedex had said in March the cost would be more than $1.5 billion. It bought TNT Express in 2016 for $4.8 billion and has struggled to integrate it into its own network.
Adjusted net income fell to $1.32 billion, or $5.01 per share, for the fourth-quarter ended May 31, from $1.60 billion, or $5.91 per share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose to $17.8 billion from $17.3 billion a year earlier, largely due to growth in U.S. volume and higher revenue per shipment at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground.
Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.85 per share and revenue of $17.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The FAA said in a statement that it takes ""allegations regarding safety oversight and retaliation seriously .... To uphold these principles, we take appropriate action as necessary. We do not comment on personnel matters.""
The Wall Street Journal, which reported the FAA reassignments earlier on Tuesday, said they were ""also prompted by allegations that managers retaliated against whistleblowers,"" citing sources familiar with the matter.
Southwest Airlines said in a statement it had no ""insight to share on the recent staffing decisions made within the FAA."" The people reassigned include the office manager and two assistants, the person said.
The shakeup comes as the Transportation Department's inspector general is auditing a number of issues related to the FAA's oversight of Southwest.
The inspector general's office said last year it was opening a review after ""recent events have raised concerns about FAA's safety oversight, particularly for Southwest Airlines"" including a midair incident in April 2018 in which an engine exploded and one person was killed.
The Journal reported in February the FAA was investigating Southwest for widespread failure to accurately track the combined weight of checked bags loaded onto its jets.
The inspector general said in June 2018 had received a complaint ""regarding a number of operational issues at Southwest Airlines, such as alleged pilot training deficiencies, which raise concerns about FAA's oversight of the carrier.""

In May 2018, the FAA said federal investigators were assigned to monitor Southwest maintenance operations, after whistleblower complaints of mistreatment of mechanics raised concerns. The agency said it found no rule violations and that the assignment of additional inspectors was standard practice to preclude any deterioration in maintenance.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investors with $34 trillion demand urgent climate change action,"By Simon Jessop and Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors managing more than $34 trillion in assets, nearly half the world's invested capital, are demanding urgent action from governments on climate change, piling pressure on leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies meeting this week.
In an open letter to the ""governments of the world"" seen by Reuters, groups representing 477 investors stressed ""the urgency of decisive action"" on climate change to achieve the Paris Agreement target.
Almost 200 nations agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. Current policies put the world on track for at least a 3C rise by the end of the century.
The letter comes ahead of a June 28-29 G20 summit in Japan and as United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urges countries to back more ambitious climate goals.
""There is an ambition gap... This ambition gap is of great concern to investors and needs to be addressed, with urgency,"" a statement from the investors accompanying the letter said.
Governments were urged to strengthen their Paris Agreement targets by 2020; phase out thermal coal power and fossil fuel subsidies by set deadlines; set a robust global carbon price by 2020 and improve climate-related financial reporting.
""It is vital for our long-term planning and asset allocation decisions that governments work closely with investors to incorporate Paris-aligned climate scenarios into their policy frameworks and energy transition pathways,"" the statement said.
The investor letter was signed by the chief executives of the seven founding partners of The Investor Agenda, including the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change and the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment.
Large investors signing the statement included Legal & General Investment Management and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), although the world's two biggest asset managers, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard, did not.
A BlackRock spokeswoman declined to give a specific reason for not supporting the call, but pointed to a statement from its annual report that said it typically does not join such initiatives. Reasons can include overlap with the company's existing efforts or a misalignment of views.
A spokeswoman for Vanguard was not able to give a specific reason, but said it was concerned about the long-term impact of climate risk and was actively engaged on a number of climate related initiatives with an emphasis on good disclosure.
A U.N.-backed panel of scientists has said limiting global warming to 1.5C would cost at least $830 billion a year but the cost of inaction is thought to be much higher.
DIVESTING DRIVE 
A number of institutional investors have already started to divest from fossil fuel companies due to the risk their assets will become stranded as the cost of renewable energy falls.
Last month, the U.N.'s Guterres urged countries to end approval for new coal-fired power plants beyond 2020, as well as fossil fuel subsidies.
Carola van Lamoen, Head of Active Ownership at global asset manager Robeco, said: ""As investors, in our view the development of new coal power plants after 2020 puts at risk both the return on investment and the world's chance of limiting global warming in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.""
However, some countries argue that they need to keep using fossil fuels to power their economic development.
A report by researchers which tracks countries' progress toward limiting global warming showed that only five out of 32 nations have targets in line with a 2C limit. 
A report by the Overseas Development Institute thinktank said on Tuesday that G20 governments boosted backing for coal-fired power plants, particularly in poorer nations, from $17 billion to $47 billion a year from 2014 to 2017.

Japan, as host of the G20 summit in Osaka this week, has been criticized for its plans to continue using coal. It backs the use of carbon capture and storage to trap emissions, but the technology is costly and not yet commercial.

Dip is president and CEO of Dip Shipping Co and Handal is a sales manager.

In recent years, Netflix had been luring away high-profile executives from rivals and was earlier sued by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp for poaching employees as it built an audience of nearly 149 million global customers.
Disney unveiled details of Disney+, an ad-free monthly subscription streaming service, in April and priced it at $7 monthly or $70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the most popular entertainment franchises.
Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12.

After two disappointing economic indicators today in new home sales and consumer confidence, tomorrow brings the latest durable goods figures.
And investors should keep an eye out not just for the earnings number from KB Home, but for the commentary. There should be a glimpse of whether the current low rates are starting to bring in more home buyers. That’s not showing up in the government housing data just yet.
Here are three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Durable Goods on Tap
Durable goods orders will be the focus for the market before the bell. The Commerce Department will report May orders for goods lasting three years or more at 8:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Durable goods orders are expected to come in flat after following a 2.1% decline in April, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are predicted to have increased by 0.1%.
2. Crude Inventories on Tap
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report is due Wednesday, with many expecting another draw in crude stockpiles.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data that, while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels and showed crude stockpiles fell by 7.54 million barrels last week. The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 2.54 million barrels for the week ended June 14.
Crude oil futures climbed 0.1% to settle at $57.83 a barrel today.
3. KB Home and  General Mills  Earnings on Deck
General Mills (NYSE:GIS) will report earnings before the U.S. markets open on Wednesday, with analysts keen to see whether the company has managed to keep costs in check and margins intact. During the previous quarter, the company delivered an earnings beat, as efforts to keep down costs, mainly from packaging, shipment, and raw materials, supported the bottom line.
General Mills is expected to report earnings of $0.77 share on revenues to $4.24 billion.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) is also set to report second-quarter results tomorrow after the market closes. Guidance will be closely watched following a rebound in U.S. housing activity on the back of falling mortgage rates. Industry leader  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN), however, fell 6.1% on Tuesday after offering weak guidance, and the Commerce Department reported a surprising sales drop in new home sales for May.
KB Home is expected to report earnings of $0.39 a share on revenue of $943 million."

1561,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Slides as Hopes Fade Fed Will Go for Big Rate Cut,"Investing.com - Stocks fell back Tuesday as investors became more certain the Federal Reserve will only enact a modest rate cut at its July meeting. In addition, unease grew about the prospects for a meeting between President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping
The S&P 500 fell 0.95%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.51% and the Dow Jones industrials dropped 0.67%. The day's declines were the third straight for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq and second in three days for the Dow.
The market was modestly lower when both Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard gave speeches and acknowledged rates might need to be cut to sustain the economic recovery. But Bullard disappointed when he suggested a rate cut would not be 50 basis points (a half-percentage point), which is what more bullish investors have been betting on and the president would like.
Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool expects the Fed to trim its key federal funds rate to 2% to 2.25% from 2.25% to 2.5% now at its July meeting. The speeches will probably amplify the president's criticism of the Fed and of Powell in particular. There's talk the president might replace Powell as chairman, although Powell's actual term as a Fed governor would go on. (The legality of such a move is not entirely clear.)
Despite the stock market's reaction, bond traders saw rates heading lower. The U.S. 10-Year Treasury fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016. The yield has fallen 17.4% this quarter alone and is down about 25.8% for the year.
Trump's meeting with President Ji also carries risks for markets. If the United State and China can't resolve their trade disputes, the trade war will go on and unsettle markets.
In addition to the political tensions, profit-taking seemed to hit the market, with tech stocks hit the hardest.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the biggest laggard among the 30 Dow stocks and third-worst among Nasdaq 100 stocks, in part because it has been one of the top Dow performers this year. There were analysts suggesting the software giant's Azure cloud business might not be a profitable as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services business.
But Amazon also fell on Tuesday, as did Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). The Nasdaq 100 fell 1.70%.
Where there was strength was in very defensive stocks. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV) hit 52-week highs. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and McDonald's were the top Dow performers on the day.
Botox-maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) jumped 25% after agreeing to be acquired by AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) for about $63 billion.
Metals and crude oil were mostly steady. The August contract for gold settled up 50 cents at $1,418.70 an ounce in New York, although it traded as high as $1,442.90. WTI futures were off just 7 cents to $57.83.
Not helping the market was a Conference Board report showing consumer confidence fell to a 21-month low.
And housing stocks dropped back after the Commerce Department reported that sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell for a second-straight month in May. That indicated lower mortgage rates had yet to provide a boost to the struggling housing market.  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) underscored the weakness with weaker than-expected guidance. Shares fell 6.1%, second-worst among S&P 500 stocks. The company said U.S. tariffs are adding $500 to the cost of a home. Average selling prices are falling as well.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) and HCA Holdings (NYSE:HCA) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day.
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Lennar (NYSE:LEN) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) were the S&P 500 laggards."

1563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 03:50PM ET</span>",Vitriol Flies in Puerto Rico as FBI Is Said to Probe Treasury,"(Bloomberg) -- The firing of Puerto Rico’s top Treasury official set off an extraordinary exchange of insults Tuesday, with the finance chief’s son calling Governor Ricardo Rossello corrupt and the governor questioning the mental state of his accuser.
The back-and-forth was the latest distraction for a U.S. commonwealth government already trying to navigate a massive bankruptcy and recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. The drama could hurt the government’s efforts to restore confidence in its management abilities as it prepares next year’s budget and tries to strike a deal with creditors that would spare its economy.
The imbroglio began Monday morning, when then-Treasury Secretary Raul Maldonado gave an interview to a radio station disclosing alleged crimes in his own department, including influence peddling, issuance of fake licenses, destruction of documents and accessing privileged taxpayer records. He said he had personally been targeted for extortion and threatened. He said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into an “institutional mafia.”
The governor said in an afternoon news conference that Maldonado had never told him of any crimes, and he asked his long-time cabinet member to resign at once.
Hot Blast
Then, Maldonado’s son entered the fray. Raul Maldonado Nieves took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to excoriate Rossello as ""corrupt.""
Maldonado Nieves went on to say he attended a meeting at the governor’s mansion with officials from auditing firm BDO. El Nuevo Dia newspaper has reported BDO is being investigated by the FBI in connection with irregularities connected to its contracts with the territory’s government.
Maldonado Nieves said that at the meeting he saw Rossello order the audit firm to change a report on Hurricane Maria aid. Lapsing into profanity, he said the report would have shown mismanagement in a relief effort that involved Rossello’s wife, Beatriz Rossello.
BDO didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Family Protector
On Tuesday morning, Rossello released an official statement from the governor’s office in which he called the allegations ""absurd"" and ""disrespectful."" He denied wrongdoing by himself or Beatriz Rossello and said he wouldn’t tolerate attacks on the ""integrity of my wife and my family."" He said she never had an administrative role with the relief charity, but rather served as a spokeswoman.
Rossello speculated that his former treasurer’s son must be “going through a moment of personal torment, whatever it may be.”
Puerto Rico is trying to extricate itself from both its long-running economic crisis and recover from Hurricane Maria, which ravaged the island in September 2017. Now at the center of the swirling controversy, the Treasury Department has been one of the chief conduits for the estimated $20.6 billion in aid that has flowed to the island.
On Tuesday, Puerto Rico’s secretary of justice, Wanda Vazquez, said that her office was summoning the elder Maldonado this coming Friday to explain his statements on corruption in the Treasury.

Roberto Dip was sentenced to 18 months while Jason Handal was sentenced to 15 months for fixing the prices of freight forwarding from about 2010 to 2015, the department said. Freight forwarders organize shipments and contract with carriers to get goods from one point to another.
Dip is president and CEO of Dip Shipping Co and Handal is a sales manager.
""These defendants' conduct raised freight-forwarding prices by as much (as) 20 percent, victimizing vulnerable consumers and individuals sending gifts and household goods to family members,"" said Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, in a statement.
Joel Denaro, who represented Dip, said: ""Mr. Dip is very remorseful. He accepted full responsibility for his actions and hopes in the future that his sentence will be reduced.

As director of original film at Netflix, Brodlie was responsible for films including ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" and ""Ibiza."" 
He also acquired award-winning movies ""Roma"" and ""Mudbound"" for Netflix. ""Roma"" won three Academy Awards.
In his new role at Disney, Brodlie will determine what content needs to be produced or acquired for Disney+ customers outside of the United States, according to a statement from the company.
In recent years, Netflix had been luring away high-profile executives from rivals and was earlier sued by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp for poaching employees as it built an audience of nearly 149 million global customers.
Disney unveiled details of Disney+, an ad-free monthly subscription streaming service, in April and priced it at $7 monthly or $70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the most popular entertainment franchises.
Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12.

After two disappointing economic indicators today in new home sales and consumer confidence, tomorrow brings the latest durable goods figures.
And investors should keep an eye out not just for the earnings number from KB Home, but for the commentary. There should be a glimpse of whether the current low rates are starting to bring in more home buyers. That’s not showing up in the government housing data just yet.
Here are three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Durable Goods on Tap
Durable goods orders will be the focus for the market before the bell. The Commerce Department will report May orders for goods lasting three years or more at 8:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Durable goods orders are expected to come in flat after following a 2.1% decline in April, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are predicted to have increased by 0.1%.

Rossello speculated that his former treasurer’s son must be “going through a moment of personal torment, whatever it may be.”
Puerto Rico is trying to extricate itself from both its long-running economic crisis and recover from Hurricane Maria, which ravaged the island in September 2017. Now at the center of the swirling controversy, the Treasury Department has been one of the chief conduits for the estimated $20.6 billion in aid that has flowed to the island.
On Tuesday, Puerto Rico’s secretary of justice, Wanda Vazquez, said that her office was summoning the elder Maldonado this coming Friday to explain his statements on corruption in the Treasury.

1573,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",Bond Bulls Near First-Half Record With $72 Billion ETF Inflows,"(Bloomberg) -- As the risk of an economic slowdown lingers, exchange-traded fund investors are seeking shelter in bond funds.
They’ve poured about $72 billion into fixed-income ETFs this year through June 24, with the funds on track for their biggest first-half inflows ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Those bets have also fueled assets in the debt strategies to hit an all-time high of nearly $741 billion.
Markets have been whipsawed by mounting concern over softer economic data and President Donald Trump’s trade wars with major partners. For a month now, a key part of the Treasury yield curve has been inverted -- a phenomenon that’s reliably predicted a recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the downside risks to the U.S. economy have increased recently, reinforcing the case among policy makers for somewhat lower interest rates.
“Bond ETFs are punching way above their weight. They’re having a huge year,” said Eric Balchunas, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Fixed income is the benefactor of an overall hangover from last year and nervousness about money going forward.”
For the Long-Term
That’s encouraged investors toward long-duration debt funds, which saw inflows of more than $8.6 billion this year through June 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
The largest in the category, the $14.4 billion iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF, or TLT, has seen assets surge 65% after taking in $4.5 billion during that period. Meanwhile, the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond (NYSE:IEF) ETF, or IEF, has posted inflows of about $5.5 billion, already surpassing its previous record high in 2014.
That’s an indication that investors are betting interest rates will stay lower for longer, according to Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank.
“They’re willing to accept the current interest rates over the long period,” Gaffney said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “When you lengthen duration like that, when you’re looking at the long end of the curve, obviously you’re thinking that you’re willing to lock in those lower rates for a longer period because you don’t think interest rates are going anywhere.”
Ultra-Short
While the longer-end of the yield curve has been a favorite pocket for bond buyers, debt investors also upped their exposures at the other extreme. In June, funds tracking securities with less than a year to maturity took in $4.8 billion, on track for the biggest month of inflows since November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, ticker SHV, is on pace for a record monthly inflow of more than $4 billion, while  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).’s SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF, or BIL, is on track to take about $850 million.
Investors are “searching for yield -- it’s simply a yield play,” said TIAA’s Gaffney. “The U.S. bond market is still the place to park funds.”
In Good Company
Another beneficiary of a Fed willing to cut rates to boost growth are funds tracking corporate debt. The $37 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, ticker LQD, has taken in more than $4 billion through June 24, nearly double its previous monthly record. Meanwhile, the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, or HYG, has taken in over $3 billion in the same period.
“Investors are saying really low interest-rates are fantastic for corporations because they can borrow at low rates,” said Priscilla Hancock, managing director of global fixed income, currency and commodities at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
But Hancock has some concerns that flows could turn negative -- especially in riskier assets such as high-yield debt -- as investors seek safety and exit funds to access liquidity.
“If we’re in late cycle, you want to be careful about reaching for too much yield and taking on too much risk, because when you want to get out, everyone else may also want to get out at the same time,” she said. “I’m concerned about where pricing will go when everyone is trying to get out of the eye of the needle.”"
1574,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 03:29PM ET</span>",What is a Beyond Meat burger worth to hungry investors?,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. consumers hankering for one of Beyond Meat Inc's faux-meat burgers can pick one up at the grocery store for about $3 a patty. 
That is a fraction of what they are going for on Wall Street, where investors looking to get a serving of the food producer's sizzling stock appear to be laying down the equivalent of more than $50 a burger.
Nailing down just how much Beyond Meat is worth is one of the hottest topics on Wall Street following a nearly 500% surge in its stock since its initial public offering on May 2.
The company has attracted investors betting it will become the dominant player in the nascent market for plant-based hamburgers, sausages and other meat alternatives, even though the company has yet to turn a profit.
With ground beef retailing in grocery stores for the equivalent of $1 or less per 4-ounce (113 gram) burger patty, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beyond Meat's early success in grocery store meat sections shows a market exists for premium-priced burger products made with or without animal.
At nearly $9 billion, Beyond Meat's market capitalization rivals several mature food companies. Poultry producer Pilgrim's Pride checks in at $6 billion, for instance, while Campbell Soup Co sports a stock market value of $12 billion. 
So far, the Wall Street establishment does not see that price tag as justified. The eight analysts covering the stock have price targets ranging from 11% to 46% below Beyond Meat's current share price of around $144, following its recent rally. 
Preferred valuation measures like the price to earnings ratio are not useful because Beyond Meat is losing money and is unlikely to record a profit for at least another year or so. 
Meanwhile, the stock is trading at 38 times this year's Wall Street revenue estimate, making it more expensive on that basis than all but a handful of U.S. stocks even as it faces competition from larger, profitable rivals including Nestle, the world's largest packaged foods group.
(For a graphic on 'Beyond Meat's burger multiple' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2FvFK4S)
PATTIES PER SHARE?
Beyond Meat is increasing sales of its Beyond Sausage and other products, but the Beyond Burger remains its flagship offering.
The company sold 15.2 million pounds of food last year, equivalent to 61.0 million 4-ounce patties, the weight of the Beyond Burger sold in supermarkets. That puts the company's current market capitalization at the equivalent of $143 per Beyond Burger patty sold last year.
Analysts on average expect Beyond Meat's revenue to surge 152% this year to $221 million, according to Refinitiv. Conservatively assuming no price increases, it would be on track to sell 153 million patties in 2019, making its current stock market value equivalent to $57 per 4-ounce patty sold in 2019. 
A Beyond Meat spokesperson declined to give details on sales of specific products or the weight of its burgers sold through restaurants.
While investors do not typically value companies by comparing stock prices to unit sales, the high price they are paying - at least in terms of burger patties - to own a stake in Beyond Meat's future signals a lofty valuation, even as competition grows. 
Impossible Foods has started selling its Impossible Burgers through restaurants including Burger King, Red Robin and Applebee's. Meat processor  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) this month launched its first vegetarian and mixed-protein products, including a beef and pea burger. Nestle and Canada's Maple Leaf Foods Inc are launching their own competing patties and vegan ""ground beef"" in coming months.

""I would never bet against America's love affair with burgers,"" said Bob Goldin, a partner at food industry consulting company Pentallect. ""Even if they chip off 1 or 2% of the market it's big business. But competition is coming.""

In a sign that Amazon is starting to ramp up plans to bolster advertising on its streaming TV products and encroach on Roku’s turf, the e-commerce giant launched three new smart televisions with support for HDR to the product line for the first time.
Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell more than 3%, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 1.4%.
The sticker price of the TVs is also attractive, increasing the likelihood that Amazon adds to its superior user base. The 43-inch model is priced at $329.99, 50-inch at $379.99 and 55-inch at $449.99.
Roku is estimated to have 28.6 million active user accounts, with Amazon’s Fire TV slightly higher at about 30 million active users to date.
Amazon is not the only competitor posing a threat to Roku. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) video product unveiled on March 25 is also expected to vie for a piece of the pie.
Despite the weakness, Roku is up nearly 200% year to date as better-than-expected first-quarter results in May helped the stock mount a recovery."
1576,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 02:56PM ET</span>",PG&E bondholders propose bankruptcy exit plan worth up to $30 bln,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A committee of bondholders of PG&E Corp's utility unit on Tuesday proposed a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would inject up to $30 billion to help the California power provider emerge from Chapter 11 and pay off its liability from wildfires.
In a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in San Francisco, the committee, made up of senior unsecured noteholders of Pacific Gas & Electric Co (NYSE:PCG), also sought to terminate the utility's exclusive period for filing a Chapter 11 reorganization plan so the committee may file its own plan. PG&E has until Sept. 29 to file a plan.
PG&E has been too slow to file its own plan and ""the need to exit bankruptcy expeditiously is paramount,"" the committee said in its filing, adding its plan would provide up to $16 billion to compensate all of PG&E's pre-bankruptcy wildfire claims.
The committee's plan would be funded by $18 billion in cash from bondholders in exchange for new common shares in a reorganized company, as well as $2.2 billion in insurance proceeds owed PG&E for wildfire losses.
Bondholders would also provide $4 billion in cash in exchange for new unsecured notes and $5.5 billion would be raised by selling new secured notes to third-party investors.
San Francisco-based PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018 that left the company anticipating $30 billion in liabilities blamed on its equipment.
The worst of the blazes, November's Camp Fire, leveled the town of Paradise and killed more than 80 people. It was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of modern times in California.
A spokesman said the committee had no additional comment on the plan beyond its filing.
A spokesman for PG&E in an email to Reuters said the power provider is ""committed to working together with our stakeholders through the Chapter 11 process to fairly and expeditiously resolve our liabilities resulting from the 2017 and 2018 Northern California wildfires, develop a more sustainable business model and continue delivering safe and reliable service.""
The committee said in its filing that its reorganization plan will provide a ""substantial"" capital investment to fund improvements in PG&E's electric infrastructure to ensure reliable power service and meet California's renewable energy goals.
The committee also said its plan will provide for a quick exit from bankruptcy for PG&E that maintains an investment-grade rating for the power provider.
The committee's filing did not identify unsecured noteholders that would participate in the plan, but the largest stakeholders in the group include Pacific Investment Management Co LLC, Elliott Management Corp and Davidson Kempner Capital Management.
According to the committee's filing, terms of the plan will not affect PG&E's ratepayers and will provide for a $4 billion contribution to a fund for insuring against utility-related wildfire liabilities that California officials are considering establishing.
Governor Gavin Newsom last week proposed helping utilities create a fund of up to $21 billion to compensate future victims of wildfires sparked by the companies' equipment or employees.
Approval from state lawmakers would be needed to create the fund.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 02:34PM ET</span>","Wall Street drops on trade worries, Fed Chair Powell's speech","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday as simmering trade concerns, combined with disappointing economic data, sent buyers to the sidelines, where they remained after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushed back on pressure from President Donald Trump to cut rates.
All three major U.S. stock indexes were in the red, weighed most heavily by technology stocks, after Powell said the Fed was grappling with whether trade uncertainties and other issues support interest rate cuts. 
Powell, speaking at the Council on Foreign relations, also reiterated the Fed's independence, a day after Trump tweeted that the Fed ""doesn't know what it's doing.""
Earlier, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in an interview with Bloomberg said he does not think the Fed needs to cut rates by a half-percentage point at its next policy meeting, in late July.
""You had a one-two punch,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. ""Powell came out and warned against policy bending to short-term political interests, but it is also Bullard, who is a dissenter, saying 50 basis points would be too much."" 
Bullard last week said he had dissented at the Fed's June policy meeting because he felt that weak inflation and uncertainties about the economic outlook warranted a rate cut.
Despite Tuesday's sell-off, June is shaping up to be a good month for U.S. equities. The benchmark S&P 500 continued to hover within a percent of the all-time high reached last Thursday.
Still, anxieties stemming from the U.S.-China trade war found no relief in a White House official's remarks that Trump is ""comfortable with any outcome"" arising from a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit convening in Japan on Friday.
""The market...is really looking at two issues that push it higher,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""One is the trade agreement and the other is Fed policy. It's really trade policy that's going to be more meaningful."" 
On the economic front, sales of newly constructed homes and consumer confidence numbers both came in well below economist expectations, according to separate reports from the U.S. Commerce Department and the Conference Board.
Growing signs of economic softness, especially related to the trade disputes between the United States and its major trading partners, contributed to the Federal Reserve's last week signaling that interest rate cuts could begin as early as July.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 114.25 points, or 0.43%, to 26,613.29, the S&P 500 lost 17.36 points, or 0.59%, to 2,927.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 80.27 points, or 1%, to 7,925.42.
Of the 11 major indexes in the S&P 500, 10 were in negative territory, with technology and communications services seeing the biggest percentage drops. 
Rate-sensitive bank stocks were down 0.2%, as U.S. Treasuries benchmark yields fell below the closely watched 2% level.
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) said it would buy Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc for about $63 billion, sending the Botox maker's shares up by 26.9%. AbbVie's stock dropped 15.4%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 22 new highs and 79 new lows.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 02:31PM ET</span>","Exclusive: In a world first, Facebook to give data on hate speech suspects to French courts","By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - In a world first, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has agreed to hand over the identification data of French users suspected of hate speech on its platform to judges, France's minister for digital affairs Cedric O said on Tuesday. 
O, whose father is South Korean, is one of French President Emmanuel Macron's earliest followers, and has been influential in shaping the president's thinking on Big Tech as an advisor at the Elysee palace in the first two years of Macron's presidency.
The decision by the world's biggest social media network comes after successive meetings between Zuckerberg and Macron, who wants to take a leading role globally on the regulation of hate speech and the spread of false information online. 
So far, Facebook has cooperated with French justice on matters related to terrorist attacks and violent acts by transferring the IP addresses and other identification data of suspected individuals to French judges who formally demanded it. 
Following a meeting between Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, and O last week, the social media company has extended this cooperation to hate speech.
""This is huge news, it means that the judicial process will be able to run normally,"" O told Reuters in an interview. ""It's really very important, they're only doing it for France.""
O, who said he had been in close contact with Clegg over the last few days on the issue, said Facebook's decision was the result of an ongoing conversation between the internet giant and the French administration. 
Since his nomination as minister in March, O has made the fight against hate speech online a key priority through regular contacts with Facebook's top executives, including founder Mark Zuckerberg. 
Facebook declined to comment.
STRONG SIGNAL
""It is a strong signal in terms of regulation,"" said Sonia Cisse, a counsel at law firm Linklaters, adding that it was a world first. ""Hate speech is no longer considered part of freedom of speech, it's now on the same level as terrorism."" 
With Facebook's latest move, France is now a clear frontrunner in the quest to regulate big social media outlets, and other platforms might follow suite, Cisse said. 
The discussions on how to best regulate tech giants began with a Zuckerberg-Macron meeting last year, followed by a report on tech regulation last month that Facebook's founder considered could be a blueprint for wider EU regulation.
Facebook had refrained from handing over identification data of people suspected of hate speech because it was not compelled to do so under U.S.-French legal conventions and because it was worried countries without an independent judiciary could abuse it. 
France's parliament, where Macron's ruling party has a comfortable majority, is debating legislation that would give the new regulator the power to fine tech companies up to 4% of their global revenue if they don't do enough to remove hateful content from their network.
O also signaled his openness to seeing French startups being snapped up by larger U.S. companies, in a spite of recent measures taken by Macron's government to bolster anti-takeover rules to protect the country's strategic companies.
""My only goal is to spur the creation of a lot of companies,"" he said. ""I have no problem with the fact that some of them are bought by U.S. companies, as long as they don't have critical technology.""
TOO BIG
The minister is also reluctant to support the idea of breaking up companies like Facebook or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose size, weight on the Internet and financial firepower have turned them into systemic players just as much as big banks.
Facebook has been called a social media monopoly by co-founder Chris Hughes, and calls for a break-up of the group have intensified.
""We cannot impose very tough obligations on Western companies and dismantle them because they are very big, and not do the same thing with Chinese companies that enter the Western market,"" he said, referring to groups like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent. 
A graduate of France's top business school, HEC, O combines political experience - he was an aide to Dominique Strauss-Khan, like many of the tight group of ""Macron Boys"" who propelled him to power - and a stint in the private sector, at engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF).

At the Elysee, he was in charge of advising Macron on the French government's vast portfolio of stakes in French companies, having to deal with hot corporate sagas such as Renault-Nissan, as well as handling relations with Big Tech.

GM has long been dominated the U.S. full-size SUV segment, which fetches higher margins, but rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has been pushing to capture market share. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said earlier this year it would start building a full-size Jeep SUV in late 2020.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 11:35AM ET</span>",Safety first: markets wary of world politics and policy and dash for bunkers,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Gold, Switzerland's franc, Japan's yen, top-rated government bonds, and even bitcoin -- investors have dashed for havens and alternative assets this week as anxiety grows about trade wars, U.S.-Iran tensions and negative interest rates. 
Although world stocks and bonds remain near record highs thanks to promises of ever more central bank largesse, the sudden dash for these financial bunkers shows all is not as calm as a cursory reading of headline indexes suggests. 
Fears of a global trade war have been simmering for over a year but the latest standoff between Washington and Beijing may come to a head at the G20 summit in Japan this weekend. New U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could kick in next month if there's no progress between the two sides. 
Military tensions between the United States and Iran have also gone up several notches after Tehran's downing of an unmanned American drone last week and claims that U.S. retaliation was stopped at the last minute. A fresh wave sanctions on Iran's leaders and a war of words between the two sides have followed.
The trade and geopolitical worries are compounding investor concern about a looming global economic downturn and whether central banks are easing policy again quickly enough to offset it. Even if they are, the expanding universe of bonds with a negative yield -- effectively penalizing investors for holding them -- is unnerving for many. 
""It comes at the worst possible moment because we are late-cycle, we are worried about global growth, and the U.S. are fighting on many fronts,"" said Frederic Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet Wealth Management, referring partly to the trade conflict between the U.S. and China. 
He said that under normal circumstances, the reaction to the dispute in the Middle East would have been confined largely to oil prices. But because of worries over global growth and the tail risk from trade negotiations, flows are being directed instead into safe assets. 
""This Iran conflict is the cherry on the cake,"" said Ducrozet. 
Nowhere has the move been more marked than in gold. The precious metal struck a six-year high of 1,438.63 on Tuesday, up a whopping 11.2% over the past month. ""Safe"" currencies the Japanese yen and Swiss francare around 2.% and 2.7% higher respectively over the same period. 
(Graphic: Rush to safety - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FtKU1u)
Ducrozet even pointed to bitcoin's resurgence -- up 40% over the last month -- as possibly partly driven by the search for alternative investments. 
The promise of fresh stimulus from the world's top central banks has fueled an all-inclusive rally in public assets, with equities and bonds rising in tandem. That is unsettling for portfolio managers who use the more typical inverse relationship between stocks and bonds to balance and insulate their funds.
The fear is that if they correlate on the way up, they will do so on the way down -- hence the search for more alternative assets to diversify portfolios.
""It seems that the world is so awash with money, that it is creating financial asset price inflation wherever you look,"" ING economist Robert Carnell said in a note last week.
""Something is wrong here. Moreover, the likelihood that if and when this is realized, the positive correlation between all assets means that my portfolio diversification will all count for nothing is rather disturbing.""
What's more, there are growing worries that central banks under pressure from politicians and markets alike are finding it harder to read the signals on inflation and growth due to the lack of visibility on policy and trade. 
Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell speaks later on Tuesday, following stinging criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.
On Monday, Trump again criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates fast enough saying the world's most important central bank ""blew it"" and didn't know what it was doing.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>","Norway wealth fund allowed to invest again in Walmart, Rio Tinto, others","By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund can invest again in miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and retailer Walmart after their exclusions from the fund's investments on ethical grounds were revoked, the board of the central bank said on Tuesday.
The fund can also resume investing in Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim's Grupo Carso, U.S. defense company General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and fertilizer-maker Nutrien, the board added in a statement.
Reinvestments will likely take place ""within an appropriately long timeframe,"" said the board, without specifying a timeline. The fund is managed by a unit of the central bank.
The fund, one of the world's largest investors, has an ethical mandate set by parliament and is not allowed to invest in companies that produce nuclear weapons, cluster munitions and tobacco, among other ethical criteria. 
An ethical watchdog, the Council on Ethics, makes recommendations to the board of the central bank on whether companies should be excluded, reincluded or put on a watchlist, after which the board ultimately decides.
Walmart, and its subsidiary Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico SAB de CV, had been excluded from the fund's investments since 2006 based on an assessment of ""serious or systematic violations of human rights"".
These included, in the ethics watchdog's view, employing minors against international rules, allowing hazardous working conditions at suppliers and pressuring workers into overtime. 
""The Council on Ethics has found that the grounds for exclusions are no longer present,"" the board of the central bank said in a statement.
Walmart was unavailable for comment on Tuesday. It told Reuters in 2014 that it does not comment on any shareholders that buy or sell its stocks. 
""Our company provides a range of jobs, and along with training and development, our associates have strong career opportunities. We are proud of what our associates achieve and the opportunities that we provide around the world,"" said a Walmart spokesman at the time.
RIO TINTO
Miner Rio Tinto was excluded in 2008 based on the risk of causing severe environmental damage related to Indonesia's Grasberg mine, the world's second-largest copper mine. 
""The company has made it clear for the Council on Ethics that it has signed an agreement to sell its interest in the mine,"" said the statement by the central bank's board.
Rio Tinto was not immediately available for comment.
The issue was Rio Tinto's stake in the mine, which according to the Norwegian finance ministry at the time, discharged very large amounts of tailings directly into a natural river system.
Rio Tinto spokesman Nick Cobban said at the time of the exclusion: ""We have an exemplary record in environmental matters, world-leading in fact, and they are given the very highest priority in everything we do.""
""The current system of tailings is unquestionably the most appropriate given the high rainfall and seismically unstable geology in the area,"" Cobban said.
Fertilizer-maker Nutrien had been excluded from the fund in 2011 following an assessment of the risk of violations of fundamental ethical norms related to the company's operations in Western Sahara, a contested territory between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario since Spain left in 1974.
""The Council on Ethics have found that these purchases now have ceased,"" said the central bank's board.
Nutrien is ""pleased with Norges Bank's decision"", said a company spokesman, referring to the Norwegian name of the central bank. 
U.S. listed General Dynamics had been excluded from the fund in 2005 because it produced cluster munitions.
""The company has made it clear for the Council on Ethics that such production has been terminated,"" said the board.
General Dynamics was not immediately available for comment.
Grupo Carso SAB de CV was excluded from the fund in 2011 because it produced tobacco. ""The company has made it clear ... that it is no longer involved in tobacco production,"" said the board.

Grupo Carso was not immediately available for comment.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",AbbVie looks beyond Humira with $63 billion deal for Botox-maker Allergan,"By Michael Erman and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - Drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) said on Tuesday it would buy Botox-maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc for about $63 billion, grabbing control of the biggest name in medical aesthetics to help reduce its reliance on blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira.
AbbVie has been under pressure to diversify its portfolio as Humira, the world's best-selling drug, is already in competition with cheaper versions in Europe and faces expiration of its patents in 2023 in the United States, its most important market.
Humira, which brought in revenue of about $20 billion last year, reported the first fall in quarterly sales in years in the January-March period.
AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez said the company was well positioned to buy Allergan because of the massive amount of cash that Humira generates.
""Humira is buying the assets that replace it over the long term,"" said Gonzalez, who will lead the combined company and remain chairman and chief executive through 2023. 
Allergan Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders, who put together the current version of his company through a series of deals to roll up several pharmaceutical firms in 2014, will join AbbVie's board upon completion of the deal. 
Saunders built his reputation as a dealmaker, but Allergan has struggled since  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) walked away from a $160 billion deal in 2016. Allergan's shares have lost around half their value since then.
He has been under pressure over the last year to break up or sell the company, with activist investor David Tepper running a campaign to urge Allergan to hire an independent chairman.
Investors have also questioned Saunders' growth plans beyond acquisitions and the quality of the company's drug pipeline. 
On a conference call, Gonzalez said the deal was not a pipeline-driven transaction, and AbbVie executives downplayed the role Allergan's experimental drugs would play in the combined company.
Shares of AbbVie have also languished, losing more than a third of their value from highs hit in January 2018 over concerns about competition to Humira.
The deal, which comes months after Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co agreed to buy  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) in a $74 billion transaction, will redomicile Dublin-based Allergan to the United States. 
AbbVie and Allergan senior management had been discussing a possible deal since late April, the companies said. 
Allergan remains an industry leader in aesthetics, and is likely to be the cornerstone of AbbVie's valuation, SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note.
""This is yet another transaction driven by diversification, scale and low borrowing costs, rather than portfolio or top line synergies,"" Porges said.
Allergan shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie shares and $120.30 in cash for each share held, for a total consideration of $188.24 per Allergan share, a premium of 45% to the stock's Monday close. Including debt, the deal values Allergan at $83 billion.
AbbVie shares were down 14% at $67.54, while Allergan's stock was up 27.60% at $165.13 in morning trading. Shares of other specialty pharmaceutical companies also moved higher.
Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV, Bausch Health Co Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd were all up 2% to 4%. 
AbbVie's offer price is a far cry from Pfizer's all-stock offer for Allergan that valued the Ireland-based drugmaker at $363.63 per share in 2015.
AbbVie said it expects annual pretax savings and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in its third year, after the deal closes in early 2020.
The transaction is expected to add 10% to adjusted earnings per share over the first full year following the close, the companies said. 

The deal was a better-than-expected outcome for Allergan as investors and analysts were expecting a split, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen wrote in a note, adding that it is unlikely that anyone else will step in and bid for Allergan at this point.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese beverage giant Suntory Holdings said it would work with rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) as well as Nestle to push the government in Vietnam, among the biggest contributors to plastic waste in the ocean, to create a large-scale recycling system.
The alliance comes amid growing global outrage over such pollution, with the European Union voting to outlaw some single-use plastic items such as straws. Japan plans to discuss the issue at the G20 summit it hosts this month.
Suntory, the maker of Hibiki whisky as well as soft drinks, plans to switch out pure petroleum-based plastic bottles in all markets by 2030, using only recycled or plant-based materials. This would cost around 50 billion yen ($467 million), Suntory Chief Executive Takeshi Niinami told Reuters. 
This goal is particularly challenging in Suntory's Southeast Asian markets, including Vietnam, where it has a joint venture with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Much of the region lacks sophisticated systems for collecting, sorting and treating used plastic.
Niinami said his fear was that governments may take drastic restrictions against plastic bottles instead of working on recycling. The company sees no viable alternative yet to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. 
""If an environment minister or regulator suddenly declares PET bottles as bad and restricts its use ... this will be disruptive.""
Vietnam's prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, said earlier this month he wanted Vietnam to phase out single-use plastics by 2025. He said there should be ""drastic measures"" to get there but did not say how.
The foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment made outside office hours.
Niinami said the alliance will call on the government to plan a system spanning collection and facilities for recycling, although members have not decided on specifics such as how such infrastructure would be paid for. 
He said the alliance was not offering up a blank check, but added Suntory was aware it may need to help and possibly pass on some of the costs of such recycling efforts to customers.
""It would be difficult for suppliers like ourselves to pay for everything,"" he said. 
The alliance will also include the local operations of companies including Tetra Pak and NutiFood.

This is the latest in a string of partnerships among global plastics and consumer goods companies formed this year. A report by Greenpeace last year found Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle to be the world's biggest producers of plastic trash, although all three companies have made recycling pledges.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>",Spain's bad bank transforms into real estate fund as it tries to stem losses,"By Jesús Aguado and Ingrid Melander
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's 'bad bank' is joining the ranks of the world's biggest real estate funds as it swaps loans for property in an attempt to limit losses on toxic assets it took on during the financial crisis.
Sareb took over more than 50 billion euros ($57 billion) in real estate and other toxic assets from nine Spanish savings banks in 2012, part of a rescue deal as the government sought to try and draw a line under the country's banking crisis. 
Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008, the number of Spanish lenders has shrunk to 12 from more than 55 and survivors have drastically streamlined operations and reduced their non-performing assets by 60% from a peak in 2013.
But Sareb is struggling, as a slump in Spanish real estate prices has depressed the value of loans and foreclosed assets it took on, despite Sareb buying them at the time at an average discount of 46% and 63% respectively.
Its difficulties contrast with the success of some other 'bad banks' set up in Europe after the financial crisis, such as in Britain and Ireland where property markets have rebounded.
Sareb, owned by Spain's banks and the state bailout fund FROB, has only managed to sell a third of its real estate and financial assets since it was established and has repaid less than a third of its senior debt. 
The bad bank says its best hope is to claw back money by foreclosing on real estate loans and sell the properties itself. 
""Transforming loans gives us more liquidity on those assets. It is easier for us to sell the real estate development, than to directly sell the loan,"" Iker Beraza Perez, deputy general director for strategy and pricing at Sareb, told Reuters.
When the bad bank originally took on 200,000 assets for more than 50 billion euros, 80% were loans. 
Under its new plan, Sareb is focused on transforming up to 18 billion euros from a total of 22 billion euros in outstanding loans to real estate developers into assets in order to gain access to the collateral and be able to sell it afterwards.
That is on top of 12.4 billion euros in real estate assets it held as of the end of 2018, and ranges from unfinished apartment blocks in Benidorm and villas on the Costa del Sol, to parking lots and offices in cities across Spain and undeveloped land in rural areas.
""Sareb was always going to end up being a real estate agency, sooner or later,"" a source at a Spanish real estate company, involved in transactions with the bad bank, said.
Some of this transformation was already under way via negotiations with developers but Sareb is now planning to speed up filing lawsuits against those who don't fulfill their payments, targeting a total of around 8 billion euros in loans. 
In 2017, it started these proceedings on loans worth 1 around billion euros but legal proceedings take time and can delay the moment they get access to the assets by up to four years. So far, Sareb says it has transformed 5.8 billion euros into assets.
When Sareb was set up, it targeted a return on equity of around 14%-15% but Beraza said market conditions meant the lender would not be able to deliver a positive return.
Ireland's National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was also initially seen as a liability when it was created in 2009.
But thanks to a recovery in the economy and property prices in Ireland, NAMA's 32 billion euro deleveraging program was 94% complete at the end of 2018.
Britain's 'bad bank' set up to manage more than 100 billion pounds ($127 billion) of assets repaid the last of its government loans this month.
CHANGE OF TACK
Sareb has been forced to change tack as rising competition from banks in shedding assets since 2017, with discounts ranging from 50% on foreclosed assets to over 70% on some fire block sales of non-performing assets, eroded its business plan. 
""We can't sell at the same discounts as those applied by the banks, and it looks like they're still going to hold that kind of discount for a while,"" Beraza said.
In 2018, Sareb reported a loss of 878 million euros, while revenues fell by 5%.
By the end of 2018, Sareb's assets were worth 34 billion euros. In 2014, Sareb brought in four external managers to manage its assets but among its new plans Sareb now wants to renegotiate the terms of its contracts with those managers.
The four managers are Haya Real Estate, which is owned by private equity fund Cerberus, and real estate services companies Altamira, Solvia and Servihabitat. The contracts with Altamira, Solvia and Servihabitat expire in 2021.
Haya was assigned a portfolio of 18 billion euros but its contract with Sareb expires in December and won't be renewed, Beraza told Reuters, adding that a new competitive process would kick off with non-binding offers expected by July.
Sareb, which wants to reduce fixed management fees and establish a performance fee dependent on property sales, has already sent a letter to Haya and the other three managers to invite them to participate under new conditions, Beraza said.
With this initiative Sareb aims to achieve around 300 million euros in cost savings by 2027, when Sareb is supposed to be wound down. The external managers declined to comment.
But achieving that could still be tough. Ratings agency S&P anticipates a slowdown in the Spanish real estate market, from an estimated 4.5% rise in house prices in 2019 to 3.4% in 2020.

That has led some real estate experts to express doubts that Sareb could offload its assets by the end of 2027.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 10:58AM ET</span>",Special Report: How judges added to the grim toll of opioids,"By Benjamin Lesser, Dan Levine, Lisa Girion and Jaimi Dowdell
WELCH, West Virginia (Reuters) - The opioid epidemic that has so far killed half a million Americans is routinely blamed on greedy drug makers, feckless doctors and lax regulators. But there’s another group that has contributed to the depth and duration of the catastrophe: judges.
Judges like Booker T. Stephens.
Until his retirement in May, Stephens sat on the West Virginia Circuit Court in Welch, deep in Appalachian coal country, where addiction took early root among miners who were prescribed the blockbuster opioid OxyContin for the pain their jobs inflicted. And it was in his court where the first lawsuit filed by a state against OxyContin’s maker, Purdue Pharma LP, landed in 2001.
West Virginia accused Purdue of duping doctors into widely prescribing the drug by minimizing its risks, convincing them it was less addictive than other opioids because just one dose delivered steady relief for 12 hours. In the pretrial “discovery” phase of the case, Purdue sent thousands of pages of internal memos, notes from sales calls on doctors, marketing plans and other records to the state’s lawyers who had requested them.
That evidence was clearly compelling: In a 2004 ruling, Judge Stephens rejected Purdue’s motion that he dismiss the case and sided with the state’s assertion that the material could convince a jury that Purdue’s sales pitch was full of dangerous lies.
But Stephens sealed the evidence on which he relied in that ruling. And when Purdue and the state reached a settlement that year, before the case went to trial, the evidence remained hidden, out of sight to regulators, doctors and patients. Over the next few years, as OxyContin sales and opioid-related deaths climbed, more than a dozen other judges overseeing similar lawsuits against Purdue took the same tack, keeping the company’s records secret.
It would be 12 years – and 245,000 overdose deaths – before evidence Stephens and other judges kept hidden was made public, and then only after it was leaked to a newspaper https://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1. What it showed was revelatory: OxyContin, the first billion-dollar-a-year narcotic, was not the reliable 12-hour painkiller Purdue long claimed it was. Its effects often wore off much sooner, exposing patients to a relapse of pain, withdrawal, or both – suffering relieved only by the next pill. When doctors raised concerns, the documents showed, Purdue sales reps counseled them to put patients on bigger, more dangerous doses.
The eventual release of the evidence reinforced the widely held view that OxyContin was a catalyst for the epidemic, which by then had expanded beyond prescription opioids to include illicit drugs such as heroin. The material also informed hundreds of new lawsuits seeking to force accountability on the entire opioid industry for its role in the addiction crisis.
But for untold numbers of opioid users who had overdosed, it was too late. “Heartbreaking and sickening” is how Congresswoman Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been involved in investigating the causes of the opioid epidemic, described the early decisions to seal the Purdue evidence. In an interview, Clark said she believes that had the secrets come out earlier, doctors would have written fewer OxyContin prescriptions and fewer insurers would have covered the drug. “We don’t know how many lives we could have saved,” she said.
Stephens told Reuters he doesn’t second-guess his decision. “It happened, and that’s all that I can say about it,” he said. “It speaks for itself.”
CONTINUING THE TRADITION
Today, 15 years after Stephens protected Purdue’s secrets, Federal Judge Dan Polster is providing the same cover for multiple opioid makers, distributors and retailers. He is presiding over a mass of litigation that seeks to hold the entire industry responsible for the epidemic. Life-saving information contained in those cases, too, may remain under seal, as Polster has stuck to a strict secrecy playbook.
Polster declined to comment for this article.
The trail of hidden evidence running through the opioid crisis is emblematic of a pervasive and deadly secrecy that shrouds product-liability cases in U.S. courts, enabled by judges who routinely allow the makers of those products to keep information pertinent to public health and safety under wraps. And since nearly all such cases are resolved before trial, the evidence often remains secret indefinitely, robbing consumers of the chance to make informed choices and regulators of opportunities to improve safety.
In an unprecedented analysis, Reuters found that over the past 20 years, judges sealed evidence relevant to public health and safety in about half of the 115 biggest defective-product cases consolidated before federal judges in so-called multidistrict litigation, or MDLs. Those cases comprised nearly 250,000 individual death and injury lawsuits, involving dozens of products used by millions of consumers: drugs, cars, medical devices and other products. And the numbers don’t convey the full extent of information locked away because they don’t include thousands of product-liability cases heard in state courts.
The impact is broad. Although secrecy makes complete analysis impossible, Reuters found that hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products after judges in just a handful of cases allowed litigants to file under seal, beyond public view, evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger.
For example, beginning in the early 1980s, judge after judge kept under seal evidence that the trigger on Remington Arms Co’s Remington 700 hunting rifle was prone to misfiring. In 2014, after decades of secrecy, a judge presiding over a class-action lawsuit in Missouri refused to seal the trove of documents, which showed that the company had been aware of the defective trigger since the late 1940s. By then, nearly 200 people had died from accidental shootings blamed on the problem. The company then recalled the defective rifles.
Thousands more people died in rollover accidents involving General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) cars and trucks while judges agreed to hide records showing the company knew that reinforcing vehicle roofs would save lives. After a decade of lawsuits in which those records were kept secret, a Los Angeles judge released the information in 2004 at the request of plaintiffs who wanted to share it with regulators. In 2009, the federal government upgraded a decades-old standard on roof strength.
Remington declined to comment. In a statement emailed to Reuters, GM said: “Advances in auto safety effectively addressed this concern many years ago … Also, it’s fair for individuals or companies to be able to request that certain sensitive or personal information be safeguarded.”
THE LAW AND THE REALITY
In fact, court records are presumed to be public as a matter of law. They can only be sealed for valid concerns about privacy, including personal medical records, and to protect company trade secrets.
In most states and nearly all the 13 federal appellate circuits, judges are legally obliged to weigh any litigant’s request that information be sealed against the broader public interest in making it public. They also must explain in the court record any decision in favor of secrecy. Judges incur no penalty for failing to do these things.
In practice, secrecy has become so ingrained in the system that judges rarely question it. In 85 percent of the cases where Reuters found health and safety information under seal, judges provided no explanation for allowing the secrecy.
Judge Stephens was bound by West Virginia law to weigh secrecy against transparency and provide in the court record his reasoning. Like many judges in his position, he did neither. “This case was sealed because both sides agreed and asked me to seal it,” he told Reuters.
That reasoning explains why secrecy has become the norm: It makes things easier for everyone involved. Corporate lawyers want to protect their clients’ reputations. Plaintiffs’ lawyers want to avoid miring their clients’ cases in lengthy courtroom wrangling over requests that filings be sealed or redacted. And judges want to keep the business of justice moving.
Secrecy is amplified by the growing practice of consolidating similar lawsuits under a single judge. MDLs, which now cover as much as 40 percent of all lawsuits filed in federal courts, are meant to promote efficient resolutions. Each decision the judge makes applies to all of the consolidated lawsuits. Thus, with one sealing order, a judge can impose secrecy in thousands of cases.
That is now happening in federal district court in Ohio, where Judge Polster is managing nearly 2,000 lawsuits filed against the opioid industry. Cities and counties across the country claim that companies up and down the supply chain – drug makers like Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals subsidiary and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, as well as Purdue, distributors like McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), and retailers like  Walgreen Co  (NASDAQ:WBA) – contributed to the public-health disaster by using misleading marketing and other ruses to boost sales at the expense of public safety.
So far, Polster has imposed a draconian secrecy on the proceedings. The judge, a former federal prosecutor confirmed to the bench in 1998, has given the litigants broad discretion to determine what records remain secret. As a result, entire lawsuits have been filed under seal in his court, including supporting evidence drawn from millions of records that detail the industry’s conduct over two decades.
All the companies have denied the allegations. Teva and McKesson declined to comment for this article. Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment. Janssen said its marketing of opioids was “appropriate and responsible.”
Privately held Purdue, controlled by the Sackler family, said that OxyContin “has been deemed safe and effective for 12-hour dosing,” that it has always given the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) all information the agency requires, that protective orders are routine, and that any suggestion the company used court-ordered secrecy to withhold relevant safety information about OxyContin is misleading and inflammatory. Purdue said it has spent more than $1.5 billion on efforts to solve the opioid crisis. ""These efforts, not the disclosure of Purdue’s internal documents, will help solve the complex opioid abuse crisis,"" it said.
A few states, including Texas and Florida, have adopted “sunshine” rules and laws that limit the sealing of health and safety records. At the federal level, corporate lobbying has stymied sunshine legislation for decades.
Opponents of sunshine laws often cite a 1991 Harvard Law Review article in which New York University law professor Arthur Miller wrote that no hard evidence showed that court secrecy caused any harm to public health or safety. “Research or statistical data is completely nonexistent,” Miller wrote.
In an interview, Miller said Reuters’ analysis of court data helps fill that void and suggests that judges are not fulfilling their responsibility to guard the public interest. “Certainly, anything relating to public health or things tied to social policy, you would want to have an explanation as to why something is sealed,” he said.
“THAT’S BANANAS”
In the years following the Purdue case, Judge Stephens watched the wreckage of opioid addiction flow through McDowell County Circuit Court: burglaries, robberies, assaults. Thursdays in the hilltop courthouse in Welch were usually spent dealing with parents accused of child abuse and neglect.
On one rainy Thursday last February, a clerk led a steady stream of mothers and fathers into Stephens’s chambers, where he decided whether their children could remain with them. “In almost every case, the parents are addicted,” Stephens said later. “We have parents who are now choosing drugs over their own children.”
When the state’s suit against Purdue came before him in 2001, the cumulative U.S. death toll from opioids since 1999 was 16,000, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Stephens, who served for more than three decades on the McDowell County court before his May retirement, still counts it as his most high-profile case.
During the discovery process, each side was obliged to send information requested by the other – including the Purdue documents describing the company’s development and marketing of OxyContin. That exchange is where secrecy gets its start in lawsuits.
For decades, the rules of civil litigation required that evidence collected during discovery be logged with the court, open to public scrutiny. Secrecy was the exception.
In the 1980s and 1990s, rule changes moved discovery out of the courthouse and thus out of public view. Instead, the material was to be swapped privately between the lawyers involved. Companies eager to keep their records confidential had pushed for the change, but it also served the interests of judges and court clerks inundated with increasingly complex product-liability cases and huge caches of documents accompanying them.
In the early 2000s, under the new discovery rules, Purdue’s lawyers sent the company’s documents directly to lawyers working for West Virginia, outside the court record and thus inaccessible to the public. This exchange occurred, as it almost always does, under the judge’s protective order that the material remain confidential.
Lawyers for Purdue filed a pretrial motion asking Judge Stephens to dismiss the case. West Virginia, to support its argument that the case should go to trial, submitted as evidence some of the documents Purdue had handed over in discovery.
Such evidence entered into the court record to support a pretrial motion is generally the only way, short of a trial, that discovery material is made public – though that evidence often represents only a tiny fraction of what’s produced in discovery. Here, too, secrecy prevailed. Lawyers for Purdue and the state agreed between themselves that the state would file its motion and supporting evidence under seal. Stephens did not evaluate the material to determine whether secrecy was warranted, as required by state law, and he provided no rationale.
“That’s bananas,” said Jennifer Oliva, a professor at West Virginia University College of Law. “He’s not allowed to do that without providing reasons.”
Judge Stephens was no rogue outlier. At least 16 other judges allowed internal documents produced by Purdue in lawsuits filed between 2001 and 2007 to be sealed without explanation. Court records make clear that evidence under seal pertained to Purdue’s marketing.
More broadly, in at least 31 of the 115 large federal product-liability cases Reuters reviewed, judges sealed entire arguments that dealt directly with the strength of the evidence. Court rules frown on such broad sealing practices because truly confidential information rarely spans an entire legal brief. In most of those cases, nothing in the court record indicates that the judge conducted any analysis of whether secrecy was merited.
Almost immediately after Stephens’s 2004 ruling that the evidence against Purdue was sufficient for the case to proceed to trial, Purdue settled with West Virginia for $10 million. Stephens left his sealing order intact. The evidence was locked away in a vault in McDowell County Courthouse. By the end of that year, opioid deaths neared 65,000.
Stephens told Reuters that he was simply honoring the litigants’ wishes. “Obviously when you settle a case of this magnitude and of this nature, Purdue Pharma would not want to let the world know they had engaged in deceptive marketing practices,” he said.
Frances Hughes, West Virginia’s chief deputy attorney general at the time, said the state agreed to Purdue’s sealing requests to get the evidence it needed and avoid a potentially lengthy court fight. “We were doing something that is very much routine and necessary when you are involved in litigation with a major corporation,” she said.
Many plaintiffs’ lawyers privy to evidence that could affect public health and safety told Reuters they had often employed a similar calculus. Bound by ethics rules to put their clients’ interests first, they want access to records that can help their cases. Demanding transparency can cause protracted delays.
Judges, while charged with guarding the public interest, also have large caseloads. At the federal level, their efficiency in handling those caseloads is measured by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the federal judiciary’s management agency, but judges aren’t formally penalized for letting cases drag on.
Many judges want to avoid getting bogged down in confidentiality battles, said Jeremy Fogel, who as a judge until last year managed the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, D.C., an agency that helps educate judges.
“You’re overburdened. You’ve got limited bandwidth. You have lawyers fighting about everything. And so, when they finally agree on something, you’re all too happy to accept that,” said Fogel, now head of the Berkeley Judicial Institute at the University of California.
As a result, he said, “information that could have really made a difference sometimes doesn’t come to light.”
LITTLE DATA, LITTLE SUNSHINE
In the years following Stephens’s ruling, Purdue benefited from the secrecy that had shrouded the West Virginia and similar cases.
The U.S. Department of Justice in 2007 brought criminal charges against Purdue, accusing it of lying in its marketing about how easy it was to abuse OxyContin by crushing the pills to get their full narcotic payload all at once.
In a filing in federal court in Abingdon, Virginia, Purdue reasserted its 12-hour claim: “When taken as directed, without tampering with the product’s controlled-release delivery system, OxyContin is indisputably safe and effective.”
Under a plea bargain, three Purdue executives admitted guilt but served no time. The company paid $600 million to resolve the case. The three executives later left the company.
Company records that dribbled out over the years generated newspaper and government reports about aggressive sales tactics. But evidence undermining Purdue’s claims about OxyContin remained locked away in courthouses across the country. And Purdue continued marketing its drug based on the contested 12-hour claim.
OxyContin sales surged, topping $2 billion in 2008. Opioid deaths climbed to 135,000 by the end of 2008. The next year, Purdue’s 80-milligram Oxycontin pill, the largest-dose version, was the company’s biggest moneymaker. That year, drugs – fueled by the spike in opioid overdoses – surpassed car accidents as a cause of death in the United States.
By then, Mississippi lawyer Philip Thomas was trying to bring information about Purdue’s marketing of OxyContin to the attention of regulators. Thomas represented Patricia Gwen Kiser, a nurse who alleged in a lawsuit against Purdue that her doctor had prescribed OxyContin for her fibromyalgia and arthritis pain based on the company’s false claims about the drug’s safety.
Purdue turned over more than 250 boxes of records to Thomas, designating most of the evidence confidential. Thomas asked Purdue to share just 21 of the documents – emails, meeting minutes and the script Purdue asked sales reps to use when pitching OxyContin to doctors – with the FDA. Purdue declined.
Thomas then asked Judge Linda Anderson, the judge hearing the case in federal court in Mississippi, to allow him to share the records with the regulator. Purdue resisted, arguing that the records were confidential trade secrets. Anderson, in a 2010 order, agreed with Purdue.
Anderson did not respond to a request for comment. In its statement to Reuters, Purdue said it provided “all or most” of the documents to the agency, though they “do not contain the type of scientific information” the agency usually relies on.
Some regulators have made efforts to counter the potential harm of court secrecy. In 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued guidance for judges on allowing exemptions in secrecy orders so that lawyers can share health and safety records with the agency. The Consumer Product Safety Commission followed suit.
The FDA has not. In a statement to Reuters, the agency said the current regulatory regime gives it “the tools to keep patients and consumers safe.”
The year after NHTSA issued its guidance, the agency opened an investigation into possible safety defects in Goodyear tires on thousands of motor homes. In its December 2017 announcement, the agency said the inquiry, which is continuing, was made possible, in part, only after an Arizona judge allowed the release of the tire maker’s records, including insurance claims and complaints data.
Goodyear declined to comment, as did NHTSA.
In the absence of such exceptions, lawyers or anyone else with knowledge of confidential evidence put themselves at risk if they share that information outside the confines of court.
David Egilman was an expert witness in a lawsuit alleging Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) & Co’s antipsychotic drug Zyprexa could cause excessive weight gain and diabetes. Egilman, a clinical professor of family medicine at Brown University, made Lilly records he had reviewed in the case available to the New York Times.
After the newspaper published articles https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/business/17drug.html based on the documents, Lilly threatened to seek criminal sanctions against Egilman. In 2007, he agreed to pay https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/business/08lilly.html the drug maker $100,000 to resolve the matter. About a year later, Lilly pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $1.4 billion to resolve charges it had illegally marketed Zyprexa.
Lilly declined to comment.
Egilman had that earlier experience in mind when he sought to shine a light on OxyContin, which he had prescribed to a few patients in the drug’s early days. While reviewing Purdue’s records as an expert witness in a lawsuit against the company, Egilman became convinced that doctors were getting the wrong message about OxyContin.
This time, he went to court to try to force Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley to release evidence her office had gathered during an investigation into Purdue’s sales practices.
Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Linda Giles took a dim view of his petition, asking Egilman’s lawyer during a 2012 hearing, “What’s his agenda?” and “You want me to believe he’s some noble citizen?”
Sensing the case wasn’t going his way, Egilman said, he agreed to withdraw his petition rather than risk establishing an unfavorable precedent with a ruling that evidence collected in a state investigation was confidential.
“I could have stopped this,” Egilman said in an interview. “I am morally and ethically responsible. I took an oath to protect my patients’ health, not corporate profits.”
Coakley and Giles declined to comment.
By the end of 2012, the opioid death toll stood at 223,000.
The evidence that OxyContin wasn’t the benign pain reliever its maker said it was remained locked away until 2016. That year, the Los Angeles Times published a report, based on copies of sealed records, detailing how Purdue sold OxyContin as a 12-hour drug, even though the company knew it often didn’t last that long.
The report cited the company documents that Stephens and other judges had long kept under seal, revealing that OxyContin wore off early in Purdue test patients and that physicians complained to sales reps about the problem. Gaps in a narcotic's effect can cause bouts of pain, withdrawal and relief known to foster addiction.
The sealed records further showed that despite what Purdue knew, it hired hundreds of sales reps to push OxyContin as a 12-hour drug because insurers would balk at paying top dollar for a pain reliever that was little different from cheaper alternatives.
After the Los Angeles Times report, Judge Stephens began releasing the records he had sealed in 2004 to news organizations that requested them, including Reuters. “I felt that it would be helpful to others who are going to pursue this type of litigation,” he said.
He was right. Many lawsuits against Purdue have cited the newspaper report and the original records.
When the opioid epidemic landed on Judge Polster’s docket in federal district court in Cleveland in late 2017, it had claimed 350,000 lives.
Blame for the public-health disaster was now directed at the entire industry – drug makers, distributors and retailers. The allegations in the hundreds of cases consolidated in Polster’s court remained consistent: The companies hyped opioids for everyday pain relief, downplayed their addictiveness, and then blamed the people who used them for getting hooked.
“What’s happening in our country with the opioid crisis is present and ongoing,” Polster told a courtroom packed with lawyers for a Jan. 9, 2018, hearing. “Since we’re losing more than 50,000 of our citizens every year, about 150 Americans are going to die today, just today, while we’re meeting.”
The judge said then, as he has said many times since, that he wanted the suits settled quickly so that communities ravaged by addiction can receive money to combat the crisis. “I don’t think anyone in the country is interested in a whole lot of finger-pointing,” Polster told the standing-room-only crowd. “People aren’t interested in depositions, and discovery, and trials.”
The tobacco industry settlement of 20 years ago, however, shows that when evidence is aired, it can have a big public impact. Under their landmark agreement with 46 states in 1998, cigarette makers paid $246 billion and divulged more than 26 million pages of records showing how they had manipulated nicotine to foster addiction and funded research to sway policy. That information formed the basis of public-health initiatives and regulatory action in 160 countries. Since then, smoking rates in the U.S. have plunged to historic lows.
Citing the tobacco archives, public interest lawyers recently filed a brief in Polster’s court asking that any resolution of the opioid litigation require the disclosure of all documents to promote research, changes in public policy, regulations and consumption.
In Polster’s court, as lawyers began fleshing out their cases against the opioid industry in amended complaints, they redacted details of the companies’ conduct. In almost every instance, Polster failed to provide on the record his reason for allowing the secrecy, though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which oversees his jurisdiction, has established precedent requiring that he do so.
A few courts, recognizing the breadth of the opioid crisis, have recently signaled a less tolerant stance on secrecy, putting them at odds with Polster.
Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Janet Sanders was presiding over a hearing in January on Purdue’s request to maintain hundreds of redactions in a lawsuit filed against it by the state. News organizations, including Reuters, had petitioned Sanders to lift the redactions.
Sanders reminded the lawyers that they were in the courthouse where records of child sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests had been sealed – until the Boston Globe petitioned the court http://archive.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories/012402_documents.htm for their release.
That case, she said, showed that even if the litigants on both sides want to keep evidence secret, the “court has to separately make a determination.”
Purdue’s lawyers argued that disclosure would stoke outrage and embarrass the company.
Noting the “tremendous” public interest in the information, Sanders said: “This material – some part of it or all of it – is going to come out one day. I’m not sure why it shouldn’t be sooner rather than later.”
Tony LaGreca, whose son fatally overdosed after becoming addicted to opioids prescribed for a football injury, was in the courtroom that day. “She was pretty awesome,” he said of Sanders. LaGreca said parents like him are eager for the world to see evidence placing some responsibility for addiction on the drug companies. “It should be all made public,” he said.
In an emergency motion filed in Polster’s Cleveland court, Purdue urged the judge to block Sanders from lifting the redactions. The Massachusetts lawsuit was full of details that could make the company look bad, a Purdue lawyer complained at a hearing, and the effort to get Judge Sanders in Boston to release them was an attempt to get around Polster’s secrecy order.
Polster sympathized. “I’m not very happy with the Massachusetts AG either,” he said. But he decided he didn’t have the power to overrule Sanders.
The next day, an unredacted version of the Massachusetts lawsuit was made public. The state used excerpts of emails between Purdue executives and board members and details from other records to bolster its main allegation: Purdue’s sales campaign was a “deadly and illegal scheme to deceive doctors and patients” that had contributed to at least 671 fatal overdoses in Massachusetts since 2009.
The unredacted material supported allegations that, after pledging reforms in the 2007 plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Purdue pressed doctors to prescribe OxyContin to the elderly and military veterans, groups vulnerable to addiction. The state also alleged that Purdue sought to boost prescriptions for bigger doses, even though a 2012 internal analysis acknowledged that the more potent pills ""very likely"" carried heightened ""dose-related overdose risk."" The underlying analysis remains under seal.
Purdue denies the allegations.
The unredacted material shows why doctors continued to write historically high numbers of OxyContin prescriptions even as deaths mounted, said Harvard Medical School professor Jerry Avorn. “It helps patients and doctors understand why so much OxyContin is being used.”
Judge Sanders declined to comment on the case. In product-liability cases generally, “the public has very much right to know what’s going on,” she said. “Transparency gives assurance that what’s going on is fair … There’s no hanky-panky. There are no agreements between the parties that are contrary to the public interest.”
Polster has since ratcheted up the secrecy in his court. He signed a Feb. 11 order that allows litigants to designate any document as “highly confidential – attorneys’ eyes only information.” That bars disclosure to anyone – even the mayors and other state and local officials the lawyers represent – without signed permission from Polster or the litigant who produced it.
Last week, the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rebuked Polster for his secrecy orders, after the Washington Post and the Gazette-Mail of Charleston, West Virginia, appealed his sealing of government data on the flow of opioids around the country.
The three-judge panel unanimously agreed that Polster had not stated adequate reasons for allowing parties to file documents under seal, not just about the government data, but beyond. They ordered him to do so. Polster ""is advised to bear in mind that the party seeking to file under seal must provide a ‘compelling reason’ to do so,” Judge Eric Clay wrote.

In the coming weeks, the plaintiffs will file their most extensive briefs yet about the opioid industry’s conduct. It will be up to Polster to decide what the public will be allowed to see.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",Former Deutsche Bank executive denies helping Bittar rig Euribor,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) managing director, charged with manipulating global Euribor interest rates, on Tuesday denied helping convicted trader Christian Bittar and said any assistance his team gave his former colleague was inappropriate.
Andreas Hauschild, who ran the bank's Frankfurt team responsible for rate submissions, told Southwark Crown Court he was unaware of such conversations in 2005 and that it was inappropriate to request rates to suit trading positions.
""This is not what you do ... it is not proper,"" the 54-year-old German said on his first full day in the witness box.
He said he first saw communications between Bittar, a former Deutsche Bank derivatives trader, and his team after prosecutors from the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) sent him documents about the case.
""I was in Turkey with the family on holiday (when those conversations took place),"" he said, as a court clerk showed the jury a photograph of the family holiday, which was developed in July 2005.
Hauschild also denied trying to manipulate Euribor submissions by selling cash in the market, by asking colleagues to help set rates that would benefit his own trading positions or by helping Bittar, when his former London-based colleague begged him to help influence rates in 2006.
He is charged with conspiracy to defraud over the alleged manipulation of Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate), a Brussels-based benchmark that helps determine rates on around $180 trillion of global financial contracts and loans.
Prosecutors allege bankers rigged rates to benefit trading positions, deliberately ignoring rules that they should be set independently of commercial interests.
Hauschild said he had little recollection of emails sent 14 years ago, but that he had tried to piece together what had been meant from trading records and other documents.
Hauschild, who was in charge of money markets in continental Europe and worked at Deutsche Bank between 1988 and 2006, picked out examples where his trading book was at odds with rate requests in the team or with Deutsche Bank's rate submissions.
In the seventh rate-rigging trial brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office, Hauschild is accused of conspiring with others at Deutsche Bank,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and other banks between January 2005 and December 2009.
Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average.
The jury has heard that Bittar has already been convicted over the conspiracy alongside one-time Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef, ex-Barclays senior rate submitter Colin Bermingham and former Barclays derivatives trader Carlo Palombo.

Walmart has made “positive developments” in monitoring its suppliers, the fund’s Council on Ethics said in a statement released Tuesday.
“Furthermore, the company engages actively in selected, high-risk areas in order to help bring about improvements in working conditions,” the council said in a letter. “There seem to be fewer reports of poor working conditions in Walmart’s supply chain now than there were before.”
The fund also decided to revoke exclusions to Grupo Carso SAB de CV, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)., Nutrien Ltd.,  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Ltd. and Rio Tinto Plc, as well as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico SAB de CV, according to a statement.
General Dynamics was let in from the cold after discontinuing the production of cluster munitions while Grupo Carso is no longer involved in tobacco, according to the fund. The exclusion of Nutrien was revoked after it ceased purchases from Western Sahara and Rio Tinto was taken off the list after it agreed to sell its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, reducing the risk of “severe environmental damage.”
Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, takes into account ethical rules encompassing human rights, some weapons production, corruption, the environment, coal and tobacco when deciding on its investments.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>","India warns foreign e-commerce firms like Amazon, Flipkart over discounts: sources","By Aditya Kalra, Devjyot Ghoshal and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has told foreign e-commerce firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart's Flipkart that they must ensure compliance with new foreign investment rules aimed at deterring them from providing steep online discounts, three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has said that while the government was prepared to listen to concerns about its new foreign direct investment rules (FDI), it was committed to protecting small traders from predatory behavior by foreign-funded companies, the sources said.
The comments were made by Goyal during a closed-door meeting on Monday with several e-commerce companies. It comes in a week when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is due to visit New Delhi - he is expected to arrive late on Tuesday - and trade tensions have heightened between the two countries.
India from Feb. 1 imposed new e-commerce FDI rules to help hundreds of thousands of small traders, but small businesses and a right-wing group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party say there are still issues. They allege big online retailers use complex business structures to circumvent federal rules, and still burn billions of dollars to offer discounts.
Amazon and Flipkart say they've complied with the rules and deny any wrongdoing. Both companies, and the U.S. government, protested against the rules in January, saying they would force firms to change their business structures, Reuters has reported.
Goyal during the Monday meeting defended the government's new FDI policy, saying the rules should in no way be violated by any company, both in letter and in spirit. The government will not allow e-commerce firms' discounting practices to affect small shopkeepers, Goyal said, according to three industry executives in attendance.
""The minister was clear and direct,"" said one of the executives.
Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy in a statement said the company looked forward to working with the government and Goyal had engaged ""in a candid, positive & progressive"" discussion. 
Amazon said it welcomed the ""open & candid discussions & the promise of continuing engagement"" with the government, adding it was committed to supporting various Indian government initiatives.
In a statement on Tuesday, the commerce ministry said it had formed a committee to hear grievances on issues related to FDI in e-commerce, adding it will ensure small retailers thrive in the country. It did not detail discussions around the question of steep online discounts.
E-COMMERCE, TRADE CONCERNS
The government brought in the new policy in February after complaints from small Indian traders who said the e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace in which they offered major discounts. Such practices are now prohibited.
The rules led to a brief disruption of Amazon's online operations in February and shocked Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which had just months before invested $16 billion in acquiring control of India's Flipkart in its biggest ever deal.
The United States government and American firms have voiced concerns about several recent Indian policies. Other than stricter e-commerce rules, India has demanded companies to store more of their data locally. In 2017, the United States lodged a written protest against India's decision to cap medical device prices.
Goyal has had a series of meetings since last week with foreign and Indian e-commerce firms and technology companies with an aim to iron out policy issues. He has also discussed what government press releases describe as ""threats"" local firms face from ""large foreign competition"".
On Monday, concerns around online discounts available on Amazon and Flipkart were discussed specifically during the meeting, with both companies asked by government officials about how they price products online, the sources said.
Amazon and Flipkart argued they provide logistics support and other services to small Indian retailers who use their e-commerce platforms to boost their businesses, said the third source who attended the meeting.

""Goyal said he doesn't want uncertainty for businesses ... he talked about having an inclusive policy that protects interests of all stakeholders,"" said one of the sources.

1609,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Most American-Made Cars Sold in the U.S. Are Japanese ,"(Bloomberg) -- While Donald Trump has been pressing for tariffs on foreign-made cars and parts, it turns out the most American-made cars sold in the U.S. today are usually Japanese.
The annual “American-Made Index” compiled by Cars.com found nine of the 15 most U.S.-sourced vehicles are manufactured by Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. The two Japanese automakers dominated the latest study thanks to the big number of popular vehicles they assemble in America and their high content of U.S.-made parts.
“It’s not surprising that there’s a lot of vehicles here from Honda,” Kelsey Mays, senior editor of Cars.com, said in an interview. About two-thirds of Honda’s cars are assembled in the U.S., which is more than General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Mays said. Toyota also sells mostly American-made vehicles in the U.S. market.
The 2019 study, published Tuesday, takes into account many of the issues Trump has stumped about when it comes to the automotive trade. Cars.com examined assembly location, parts sourcing as determined by the American Automobile Labeling Act, factory employment relative to sales and sourcing of engines and transmissions. The five factors aren’t equally weighed and Mays declined to give details of the breakdown.
Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep Cherokee SUV topped the list, and GM’s Chevrolet Corvette sports car placed fifth. But Japanese automakers dominated the ranking just as they did in 2018. The study, which debuted in 2006, was redesigned in 2017.
While Japanese nameplates are among the most American-made, some American brand icons are not in the Top 10. One common misconception involves Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s F-150, America’s longtime best-selling vehicle: Some 71% of respondents believed it to be the most American vehicle on the road, but Cars.com said it actually ranked No. 13.
Many U.S. consumers give preferential consideration to American-made vehicles, according to the survey. But nearly 50% of respondents said they were very or somewhat concerned about the impact of tariffs on their new car purchasing decisions.
Cars.com hasn’t seen a massive relocation of production in a way that would influence its rankings despite the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs on China and threats to do so on European and Japanese imports. Mays said Ford and GM have indicated “a few employment changes” because of the tariffs, but no automaker has significantly altered its assembly lines or supply chains in reaction to trade policy. Still, such changes could be coming -- and would likely raise costs for car buyers, he said.
The White House delayed imposing tariffs on imported vehicles from the European Union, Japan and other nations on May 17 for 180 days. Earlier this month, the administration denied a GM request to exclude its Chinese-made Buick Envision from a 25% import duty."

Retail sales in China is expected to grow 3.5% in 2019 to reach $5.29 trillion, much lower than a previous forecast of 7.5% growth to $5.64 trillion. 
The research firm had expected China to surpass the U.S. in retail sales this year, but based on the current growth projections China will overtake the U.S. in 2021 by about $93 billion, the report said. 
""The U.S.-China trade turmoil is even more of a concern for China now that domestic demand impacted one of the country's largest sectors: auto,"" eMarketer forecasting director Monica Peart said. 
""But with two simultaneous market challenges, retail sales may struggle to achieve the national growth target of 6% to 6.5% for the year.""
The firm forecasts U.S. retail sales to grow 3% this year amounting to $5.48 trillion. 
President Donald Trump in early May imposed additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. Trump earlier this month threatened more duties on Chinese imports if no deal was reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit, scheduled later this week in Japan.

China has a 21.1% share of the world's retail market, while the U.S. has a 21.9% share, the report said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Managers at Neil Woodford's suspended flagship fund were using ""flawed"" European Union rules to the full, Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday as he faced questions over the British regulator's role.
""They were using the rules to the full and they were not telling us they were doing that,"" Bailey told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
Retail investors were left unable to get their cash out of the fund run by Woodford, one of Britain's most high-profile money managers, after it suspended withdrawals in early June following a rise in redemptions. 
Bailey told lawmakers it was right to suspend the fund, but this would have been done earlier if the ""flawed"" European Union rules for funds were based on principles.
The FCA has opened a formal investigation into events surrounding the suspension and the listing of some of the funds' assets on a stock exchange in Guernsey.
The Woodford fund was worth around 10 billion pounds ($12.8 billion) at its peak in 2017, but has fallen in value to about 3.5 billion pounds, mainly due to redemptions, Bailey said.
It was ""not right"" to suggest that Link, which has responsibility for the management of the suspended Woodford fund, was any worse than other authorized corporate directors in ensuring asset managers comply with rules, Bailey said.
The FCA will also look at the role of  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS), the Woodford fund's depositary.

""Suspension is an important tool, it should not be demonized,"" Bailey said.

 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) announced plans last week to introduce a new global cryptocurrency called Libra as part of an effort to expand into digital payments.
Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that while there was room to improve cross-border money transfers, Libra had to follow anti-money laundering rules.
""The risks are increased by the anonymity that Libra users would have,"" Villeroy said in an interview with French weekly magazine L'Obs, adding that Libra would have to ensure transactions and users' data were fully secure.
""If the project seeks to go beyond payments to offering banking services like deposits, it will then have to be regulated like a bank with a banking license in all the countries it operates. Otherwise it would be illegal,"" he said.
France is using its year-long presidency of the Group of Seven nations (G7) to set up a task-force to tackle such concerns at an international level.

Green bonds are a growing category of fixed-income securities, which raise capital for projects with environmental benefits.
Although green bonds make up a small fraction of the overall bond market, they are attracting more attention because meeting emissions-cut targets will need trillions of dollars of capital from public and private sectors.
Cumulative green bond issuance has reached nearly $107 billion, according to the Climate Bonds Initiative, a London-based non-profit which promotes investment in the low-carbon economy.
Issuance has now reached $100 billion three times - the last time was in Sept. 2018. Forecasts for the final amount of issuance this year range from $180 billion to $250 billion.
""Reaching $100 billion in green bond issuance for the third time and so early in the year is welcome. However, the global climate finance challenge is to reach a $1 trillion in annual green investment early in the 2020s,"" said Climate Bonds Initiative Chief Executive Sean Kidney.
The former United Nations climate chief, Christiana Figueres, has said the financial sector should be aiming to reach $1 trillion a year of green bond issuance by 2020 to support international goals to decarbonize economies.
So far this year, the largest corporate bonds issued have been by French utility Engie at $1.7 billion, Korean petrochemicals firm LG Chem at $1.6 billion and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China at $1.5 billion.
In terms of country issuance, France and the United States have issued the most green bonds so far this year. Last month, the Netherlands launched a $6.7 billion green bond.

In the 12 weeks to June 16, Sainsbury's sales fell 0.6%, market researcher Kantar said.
In contrast, sales were flat at market leader  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), slipped 0.1% at Asda and dipped 0.5% at No. 4 Morrisons.
However, all the big four lost share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, whose sales grew 9.3% and 7.5% respectively.
Sainsbury's, which had its proposed 7.3 billion pound ($9.3 billion) takeover of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) owned Asda blocked by the Britain's competition regulator in April, is due to issue an update on first quarter trading on July 3. 
Sainsbury says Kantar underestimates its general merchandise market share, saying it has streamlined its general merchandise range in favor of the range offered by Argos, which it acquired in 2016, and Kantar does not capture Argos' sales.
Kantar said Sainsbury's halved the rate of sales decline it registered last month as it attracted more affluent shoppers.
Sainsbury's shares, which fell 4% on Monday, were down another 0.4% on Tuesday, extending losses for the year to 40%. Shares in Tesco and Morrisons both fell more than 2%.
Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said Sainsbury's performance was its best since January.
""Whilst Sainsbury's till roll is still falling, this is clearly a step in the right direction. A few more of these data points could spark a new wave of optimism,"" he said.
Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe is under pressure to show the group can prosper on its own after the Asda debacle. He said in May he would improve stores, cut prices on daily essentials and invest in online to restore sales growth. 
TOUGH COMPARATIVE
Kantar said overall UK grocery sales were up 1.4%.
""The modest level of current growth is thanks in no small part to the wet start to the summer, with last year’s heatwave and the run up to the men's FIFA World Cup making 2018 a difficult year to top,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.

Grocery inflation over the 12-week period was 1.0%. Kantar said prices were rising fastest in markets such as crisps, bottled cola and dog food, while falling in instant coffee, fresh bacon and detergents.

BMW's efforts to optimize the environmental impact of hybrid cars with engine cut off functions, comes as the auto industry struggles to sell purely electric vehicles, which accounted for only 1.5% of total car sales globally last year.
People have shied away from buying purely electric cars because of a lack of charging stations, and because they have a limited operating range and longer recharging times than combustion-engined variants.
Scaling up adoption of electric cars has proven difficult because cities are struggling to make costly investments into their electric infrastructure to ensure that new charging stations can handle powering up vehicle batteries at scale. 
Even Germany's Ruesselsheim, home to carmaker Opel, needed to apply for state aid to build 1,300 charging stations.
Hybrid vehicles have the ability to recharge the electric battery while operating in combustion-engine mode, a function which eases customer anxiety about limited operating range, and takes pressure off cities to expand charging infrastructure. 

BMW's new hybrids will have the cut off function from 2020 onwards and cities, including Rotterdam in the Netherlands, say the function has proven to be an effective way to cut pollution.

1621,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Gold Miners Get Their Day in the Sun,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Gold mining stocks are finally getting their day in the sun.
The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners (NASDAQ:RING) ETF, which we’ll take as a rough proxy for the sector, has hit a three-year high this week, tracking the surge in world bullion prices. It’s now up 28% since the end of May alone. Bullion, despite hitting a six-year high this morning, is up only 11% in the same timeframe.
Part of the reason is catch-up: gold itself never fell out of favor with global investors to the same extent that gold mining companies have done in the past three years. But while gold is a relatively straightforward investment that is priced off fairly transparent developments in monetary policy, jewelry demand and the asset management policies of central banks, each company has its own operational and governance risks, often complicated by political risk in the jurisdictions where they operate.
The problems are illustrated by the woes of U.K.-listed blue chip Acacia Mining (LON:ACAA), which was spun off from Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) in 2010 and which mines mainly in Tanzania. On the face of it, the company has a fine resource base and access to all the expertise of its parent company. However, it’s been unable to export gold-bearing ore from Tanzania for two years due to a dispute with the government.
Barrick’s attempts to solve the issue – by offering to buy out minority shareholders and by negotiating directly with Tanzania on Acacia’s behalf – appear to have made the situation even worse: Acacia issued a 5,000-word statement attacking its parent on Monday, blaming it for its troubles with the government and accusing it of trying to buy back its asset on the cheap.
That partly explains why Acacia is up only 3% this year, although it's up 3.3% this morning, helped by perceptions that it is still cheap. By contrast, the largely scandal-free Harmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY), which operates largely in South Africa, is up 25%. Likewise, Russian-based miners  Petropavlovsk  (LON:POG) and  Polymetal  (LON:POLYP) - despite past incidents with minority shareholders - are up 56% and 19%, respectively, profiting from a lull in the hostile rhetoric coming out of the U.S. toward their home country.
The market applies sharp discounts miners’ resource bases – Acacia's market value is $983 million, while just its proven and probable gold reserves are worth over $7 billion at current prices, and it has hundreds of millions of dollars more in silver and copper by-product on its books. Miners with more speculative projects can trade even more cheaply. That means that the upside for investors can be enormous. However, there are reasons why gold itself is considered the safe haven, rather than the companies that produce it."

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were spooked by Iran tensions and trade jitters on Tuesday, while the risk of more dovish talk from the Federal Reserve inflated gold to six-year highs and stoked demand for safe-harbor currencies like the yen and Swiss franc.
Taking a dramatic step to increase pressure on Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order imposing sanctions on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other top officials.
The move is a further worry for investors waiting anxiously to see if anything comes of Sino-U.S. trade talks later this week, with sentiment not helped after a senior U.S. official said president Donald Trump would be happy with ""any outcome"" from the trade talks with China. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3%, with the technology sector bucking the trend on the back of Capgemini's purchase of engineering and digital services company Altran for 3.6 billion euros ($4.10 billion). 
Capgemini shares rose 7% and those in rival SAP SE (DE:SAPG) 0.3%, pushing the sector around half a percent up. Altran surged 21%.
""Our view is that because of the very high global economic uncertainty markets have become very twitchy and can move a long way on not much news like Trump's meeting with Xi at the G20,"" said Gerry Fowler, global multi-asset strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""At the moment, the data looks okay but the sentiment has deteriorated and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year,"" he added.
Trump is slated to meet one-on-one with at least eight world leaders at the G20 summit in Osaka, including China's President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Chinese investors seemed none too hopeful as Shanghai blue chips slipped 1%. That led MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.4%. 
Japan's Nikkei lost 0.4%, while S&P 500 e-minis edged down 0.2%. 
FED SPEAKERS
There are no fewer than five Fed policy makers speaking on Tuesday, including Chair Jerome Powell, and markets assume they will stick with the recent dovish message. 
""It's always possible the chair could walk back some of the market's dovish interpretation of last week's FOMC meeting...but we suspect he will reinforce the message laid out last week,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), a senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets.
""By the end of July, we believe the Fed will have seen enough to decide that action to counter downside economic risks and low inflation/inflation expectations is warranted, and so we look for a 25 basis point rate cut at the next FOMC meeting."" 
Markets are running well ahead of that. Futures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing and imply around a 40%chance of a half-point move. 
A total 100 basis points of cuts are implied by mid-2020, a major reason two-year yields are well under cash at 1.715%. 
GOLD SOARS 
Yields on 10-year Treasuries have dived 120 basis points since November and, at 1.99%, are almost back to where they were before Trump was elected in late 2016. 
German 10-year bund yields hit a new record low of 0.332%, down 2 basis points on the day. 
The dollar has fallen for four sessions in a row against a basket of other currencies to stand at a three-month low of 95.989. 
""USD DXY now looks likely to break through the March low of 95.76 and below there 95.0,"" said Tapas Strickland, a markets strategist at NAB. 
""The drivers here continue to be heightened expectations of the Fed cutting rates - now 3.1 cuts priced by years' end,"" he said, noting that a number of index trackers showed the dataflow from the United States was now showing more disappointing misses than Europe. 
The euro hit a three-month high of $1.1412, having gained 2.0% from a two-week low of $1.1181 touched a week ago as the dollar has lost steam. It last stood at $1.1396. 
Against the safe-harbor yen, the dollar hit its lowest since the January flash crash at 106.79. Dealers also noted a report from Bloomberg that Trump had privately mused about ending the postwar defense pact with Japan. 
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell to its lowest in nine months and was last at 0.9755.
The pullback in the dollar combined with lower yields globally lit a fire under gold, which touched a six-year top. The metal is up 12% in the past month at $1,1433.16 an ounce. [GOL/]

ZURICH (Reuters) - Spain's Allfunds Group is buying Credit Suisse's business-to-business investment fund platform InvestLab for an undisclosed sum as the investment services industry consolidates to reap the benefits of scale. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will take a stake of up to 18% in the combined business, the two companies said on Tuesday. It will also receive an undisclosed cash payment. 
The Swiss bank said the transaction would result in a 0.5% increase in return on tangible equity (RoTE) this year, which Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said suggested the sale price ""had to be relatively high"". 
Even so, the analysts said the deal to combine what essentially are digital fund supermarkets would have little impact on the operating business at Credit Suisse.
""This transaction is really a sideshow"" for Credit Suisse, Zuercher Kantonalbank's Javier Lodeiro said, adding the gross margin for the combined Allfunds-Investlab business from assets under custody was probably ""extremely thin"".
Allfunds calls itself the world's largest institutional fund distribution network and said the combination with Credit Suisse InvestLab would offer 78,000 investment products to financial institutions across more than 45 countries, with assets under management topping 500 billion euros ($570 billion).
Credit Suisse is exiting control amid consolidation in a technology-driven business area where scale has grown more important, creating opportunities for Allfunds to bulk up.
Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and private equity investor Hellman & Friedman bought Allfunds in 2017 from  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) Group, Santander (MC:SAN) Group, General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus. 
""Going forward, Credit Suisse will utilize the combined business platform to distribute mutual funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds),"" the Swiss bank said in a statement.
InvestLab has about two dozen employees, who will retain their jobs with the transaction, a spokesman said. 
""The combination will allow Allfunds to accelerate and expand its investment into the development of new services and solutions to the benefit of the funds eco-system, comprising of asset managers, fund distributors and other intermediaries,"" Allfunds said. 
""With this arrangement, Allfunds continues its global expansion into new territories while consolidating business ambitions in Asia and Central Europe,"" Allfunds added, saying Switzerland would become a key business hub following the deal, which is due to close in early 2020. 

InvestLab offers distributors access to over 46,000 products from more than 170 providers worldwide, with assets under management topping 140 billion Swiss francs ($144 billion).

(Reuters) - The multi-billion euro merger of two of Europe's big business consultancies capped losses for its major stock markets on Tuesday as Middle East tensions and doubts about the chances of progress in U.S-China trade talks this week weighed on sentiment. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index dipped 0.13% in the first hour of trading, but the technology sector was up around half a percent on the back of Capgemini's purchase of smaller rival Altran for 3.6 billion euros.
After three weeks of solid gains that have reclaimed almost all of a May sell-off that generated European shares' worst monthly performance in more than two years, sentiment remained shaky. 
President Donald Trump targeted Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other top officials with sanctions on Monday in a move Tehran said closed the path to diplomacy between the countries.
A U.S. official also said on Monday that Trump was ""comfortable with any outcome"" from talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping when they meet at a G20 summit this weekend, cooling hopes for a substantive breakthrough. 
""The U.S. ... communicated that the market shouldn't put up their hopes too high for the coming G20 meeting,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, a senior market economist at Rabobank. 
""The maximum that can be achieved is a temporary truce like they did last time where they also decided to stop at least raising tariffs further."" 
Capgemini shares rose as much as 7% as dealers welcomed the acquisition of Altran, which the company expected will contribute to its earnings from year one. Shares in Altran itself surged 21.2% to reflect the selling price.
In other M&A news, SMCP fell 0.3% as the French fashion group agreed to buy men's luxury clothing company De Fursac, in a deal which it said would boost its earnings and fit in well with its other existing brands such as Sandro.
The banking sector, tumbled 1%, the most among major European sectors as euro zone government bond yields stayed moored near record lows ahead of a handful of speeches by U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers, including Chair Jerome Powell. 
The Fed is facing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to cut rates sharply in the face of a slowing economy and markets now believe firmly that the panel will do so in July.
Any indication to the contrary would be likely to drive up short-term bond yields while also weakening stock markets, whose rally this month has been driven by expectations of more stimulus from both the Fed and the European Central Bank.
""A lot of the central bank news is priced into equities and investors are now taking a step back to evaluate why central banks have turned more dovish,"" said David Holohan, a strategist at Mediolanum Asset Management in Dublin. 

""We are dependent on Asia in a lot of ways to generate growth because Europe continues to be quite sluggish, US is cooling, and unfortunately Asia is where a lot of tariffs are aimed at. ... Does that not mean earnings multiples need to be lower and prices drift down? Valuations are quite high.""

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd on Tuesday threw cold water on hopes for a quick fix to strained relations with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), saying inequality between the partners could unravel their two-decade-old automaking alliance.
Speaking at Nissan's annual general meeting in Yokohama, Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said he wanted to preserve the spirit of equality - in an alliance whose shareholding structure Nissan has long seen as lopsided.
During a three-hour affair peppered with heckling, shareholders returned Saikawa to the automaker's board as widely expected and in defiance of opposition from proxy advisors. The executive now faces the task of repairing trust with Renault, which has deteriorated in past weeks as the French automaker has sought more control within Nissan.
Tuesday's meeting, the first since the ouster last year of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, comes just days after Saikawa and Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard resolved an unusually public disagreement over appointments to Nissan's new governance committees.
""We want a win-win relationship with Renault. The alliance has been successful until now because we have respected each others' independence,"" said Saikawa.
""If necessary, we will put our capital structure on the table. If the relationship becomes a win-lose one, the relationship will break up very quickly.""
The comments are some of the starkest in recent memory and signal Nissan's deepening concern over the alliance, in which Renault owns 43% of the Japanese automaker, which in turn holds a 15%, non-voting stake in its partner.
Saikawa also said Nissan would ""postpone discussions"" on the future direction of the alliance as the automaker prioritized recovery of its dismal financial performance.
France's finance ministry, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15% stake, declined to comment on Saikawa's comments.
FRAYING TRUST
Shareholders at Japan's second-biggest automaker voted in favor of a new governance structure and 11-member board to address lax auditing revealed after the arrest of Ghosn over financial misconduct allegations he denies.
Renault had demanded additional representation on Nissan groups overseeing company auditing and personnel nominations. The move was widely speculated to be a reprisal after Nissan abstained from endorsing Renault's doomed merger plan with Italian-American peer Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
Saikawa had initially pushed back at those demands, but late last week Nissan granted seats to Senard and Renault CEO Thierry Bollore on its nominations and auditing committees respectively, even though Nissan itself will not be represented.
The automakers' deteriorating ties were highlighted by a shareholder who accused Senard, who serves as vice chairman of Nissan's board, of failing to look after the interests of Nissan and its employees as promised when he took up his role in April.
In response, Senard told shareholders: ""Since I arrived, I have done everything I can to smooth the relationship of an alliance that I found in a much worse state than I thought.""
""I had no intention to be aggressive towards Nissan,"" he said. ""I beg you to believe me on that.""
ALLIANCE VISION?
Saikawa won a reprieve on his leadership, fighting off a rare public rebuke by international proxy firms International Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, which earlier this month urged shareholders to vote against reappointing the former Ghosn lieutenant as director.
Still, people at both automakers have said the recent public disagreements have dissolved the image of unity the automakers promoted only months ago, raising questions about whether Saikawa, Senard and former Ghosn ally Bollore are the right people to break from Ghosn's legacy in the longer term.
Some Nissan shareholders at the meeting said they were concerned that Saikawa has been overly focused on rebuffing Renault, rather than finding ways to cooperate with its partner to achieve the ""win-win relationship"" he promoted on Tuesday.
""There are so many alliance-related issues which are occupying the company that it's a shame that Nissan is unable to focus on bigger, external issues"" like improving global competitiveness, shareholder Hideyuki Tamura said after the meeting.

""It's not to say we need to merge, but I'm worried that our leadership may be lacking a forward-looking vision of the alliance.""

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. furniture company RC Willey Home Furnishings is so concerned that new global clean air rules will cause transport disruption that it brought forward the shipment of arm chairs and sofas from China by two months.
The tougher regulations, set by the United Nations shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), come into force on Jan 1. Costs will rise for ships towards the end of this year and there will be a knock on effect for trucks and other transporters that move goods around the world.
For shipping companies it is the biggest shakeup in decades and adds to the pressures of an economic slowdown and the threat of an escalating trade war between the United States and China. 
While consumers are not expected to pay more for goods, higher transport bills and disruption to company deliveries could further dent economic growth. 
Ship owners must cut sulphur emissions to 0.5% from 3.5%. They can do this by using low-sulphur fuel, installing exhaust gas cleaning systems or opting for other, more expensive, clean fuels such as liquefied natural gas or traveling more slowly. 
Jeff Child, president of Berkshire Hathaway’s RC Willey Home Furnishings, moved the delivery of about 450 containers from September and October to July and August. He wants to avoid any disruption in the peak fourth quarter as ships prepare for the changes, including refitting equipment. 
""We just don’t want to get caught in a situation where it affects our inventory,"" he told Reuters.
Analysts say the container industry, which transports consumer goods such as sofas, designer clothes and bananas, will be one of the worst hit with extra costs of about $10 billion.
The world's two biggest container shipping lines - Denmark's Maersk and Swiss headquartered MSC - say they face annual extra costs of over $2 billion each. Twenty-five logistics company executives told Reuters they would pass along any IMO-related costs, such as ship upgrades or more expensive fuel, to customers. 
""The sulphur cap will further put pressure on ocean freight rates and we... will have to pass those costs on to remain competitive,"" Peder Winther, global head of ocean freight with Swiss transportation company Panalpina Group said. 
TRUCKERS WORRIED
Economists say manufacturers are expected to absorb their part of the cost and are unlikely to raise the price of consumer goods, but the hit to companies could be a drag on the world economy. 
A Nestle S.A. spokesperson said the food group was talking to transport companies about ""fuel adjustment methodology"" to reflect the impact of the new rules. 
""Higher fuel prices would result in higher transport costs,"" said Peter Nagle, an economist with the World Bank's Development Prospects Group. ""This would have the potential to lead to slower economic growth and trade."" 
Trucking companies will also suffer. The IMO rules do not apply to them but they will face new competition from ships for lower sulfur fuel. This is expected to push up the price of diesel fuel for trucks by as much as 100 percent.
Small to mid-sized truckers may find it tough as they lack the clout to negotiate fuel deals or to recoup the costs. 
""I’m at the whim of the market. All I can do is let the customers know what’s going on,"" said Mike Baicher, president and chief executive of New Jersey based West End Express, which runs 90 trucks in New York, New Jersey and along the East Coast.
""There is only so much that the trucking company can absorb."" 
In a letter sent to top U.S. government officials including National Security Advisor John Bolton, transport associations including trucking groups said there was consensus that U.S. transport industries would be ""negatively affected by IMO 2020 pricing pressure"". It said there could be market disruptions. 
""There’s a storm approaching but we don’t know how bad the storm is going to be,"" said Glen Kedzie, energy and environmental counsel for the American Trucking Associations.
""YOU'RE GOING TO PAY""
Shipping and freight forwarding companies, who offer a service overseeing the delivery of goods from beginning to end, expect to feel more cost pressure. 
Bart de Vries, chief operating officer for air & sea with U.S. headquartered Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, expects to pay more for services as shipping companies pass along the costs. 
Some companies may overhaul their business plans.
""It will undoubtedly force many exporters and importers to review their sourcing strategies and vendors,"" said Cas Pouderoyen, senior vice president of ocean freight with global logistics company Agility 
Richard Fattal, co-founder of digital freight forwarder and logistics provider Zencargo, said there could be as much as a 10 to 20% rise in overall operating costs next year. 
Allen Clifford, a U.S.-based executive vice president with MSC, said at a recent forum in California that his company was facing huge expenses.

""Who’s going to pay for it? You’re going to pay for it. Because I’m tired of paying for it,"" he told industry executives, and port and customs officials.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>","Australia's Domino's Pizza sued for underpaying staff, shares slide","By Shriya Ramakrishnan
(Reuters) - Australia's Domino's Pizza Enterprises was hit on Tuesday by a class-action lawsuit over employee underpayment which the fast-food chain said it would defend itself against, but its shares fell more than 6% to a four-year low.
The suit, filed by law firm Phi Finney McDonald in the Federal Court of Australia, alleges that Domino's misled franchisees by telling them not to pay delivery drivers and in-store workers wages as per industry standards.
According to the Australian Fair Work Commission, fast food employees are entitled to a minimum weekly wage of A$813.60 ($565.86).
The suit was filed on behalf of Australian employees who were employed as delivery drivers or in-store workers between June 24, 2013 and January 24, 2018, Phi Finney McDonald said.
The claim alleges that benefits mandated under the Fast Food Industry Award 2010 like casual loading, travel costs, penalty rates, mininum three-hour shifts and laundry allowances among others were systematically avoided by Domino's.
“Domino’s workers should have been paid under the Award, but they were not. It is only fair that Domino's pay employees what they’re owed,"" Brett Spiegel, principal lawyer at Phi Finney McDonald, said.
The law firm added that the misconduct was revealed through an investigation spearheaded by the Retail and Fast Food Workers’ Union (RAFFWU).
“Some workers are owed tens of thousands of dollars. It’s nothing short of a disgrace,"" said secretary of RAFFWU Josh Cullinan, as quoted in the law firm's statement.
A spokesman of Domino's Pizza Enterprises, which is the largest franchisee of the Domino's Pizza brand outside the United States, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It posted a 9.2% fall in its first-half net profit in February. The company had also said it expected earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for fiscal 2019 to be at the lower end of its guidance range of A$227 million to A$247 million.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.6% and 1.1% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.2%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.5%. South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 slipped 0.1%.
Due to a lack of directional drivers today, traders are turning their focus to the upcoming G-20 summit in Japan this weekend. Sentiment remained fragile as analysts do not expect much progress to be made during the meeting after the U.S. put five more Chinese firms under its trade blacklist this week.
China's Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said Beijing wants the U.S. to stop “inappropriate actions” against Chinese firms.
“We hope the U.S. side, under the principles of free trade and the spirit of WTO (World Trade Organization) principles, can cancel these inappropriate measures against Chinese companies, and remove them from the entity list. This has benefits for both sides,” said Wang in a press conference on Monday.
Trump said he expects a good meeting with Xi, but warned earlier that China must return to concessions it made in earlier rounds of talks before the two sides could make a deal.
China’s Ministry of Commerce today released a statement and said the country’s Vice Premier Liu He had spoken to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on the phone this week.
They discussed trade and agreed to maintain communications, according to the statement.
Meanwhile, White House officials confirmed on Monday that Trump will also meet with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the summit."

Meng, 47, the daughter of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on charges alleging she misled global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company in Iran.
She has denied any wrongdoing, and Huawei pleaded not guilty in a New York court in March, but the matter has sparked tensions between China, which has demanded her release, and Canada.
After Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians and later formally charged them with espionage. Canada says the arrest of the two men was arbitrary. China has also blocked imports of Canadian canola seed and has increased scrutiny of pork.
In a statement, Meng's lawyers said they sent a letter to Justice Minister David Lametti asking him to withdraw the extradition proceedings.
""The extradition proceedings are without merit and cessation of the proceedings would be in the best interests of Canada's national interests,"" the statement said.
The ministry said it ""cannot confirm receipt of the letter,"" adding only that Canada ""respects the rule of law"" and was following its extradition procedures.
Earlier this month, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland dismissed a suggestion that Ottawa block the extradition, saying there has been no political interference and that doing so would set a dangerous precedent.
Meng's Canadian lawyers said neither Canada nor the United States had jurisdiction in the matter and that Meng's extradition was sought for ""political purposes.""
The case against Meng and Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, has also ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington. The world's two largest economies have been waging almost a year-long trade war.

U.S. President Donald Trump said in December he would intervene with the U.S. Justice Department if it would help secure a deal with China.

1636,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",Trump Muses Privately About Ending Postwar Japan Defense Pact,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has recently mused to confidants about withdrawing from a longstanding defense treaty with Japan that he thinks treats the U.S. unfairly, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Trump regards the accord as too one-sided because it promises U.S aid if Japan is ever attacked but doesn’t oblige Japan’s military to come to America’s defense, the people said. The treaty, signed more than 60 years ago, forms the foundation of the alliance between the countries that emerged from World War Two.
Even so, the president hasn’t taken any steps toward pulling out of the treaty, and administration officials said such a move is highly unlikely. All of the people asked not to be identified discussing Trump’s private conversations.
Exiting the pact would jeopardize a postwar alliance that has helped guarantee security in the Asia-Pacific, laying the foundation for the region’s economic rise. It would also risk spurring a fresh nuclear arms race as Japan would need to find another way to defend itself against threats from China and North Korea. Under the terms of its surrender in World War Two, Japan agreed to a pacifist constitution in which it renounced the right to wage war.
Meeting With Abe
The president will make his second trip to Japan in a matter of weeks on Wednesday when he travels for the Group of 20 summit in Osaka. He’s expected to again meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who enjoys as good a relationship with the mercurial and unpredictable American president as any foreign leader.
Yet as with many U.S. allies, there are growing tensions between the countries over Trump’s attitude toward trade. The president has said he may enact tariffs on imports of foreign cars, calling them a threat to national security -- an allegation called preposterous by automakers and many U.S. lawmakers.
It’s unsettled in American law whether the president can withdraw from a ratified treaty without congressional approval. President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 without lawmakers’ consent.
Trump regards Japan’s repeated efforts to move a large U.S. military base in Okinawa as a sort of land-grab, the people said, and has raised the idea of seeking financial compensation for American forces to relocate. Trump’s focus on the U.S. defense pact with Japan may foreshadow broader scrutiny of American treaty obligations across the world, two people familiar with the matter said.
The president has said in private conversations previously that he has Japan’s back and is aware of the U.S.’s obligations under the treaty. But, as with his stance on other multilateral agreements, he wants the relationship to be more reciprocal.
“The U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger,” Trump told sailors and Marines last month aboard the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship at the naval base in Yokosuka, shared by the U.S. and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces. “This remarkable port is the only one in the world where an American naval fleet and an allied naval fleet headquartered side by side, a testament to the ironclad partnership between U.S. and Japanese forces,” he said.
At the same time, the president has long expressed skepticism of arrangements such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the Paris climate accord, both agreed by President Barack Obama, and has re-negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The U.S. defense treaty with Japan was first signed in 1951 along with the Treaty of San Francisco that officially ended World War Two. The defense pact, revised in 1960, grants the U.S. the right to base military forces in Japan in exchange for the promise that America will defend the island nation if it’s ever attacked.
For decades after the war, Japan refrained from developing offensive capabilities such as long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons. But Abe, a relatively hawkish leader, believes his nation should take a more robust role in its own defense. He pushed through a controversial interpretation of the constitution to allow Japanese forces to come to the aid of allies.
Japan is buying advanced F-35 fighter planes from the U.S. and will fly some of them off warships effectively refashioned as aircraft carriers, its first since the war. In May, the country’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party recommended the government eventually raise defense spending to about 2% of gross domestic product, in line with NATO recommendations for its members and a threshold Trump has said should be a minimum for U.S. allies.
‘Cornerstone of Peace’
There are presently about 54,000 U.S. military personnel based in Japan, a permanent troop presence that allows the U.S. to more easily project force across the Pacific. U.S. Forces, Japan, calls the arrangement “the cornerstone of peace and security in the Pacific” on its website.
It isn’t clear how those forces would be affected if Trump withdrew from the treaty. The president has frequently complained that U.S. allies hosting American bases don’t pay enough money for what he considers a privilege, and he could seek to negotiate a new or revised treaty that entails more Japanese financial support for the U.S. military presence.
While the president did not refer to the base by name in his recent conversations, there has been a running dispute surrounding Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa. The American presence has been controversial for more than two decades, since three servicemen raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl in 1995. Local people still attribute the presence of the base to higher rates of crime and accidents in the area, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.
Withdrawing U.S. forces entirely from Japan would hand a strategic victory to American adversaries China and North Korea.
James Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, said he doubts the U.S. will withdraw from the treaty with Japan.
“There’s nothing that says we have to abide by treaties for all eternity,” Carafano said. “I just doubt we will revisit U.S. policy on the U.S.-Japan strategic alliance,” which he also referred to as the “cornerstone” of U.S. foreign policy in Asia.
Abe reached a deal in 2013 with Obama to move the base out of Okinawa as early as 2022 if a replacement could be constructed. But Trump believes the land underneath the base is valuable for development, and has told confidants the real estate could be worth about $10 billion, the people said.
He considers the situation another example of a wealthy country taking advantage of the U.S., the people said."
1637,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO's Lawyers Urge Canada to End Extradition Process,"(Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer urged Canada’s justice minister to end extradition proceedings, arguing that he has the power to withdraw a process that’s been politicized by the U.S.
Meng Wanzhou’s defense wrote to Minister of Justice David Lametti, saying it’s in Canada’s national interest to reject the U.S. request and to free Meng, who’s been living under house arrest in Vancouver since her detention last December.
Under Canada’s extradition law, Lametti has the discretion to withdraw the proceedings against Meng at any time, the lawyers say. Doing so would be an extremely rare intervention and would effectively abort a lengthy court process that usually ends up with the person being handed over.
“These extradition proceedings are unique,” Meng’s Canadian lawyers said in an emailed statement Monday. “The factual and legal underpinning for Ms. Meng’s extradition are without precedent in Canadian law.”
The Canadian department of justice didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
The U.S. accuses Meng of tricking banks into conducting more than $100 million worth of transactions for Huawei that may have violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng faces multiple criminal charges in the U.S., including bank and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiring to obstruct justice, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
Her lawyers are arguing for Canada to end the case by citing reasons similar to those they’ve already raised in preliminary hearings at the Supreme Court of British Columbia: that her alleged conduct wouldn’t have the grounds to prompt a criminal prosecution in Canada and that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump indicate that the case is politically motivated.
“There could never be jurisdiction to prosecute Ms. Meng in Canada: Canada does not police the conduct of foreign persons in foreign lands that have nothing to do with Canada,” the lawyers argue in the statement.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has said Meng’s case must follow Canadian due process and rule of law.
“It would be a very dangerous precedent indeed for Canada to alter its behavior when it comes to honoring an extradition treaty in response to external pressure,” Freeland told reporters earlier this month.

1638,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 08:30PM ET</span>",Head of Thai Bank Whose Stock Surged Shuns Risky Lending,"(Bloomberg) -- Tisco Financial Group Pcl, Thailand’s top performing bank stock this year, is becoming wary of risky lending practices as the Southeast Asian nation’s economy slows.
The bank is focused on asset quality and may fail to achieve its 2019 loan growth target of 5% amid intense competition in the car credit sector and central bank mortgage curbs, Chief Executive Officer Suthas Ruangmanamongkol said.
“The competition in retail lending is unreasonable and risky, with firms offering zero down-payment and low-rate loans,” Suthas said in an interview in Bangkok on Monday. “Asset size and loan growth is not our priority. We’re trying to prevent risky lending that could cause major problems.”
The Bank of Thailand has repeatedly flagged concerns about financial stability following an extended period of low borrowing costs, and is expected to refrain from cutting rates on Wednesday despite a marked economic slowdown. Lenders will tighten standards as the challenging outlook puts the spotlight on asset quality, according to a report from the monetary authority.
“Thai banks are likely to struggle to achieve even tapered-down loan growth targets for the year, unless they bring down their credit underwriting standards,” said Diksha Gera, a senior industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The consumer-lending proportion of bank credit in Thailand has risen substantially since 2011, pushing up consumer leverage and posing asset quality risks.”
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy expanded at the weakest pace since 2014 in the first quarter as exports, tourism and investment moderated.
Tisco Financial’s total return of about 32% in the past six months is one of the best in Asia among the region’s larger banks, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
A dividend yield of roughly 8% is one of the reasons why investors have turned to the stock, according to broker KT Zmico Securities Co. The yield is the highest among the Thai stock exchange’s publicly traded commercial banks.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>","For Japan Inc, discretion is the better part of activist valor","By Tomo Uetake
TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan enters the busiest period of its annual general meeting season, shareholders will submit a record number of proposals to companies amid signs activist efforts to instigate change among conservative corporates are bearing fruit.
But while overt and direct activism has stepped up, it's the less combative behind-the-scenes lobbying, much of which takes place before the public meetings are held, that is having some of the greatest impact on governance changes.
The most visible example of that change is scandal-hit medical equipment maker Olympus Corp, which will become Japan's first major firm to give a U.S. activist fund a seat on its board this month.
""Companies are much more willing to listen to shareholders and take action in response to shareholder engagements,"" said Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based hedge fund Oasis Management. 
""You're seeing more independent directors on board, more companies getting rid of their poison pills, more buybacks and increased dividends. It's all happening.""
About two-thirds of firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange hold their AGMs this week.
Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking says the number of companies that have received shareholder proposals during this year's peak AGM season is a record 54. That's more than last year's 42, which was also a record, although all of those submissions were ultimately rejected.
Of note this year is the gradual withdrawal of some proposals as activists confer privately with companies to quietly get their demands met.
Toshiba Corp is a case in point. In March, New York-based King Street Capital Management sent a letter to the CEO to propose a slate of directors to replace the Toshiba board. It had previously intended to submit a shareholder proposal for its AGM, scheduled for Wednesday. 
But behind-the-scenes discussions with King Street and other funds resulted in Toshiba announcing last month an overhaul of its own proposal of board members to include more external and even non-Japanese directors for the first time in 80 years.
""There is a lot more going on than the number of shareholder proposals implies,"" said Kengo Nishiyama, a senior analyst at Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research. ""I think behind-the-scenes engagement will become the mainstream of Japan's activism.""
CHANGING ATTITUDES
Analysts say softer activism is one factor driving the shift in companies' attitudes. Also helping are Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to improve governance and a corporate recognition that investors reward companies that shake up their management.
Olympus' share price has climbed more than 40% year-to-date, making it one of the top three performers in the benchmark Nikkei average. That in part follows its decision in early January to grant San Francisco-based investment fund ValueAct Capital a seat on its board. 
In contrast, firms that outright knock back shareholder demands are punished. On Friday, Kyushu Railway Co's shares slumped 4.5% after shareholder proposals made by New York-based Fir Tree Partners and supported by other firms were rejected.
That reality has prompted change.
Sojitz Corp's CEO, Masayoshi Fujimoto, took part in another first-of-its-kind shareholder forum, alongside activist investors and a government representative, that the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan held earlier this month.
""We hope to attract more long-term shareholders,"" the trading firm said. ""For that, we think it's important to reach out to foreign institutional investors.""
The shift away from a zero-sum game approach to activism comes as funds see some change as better for shareholders than no change.
""Our aim is not to win the vote at AGMs. We are happy as long as our portfolio company's value gets a boost in any way,"" said Tsuyoshi Maruki, founder and chief executive of Tokyo-based activist fund Strategic Capital.
Oasis's Fischer said his fund withdrew most of its planned proposals before the AGMs after meaningful behind-the-scenes engagement with companies.
Some long-only investors also say they feel the activist approach is now more in line with their thinking.
""I noticed several cases where activist funds have made the same demands as us. This is something new, something that hasn't happened a year ago,"" said Archibald Ciganer, co-head of Japanese equities at U.S. asset manager T.Rowe Price.
Another sign of corporate change is an increase in firms' share buybacks, which are expected to hit a record this year. Share buybacks worth 5.57 trillion yen ($52 billion) have been announced by 519 companies so far, much higher than the 2.84 trillion yen by 365 in the same period last year, according to the data compiled by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
CLSA's Japan strategist Nicholas Smith says while public rows at AGMs benefit few investors, confrontational engagement still plays a role in driving change.

""When having discussions, it's important to remind companies that if they fail to be reasonable, activists do have other measures they could employ,"" Smith said. ""It is crucial that AGM proposals do not become paper tigers.""

Trump also announced new sanctions on Iran, designed to get the Islamic Republic to renegotiate its nuclear agreement from a few years ago. So far, Iran has refused to negotiate.
In the meantime, the S&P 500 was off 0.2% on Monday. The Dow Jones industrials rose 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.24%. Futures trading suggests the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 index will move only a little going forward. The Dow could push up perhaps 60 points.
Something to watch: the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Thursday and reached a new interim high on Friday. But the Dow, the Nasdaq and other indexes have not followed through. The Dow ended Monday off 0.8% from its all-time high set in October. The Nasdaq Composite is off 2.1% from its all-time high reached at the end of April.
The market was supported by tech stocks, materials stocks and consumer staples stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which hit a 52-week high. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) also hit 52-week highs.
On the downside were health-insurance companies, such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).
Energy shares, including  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were lower.
Discretionary stocks also fell. One was Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), which had been up as much as 45% for the year as of Friday. Ulta, which sells beauty products and operates salons, was off 3.1% Monday after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it was starting a service to sell beauty products to professionals. Amazon saw a modest gain on the day.
There was a big deal to cheer the lovers of big deals. Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR), the big casino operator, agreed to merge with Eldorado Resorts (NASDAQ:ERI) in an $8.6 billion, cash-and-stock deal. Caesars was up 14.5%; Eldorado fell 10.6%. 
Interest rates continued to move lower. The United States 10-Year yield fell to 2.02%, the lowest level since November 2016. News reports have suggested the interest-rate decline has unleashed new refinancing demand among homeowners and interest in home buying. The declines reflect an investor bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting at the end of July. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitoring Tool  suggests a rate cut is certain at that meeting, with a 73% chance of another rate cut in September.
Crude oil was lower for much of the day, but rebounded near the end of the session. WTI futures finished up 47 cents at $57.90 a barrel. Brent futures, the global benchmark, were off 34 cents to $64.86, but cut its loss considerably.
Gold Futures continued to surge above $1,400 an ounce, settling at $1,418.20 an ounce. There was speculation the metal could drive above $1,500.
Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
Gaming companies Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and mining giant Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM) were among the top S&P 500 performers.
Pharmaceutical-maker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), railroad equipment maker Wabtec (NYSE:WAB) and biotech giant Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) were among the S&P 500 laggards on the day."
1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 06:05PM ET</span>",Ex-Venezuelan oil minister asks U.S. court to set aside $1.4 billion judgment,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Former Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez asked a federal judge in Houston on Monday to set aside a $1.4 billion default verdict against him in a fraud suit brought by a defunct Houston oil company, according to court documents.
Ramirez, who was Venezuela's oil minister for 12 years and later served as its foreign minister and U.N. ambassador, said Harvest Natural Resources Inc and HNR Energia BV had failed to properly serve him notice of the lawsuit.
""Given that Ramirez was not properly served and that he lives in Europe out of the public eye, his default was not willful, and he has acted as expeditiously as he could to address the default in light of the issues caused by his being abroad,"" a court filing said. 
Dane Ball, a partner with law firm Smyser Kaplan & Veselka LLP, which represents Harvest, declined to comment.
U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal issued the default judgment on Feb. 13 after Ramirez did not contest Harvest Natural Resources' claims, according to an opinion accompanying the ruling. [nL1N20926M] 
Harvest's suit claimed Venezuela had refused to allow the company to sell its assets in the country since 2012, leading it to lose $472 million. It accused Ramirez and others of seeking a $10 million bribe to approve the transaction. 
Rosenthal initially awarded Harvest $472 million in damages in December, an amount he tripled in February.
Shares in Harvest ceased trading in May 2017 and the company began a three-year process of liquidating assets and winding up remaining issues from the close of the business. 

Ramirez was appointed energy minister by late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in 2002, serving in that job until 2014. He was briefly foreign minister under President Nicolas Maduro and later was the country's ambassador to the United Nations, but left after being accused of corruption by Venezuelan officials amid a purge of executives at state oil firm PDVSA.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 05:33PM ET</span>","U.S. tariffs on China-made consumer tech goods seen cutting sales, delaying upgrades","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumers will delay or forgo technology upgrades if President Donald Trump imposes a new round of 25% tariffs on Chinese goods, slowing the U.S. innovation engine, technology industry executives said on Monday.
Trump's administration is preparing to levy tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese imports after a public comment period ends on July 2 if the U.S. and Chinese presidents cannot relaunch talks to end their trade war. 
The two countries have been at odds since July 2018 over a host of U.S. demands that Beijing adopt policy changes that would better protect American intellectual property and make China’s market more accessible to U.S. companies.
Consumer technology products, including cellphones, laptop and tablet computers, smart speakers and video gaming consoles, would make up $167 billion of that $300 billion total, or more than half the target list, said Sage Chandler, vice president of international trade for the Consumer Technology Association.
Chandler told a hearing on the tariffs hosted by the U.S. Trade Representative's office that imposing the tariffs would raise the retail price of cellphones by an average of $70, while the price of laptop computers would rise by $120 and video game consoles by $56.
""A lot of consumers will look at that and say: 'I'll just wait for the next generation.' That's a lot of money for the average consumer,"" Chandler told Reuters.
Chandler, whose association represents major tech groups including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), told the hearing the proposed tariffs would extend a ripple effect that would spread through the U.S. economy.
""Because technology is now the backbone of so many other industries - from agriculture to manufacturing - taxes on technology hit far beyond the technology industry,"" Chandler said.
Win Cramer, founder and chief executive of JLab Audio, a California-based maker of Bluetooth wireless headphones, said he added eight employees after the company's products were spared from the previous round of tariffs. But Cramer said he may have to lay off some of those people, as a 25 percent tariff would shrink sales.
""The proposed tariffs on products that make up 80 percent of our business would be catastrophic. We would be forced to lay off employees and raise prices to consumers,"" he said. ""The factory jobs that build our products never existed in America."" 
Other company executives from industries ranging from food equipment to fashion products repeated a refrain from five days of hearings last week - that they relied heavily on China for production and it would be extremely difficult and costly to shift their supply chains to other countries, taking two to three years to do so.

Christine Robins, chief executive of Georgia-based gas barbecue grill maker Char-Broil LLC, said the tariffs would force the company to raise prices, increasing the risk that large retailers would try to cut costs by contracting directly with Chinese factories for private-label grills and ""squeeze out"" established U.S. brands such as Char-Broil.

(Reuters) - WarnerMedia on Monday said it appointed Ann Sarnoff as the chief executive officer of Warner Bros, the first woman to run one of Hollywood's most powerful studios in its 96-year history. 
Sarnoff, currently president of BBC Studios Americas, will take over the studio behind ""Wonder Woman,"" ""Friends"" and the Harry Potter franchise, following a scandal involving its previous studio chief.
“I want to work closely with colleagues across WarnerMedia and make the whole more than the part,” Sarnoff said in a phone interview. “I want to take what is a very successful legacy and history and make it even stronger going forward.” 
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), the second largest U.S. wireless carrier, acquired Warner Bros as part of its $85 billion purchase of Time Warner last year. Some Warner Bros content will be distributed on a new WarnerMedia streaming service set to launch in early 2020. 
The former chairman and CEO of Warner Bros, Kevin Tsujihara, resigned from the studio in March, following a report that the married executive had sought help securing roles for an actress after the two had sex. Tsujihara's attorney denied the executive played a ""direct role"" in the actress' hiring.
Sarnoff will report to WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey. 
“Ann has shown the ability to innovate and grow revenues and has embraced the evolution taking place in our industry,"" Stankey said in a statement. 

Sarnoff has also held leading executive roles at the National Basketball Association, Viacom and Dow Jones.

(Reuters) - An Oklahoma judge on Monday approved a revised $85 million settlement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd resolving claims by the state's attorney general that the drugmaker helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The decision by Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman in Norman, Oklahoma came after the state's attorney general, governor and top lawmakers resolved a dispute over how the money should be deposited and spent. 
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter struck an initial settlement with Teva on May 26, just days before the Israel-based drugmaker was set to face trial alongside Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which is continuing to fight the case.
The settlement resolved claims that Teva and other drugmakers helped cause the epidemic by marketing opioids as safe and effective for everyday pain while downplaying their addictive qualities.
The case is one of around 2,000 by state and local governments seeking to hold drugmakers responsible for an epidemic the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says led to a record 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017.
Teva's deal came just days before the Israel-based drugmaker was set to face trial in the case, and two days after Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that required funds recovered in lawsuits by the state to be deposited into the state's treasury.
The law followed criticism by state legislators that money from an earlier, $270 million settlement in the case with Purdue Pharma LP in March was not deposited in the state's coffers for lawmakers to determine its use.
Instead, nearly $200 million of that March settlement went toward creating an addiction treatment and research center at Oklahoma State University.
Under Teva's initial settlement, the $85 million was to be deposited into a court-controlled account pending the outcome of J&J's trial.
Hunter's office argued Teva's settlement should be combined with any money J&J must pay to help remedy, or abate, what the state says is a public nuisance that will cost $17.5 billion to remedy over 30 years. J&J denies the allegations.
But Stitt and Republican leaders of the state's legislature argued any funds should be deposited directly with the state's treasury.
Under the revised accord, money from Teva's settlement would be deposited in a fund with the state and only be used to address the opioid epidemic, subjected to future legislation, according to court papers. Teva did not admit wrongdoing.

Shares of Sally Beauty Holdings, which targets industry professionals, sank 17%, while those of Ulta Beauty Inc fell about 3%. 
They are the just the latest to suffer from Wall Street's concern about moves by the world's largest retailer into a series of niche or more regulated markets.
Last year, U.S. pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers such as CVS, Walgreen and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) lost billions in market value when Amazon took its first step into online pharmacy by buying https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pillpack-m-a-amazon-com/amazon-to-buy-pillpack-in-potentially-disruptive-drug-retail-push-idUSKBN1JO1RU small existing player PillPack.
Amazon typically uses its scale and online profile to offer a wider range of products at lower prices, putting pressure on margins of existing players.
""Currently, stylists often travel to multiple cosmetology supply locations to get necessary supplies,"" Jefferies analysts said. ""We expect Amazon to quickly become an important enough channel for brands to carry their top offerings on the platform.""
Amazon said stylists would need to upload their state-issued licenses and create a business account to buy products from the new store, which the company said would stock brands including Wella Professionals and OPI Professional.
Its entry will directly threaten about 19% of Sally Beauty's operating profit and an additional 33% was likely see pressure from more competition, according to DA Davidson analysts. 
Ulta, however, will see lesser pain as it sells mostly cosmetics and styling tools, which account for only 19% of total sales, the analysts said.
The companies did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.

Shares of the e-commerce retailer were trading 0.2% higher at $1,913.16.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged lower on Monday as losses by healthcare companies overshadowed gains in the technology sector, while investors awaited U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit this week.
The Nasdaq slipped but tariff-sensitive industrials, headed up by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, led the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average to a nominal advance.
While the bellwether S&P 500 ended the session in the red, it remained within a hair's breadth of its all-time closing high reached last Thursday as markets reacted to a dovish statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Market players hope Trump and Xi will de-escalate the trade war that has been blamed for a global economic slowdown.
""Today's very quiet,"" said Bruce Monrad, chairman and trustee at Northeast Investors Trust in Boston. ""People are digesting the Fed and looking forward to possible outcomes of the G20 and how that could in turn affect the Fed going forward."" 
A Fed rate cut in July ""may be locked and loaded but could be somewhat contingent on what happens at the G20,"" Monrad added.

Six of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 lost ground, with the biggest percentage drop for energy stocks as crude prices fell.
In the latest trade-related squabble, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) apologized for mistakenly returning a Huawei phone to its sender, after misrouting packages from the Chinese tech firm last month. The move provoked the ire of Chinese authorities and raised the prospect of FedEx being added to China's ""unreliable entities"" list. The package delivery firm's shares slid by 2.7%.
Caesars Entertainment Corp jumped 14.5% on news that rival Eldorado Resorts Inc had agreed to buy the casino operator for $8.5 billion. Eldorado dropped 10.6%.
United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) advanced 1.1% after Cowen & Co upgraded it to ""outperform"" from ""market perform.""
 Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) slipped 5.5% after Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co announced that its planned $74 billion deal to buy the drugmaker was expected to close at the end of 2019 or beginning 2020, later than expected. Bristol-Myers fell 7.4%. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.27-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 42 new highs and 82 new lows.

1649,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO’s Lawyers Urge Canada to End Extradition Process,"(Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer urged Canada’s justice minister to end extradition proceedings, arguing that he has the power to withdraw a process that’s been politicized by the U.S.
Meng Wanzhou’s defense wrote to Minister of Justice David Lametti, saying it’s in Canada’s national interest to reject the U.S. request and to free Meng, who’s been living under house arrest in Vancouver since her detention last December.
Under Canada’s extradition law, Lametti has the discretion to withdraw the proceedings against Meng at any time, the lawyers say. Doing so would be an extremely rare intervention and would effectively abort a lengthy court process that usually ends up with the person being handed over.
“These extradition proceedings are unique,” Meng’s Canadian lawyers said in an emailed statement Monday. “The factual and legal underpinning for Ms. Meng’s extradition are without precedent in Canadian law.”
The Canadian department of justice didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
The U.S. accuses Meng of tricking banks into conducting more than $100 million worth of transactions for Huawei that may have violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng faces multiple criminal charges in the U.S., including bank and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiring to obstruct justice, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
Her lawyers are arguing for Canada to end the case by citing reasons similar to those they’ve already raised in preliminary hearings at the Supreme Court of British Columbia: that her alleged conduct wouldn’t have the grounds to prompt a criminal prosecution in Canada and that comments by U.S. President Donald Trump indicate that the case is politically motivated.
“There could never be jurisdiction to prosecute Ms. Meng in Canada: Canada does not police the conduct of foreign persons in foreign lands that have nothing to do with Canada,” the lawyers argue in the statement.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has said Meng’s case must follow Canadian due process and rule of law.
“It would be a very dangerous precedent indeed for Canada to alter its behavior when it comes to honoring an extradition treaty in response to external pressure,” Freeland told reporters earlier this month."

Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) fell 2.7%, adding to its nearly 11% slump on Friday, when the marijuana giant reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss per share of C$0.98 and revenue of C$94.1 million, up 313%.
The company attributed the surge in revenue to “value-added products, extraction services, and clinic partners,"" but the revenue growth was more than offset by a ramp up in costs, weighing on margin growth.
Gross margin for the quarter fell to 16% of net revenue, down from 34% of net revenue a year earlier, which CFO Mike Lee blamed on ""operating expenses for facilities not yet cultivating or facilities that had underutilized capacity.""
Looking ahead, some on Wall Street expect Canopy to improve margins, even as costs will likely climb as the company ramps up manufacturing and processing to boost output.
While BMO said it believes Canopy's gross margins will improve, analysts expressed some doubt on the contribution to growth from edibles and vapes.
The bank also questioned the company's ability to hit its C$1 billion run-rate guidance by the end of fiscal 2020 as the operating expenses required to ramp manufacturing and processing could be higher than planned."

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - H2O, one of French bank Natixis' asset management businesses, has sold off some illiquid assets and removed entry fees across its funds as it tries to stem outflows of customer money.
The business, which contributed about 11% of Natixis' net income last year, said on Monday the move had led it to mark down the value of its funds by as much as 7%.
Around 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) was pulled from H2O funds last week after rating company Morningstar put one of its funds under review, citing concerns over liquidity and governance. That sent Natixis shares tumbling. Such concerns were also raised in a Financial Times report.
Concerns about liquidity in funds that allow investors to get their money back on a daily basis have risen recently, particularly in Britain where money manager Neil Woodford was forced to suspend trading in his flagship fund.
H2O, which manages around 31 billion euros ($35 billion), said it had sold part of its non-rated private bonds. It did not give details, but said the aggregate value of the bonds represents less than 500 million euros as of Monday.
The speed with which H2O has acted to reduce less liquid assets contrasts with Woodford, whose flagship fund has a much greater exposure to unlisted companies and has yet to fully update on its sale process.
Natixis said separately it backed the decisions taken by H2O and would bring forward a planned audit of H2O.
The bank also reaffirmed its confidence in its operating model, which involves buying majority stakes in asset management companies and allowing them a degree of independence at the same time as plugging them into Natixis' distribution platform.
Natixis shares closed up 0.7% on Monday.
Natixis' affiliates, which include U.S. firms Loomis & Sayles and Harris Associates, currently manage combined assets of 855 billion euros. H2O manages about 3.7% of group assets.
KBW analyst Jean Pierre Lambert said information on the H2O website showed outflows from its funds of 1.4 billion euros between Tuesday and Thursday last week, suggesting outflows could have neared 2 billion euros by the end of the week.

(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) has apologized for another Huawei delivery ""mistake,"" reigniting Chinese ire and drawing the fire of state media which suggested the U.S. delivery firm could end up on China's upcoming list of companies that harm national interests.
The firm on Sunday said it returned a package - identified as containing a Huawei phone - due to an ""operational error,"" and that it would deliver all products made by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to addresses other than those of Huawei and affiliates placed on a U.S. national security blacklist.
China's foreign ministry on Monday nevertheless asked for a full explanation. Technology news outlet PCMag, formerly known as PC Magazine, reported that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. Fedex returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a ""U.S. government issue"" with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported.
The incident comes as Chinese authorities investigate FedEx for misrouting packages sent by Huawei last month. Meanwhile, China is also drawing up an Unreliable Entities List of foreign firms, groups and individuals.
The list mirrors the U.S. Entity List that Huawei was added to in May, essentially barring it from buying U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. The U.S. added more Chinese entities to the list on Friday.
The Beijing News, a municipal government-run newspaper, in an editorial on Monday, said FedEx had misinterpreted the U.S. ban and called on U.S. firms to be ""rational"" and not to over-react.
FedEx rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) also confirmed it would not ship to Huawei addresses on the Entity List but had no ""general ban"" on Huawei products.
A Huawei spokesman said the Chinese firm was not currently using either FedEx or UPS services. On Sunday, Huawei tweeted it was not within FedEx's right to prevent the delivery and said the courier had a ""vendetta.""
UNRELIABLE
The latest incident sparked renewed criticism of FedEx on Chinese social media, with the topic ""FedEx apologizes again"" trending on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog platform.
State-run newspaper Global Times on Sunday tweeted that FedEx is likely to be added to China's Unreliable Entities List.
Neither China's commerce ministry nor FedEx responded to Reuters' requests for comment on the likelihood of FedEx being added to the list. State news agency Xinhua previously said authorities' investigation into FedEx misrouting Huawei packages should not be regarded as retaliation.
Being in the ""crosshairs"" of the Chinese government ""is a tremendous headwind and risk"" for FedEx, Trip Miller, said managing partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a FedEx position valued at roughly $7 million.
""Can you imagine if FedEx was banned from doing business? China could get our attention pretty quick if it did something like that,"" said Miller, adding that such a move would significantly disrupt global trade networks.
FedEx's operational error comes against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world's two biggest economies. The United States and China have been engaged in a trade fight for nearly a year on issues such as tariffs, subsidies, technology, regulations and cyber security.

A telephone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi JinPing last week, as well as confirmation the two will meet in Japan on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit, have rekindled hopes of a detente.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dismissed calls for a break-up of the world's biggest social network and other big internet companies on Monday, saying this would not tackle issues such as privacy, attempts to influence elections or harmful content.
""Just because it is difficult to regulate the internet doesn't mean policy makers should jump to the alternative of wishing these companies away,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, said in a speech on Monday in Berlin.
Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has almost 2.4 billion monthly users, is firmly in the cross hairs of regulators and faces calls from some government officials for penalties or to be forcibly broken up.
""The internet does need competition and it does need regulation ... we want to work with governments and policymakers to design the sort of smart regulation that fosters competition, encourages innovation and protects consumers,"" Clegg said.
Last week seven U.S. Senate Democrats asked the Trump administration to disclose details of possible Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department antitrust investigations into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Reuters and other outlets reported the agencies were gearing up to investigate whether the firms misuse their market power.
While it was large in absolute terms, Facebook's share of the global advertising market was still ""relatively small"", said Clegg.
The former British deputy prime minister was hired to help deal with a global backlash against Facebook over its mishandling of user data and not doing enough to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Facebook raised more concerns last week when it said it plans to launch a new global cryptocurrency.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of companies like Facebook and Google, saying they suppress conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence. 
Clegg also said in his speech on Monday that the West should move fast on new rules or see countries like China and Russia determine the internet's future.

""If the West doesn't engage with this question quickly and emphatically, it may be that it isn't ours to answer. The common rules created in our hemisphere can become the example the rest of the world follows,"" he said.

The surprise move sent Bristol's shares down 4.3% in morning trading, while Celgene fell nearly 4%. 
Bristol announced its plans to buy Celgene in a cash-and-stock deal in early January to bring together the companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever. It had said it would close the deal in the third quarter of 2019.
However, now it expects the merger to close by the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020.
The divestiture is subject to further review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and requires Bristol to enter into a consent decree with the agency, Bristol said. 
In March, the FTC had sought additional information from the companies as it focused on their psoriasis treatments as part of its review of their planned merger.
Otezla brought in revenue of $1.61 billion for Celgene in 2018. Bristol is also developing a treatment for the condition and in September reported positive results from a mid-stage trial of its plaque psoriasis drug.
""The company is continuing to develop its promising immunology pipeline asset, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, in several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis,"" Bristol said in a statement.
Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the divestiture came as a surprise to the brokerage and can be seen as a sign that the FTC is being tougher on regulating competition.
Bristol said it remains actively engaged in discussions with the FTC on continued review of its offer to buy Celgene.
Separately on Monday, Bristol said its blockbuster cancer treatment Opdivo failed to meet the main goal of statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients in a late-stage study.

The companies have submitted a formal application for the merger clearance by the European Commission, Bristol said.

1665,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 11:19AM ET</span>",Billionaires From Soros to Pritzker Heirs Urge Wealth Tax,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the richest people in the U.S. are calling for a federal wealth tax.
Financier George Soros, heiresses Liesel and Regan Pritzker, Abigail  Disney  and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). co-founder Chris Hughes are among those calling for the levy to help address income inequality and provide funding to address climate change and public health issues.
“We are writing to call on all candidates for President, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, to support a moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1% of Americans -- on us,” according to a letter signed by 19 individuals -- one anonymously -- and posted online Monday. “The next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans.”
Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke support the idea, according to the letter. Warren has proposed a 2% tax on assets of $50 million or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1 billion. It is estimated to generate nearly $3 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years.

The wealth tax isn’t embraced by all Democrats because many believe it would be difficult to assess objectively the value of wealth like artwork and jewels. There are also concerns that such a tax is unconstitutional because the federal government is prohibited from taxing property, only income.
The New York Times reported on the letter earlier Monday.
Some of those signing have already expressed concerns about America’s rising inequality. Hughes has evangelized for higher taxes on the rich in his book “Fair Shot.” Disney, whose grandfather and great-uncle founded Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co., recently called Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger’s $65.6 million compensation package “insane.”
Another signatory, entrepreneur Nick Hanauer, first warned his “fellow zillionaires” about the country’s growing wealth divide in 2014, writing that “there is no example in human history where wealth accumulated like this and the pitchforks didn’t eventually come out.”
Such inequality has only deepened. Last week, Bernard Arnault joined Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as the third person with a fortune of at least $100 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, whose 500 members have a total net worth of $5.5 trillion, up from $4.9 trillion two years ago.

(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) has apologized for another Huawei delivery ""mistake,"" reigniting Chinese ire and drawing the fire of state media which suggested the U.S. delivery firm could end up on China's upcoming list of companies that harm national interests.
The firm on Sunday said it returned a package - identified as containing a Huawei phone - due to an ""operational error,"" and that it would deliver all products made by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to addresses other than those of Huawei and affiliates placed on a U.S. national security blacklist.
China's foreign ministry on Monday nevertheless asked for a full explanation. Technology news outlet PCMag, formerly known as PC Magazine, reported that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. Fedex returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a ""U.S. government issue"" with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported.
The incident comes as Chinese authorities investigate FedEx for misrouting packages sent by Huawei last month. Meanwhile, China is also drawing up an Unreliable Entities List of foreign firms, groups and individuals.
The list mirrors the U.S. Entity List that Huawei was added to in May, essentially barring it from buying U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. The U.S. added more Chinese entities to the list on Friday.
The Beijing News, a municipal government-run newspaper, in an editorial on Monday, said FedEx had misinterpreted the U.S. ban and called on U.S. firms to be ""rational"" and not to over-react.
FedEx rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) also confirmed it would not ship to Huawei addresses on the Entity List but had no ""general ban"" on Huawei products.
A Huawei spokesman said the Chinese firm was not currently using either FedEx or UPS services. On Sunday, Huawei tweeted it was not within FedEx's right to prevent the delivery and said the courier had a ""vendetta.""
UNRELIABLE
The latest incident sparked renewed criticism of FedEx on Chinese social media, with the topic ""FedEx apologizes again"" trending on Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog platform.
State-run newspaper Global Times on Sunday tweeted that FedEx is likely to be added to China's Unreliable Entities List.
Neither China's commerce ministry nor FedEx responded to Reuters' requests for comment on the likelihood of FedEx being added to the list. State news agency Xinhua previously said authorities' investigation into FedEx misrouting Huawei packages should not be regarded as retaliation.
Being in the ""crosshairs"" of the Chinese government ""is a tremendous headwind and risk"" for FedEx, Trip Miller, said managing partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a FedEx position valued at roughly $7 million.
""Can you imagine if FedEx was banned from doing business? China could get our attention pretty quick if it did something like that,"" said Miller, adding that such a move would significantly disrupt global trade networks.
FedEx's operational error comes against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world's two biggest economies. The United States and China have been engaged in a trade fight for nearly a year on issues such as tariffs, subsidies, technology, regulations and cyber security.

A telephone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi JinPing last week, as well as confirmation the two will meet in Japan on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit, have rekindled hopes of a detente.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dismissed calls for a break-up of the world's biggest social network and other big internet companies on Monday, saying this would not tackle issues such as privacy, attempts to influence elections or harmful content.
""Just because it is difficult to regulate the internet doesn't mean policy makers should jump to the alternative of wishing these companies away,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's head of global affairs, said in a speech on Monday in Berlin.
Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has almost 2.4 billion monthly users, is firmly in the cross hairs of regulators and faces calls from some government officials for penalties or to be forcibly broken up.
""The internet does need competition and it does need regulation ... we want to work with governments and policymakers to design the sort of smart regulation that fosters competition, encourages innovation and protects consumers,"" Clegg said.
Last week seven U.S. Senate Democrats asked the Trump administration to disclose details of possible Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department antitrust investigations into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Reuters and other outlets reported the agencies were gearing up to investigate whether the firms misuse their market power.
While it was large in absolute terms, Facebook's share of the global advertising market was still ""relatively small"", said Clegg.
The former British deputy prime minister was hired to help deal with a global backlash against Facebook over its mishandling of user data and not doing enough to prevent Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Facebook raised more concerns last week when it said it plans to launch a new global cryptocurrency.
U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of companies like Facebook and Google, saying they suppress conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence. 
Clegg also said in his speech on Monday that the West should move fast on new rules or see countries like China and Russia determine the internet's future.

""If the West doesn't engage with this question quickly and emphatically, it may be that it isn't ours to answer. The common rules created in our hemisphere can become the example the rest of the world follows,"" he said.

The surprise move sent Bristol's shares down 4.3% in morning trading, while Celgene fell nearly 4%. 
Bristol announced its plans to buy Celgene in a cash-and-stock deal in early January to bring together the companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever. It had said it would close the deal in the third quarter of 2019.
However, now it expects the merger to close by the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020.
The divestiture is subject to further review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and requires Bristol to enter into a consent decree with the agency, Bristol said. 
In March, the FTC had sought additional information from the companies as it focused on their psoriasis treatments as part of its review of their planned merger.
Otezla brought in revenue of $1.61 billion for Celgene in 2018. Bristol is also developing a treatment for the condition and in September reported positive results from a mid-stage trial of its plaque psoriasis drug.
""The company is continuing to develop its promising immunology pipeline asset, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, in several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis,"" Bristol said in a statement.
Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the divestiture came as a surprise to the brokerage and can be seen as a sign that the FTC is being tougher on regulating competition.
Bristol said it remains actively engaged in discussions with the FTC on continued review of its offer to buy Celgene.
Separately on Monday, Bristol said its blockbuster cancer treatment Opdivo failed to meet the main goal of statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients in a late-stage study.

The companies have submitted a formal application for the merger clearance by the European Commission, Bristol said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp has sued Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc for trademark infringement, in an effort to stop the world's largest retailer from using the name Jetblack for its text-based personal shopping service.
In a complaint filed on Friday night, JetBlue said Jetblack was a ""transparent attempt"" by Walmart to capitalize on the carrier's goodwill, and would likely cause ""significant consumer confusion"" as the service expands across the United States.
JetBlue also said Walmart intended further infringements by using other ""Jet+color"" names such as Jetgold and Jetsilver, and moving closer to JetBlue's core business by offering travel services, including dining and entertainment recommendations.
The complaint said JetBlue owns 43 federal trademark registrations for JetBlue marks dating as far back as 1999, the year before the Long Island City, New York-based carrier began flying passengers. JetBlue is now the sixth-largest U.S. airline.
Walmart launched Jetblack in New York City in May 2018, as part of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer's effort to compete with such e-commerce services as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Amazon Prime, especially in urban areas.
""We respect the intellectual property rights of others,"" Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said. ""We take this issue seriously, and once we are served with the complaint will respond appropriately with the court.""
The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Jet.com, which Walmart bought in 2016, is also a defendant.
JetBlue and its lawyers did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment.
Jetblack calls itself a ""personal shopping and concierge service that combines the convenience of e-commerce with the customized attention of a personal assistant,"" with ""busy parents"" among its target customers.
The business is a startup located within Store No. 8, which is Walmart's Silicon Valley-based incubation arm.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Banks in Estonia have not yet plugged all the gaps in their money laundering controls, the Baltic state's regulator told Reuters, pledging to maintain a clampdown in the country at the center of one of Europe's biggest financial scandals.
Estonia's efforts to tighten money laundering controls at its banks follows a scandal at Danske Bank which has been ejected from the country after coming under investigation for 200 billion euros ($228 billion) of suspicious transactions that flowed through its Estonian branch.
Kilvar Kessler, Estonia's top bank supervisor, said he had also concluded an investigation of money laundering controls at Swedbank, as well as making checks on other lenders including SEB.
Kessler said his investigations had shown that, although there had been improvement in banks' attitude to money laundering, there were ""still weaknesses in the control systems"".
""Most of the risk is the past but some of the risk elements are still there,"" said Kessler, who heads financial watchdog, the Finantsinspektsioon. ""We don't want to see sloppy banking here.""
His comments underline the widespread scale of the problem that affected many banks in the Baltic state that had become a route for money leaving neighboring Russia.
A Swedbank spokeswoman said it was ""fully cooperating with the authorities"". An SEB spokesman said it had an ongoing dialogue with regulators and welcomed any review of its Baltic business.
Last week, Swedbank, which is under investigation by U.S. authorities, suspended two executives at its Estonian business. In April, it admitted to failings in combating money laundering.
Kessler said almost all banks in Estonia, which has a population of 1.3 million, had earlier dealt with foreign so-called ""non-resident"" customers, such as from Russia, but that this business had shrunk.
""It is not possible to do all the parties in the market at once,"" he said, outlining his efforts to clean up the sector. ""There are a number of them. We have our priority list."" 
The scandal has tarnished the reputation of the tiny state, which has marketed itself as a digital hub, offering electronic residency cards to foreigners including Pope Francis. 
The Danske case, which followed the sudden closure of ABLV bank in Baltic neighbor Latvia for money laundering discovered by U.S. authorities, prompted calls to tighten anti-money laundering rules. 
Kessler appealed to bankers aware of wrongdoing to come forward.
He said bankers with a ""dark conscience"" should come clean. ""If you have something to hide, maybe you will be treated in a milder way if you talk with us,"" he said. ""If not, wait for the law enforcement (to come) knocking at your door.""
Earlier this month, Estonia's Corruption Crime Bureau of the Central Criminal Police said they had detained three employees of Tallinn Business Bank, as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering and bribery.
Mati Ombler, who heads the Corruption Crime Bureau, said in a statement outlining the action that ""illegal cash flows"" were a threat to the country's reputation.
Igor Novikov, chairman of Tallinn Business Bank's management board, told Reuters by email that the investigation was directed at employees and not the bank itself.

""During (the) last 9-10 months, the number of accounts of non-residents has been decreased very substantially,"" Novikov said, referring to foreign customers. ""Money laundering controls have been adjusted.""

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's UniCredit has put a possible bid for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) on ice as the German rival does not want to engage in negotiations so soon after the collapse of merger talks with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), four sources said.
UniCredit had stepped up preparations for a potential takeover of Commerzbank by engaging Lazard and its banker Joerg Asmussen, a former German deputy finance minister, along with JP Morgan, people familiar with the matter said in May.
That raised the prospect of a deal that would allow Italy's largest bank by assets to shift its focus away from its struggling domestic market, a key plank of Chief Executive Jean-Pierre Mustier's strategy.
But the advisers have had little luck discussing a possible bid with Commerzbank, which is represented by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Rothschild, and have been left on stand-by, the sources said.
Mustier has been forced to put his ambitions on the backburner as Commerzbank has asked for some ""breathing space"" and is not ready to negotiate another deal just yet, the sources said. 
""Commerzbank told UniCredit they need time to think about the best course of action,"" said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the matter.
This source ruled out a bid being revived over the summer. He said things might change with time, although it was unclear when the Germans might be ready to sit at the table for talks with the Italian bank. 
UniCredit and Commerzbank declined to comment.
UniCredit has long been interested in expanding in Germany as it seeks to reduce its exposure toward its Italian home market, which has been weighing down its share price, several sources familiar with management's thinking have said. 
The Milan-based lender, which has a market capitalization of around 24 billion euros ($27.3 billion) compared to Commerzbank's 8 billion euros, already owns HVB, a large German lender based in Munich.
But the Italian bank, which has been concentrating on its own turnaround plan, had been awaiting the outcome of merger talks between Commerzbank and its larger Frankfurt neighbor, Deutsche Bank, which unraveled in April.
DETAILED PLAN
UniCredit's plans for a tie-up with Commerzbank were already at an advanced stage, the sources said.
Under its plans, UniCredit would merge HVB and some of its central European operations with Commerzbank, while separating and ringfencing its Italian business, one of the sources said.
UniCredit's Central European network includes Bank Austria which ranks as a leading retail bank in the country employing 4.800 people in 123 branches as of March.
The German combination would be listed in Frankfurt, while UniCredit would maintain its listing and headquarters in Milan. Two bankers close to the situation said UniCredit would need a capital increase of between 5-7 billion euros to finance the deal.
Mindful that UniCredit's exposure to Italy was regarded as a deterrent to a deal in Germany, Mustier also moved last month to cut it, including by announcing the bank would reduce its vast portfolio of Italian government bond holdings. UniCredit had 54 billion euros of Italian bonds at the end of March.
However, he is holding fire for now on Commerzbank, trying to figure out how to persuade the Germans, a second source said. 
Two separate sources said Commerzbank, in which the German state has a 15 percent stake, would only engage in merger negotiations with UniCredit if it was certain they would succeed, as it could not afford another round of failed tie-up talks.

Both banks are due to update investors on their strategy before the end of the year - UniCredit on Dec.3, Commerzbank probably by early October - and face questions from investors about where earnings growth will come from after years of restructuring.

China confirmed that President Xi Jinping will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit. While it's uncertain if a deal will be reached, both sides have resumed trade talks ahead of the meeting.
The S&P 500 inched down 0.7 points by 9:53 AM ET (13:53 GMT). The Dow was up 60 points and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 5 points.
“Markets are generally optimistic about the fact that both sides are continuing to meet, talk, discuss and debate tariffs, and so there’s still the potential for progress,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab.
“Don’t think markets are expecting a deal, but at least as long as there’s dialogue, there’s hope for progress.”
Still, stocks were kept in check by rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with more sanctions against Tehran expected to be announced on Monday.
Last week President Donald Trump ordered and then called off a military strike in response to Iran shooting down an unmanned U.S. drone.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 09:40AM ET</span>",Italy could be given six months to address debt woes: Commission minutes,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission could give Italy until January, instead of October, to make fiscal policy changes under an EU debt procedure, minutes of an EU meeting show, a move meant to avert a possible backlash from Rome's euroskeptics. 
Unless the government makes concessions this week on its spending plans for 2019 and 2020, the EU executive is expected to propose on July 2 that a disciplinary procedure be opened over Italy's rising debt.
The procedure, which would need to be endorsed by EU finance ministers at meetings on July 8-9, would force Italy to quickly tighten fiscal policy or face fines.
Under EU rules, once a disciplinary procedure is launched against a member state, the Commission can set tight deadlines for action. The shortest is three months, which would mean Rome would need to adopt new fiscal measures by October.
But Brussels is considering giving Italy six months to address the most urgent shortfalls, according to minutes of the Commission's June 5 meeting that were published on Friday.
After that meeting, the Commission said a procedure against Italy was warranted because it had violated EU debt rules in 2018 and was forecast to go further beyond the agreed limits this year and next. 
Italy's debt grew to 132.2% of gross domestic product in 2018, more than twice the EU's 60% ceiling, and is expected to rise even further, defying rules that say it should fall.
Commissioners at the meeting insisted that data underpinning the possible procedure could not be contested by Rome. But the minutes show the Commission was open to giving Italy more time to address shortfalls, in an attempt to avoid antagonizing Italian euroskeptics.
Economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici said it was important to show Brussels was ready to listen to Italian authorities ""to avoid the Commission's position being exploited for political ends in certain quarters in Italy,"" according to the minutes.
He said the Commission could propose a deadline of six months instead of three for the Italian government to take initial corrective measures. Under the procedure, other spending cuts or taxes would need to be adopted in following years.
Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has repeatedly said EU fiscal rules are obsolete and is pushing for broad tax cuts that could further breach existing fiscal requirements. 
But many in Italy want to avert the EU disciplinary action, which could push up the cost of servicing its debt, the EU's second highest in proportion to output after bailed-out Greece. 
A decision on whether to launch the procedure had initially been expected on June 25 but it was delayed pending the release of new Italian fiscal data on June 26, one EU official told Reuters last week.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit India from Tuesday for talks with government leaders over a growing list of trade and investment issues that has cast a shadow over ties between the two big democracies.
Pompeo is expected to lay the ground for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later in the week at a G20 meeting in Japan.
Both countries are trying to promote domestic manufacturing. 
Under a ""Make in India"" campaign, Modi has been courting foreign investors. Trump has pushed for U.S. manufacturing to return home as part of his ""Make America Great Again"" campaign.
The two countries also have differences over Russian arms sales to India and U.S. sanctions on China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
TARIFFS, CLOSED MARKETS
India this month imposed higher tariffs on 28 U.S. products including almonds, apples and walnuts, following the U. S. withdrawal of certain trade privileges for India.
Last year, India had announced tariffs in retaliation to higher U.S. import duties on steel and aluminum. 
Trump has called India ""tariff king"", and pointed to 50% duties on Harley Davidson motorbikes as an example. The Trump administration has also asked India to remove price caps on imported U.S. medical devices, open up its dairy market and cut duties on IT products.
DATA LOCALIZATION, E-COMMERCE
India has mandated foreign firms to store their payments data locally, hurting companies such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V). 
The United States has been pushing for data flow across borders in several countries including India. This week, India has been alarmed at the possibility of caps on H-1B work visas that allow thousands of skilled Indians to work in the United States, as retaliation for its data localization drive. The State Department, though, has said there were no such plans.
India outlined a new draft policy for its e-commerce sector this year, focusing on data localization, improved privacy safeguards and measures to combat the sale of counterfeit products.
Tighter e-commerce foreign investment rules implemented in India in February have forced Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to rework their business strategies in the country. Walmart last year invested $16 billion in Indian online retailer Flipkart.
HUAWEI
The United States has put China's Huawei on an export blacklist citing national security issues, barring U.S. suppliers from selling to the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and second-biggest maker of smartphones, without special approval.
It is asking its allies to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for Huawei to dominate 5G telecommunications networks. India has not decided whether to invite the Chinese firm for 5G trials. 
RUSSIA'S S-400 MISSILE SYSTEM

The United States has said that India's plan to buy S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia would draw sanctions under its Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions law. India, which signed the deal last year, says the weapons are necessary to bolster defenses against China.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank has dismissed its former interim chief executive Jesper Nielsen after thousands of Danish customers were overcharged for an investment product, a first step by its new boss to restore trust in the troubled lender.
The case, which the Danish financial services authority called ""very serious"", is another blow to the reputation of Denmark's biggest bank which is trying to limit the fallout from its involvement in a major money laundering scandal.
Both the FSA and the public prosecutors ""are pursuing the possibility of penalizing the bank,"" the country's acting business minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The dismissal of Nielsen, who headed the bank's domestic banking activities and served as interim CEO until the end of last month, was the first major change since Chris Vogelzang took charge at the start of June.
""Every single day, we must strive to ensure that we offer our customers proper advice and products that suit their needs,"" said former ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) banker Vogelzang in a statement.
""As a result of misguided management decisions, we failed to do so in this specific matter, and for this we offer our apologies,"" he added.
Danske is separately under investigation in the United States and several other countries for payments totaling 200 billion euros ($228 billion) through its small Estonian branch, many of which the bank said were suspicious.
Danske will compensate around 87,000 customers who invested in the Flexinvest Fri product for a total of around 400 million Danish crowns ($61 million). Its shares traded 3% lower by 1240 GMT and have lost around a fifth of their value this year.
""Overall the charge is an unhelpful one-off at a time when public perception of the franchise remains in the spotlight,"" said KBW analysts in a note.
The fees for the product were raised in connection with the implementation of the MiFID II financial industry regulation in 2017. 
""He (Nielsen) was at the time one of the responsible Executive Board members who did not to a sufficient degree ensure that the Flexinvest Fri product was suitable for the bank's customers,"" Chairman Karsten Dybvad said in a statement.
""Therefore, we find that Jesper cannot continue in his position,"" added Dybvad, who took up his role last year.
The Danish FSA said in had been investigating the case for some time and expected to make a decision on it by late summer.
""On the basis of the information available, this is a very serious matter,"" said Jesper Berg, who heads the Danish FSA.

Nielsen served as interim CEO from last October after former chief executive Thomas Borgen resigned when the scope of money laundering case emerged from an internal investigation.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rivals to Lloyd's of London are riding a rising tide of marine insurance rates, leaving the 330-year-old market behind after it jettisoned sections of its oldest line of business last year.
Premiums for marine insurance, which until 2018 had fallen for years due to rising competition and lower claims, are increasing after a surge in catastrophe losses in the past two years and growing geopolitical tensions..
For Lloyd's, still reeling from two years of losses due to the heavy claims from natural disasters, it will still take 12-24 months before the segment returns to profit, Chief Executive John Neal told Reuters in New York last week.
Neal said that although the sector had performed better in the first quarter, syndicates needed to set ""the right price"" for the risks and consider whether all types of marine business were insurable after Lloyd's told its 99 members to cut the worst 10% of their business last year.
Broker Gallagher said in a February report that 10 Lloyd's syndicates have withdrawn or reduced their marine business. That has benefited the smaller London company market, which operates separately in the City.
""We are definitely seeing business from Lloyd's coming through our door,"" said a senior London company market insurer.
Marine cargo rates are up 12-14% this year, Miles Taffs, head of marine and aviation at Lloyd's for MS Amlin, said, while sources say yacht rates have risen by at least 20%, and by triple digits in some locations.
""The (London) company market has demonstrated greater flexibility in its approach, as have other European markets, particularly France and Scandinavia,"" Alexander Mott, marine director at broker AFL, said. 
The Standard Syndicate at Lloyd's no longer writes new business, while other firms have moved. Norwegian marine insurer Skuld said it will close its Lloyd's syndicate in July, and switch the business to Oslo and the London company market.
AMERICAN REVOLUTION
Against this backdrop, Asia Pacific and North American insurers have won business in marine cargo, said a spokeswoman for the International Union of Marine Insurance, which said global marine insurance premiums totaled $28.5 billion in 2017.
And the United States and Scandinavia have also gained from the move away from Lloyd's, Carl Day, vice president, property, marine and energy at CNA Hardy, which pulled out of marine hull insurance last year, said.
Although marine insurance slipped to 7% of business at Lloyd's in 2018, down from 8% a decade ago, it remains bigger than energy, motor or aviation.
Lloyd's, which started life providing shipping information and insured ships during the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, has a huge chunk of that market. 
Its marine insurance and reinsurance gross written premiums totaled 3.8 billion pounds ($4.85 billion) in 2017, nearly double comparable business in the London company market, the International Underwriting Association said.
But the IUA is compiling premiums data for the London company market for 2018 and has so far seen a rise in business, including in marine, a spokesman said.
While Lloyd's is still dominant in the market, it cannot afford to take its historic strength for granted.

""The Lloyd's market is still the most important marine hub in the world, but it needs to adapt ... rather than hoping that business will simply come back,"" AFL's Mott said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler shares fell as much as 5% on Monday after the German automaker cut its profit forecast for the third time in 12 months, saying it was setting aside hundreds of millions of euros to cover a regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions.
The warning - that group operating profit would be flat this year compared with previous expectations for a slight increase - was the first under new chief executive Ola Kaellenius and led some analysts to call for a fresh approach from his team.
""Best execution and accountability remain core areas of improvement that need to be addressed by the new management,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a research note.
""The endless array of so-called one-time effects raises questions regarding process, management information systems and ultimately accountability of management.""
Carmakers have been grappling with a crackdown on diesel emissions since 2015, when German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted to cheating U.S. pollution tests on diesel engines. 
The pressure has come at a time when the industry is also having to invest heavily in electric and self-driving vehicles, cope with slowing growth in China, weak markets in Europe and a rise in global trade tensions. 
In May, German competitor BMW warned on profits, citing higher than expected investments, while Volkswagen said the return on sales at its passenger cars division would come in at the lower end of its target.
Daimler declined to give details on the diesel problems it is facing, and did not say precisely how much money it was setting aside. 
It cited ""various ongoing governmental proceedings and measures"" related to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and said provisions were likely to reach ""a high three-digit million euro amount.""
However, the profit warning - announced late Sunday - followed news that Daimler must recall 60,000 Mercedes diesel cars in Germany after regulators found they were fitted with software aimed at distorting emissions tests.
The transport ministry said it was expanding its investigation to more models.
Stuttgart-based Daimler is being investigated over diesel emissions in Europe and the United States. It issued a similar profit warning on diesel issues in October.
In April, EU antitrust regulators charged BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler with colluding to block the rollout of clean emissions technology.
While Daimler was a whistleblower in that case and said at the time it expected to avoid fines, BMW booked a provision of more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).
Daimler also said on Sunday it was reducing its forecast for the return on sales for Mercedes-Benz vans. 
It now sees a return between minus 2% and minus 4%, below its previous forecast of 0% to 2%.

On Monday, car executives are due to meet with government officials and experts in Berlin to talk about the future of the car industry, a major employer and source of export income in Europe's largest economy.

Qatar Petroleum chose Chevron Phillips Chemical as its partner in a joint venture to produce as much as 1.9 million tons a year of ethylene, Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, QP’s chief executive officer, said in Doha. The venture will process the chemical from ethane, a natural gas liquid, pumped at Qatar’s giant North Field.
The venture will cost billions of dollars, though a more precise estimate must await the completion of engineering studies, Al-Kaabi said. State-run QP raised the production target from an initial plan for 1.6 million tons a year.
“We saw better results than expected from the North Field, and we were able to have more ethane available for extraction,” Al-Kaabi said Monday, referring to Qatar’s portion of the offshore reservoir it shares with Iran. So, QP increased the venture’s ethylene target, he said. “We like them big in Qatar.”
Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, is boosting output at home and picking up assets abroad. This latest push into chemicals reverses its previous pullback from the industry, when it ended plans to build two projects valued at $12.5 billion after oil prices collapsed in 2014.
Biggest Cracker
The joint venture will be the biggest facility in the Middle East for processing ethane -- or “cracking” it, in industry parlance -- into ethylene, Al-Kaabi said. It will also produce high density polyethylene, Chevron Phillips Chemical CEO Mark Lashier said. QP will own 70% of the project, with the Texas-based company holding the rest.
Petrochemicals are the building blocks of our daily stuff, from sports shoes to computer keyboards, created when oil and natural gas molecules are split, or cracked, to produce ethylene, propylene and other chemicals. Ethylene is used to make polyethylene, the most commonly used plastic.
Energy producers view these compounds increasingly as crucial to unlocking more profit from each barrel of crude they pump, and demand for these chemicals is growing faster than for oil and gas.
With oil at $65 a barrel, crude producers can earn $15 a barrel by refining their output and an extra $30 on top of that by converting it into petrochemicals, Abdulwahab Al Sadoun, secretary-general of the Gulf Petrochemicals & Chemicals Association, told Bloomberg last year.
Qatar, a sheikhdom in the Persian Gulf, plans to boost LNG capacity from 77 million tons to 110 million tons by 2024, which will lift its total domestic production of oil and gas to 6.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from 4.8 million currently. It has already made a “final decision” to proceed with the LNG expansion, said Al-Kaabi, who also serves as the country’s minister of state for energy affairs.
Expansion at the North Field is going according to plan, and Qatar will award engineering, procurement and construction contracts for onshore facilities this year, Al-Kaabi said. Qatar is still to decide whether to produce LNG by itself or with partners.
Its offshore Barzan gas project should start producing by the end of 2019, he said. Barzan, which is intended to supply the local market, has been delayed for years.
Qatar’s gas ambitions aren’t confined to the giant offshore field it shares with Iran. The country is going global, pledging $20 billion for U.S. gas and LNG, and picking up stakes in projects and exploration licenses in Mozambique, Argentina, Mexico and Cyprus."

The German airline cited falling revenues at Eurowings as a major reason for its warning on full-year profits on June 16. Eurowings' revenue was also forecast to fall sharply in the second quarter.
Lufthansa said its Eurowings fleet would be standardized on the Airbus A320 family and it would seek to boost productivity at Eurowings by limiting itself in Germany to one air operator's certificate.

Lufthansa also said it would start pegging its dividend payout ratio to net profit in the future to give the group more flexibility. It would pay out a regular dividend of 20-40% of net profit, adjusted for one-off gains and losses.
Shares in Lufthansa were down 1.6% at 0957 GMT.

Fosun is considering teaming up with partners including Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. for a joint offer, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. A deal could value GV Gold at about $1 billion, they said.
GV Gold, controlled by the owners of Moscow-based Lanta-Bank, mines at several Siberian deposits and has almost doubled output since 2016 to 304,000 troy ounces last year. BlackRock owns about 18% of the gold miner after a 2007 deal that valued the company at $500 million.
The miner’s initial public offering plan was stalled last year amid international sanctions and slump in commodity prices. Even as GV Gold and its owners were not targeted, the value of all Russian assets went down following the U.S. penalties.
The talks come at a time gold prices have surged past $1,400 an ounce for the first time since 2013 after U.S. Federal Reserve indicated a readiness to cut interest rates and a military strike between the U.S. and Iran.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). said last week that the enthusiasm for bullion is justified, with $1,500 to $1,600 in the next 12 months under a bullish-case scenario.

No final decision has been made and there’s no certainty the talks will lead to an agreement, according to the people. Representatives for Fosun, Zhaojin and GV Gold declined to comment.
The talks with GV Gold, also known as Vysochaishy, would be Fosun’s second attempt to acquire a stake in a Russian gold miner. A group of investors led by the Shanghai-based company agreed to buy 10% of Polyus PJSC for almost $900 million in 2017, but the deal collapsed early last year after they failed to agree on a way forward to wrap up the transaction amid pending approvals from Chinese authorities.
Fosun, led by billionaire Guo Guangchang, is among a few Chinese conglomerates pursuing major overseas deals. Others including HNA Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group Co. have sold assets in the past two years -- a retreat prompted by a government crackdown on debt-fueled acquisitions.
The conglomerate is considering a bid for Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG’s animal-health business, people familiar with the matter said last week, while Thomas Cook Group Plc earlier this month said it received an offer from Fosun for its tour-operator business.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 05:49AM ET</span>",Leveraged loan investors push private equity firms on ESG,"By Prudence Ho
LONDON (LPC) - Private equity firms are under pressure to boost their use of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria as debt investors and limited partners in their funds increasingly use sustainability criteria to drive investment decisions and manage risk.
The use of ESG standards in Europe's leveraged loan market is still in its infancy. Spanish telecom operator Masmovil completed Europe's first ESG-linked leveraged loan in May, while nearly $30 billion of investment-grade ESG-linked corporate loans have already been completed in 2019, according to LPC data.
Debt investors are increasingly citing ESG criteria as reasons to join deals or not, and private equity firms' limited partners also have sustainability targets, but private equity firms are skirting the issue as they try to deploy record amounts of cash.
""We know ESG is very important to many of the limited partners in private equity funds, but it hasn't yet settled down into a direct consistent impact on either asset selection or pricing,"" said David Gillmor, sector lead, European leverage finance at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.
Private equity sponsors raised only $2.5 billion of funds with ESG mandates in 2018, which at 0.5% is a fraction of total global fund raising, according to data provider Preqin.
Private equity firms are using their own ESG definitions to avoid any restrictions and maintain flexibility as they struggle to spend a record $1.54 trillion of dry powder, or uninvested capital, after raising multibillion-dollar funds.
""If it (ESG) is strictly applied, that could narrow down the choices of M&A targets. Even investing in a plastic packaging firm could be a problem,"" a fund manager said.
NOT READY YET
Europe's leveraged loan market is struggling to incorporate ESG criteria into deal structures. Its use has been limited to capital expenditure and revolving tranches to date, which are mostly sold to banks, while institutional term loans have remained unchanged.
Masomovil's loan totaled €1.7 billion, but only the €250 million capex and revolver tranches were ESG-linked, which will give a 15-basis point margin reduction if the company's sustainability rating improves.
Some investors oppose ESG margin ratchets, which could reduce their income and increase the sell-down risk in general syndication for underwriting banks.
""You are not doing ESG to get a lesser return. It's not a trade-off between the two,"" said Stephane Michel, senior portfolio manager at Hermes Investment Management, ""I want to keep the upside because I have selected a better credit by filtering out poor ESG performers.""
The use of ESG ratings across private equity firms' portfolio companies is currently limited. S&P has no ESG evaluations for leveraged loan borrowers, and many middle-market or SME companies currently have no ESG scores.
Even if ESG ratings or scores were available for leveraged companies, not all fund managers think that they should necessarily be linked to pricing.
""It's not a 100% correlation to improving credit. You could have a super ESG rating, but it's not the sole determinant of spread performance,"" Michel said.
GUIDING DECISION
Although private equity firms are dragging their heels on ESG, portfolio managers are increasingly facing questions from leveraged loan investors about underlying investments, portfolio breakdowns, ratings exposure and other related issues.
""Every fund-raising meeting, investors asked about it, and you have to reflect that in your investment decisions."" a second fund manager said.
A $500 million-equivalent leveraged loan for Israeli cyber surveillance firm NSO Group was one of the first deals to highlight negative ESG issues. The deal was placed at 90 percent of face value after it was revealed that the company's spyware tool Pegasus was used to target human rights activists.
At least four European CLO funds have been issued with an ESG focus since March 2018. The funds adopt negative screening to avoid investing in sectors including tobacco, gambling, pornography, weapons and hazardous chemicals.
European banks including  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), ING and HSBC are at the forefront of sustainability financing. BNP Paribas has a team working on ESG structures for different financing products and ING aims to double its funding by 2022 to companies and sectors that are helping to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.
""We believe sustainable business is better business,"" said Leonie Schreve, global head of sustainable finance at ING. The bank has established a global team to grow the sustainable finance business, covering green bonds, ESG linked loans, green loans and green equity.
Although it is still at an early stage, the inclusion of ESG criteria in leveraged loans is expected to develop quickly.

""It's almost exponential the acceleration, it (ESG) is here to stay and it will force private equity to pay attention,"" a senior banker said.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 05:45AM ET</span>",Nissan shareholders set to back CEO Saikawa amid fraying ties with Renault,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor shareholders are widely expected to back Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa at an annual general meeting on Tuesday, extending his tumultuous tenure at an automaker shaken by scandal and the loss of trust with alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA). 
Japan's second-largest carmaker on Tuesday will hold its first annual shareholders meeting since the ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn last year, and just days after Saikawa resolved a highly publicized tussle with top shareholder Renault over Nissan's corporate governance reforms.
Although that maneuvering helped pull the Nissan-Renault alliance back from the brink of crisis, the former Ghosn lieutenant is now faced with the unenviable task of trying to shore up a two-decade-old partnership that many in Japan see as lopsided, deeply inequitable and shot through with mistrust on both sides.
""The most important thing is how to mitigate the damage ... how to strengthen the alliance. I think both companies need to make their best efforts to overcome the mistrust,"" said a person familiar with Nissan's thinking.
The partnership hit a new low this month when Renault demanded that its chairman and chief executive be appointed to newly formed governance committees at Nissan. If not, Renault signaled it would block Nissan from adopting its new governance structure - effectively ruining months of work by an outside body. 
Renault, by far the smaller of the two, owns 43.4% of Nissan after rescuing it from the brink of bankruptcy in 1999. Nissan owns 15% of the French company, but without voting rights. That unequal relationship has long been a source of friction.
There has been wide speculation that Renault's governance move was a reprisal after Nissan had abstained from endorsing Renault's planned merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. 
The stand-off was averted when Nissan agreed to appoint Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard and Chief Executive Thierry Bollore to its audit and nominations committees, even as Nissan itself will not be represented on those committees. 
""Almost a week was spent in negotiations (on the committees) and clearly that would damage trust toward Renault and probably between the two companies,"" said the person familiar with Nissan's thinking.
TENSIONS DIALLED DOWN
By agreeing to Renault's demand, Saikawa has dialed down tensions and likely won a reprieve on his two-year tenure. The embattled CEO will be re-appointed as a director if shareholders vote to approve a new 11-member board, a widely expected outcome with Renault's backing.
""If Renault abstained on the governance reform proposals, it would put a big question mark on Saikawa's ability to manage Nissan as its chief executive,"" one Nissan source said. 
Instead, Saikawa appears to have quelled internal concerns, at least for now, about his ability to manage the automaker's relationship with Renault just as he also faces pressure to resuscitate Nissan's flagging financial performance.
Reappointment would also see him defy opposition by proxy advisors brought about by concerns that with Saikawa in charge, the automaker would be unable to make a ""clean break"" from the Ghosn era. Renault CEO Bollore is also a former Ghosn ally.
In a rare public rebuke by international proxy firms against the leader of a top-tier Japanese firm, International Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis earlier this month urged Nissan shareholders to vote against reappointing Saikawa as a director.
But people at both automakers said the recent tussle has dissolved the image of unity the companies promoted only months ago, and raised questions about whether Senard and Saikawa are the right people to shake the alliance free from Ghosn's legacy in the longer term.
""Senard has been a disappointment for us. Trust in him has fallen quite a bit,"" said a second person familiar with Nissan's thinking.
Industry experts acknowledge that a break-up of the alliance is unlikely given that operations at Nissan and Renault are so deeply intertwined - the automakers have joined forces on research and development, procurement and production, leveraging their combined scale to lower costs.
""Maybe the alliance can be salvaged, but maybe not by this group of people,"" said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA. 

""It seems like both of these companies have a lot to offer, but the current players just can't get along.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks stumbled and the dollar dropped to three-month lows on Monday as hopes waned for progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks at this week's G20 meeting and fears grew of a confrontation with Iran.
Investors are waiting to see if Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping can de-escalate a trade war that is damaging the global economy and souring business confidence. The leaders will meet during a G20 summit in Japan.
Pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.2% , reflecting losses in Paris and Milan. Stocks in London were little changed. Germany's export-sensitive DAX fell 0.5% after a profit warning by Daimler caused its shares to drop nearly 5%.
However, gains in Asia saw the MSCI regional and global stocks gauges rise again towards last week's six-week highs. Wall Street also looked in line for more gains after closing lower on Friday. S&P 500 e-minis pointed to a 0.2% rise at the open.
""G20 is turning into a high-stakes poker game for risk, and if the sideline talks between Trump and Xi fail and trigger an escalation in tariffs, the odds of a full-blown global recession increase exponentially,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets.
On Monday, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said China and the United States should be willing to compromise in trade talks and not insist only on what each side wants.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's decision on Friday to call off a planned China speech was also considered a positive sign. Pence had upset China with a fierce speech in October that laid out a litany of complaints ranging from state surveillance to human-rights abuses. 
Still, most analysts doubt the two sides will come to any meaningful agreement. Tensions are reaching beyond tariffs, particularly after Washington blacklisted Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms gear maker, effectively banning U.S. companies from doing business with it.
""Any high hopes ahead of the G20 meeting may be disappointed,"" said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING in Amsterdam. ""In the end, uncertainty will persist and central banks could still be pushed closer to invoking their contingency plans.""
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it was adding several Chinese companies and a government-owned institute involved in supercomputing to its national security ""entity list"", which bars them from buying U.S. parts and components without government approval.
A Chinese newspaper said FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) was likely to be added to Beijing's ""unreliable entities list"".
U.S. markets had reached record highs after last week's signals by the Federal Reserve that it may cut interest rates soon to bolster the U.S. economy. (N)
However, that weakened U.S. currency, causing a dollar index to slip 0.1% lower to 96.11 after its biggest weekly drop in four months last week. 
The dollar has led a broad selloff in major currencies as global central banks signaled a dovish outlook on monetary policy amid growing signs of a weak global economy.
The dollar fetched 107.39 yen, having slipped as low as 107.045 on Friday, the lowest level since its flash crash on Jan. 3. 
""The market is not expecting more Fed rate cuts than it had so far, but that the reasoning behind them is being interpreted in a different manner,"" Commerzbank's head of FX and commodity research, Ulrich Leuchtmann, wrote in a note to clients. 
""While for a long time the expected weakening of growth, fears of a recession and low inflation were used as reasons for rate cuts, another reason has now been added to the list: the Fed caving in to the White House.""
The euro rose to a three-month high of $1.1387 against the dollar. [FRX/]
In developing markets, the Turkish lira strengthened as much as 2% after Turkey's main opposition party won Istanbul's re-run election for mayor, a blow to President Tayyip Erdogan. 
Bitcoin pulled back from 18-month highs after jumping more than 10% over the weekend. Analysts said the gains came amid growing optimism over the adoption of cryptocurrencies after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its Libra digital coin.
Economic woes, looming U.S. interest rate cuts and tensions between Tehran and Washington drove gold higher. The precious metal stood at $1,404.79 per ounce, not far from Friday's six-year high of $1,410.78.
The rising tensions between Iran and the United States, after Iran shot down an American drone, also pushed oil prices higher. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said ""significant"" sanctions on Tehran would be announced.
Brent crude futures rose 0.4% to $65.42 per barrel, near Friday's three-week high of $65.76. U.S. crude futures were up 0.9% at $57.91, standing at its highest in over three weeks. [O/R]

1694,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>","StockBeat - Turkish Delight as Stocks, Lira Soar on Istanbul Vote","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Turkey’s currency, bond and stock markets are all flying Monday morning in Europe, after a re-run election in Istanbul, the country’s largest city and commercial center, resulted in a big defeat for the ruling party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
At 4:45 AM ET, the lira had gained over 1.4% against the dollar to hit a three-week high of 5.7060. The yield on the government’s benchmark 10-year bond fell by a full percentage point to 16.08% while the benchmark stock index hit its highest level since April with a 1.8% rise.
The lira had already started to make gains on Sunday after the results of the election, but added to them after Erdogan’s party formally conceded defeat, banishing fears that it would use its power to stifle the democratic process. Such a reaction would have spelled further trouble for Turkish assets, which have fallen this year under strain from the government's unorthodox efforts to keep an ongoing debt crisis under control at the country's banks.
“It’s the best-case outcome,” said Paul McNamara, a portfolio manager with Zurich-based asset manager GAM. “It makes emergency stimulus or currency intervention, neither of which Turkey can afford, less likely.”
McNamara stressed the importance of Erdogan and the AKP’s acceptance of defeat.
“We avoid the demonstrations that would have followed more attempts to reverse (the result of the vote, and) the government maintains legitimacy,” he argued.
It’s all a sharp contrast to Europe’s more developed markets, which were mostly lower after another gloomy survey from the think tank Ifo, whose closely-watched index of German business sentiment remained stuck at its lowest in over four years. While companies reported a marginal improvement in current conditions, their expectations darkened once again.
The German Dax was the worst-performing index in Europe, losing 0.4%, as the Ifo report weighed on a market already hit by yet another profit warning from Mercedes-Benz parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). The company issued its third profit warning in less than a year on Sunday night, blaming extra costs from the diesel emissions scandal.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>","ANZ under fire from NZ regulator, government over risk controls, governance","By Praveen Menon and Tom Westbrook
WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand's deputy prime minister on Monday called on the chairman of the local unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group to step down as regulators ramped up pressure on the lender to improve its internal risk controls and governance.
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said ANZ Chairman John Key, a former prime minister under the opposition National Party, should resign as he found himself at the center of questions about governance practices at the bank.
Hours earlier, New Zealand's central bank asked ANZ to provide independent proof it's operating in a prudent manner in the wake of last month's censure of the lender. 
In an interview with local broadcaster TVNZ, Peters said he thought Key should resign, days after ANZ's New Zealand CEO abruptly left the bank over an expenses scandal. 
""It's the Governor of the Reserve Bank who could make that request. But if you were to ask me, if I was the Governor of the Reserve Bank, I would have asked for his resignation, yes,"" Peters said.
Peters said that Key has a 'massive conflict of interest' because he is also on the board of ANZ's Australian parent. 
""I think there's some serious questions that need to be answered, and there's much more to be unearthed in my view,"" the deputy prime minister said. 
In an email to Reuters, ANZ said Key has declined to respond to comments made by Peters.
Later on Monday, the government announced that its review of the Reserve Bank would look at whether the powers were strong enough to regulate the banking sector.
""Now is the right time to check we have the tools to make sure banks meet their obligations to New Zealanders, and the powers to enforce them,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in a statement.
ANZ New Zealand's CEO David Hisco abruptly left the bank last week after a review of his expenses showed he logged payments for chauffeurs and wine storage as business expenses rather than personal.
Key said Hisco did not share ANZ's conclusions as he ""was adamant he had the authority for the expenditure"" but agreed to leave the bank immediately.
The CEO's departure came just weeks after the lender's license to calculate its own operational risk capital was revoked due to ""persistent"" control failures.
CONFIDENCE TEST
RBNZ on Monday asked for two reports from ANZ's local unit - the first on its compliance with central bank capital adequacy requirements and a second to assess the bank's internal governance, risk management and internal controls.
""These formal reviews will allow us to work with the bank to ensure the public, and we as regulator, can have continued confidence in the bank,"" RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said in a statement.
The reports will need to be compiled by an RBNZ-approved independent person. ANZ said it would comply with the request.
Former RBNZ official and banking industry expert Geof Mortlock said ANZ New Zealand's parent company needs to step up after the series of failures. 
""Otherwise they will look negligent as shareholders. It's especially important now, when ANZ, along with the other Australian banks, faced criticism for conduct in the Royal Commission in Australia,"" he said. 
The Royal Commission in Australia exposed industry-wide misconduct as well accusations of profiteering that went all the way up from branch level to the boardroom.
Top Australian banks have been resisting a proposal by RBNZ to raise capital ratios to 16%, meaning the country's top four banks, including ANZ, would collectively need an extra NZ$20 billion in new capital over the next five years.
ANZ said it was sound and strong, with NZ$12.4 billion ($8.2 billion) of capital as at March 31, which it said is NZ$3.5 billion more than regulatory requirements.
