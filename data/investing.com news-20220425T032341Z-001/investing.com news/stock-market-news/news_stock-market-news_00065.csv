7,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",German neo-Nazis are trying to infiltrate Daimler: works council,"By Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Neo-Nazis are attempting to infiltrate one of Germany's biggest car makers,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), to turn a key factory into a showcase for their views, the plant's works council said on Wednesday.
The neo-Nazis belong to various groups and are using an alternative union, the Zentrum Automobil, as a base, said the works council, which is made up of union members and negotiates with management.
""The right-wing activities and the entanglements in neo-Nazi actions and organizations and the related public coverage are causing substantial damage to labor representation and through this are threatening our jobs,"" said the works council at the Untertuerkheim plant in southern Germany.
Its statement did not specify which neo-Nazi groups were involved but named individuals at the plant and said the infiltration was ""not acceptable."" 
Media in southern Germany reported this month that several labor representatives at Daimler's headquarters in Untertuerkheim, where 19,000 staff are employed, were affiliated with neo-Nazi groups and have voiced xenophobic views.
The reports come at a time of heightened concern about the far-right because the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which critics equate with far right politics, could become the largest opposition bloc in parliament.
This month the AfD surpassed the center-left Social Democrats in a nationwide opinion poll.
Staff at Daimler, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and other firms in Germany's metalworking industry are due to elect new labor representatives over the next three months so management and unions are keen to quench any far-right activity.
""It appears as if Untertuerkheim, with the help of labor councillors on the ""Liste Zentrum"" is to become a far-right showcase project"" for the whole of Germany, the statement said. The Liste Zentrum is another name for the alternative union.
Workers founded the alternative union in 2009 four years before the AfD was set up and some media in Stuttgart where Daimler is based said some of its members include neo-Nazis.
""The works council of Untertuerkheim categorically opposes such an abuse of labor council mandates for right-wing goals and purposes,"" it said.
Zentrum Automobil did not provide any immediate comment. On its web page, it opposes exporting jobs abroad and criticized Daimler's main union, IG Metall, for colluding with management to the detriment of workers.
Daimler said on Wednesday it opposes any far right activity among its workforce and would monitor developments closely.
""We stand by the liberal, democratic basic order and expect all employees to live tolerance in their daily work and to act together with respect, openness, faith and fairness,"" the website said.

Daimler produced armaments for the Nazis before and during World War Two, making the issue of possible far right infiltration particularly sensitive for the company.

British officials have held talks with the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group amid fears it will pick Rotterdam as its main base rather than London, the FT said. 
""It wouldn't be a great surprise if it happened,"" the paper quoted a British official briefed on the discussions as saying. 
Unilever had no comment, noting that a decision has not yet been made. 
Earlier this month, the maker of Knorr soup and Dove soap said talks with both governments were progressing and that it expected to come to a decision by the end of the current quarter.

Unilever has already said it favors changing its current dual-listed structure which gives it headquarters in Britain and the Netherlands.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",High-risk euro bank bonds find buyers as crisis memories fade,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Alice Gledhill
LONDON (Reuters/IFR) - Germany's IKB Deutsche Industriebank, rescued twice during the financial crisis, has issued one of the riskiest forms of bonds without any credit rating from the big agencies. And yet, like many euro zone peers, it found itself swamped with demand.
IKB's raising of 300 million euros last month, and other similarly successful debt sales, show how many investors are willing to set aside memories of the 2007-2008 global shock and its 2010-2012 repeat in the euro zone.
Despite misgivings among some others, they are happy to take on the extra risk due to attractive yields, a booming euro zone economy and confidence in banking system reforms implemented since the crises.
In particular, lower-rated, higher-risk bonds known as subordinated debt have become the preferred instrument for some of Europe's biggest investors.
While such ""junior"" bonds are often in the first line of fire in the event of default, they are proving attractive as they typically offer a better return than more senior layers of debt whose holders would have a greater claim to repayment in the event of any bank failure. IKB's issue, which yielded 4 percent, drew enough demand to sell the debt four times over.
""The fundamentals for banks in Europe are much better than they were in the past: not only because of the recovery but also because of the deleveraging of the sector and stronger regulations,"" said Eric Brard, head of fixed income at Amundi, one of Europe's largest asset managers with over 1.4 trillion euros of assets under management.
Brard points to expectations that the European Central Bank will gradually unwind its ultra-easy monetary policy. ""With tightening policy, the move away from negative interest rates in coming months and years should benefit the financial sector in the long run,"" he said.
Higher interest rates help banks which typically have large cash holdings from customers' deposits. Also, with longer-dated bond yields rising, those that borrow short-term money and lend it on longer-term should likewise benefit.
Brard said he prefers subordinated bonds because of the 50-100 basis point yield premium they typically offer above their senior counterparts. 
Amundi is not the only firm to hold this view. Subordinated bonds were among the best performing European debt over the past year and the most closely-watched index of the lowest-rated bank debt, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's contingent capital index <.MERCOCO>, has risen strongly since its inception in January 2014. 
Euro zone banks last year sold 106 billion euros' worth of subordinated bonds, known as sub-debt, at an average 4.9 percent yield. Back in 2013, they raised 132 billion euros but yields were approaching double that at 9.2 percent, Thomson Reuters data shows.
Subordinated financials shine over the last year: http://reut.rs/2EHrpnJ
IKB was only the latest illustration of the hunger for sub-debt. Spain's Bankia, nationalized in May 2012 to prevent its collapse, last year sold 750 million euros of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds - the most junior version of subordinated debt.
AT1 bonds are also referred to as ""hybrid"" debt because they have no maturity date and are therefore similar to equity in terms of the risk they represent, though the issuer has the opportunity to redeem the bonds at pre-determined dates. 
""Bank balance sheets are much healthier now, and the ratio of non-performing loans has improved throughout Europe,"" said Jean Baptiste Berthon, senior cross-asset strategist at Lyxor Asset Management, a fund owned by French lender  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), with 132 billion of assets under management. 
The ratio of non-performing loans in the euro zone banking sector halved between 2012 and 2016 to just over 4 percent, according to World Bank data. 
""We are quite confident that there is relatively little systemic risk,"" Berthon said, adding that Lyxor's multi-asset fund is overweight European banks across asset classes and was positive on subordinated bonds within fixed income. 
Since the global crisis, regulators across the world have introduced stricter rules for banks to reduce systemic risk.
As part of this, lenders have been forced to issue shares and bonds to boost their capital buffers so that they are no longer forced to seek taxpayer-funded bailouts in future. 
One measure of how well protected they have become is the fully-loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio which measures the bank's capital relative to its assets. 
This ratio, aimed at cushioning banks against unexpected losses, stood at 13.5 percent on average at the end of 2016 for euro zone banks, versus 3.7 percent in 2007.
""BONKERS"" YIELD 
Some query whether the bullishness may be going too far and stems to a large degree from investors' hunt for yield. 
For example, back in 2013, Banco Popular Espanol priced the first euro-denominated AT1 bond with a coupon of 11.5 percent. But last summer that bond was wiped out when regulators orchestrated a takeover of the bank by fellow Spanish lender Santander (MC:SAN).
While this reminded investors of the risks posed by such bonds, Belfius Bank - which rose from the ashes of Franco-Belgian lender Dexia - sold 500 million euros of AT1 debt last month at a yield of 3.658 percent, a level so low relative to the risk that one banker described it as ""bonkers"".
The bond tanked after the launch, buffeted by a broader market sell-off, and is now trading at a cash price of 97.75, well below the original 100 price tag. .
Still, such is the goodwill towards the sector that expectations are starting to surface about possible subordinated bond issuance by banks in Greece, a country that not long ago was on the verge of default.
One banker who sells subordinated bank debt through syndications said a client had expressed concerns that this sector has gained legitimacy purely because the bonds have moved into a lower-yielding bracket, implying lesser risk. 
""When this asset class was yielding 7 percent, there were a lot of investors saying, 'that is a risky instrument',"" he said, declining to be named as he is not authorized to speak about his clients. 

""The exact same investors, in a similar macro environment, buy those bonds they wouldn't buy at 7 percent, at 3 percent... The lower the yield, the more comfortable people are buying something.""

22,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",EU official to U.S.: clearing plans won't undermine bilateral pacts,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European Union representatives have sought to reassure the United States that plans to tighten oversight of foreign clearing houses operating in the bloc will not disrupt transatlantic ties on market access that took years to agree.
The EU has proposed giving its regulators stronger powers to supervise ""systemic"" or large foreign clearing houses handling transactions worth trillions of euros for investors in the bloc.
Washington fears the plans will see EU regulators working over the heads of American watchdogs to intervene in U.S. clearers like ICE (N:ICE) and CME (O:CME). The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) says the move threatens EU-U.S. clearing deals that took years negotiate.
""I am not sure that having too many regulators has the right outcome,"" a senior U.S. clearing official told Reuters. 
The draft law proposes ""on site"" inspections of big foreign clearing houses handling transactions inside the bloc, instead of EU regulators going via the CFTC as they do now.
Patrick  Pearson  (LON:PSON), a senior official at the European Commission, said current EU rules on foreign clearers rely too much on supervision by regulators in a clearer's market, but said Brussels did not want to revise or scrap bilateral deals.
""We have heard noise from the other side of the Atlantic,"" Pearson told a debate about the draft law in the European Parliament's economic affairs committee, adding that discussions about the EU plans would help ""calm"" the situation.
The parliamentary committee met CFTC on Tuesday.
Committee Chair Roberto Gualtieri said the EU would endeavor to show it did not ""intend to regulate American farmers and agricultural derivatives"" which were not covered by the draft law.
CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo told the EU last year that changing bilateral deals would be a violation of trust.
Kay Swinburne, a British committee member, said CFTC had told the EU the bloc should trust home supervisors of foreign clearing houses and not legislate for ""dual oversight"". 
""I genuinely don't think the location policy will ever be used, but we do need to think in terms of what it might be sending in terms of signals to the outside world,"" Swinburne.
Britain has also been critical of the EU plan, saying it was a bid to drive the clearing of euro-denominated assets away from London's financial center after Britain leaves the bloc in 2019.
The committee's debate on Wednesday showed broad backing for the draft law, subject to stricter criteria for deciding when euro clearing should move and clarity on the role of the European Central Bank in the decision.
EU lawmakers and member states have the final say on the draft law which Gualtieri wants approved by year end.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",How matching money turbo-charges U.S. retirement savings,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO - After turning miserly when the Great Recession began nearly 10 years ago, U.S. employers are loosening their purse strings and giving workers more money to boost retirement savings.
Recently, some companies – ranging from Nationwide [NMUIC.UL] to Honeywell – said they will devote funds from the new tax cut to employee 401(k) matches. Yet, even before the tax cut, companies had become more generous with retirement plan matches and profit sharing as their financial fortunes improved. 
In 2016, employers gave retirement matches averaging 4.6 percent of worker pay – more than double the level of 2009 and a large increase over 2015’s 3.8 percent, according to a national survey of small and large employers just completed by the Plan Sponsor Council of America (PSCA). 
In the depths of the recession, retirement matches plunged to 2.1 percent of worker pay, as many companies hoarded cash.
Companies are increasing 401(k) matches to make up for the demise of pension plans. Others want to recruit and retain workers in competitive fields, said Jack Towarnicky, PSCA executive director. 
Regardless of the reason, matching money is crucial to employees because most individuals do not save enough. Almost half of employees will not have what they need for retirement, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. 
Employees, on average, save 6.8 percent of pay, according to the PCSA. That falls short of the 10 percent recommended for people who start saving in their 20s. 
It is significantly less than the 12 percent to 15 percent of pay recommended for people who delay saving until their 30s. Matching money provides a gigantic lift to inadequate savings. Research shows people are motivated to save more to take advantage of their employer's largesse. 
The most common matching formula used by companies gives employees an extra 3 percent of pay in a 401(k) if they save 6 percent on their own. In other words, the company matches half of every dollar the employee saves, up to 6 percent of pay.
POWER OF COMPOUNDING
The impact over time is huge. A 30-year-old earning $50,000 and retiring at age 67 would have about $1 million if he or she saved 7 percent of pay and received the 3 percent match each year of work. Without the match, an individual would accumulate just $736,000, assuming the investments earned an average of 7 percent a year, according to the Dinkytown retirement calculator (https://www.dinkytown.net/java/Retire401k.html).
With $1 million a person could spend about $40,000 a year in retirement. But $736,000 would limit safe spending to $29,400.
About 6 percent of companies now match half of savings ranging from 7 percent to 10 percent, according to the PSCA survey.
Employers offer a match to encourage plan participants to contribute at higher rates, said Lori Lucas, president and chief executive of Employee Benefits Research Institute. “They worry that lower-wage workers will not be able to afford to contribute more and will not be able to get the full match.”

28,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 10:45AM ET</span>",Scotch whisky makers see dram half full over Brexit,"By Elisabeth O'Leary and Martinne Geller
FALKIRK, Scotland/LONDON (Reuters) - Scotch whisky makers were among the most fervent industry advocates for staying in the European Union, but if Britain has to leave, they prefer a clean break.
The industry, already busy preparing for transport and logistical challenges, says it would be happy to stay in the EU single market and the customs union after Britain leaves the world's largest trading bloc if it had a say in regulations and a right to make bilateral trade deals. 
If that's not possible, then it would be better to have no deal and default to World Trade Organisation rules, which mandate a zero percent tariff on Scotch imports into the EU, said Karen Betts, chief executive officer of the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA).
""When we think it through, there are real risks, if you stay in the single market, of continuing to be bound by the EU's rules but not being able to influence them,"" she said. The industry would keep an open mind as long as negotiations with Brussels are going on, however, she said. 
The industry position matters: Scotch exports were worth 4.36 billion pounds ($6.10 billion) in 2017, more than one fifth of all of Britain's food and drink exports and 40,000 jobs.
To some extent, its position is unique.
For one thing, there's the advantageous tariffs under the WTO, which apply to almost all spirits.
For another, while its supply chain is almost all UK-based, exports account for 90 percent of output, meaning it has seen big benefits from the post-Brexit weakness in the pound.
Protected by a UK law which means it can only be made in Scotland, Scotch is dominated by multinationals like  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and has been an export sector for centuries. Distillers are skilled in cross-border trade and able to absorb logistical challenges and extra costs. 
What the industry wants now is clarity about the terms under which Britain will leave the EU and how much time it has to get ready for it. ""We play the cards that we are dealt. We kind of just want to know what the cards are,"" Betts said.
RISKS ...
A big concern, shared by other goods exporters, is how transport to the EU will be affected by a change in IT systems for trade with non-EU countries agreed before the Brexit vote.
If the agreed transition is not long enough following Brexit Day on March 29, 2019, the system may have to be used for all exports, including to the EU, just months after it has been introduced. The volume of declarations processed annually in that case will rise to 255 million from 55 million now, the government says, so it needs to be running glitch-free by then. 
Whisky makers are making contingency plans for alternative routes and storage in case border delays affect sales or costs.
France, Spain and Poland are among the top ten global destinations for Scotch, together accounting for 19.3 million 9-litre cases in 2016, or 21 percent of the total, according to drink industry researchers IWSR. 
By far the world leader with 13.6 million cases, France is led by Marie Brizard (PA:MBWS), which ships William Peel Scotch from Scotland but also French spirits and cognac into Britain. The company's Scotch travels to France via Belgium, using ships and trains instead of trucks. 
Chief Executive Jean-Noel Reynaud believes logistical disruptions will be manageable. ""We will just have to adapt to the new supply chain rules,"" he said. ""If we have to account for another one or two weeks in the supply, we'll do so. When we export to China it takes much more time than just importing from the UK.""
If there are bottlenecks, producers can build regional stocks, taking advantage of the fact that Scotch is not perishable, said Duncan Swift, who runs the food advisory group at business consultancy Moore Stephens.
Pernod Ricard, which has 20 percent of the French market with its Clan Campbell and Ballantine's brands, already operates via 85 distribution centers around the world and could easily use one in Europe or rent more space, chief executive Alexandre Ricard told Reuters this month. The next few months will be key. 
""What is absolutely critical for our business is to be ready to adapt swiftly,"" Ricard said.
... AND OPPORTUNITIES 
Most of the growth opportunities for Scotch whisky comes from outside the EU, in places like Latin America, Asia and the United States, which means the bilateral trade deals that Britain negotiates will be important. 
Among the fastest-growing markets for single malt Scotch in 2016 was the United States - also the world's most valuable market - but also China and India, from a much lower base. 
Overall Scotch sales in India grew 14 percent in 2016 and single malt sales grew 31 percent, despite a 150 percent tariff. ""It's the biggest whisky market in the world but only 1 percent of what is consumed there is Scotch,"" said Dan Mobley, corporate relations director at Diageo. 
Trade deals come down to economic muscle, however, and Britain's economy is roughly 15 percent of the EU's. Such deals are also notoriously slow to cement; talks between India and the EU are stalled after a decade so far.
""I don't think there are any reasons to believe that a UK-India free trade agreement could be pulled off quickly,"" said Ingo Borchert, senior lecturer in economics at the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.
Diageo, which makes 37 percent of the world's Scotch, is keen that Britain copy-and-paste advantageous EU trade arrangements with countries like South Korea and South Africa.
Chief Executive Ivan Menezes believes Brexit disruptions and costs are ""not material"" for a global company with 12 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) in annual sales. He said the company and industry were working ""very forcefully"" with government to make their concerns clear.
""We don't want things that would make moving a case of Johnnie Walker into Europe or a truck crossing the Irish border slow down. It makes no sense,"" he said at a news conference in London in January.
SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE
Brexit comes at a time when the market for all kinds of spirits is expanding and consumer tastes are becoming more adventurous, with upsides and downsides for Scotch. 
""When I started in the business (in the 1990s) people were loyal to a drink. They'd be a whisky or a gin drinker,"" said Ewen Mackintosh, managing director at independent whisky maker Gordon & MacPhail.
""People aren't category-loyal any more, they want to try new things,"" he said at the firm's Speyside distillery, which dates back to 1898.
Exports of single malt whisky rose 14.2 percent in 2017, making up a quarter of total exports and driven by demand for unique tipples. Investment has poured into distilleries over the past five years, unabated by Brexit.
Diageo, which has spent about 1 billion pounds on facilities in Scotland since 2012, is due to reopen two rural distilleries that enjoy cult status among enthusiasts, in Port Ellen and Brora. Pernod will spend 40 million pounds to expand its Scotch bottling facility in Dumbarton this year. More than a dozen smaller whisky distilleries have opened in Scotland since 2013.
Ian Macleod Distillers bought Rosebank, a collector's favorite whose spirit goes for up to 2,500 pounds a bottle, in October 2017. With turnover of 65 million pounds, Macleod's has an 80-million-pound loan facility, backed by whisky stocks, to expand further. 
""Brexit did not come into our decision (to buy Rosebank). We discussed it and dismissed it,"" said Neil Boyd, UK director.
Idled since 1993, the distillery is due to reopen in 2019, along with a visitor's center in Falkirk, a growing visitor destination between Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Tourism is also helping bigger players. Over the past year, the number of tourists visiting Diageo's 12 visitor centers across Scotland rose 15.2 pct. Spending per visitor is up 13 percent in 2016. 
Whisky makers' general confidence may come from decades of working with a product that only gets better with age. 
""If I don't need (the Scotch) as a 5-year-old, you keep it and it becomes a 10-year-old, and then again later it will become a 15-year-old,"" said Gordon & MacPhail's Mackintosh. 

""So if you have the confidence to ride out the hard times, well, actually you can end up in a better place.""

34,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 10:13AM ET</span>",Hedge funds just made a big mistake on tech stocks,"Everyone reacted to the stock market's recent correction in their own special way.
Some investors rushed to protect their holdings, pushing hedging costs to a 14-month high. Others piled back into the flaming wreckage of the short-volatility trade.
Hedge funds, meanwhile, turned their backs on tech stocks. As of last week, they had a net short position on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index for the first time in 21 months, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. It also makes them the most negative on tech stocks since 2011.
And that would be all well and good, except the bearish shift came as tech stocks surged 5.6%, their best weekly performance since October 2014. It was unfortunate timing for hedge funds and other large speculators, who were net bullish on tech for 62 straight weeks without enjoying an increase of that size.
It's worth noting this could be a very brief foray into short territory if hedge funds see recent tech strength as a reason to ""cover"" their positions — or close them through purchases. That would not only push the likes of the Nasdaq 100 even higher, but could also re-orient large speculators as net buyers once again.
And as the dust settles following the equity blow-up earlier this month, there's a lot to be excited about in the US market, especially when it comes to tech. Companies in the industry are expecting to see earnings growth of 31% for the full year 2018, which is 10 full basis points more than the benchmark S&P 500.
Since profit expansion has been a long-running pillar of the nearly nine-year bull market, these forecasts would suggest hedge funds are better off being long tech. And if that change leaves them seeking hedges,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has some alternative ideas for downside protection. "
35,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",It's 'difficult to ignore the magnitude' of Walmart's e-commerce slowdown," Walmart saw its  worst day on Wall Street in more than 30 years Tuesday after reporting earnings that fell short of expectations and spooked investors.
Shares  lost more than 10% in trading, resulting in a $31.6 billion decline in market cap, after e-commerce sales growth slowed to 23% — down from 50% in the previous quarter.
""The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as creating a healthier long-term foundation for holiday,” CEO Doug McMillan said in a press release. ""A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected, as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth.""
The results triggered a number of downgrades across Wall Street, as analysts grappled with the slowdown and lowered guidance for 2018.
""It is difficult to ignore the magnitude of the slowdown in e-commerce,"" RBC analyst Scot Ciccarelli said in a note. “Management expects the growth rate to ramp back up to the 40%+ range after 1Q, but we suspect this target will be met with more skepticism following 4Q17 results than when it was first laid out to investors several months ago.”
Walmart has been beefing up efforts to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) — which entered the grocery game with its $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods last year — through steep discounts on its Jet.com platform, curbside pickup, and a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to compete with Amazon’s Alexa-powered devices.
Company executives downplayed the e-commerce slowdown, pointing instead to unplanned expenditures.
""During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction,"" CFO Brett Biggs said through a spokesperson
Walmart still has some bulls on its side, though. 
“There were some opportunities to better manage the business in Q4, but management is still making good long-term decisions about its asset base, capital allocation, price investment and building capabilities that allow it to offer more options to customers, reduce friction and build a bigger e-commerce business – this has not changed,” Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder said in a note to clients Tuesday.
""It sounds like this end of the investment cycle is more about maintaining momentum and advancing its lead rather than playing catch-up,""
Binder’s $119 price target is well above the Wall Street consensus of $106 for the stock — and 21% above the stock’s closing price Tuesday.
Shares of Walmart are up 33% in the past year. "

C&A's chief sustainability officer Jeffrey Hogue said the privately-held company owned by Swiss-based Cofra Holding AG took the allegations very seriously and was investigating.
""We have a zero tolerance policy for any form of modern slavery including forced, bonded or prison labor. If we detect a case, we immediately terminate our relationship with the supplier,"" Hogue said in an emailed statement.
Peter Humphrey, a British corporate investigator and former journalist, spent 23 months in jail in China for allegedly obtaining private records of Chinese citizens and selling the information on to clients including drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc, charges he has denied.
In an article for the Financial Times last week, Humphrey described his time in jail, including work the prisoners did: ""Our men made packaging parts. I recognized well-known brands - 3M, C&A, H&M.""
The article also made mention of prisoners making textiles and components, but did not say for whom.
An H&M spokeswoman said the Swedish company was looking into the allegations, but could not yet say whether they were true.
Companies have been making more robust efforts to ensure their supply chains are clean of trafficking and forced labor, but there is still room for improvement, according to an annual index compiled by EcoVadis. 
""It is completely unacceptable placing manufacturing into prisons and it seriously violates the regulatory framework that our suppliers must follow,"" the H&M spokeswoman said.
""A failure to comply would immediately lead to permanent termination of our business contract.""
3M, which also has policies prohibiting the use of forced labor, also said it was investigating the report.

""3M does not engage or participate in exploitative working conditions, and we are not aware of any 3M suppliers in China using prison labor,"" a spokesman said.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia (HE:NOKIA) does not see meaningful potential for its ""struggling"" digital health business which includes activity trackers and smartwatches, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The Finnish company, which is mainly focused on making telecom network equipment, earlier this month said it would start a strategic review of its small digital health venture after just two years in the business.
""Rather than only falling in love with our technology, we must be honest with ourselves. In its entirety, our Digital Health business has struggled to scale and meet its growth expectations,"" Nokia's chief strategy officer Kathrin Buvac wrote in the letter to employees.
""Currently, we don't see a path for it to become a meaningful part of a company as large as Nokia... Failing fast isn't failure, it is accelerated learning,"" she added.
A Nokia spokesman declined to comment specifically on the memo, which was initially published by tech news website The Verge, but said: ""We now need to see how the strategic review progresses – there is no pre-ordained outcome.""
Digital health, part of Nokia Technologies unit, is one of the areas where the company had been looking for future growth opportunities amid a tough market for the network gear business.
As an initial move into the market, Nokia in 2016 bought France's Withings, which makes activity trackers and thermometers, for 170 million euros ($209 million). Last year, Nokia brought a new smartwatch to the market but also wrote down 141 million euros of goodwill on the business.
Other parts of the Technologies unit, such as patent and brand licensing for mobile phones, are not in the scope of the review​.
The Technologies business also launched a virtual reality camera in 2015, but last year said it would halt the development of that product.
""Seems Withings is up for sale and the Technologies unit will move away from new ventures and focus on patent licensing,"" said Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at Inderes Equity Research who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock.
""They (digital health and VR) were both high-risk investments in future technologies, which didn't take off. So it's good if the company has the guts to back away from them,"" Rautanen said.
Nokia last year generated sales of 23.2 billion euros, of which 52 million euros came from digital health and digital media.

Some A320neo jets were grounded this month and deliveries were halted after problems arose in January and safety authorities warned of the risk of inflight engine shutdown. 
Pratt, part of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), has said the latest problems stem from an engineering change the company made last summer to the ""knife-edge seal"" in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of the engine.
The people said the most likely option for now was a return to the old seal, which was removed over durability issues. 
An Airbus spokesman referred technical questions to Pratt. The U.S. company was not immediately available for comment.

Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said last week that deliveries to customers should resume in April.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has agreed to raise the wages of around 120,000 workers in Germany by 4.3 percent from May, resolving a dispute that had prompted its first strikes since 2004.
The deal announced by Europe's largest carmaker and labor union IG Metall on Wednesday includes a 100-euro one-off payment, improvements to VW's corporate pension scheme and the right for some workers to choose more time off instead of more money.
It also allows for some workers' hours to be increased temporarily to work on projects, which has been a key demand of industrial employers in recent labor negotiations as they face full order books.
IG Metall had demanded a 6 percent wage increase for workers at VW's facilities in western Germany, a bump in pensions and more hiring of apprentices to help cope with an industry shift to electric vehicles and self-driving technology.
But VW, facing billions of euros in costs and fines over its diesel emissions-test cheating scandal and huge investments for its subsequent transformation plan, had dismissed the demands as excessive.
It had offered to raise wages by 3.5 percent and by a further 2 percent over 30 months.
The 4.3 percent wage increase now agreed for a 27-month period mirrors a deal that IG Metall won for around 3.9 million industrial employees in Germany this month after rolling 24-hour strikes across the country.
""This (similarity) was an important objective for us in order to safeguard the competitiveness of Volkswagen,"" board member Karlheinz Blessing said in a statement.
""At the same time, we have made Volkswagen significantly more attractive as an employer,"" he said.
VW workers will also receive an additional payment equivalent to 27.5 percent of their monthly wage once a year from next year.
Some employees with small children at home or who work a demanding shift schedule can choose to take six additional days off instead, the parties said.
On the other hand, Volkswagen will be able to ask five percent and in special cases even 10 percent of the workers covered by the wage agreement to temporarily increase their working hours to up to 40 per week.
""This provision gives us the additional flexibility which we definitely needed,"" VW chief negotiator Martin Rosik said.

From July 2019, the amount that Volkswagen pays into the company pension scheme each month will rise to 90 euros per member from 27 euros now, and increase to 98 euros from January 2020.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 06:46AM ET</span>","GM proposes $2.8 billion, 10-year investment in South Korea: government official","By Shinhyung Lee and Ju-min Park
SEOUL, Feb 21 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM) (N:GM) has proposed an investment of $2.8 billion into its loss-making South Korean operations over the next 10 years and has asked Seoul to provide its share of the funds, a South Korean government official said on Wednesday.
The U.S. automaker announced last week it would shut down a factory in Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, and that it was mulling the fate of its three remaining plants in South Korea.
GM owns 77 percent of its South Korean unit GM Korea, while state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) owns a 17 percent stake. GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104), controls the remaining 6.0 percent.
The official, who had direct knowledge of the matter, said GM had asked South Korea to inject funds into GM Korea through KDB. On the basis of its shareholding, KDB would provide around $476 million in investment.
The $2.8 billion investment proposal is separate from a roughly $2.7 billion debt-for-equity swap GM is offering to get financial support and tax benefits from Seoul, the official and a lawmaker said. Reuters first reported the details of that part of the plan on Tuesday.
A GM Korea spokeswoman said she cannot confirm details of the investment.
South Korea's trade minister, Paik Un-gyu, told parliament on Wednesday the government had first asked for an audit into GM's ""opaque"" operations in the country, which directly employ some 16,000 workers. 
""By opaque we mean the high cost of goods, interest payments regarding loans and unfair financial support made to GM's headquarters,"" the minister said. 
Paik said the South Korean government needed reassurance from GM on its long-term commitment to the country before it can commit funds.
MOUNTING LOSSES
The head of GM Korea's union said workers will go on a full strike if the U.S. automaker decides to completely pull out of the country.
For now, the 14,000-member union will focus on putting pressure on GM to come up with a concrete turnaround plan, Lim Han-taek, said in an interview. 
Lim said the union will discuss a full strike and other options at a meeting on Thursday.
""We don't want to go as far as a full strike,"" he said, citing negative public views of South Korea's auto unions.
""But if GM says it will completely withdraw from South Korea, we will down our tools."" 
GM's decision to close it Gunsan plant was the latest in a series of steps it has made to put profitability ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015, GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, South Africa and Russia.
A South Korean lawmaker earlier confirmed GM had put forward a proposal including the investment plan and the debt-to-equity swap.
In return, GM requested South Korea take part in financing the investment and raising capital, according to a statement by Jung You-sub, the lawmaker from Bupyeong, where GM runs its biggest factory in South Korea.
On Tuesday, Barry Engle, head of GM's international operations, met with a government-appointed task force in Bupyeong and told reporters the company wanted to stay in South Korea. 
Engle has asked for a meeting on Thursday with the trade minister, trade minister Paik told lawmakers.
GM's international operations head met KDB's chairman and the Korean union leader, according to the bank and the GM Korea union. The union chief said Engle hoped to wrap up this year's annual wages talk as soon as possible. KDB did not provide further details about the talk.
Officials from the government and KDB have said that the automaker has not shared sufficient information about its finances or the cause of its mounting losses in the country.
A KDB official said GM and KDB had agreed to appoint audit firm Samil PwC to conduct due diligence on GM Korea's financial situation. 
South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak.
But the automaker's decision to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe.

GM Korea posted a total of 1.9 trillion won in net losses between 2014 and 2016.

Dish said pay-TV subscribers rose by about 39,000 on a net basis, including 75,000 reactivations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
In the prior quarter, Dish wrote off monthly fees from around 145,000 subscribers in the two regions that were cut off by damage to infrastructure following Hurricane Maria.

Dish, like other pay-TV providers, is combating the growing trend of cord-cutting, where consumers move away from satellite TV packages to online streaming services such as Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Prime.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Lotte Group chairman gives up management rights at key Japan holding company,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The chairman of South Korea's Lotte Group, who was convicted for bribery last week, has relinquished representative rights at a key Japanese holding company, adding further uncertainty to a conglomerate reeling from a plunge in business in China.
Shin Dong-bin will retain his title of vice chairman and position on the board of Japan's Lotte Holdings Co Ltd, which owns major stakes in many Lotte units, the Japanese firm said on Wednesday.
Shin is widely seen as the cohesive leader between the group's South Korean and Japanese arms, whose operations are separate. 
South Korea's Lotte Corp (KS:004990) said it expected cooperation between Japanese and South Korean Lotte units to ""inevitably"" weaken following the development. Executives in South Korea will ""seek to overcome such a situation"" through continued communication with management at Japanese units.
The development comes as Lotte puts up its China hypermarket business for sale, after locals shunned the firm for providing land for a U.S. anti-missile system which drew protest from Beijing. The sale has prompted Lotte to turn its attention to Southeast Asian markets.
Last week, Shin was sentenced to two years and six months in prison over an influence-peddling scandal that has rocked South Korea's business and political elite. He has appealed the conviction.
Shin said he wanted to give up his representative rights following his arrest and the board of directors agreed, Lotte Holdings said in a statement. 
Representative rights are typically given to top executives and grant wide-ranging authority over management matters under Japanese corporate law. 
Lotte Holdings is at the heart of Lotte Group's complicated ownership structure and owns stakes in affiliates including Hotel Lotte Co Ltd and  Lotte Chemical Corp  (KS:011170), as well as indirectly controlling South Korean-based holding company Lotte Corp.
Lotte Holdings shareholders' support of Shin is widely seen as important to keep at bay a brewing dispute at South Korea's fifth-largest business group among its founding family.
Shin and his elder brother were engaged in a feud over control of the group in 2015, after the brother was removed from his positions at Japanese Lotte units.

It was unclear whether Shin's relinquishing of representative rights reflected a change in shareholder support.

73,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says Earnings Trump Bond Yields for European Equities,"(Bloomberg) -- Healthy corporate earnings can help shield European stock valuations from the negative impact of rising bond yields, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
With more than half of Stoxx Europe 600 Index companies having reported fourth-quarter earnings, 54 percent have beaten estimates, according to the bank. That translates into year-on-year growth of 17 percent, it says, the strongest since 2017’s first quarter thus far.
Investors have turned their focus to earnings after the recent global stock selloff shook their confidence. Rising profit momentum can help alleviate their concerns, London-based equity strategist Emmanuel Cau says, noting that the return of inflation is ultimately a positive development for equities as it reflects a stronger economy.
“Healthy earnings growth globally, including in Europe, will help offset the negative impact on valuations from higher bond yields,” Cau said by phone. “The reason why you see inflation picking up is that growth is picking up.”
Other banks, including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), agree that earnings momentum is on the rise. After a lackluster start, results have improved as the season has progressed, according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, with last week being the season’s best thus far. Updates by energy, technology and financial companies are the most favorable, while industrials are trailing, BI says.
Even so, worries remain about the stronger euro taking a bite from European exporters’ profits. Earnings revisions -- which measure the number of analysts raising estimates relative to those cutting them -- have been negative for four of the past five weeks, a  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). gauge shows. BI cautions that revisions of 2018 forecasts are still lacking.
Cau says there is some proof of resilience on this front as well. European profits depend more on sales volume relative to peers elsewhere, he says, given companies’ higher fixed-cost bases. That means top-line growth can benefit more easily from a boost in economic activity. The trend has resulted in the relative sales beat of the U.S. versus Europe slightly narrowing in the fourth quarter, according to JPMorgan.
“European companies’ positive operating leverage can help offset the stronger euro’s drag on earnings,” Cau said. “This is related to the very strong pickup in activity that we have seen in the region and globally.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest level in a week against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, as investor focus shifted to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting. World stocks looked set to fall for a third straight day.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was up 0.2 percent. The index has bounced almost 1 percent so far this week, after slumping 1.5 percent the previous week to its lowest level in three years [/FRX].
MSCI's world index of stocks was down 0.1 percent, set for its third straight decline this week, as a down day in Europe offset earlier gains in Asia.
Investor attention is on the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting in late January, due later in the day. The last readings of U.S. wages and inflation came in higher than expected, with some blaming the numbers for prompting a violent selloff in stocks earlier this month.
""Markets are particularly sensitive to inflation, and we think the odds that the minutes reinforce the narrative of firming inflation are high,"" said Elsa Lignos, RBC's global head of FX strategy.
""We think there is a high probability that the Fed moves the dots to four hikes in 2018 (from three) near-term and that the minutes could be another step in that direction.""
The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easy-money strategies. Confidence in the dollar has also been shaken by mounting worries over the U.S. budget deficit.
U.S. Treasury yields helped to strengthen the dollar, rising as the bond market braced for this week's $258 billion deluge of new government debt. The two-year Treasury yield touched 2.282 percent, the highest since September 2008. [US/]
Increased government borrowing has put upward pressure on Treasury yields. The Treasury Department has issued more debt in anticipation of a higher deficit from last year's major tax overhaul and a budget deal that will increase federal spending over the next two years.
The stronger dollar weighed on commodities, with Brent crude futures losing 1 percent to $64.61 per barrel and U.S. crude oil futures also slipping 1 percent to $61.16.
U.S. crude hit a near two-week high the previous day on news of inventory declines at a key storage hub and from expectations that top OPEC producers could extend cooperation beyond 2018. [O/R].
Spot gold touched a one-week low of $1,329.42 an ounce, having declined 1.4 percent so far this week. 
DOWN DAY FOR STOCKS
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent after slipping earlier in the session following the U.S. market losses, which snapped a six-session winning streak.
Chinese financial markets will resume trading on Thursday after being shut for the past week for the Lunar New Year.
Japan's Nikkei trimmed earlier gains but still ended the day 0.2 percent higher.
Australian stocks were nearly flat and South Korea's KOSPI gained 0.55 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.2 percent.
European shares retreated in early trading, under pressure from a continued rise in bond yields, with pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.6 percent and Germany's DAX falling 0.2 percent.
Bond yields did not rise across the board however - lower- than-expected readings of purchasing manager surveys in France, Germany and the euro zone all came in lower than expected, stabilizing euro zone bond markets [GVD/EUR].

76,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Slowing U.S. auto sales prompts Japan automakers to rethink discounts,"By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - A second year of slowing growth in the U.S. auto market is forcing Japanese automakers to look beyond discounts to grow market share and focus more on boosting profitability in their largest market.
Global automakers have been battling for dominance in the world's No. 2 market as annual sales continue to slide from a record high 17.55 million vehicles in 2016. Many have resorted to price cuts to boost market share in the growth segments for SUVs and pick-up trucks, while also shoring up sales in the struggling sedan segment.
The costs of U.S. discounting has cut into operating profits at most Japanese automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), and Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261), where North American earnings are poised to fall for the third straight year this year. Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) profits in the region are on track to fall for the second consecutive year.
In an interview earlier this month, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said that the days of its high incentives would end once the automaker unloads inventories of 2017 models by the end of the financial year in March, as big discounts were unsustainable in a market where growth had stalled.
""Competition for sales will be difficult in this environment, and improving the quality of sales will be important. We can't compete only with incentives. We need to raise our marketing and brand value,"" he told Reuters.
HITTING A CEILING?
After focusing on growing U.S. sales aggressively since 2011, Nissan is putting the brakes on that strategy, though it is looking to grow strongly in China.
While Nissan's U.S. growth strategy boosted its market share to around 9.2 percent at the end of 2017, up from around 7.8 percent in 2010, it has also raised its marketing expenses to levels which are among the highest in the industry.
Figures from data and analytics company J.D. Power show that in 2017, Nissan offered incentives averaging 16.7 percent of the price of each vehicle sold - higher than an industry average around 10.6 percent.
Nissan discounts in 2017 were second highest only to  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) 18.6 percent, and were higher than 13.6 percent at  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and 14.1 percent at FCA. They were also significantly higher than 9.6 percent for Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and 7.9 percent at Honda Motor Co .
Nissan says that overproduction of its struggling Altima sedan before the release of the new 2018 model had led to a ramp-up in discounts, while it also cut prices on its Rogue line of SUV crossovers to gain market share in the popular segment.
Incentives are a key part of vehicle sales as they attract new business while also rewarding brand-loyal customers, but market experts say that incentive levels above 10 percent are a cause for concern, as that can lower the residual value of vehicles.
Mazda, one of Japan's smaller automakers, increased its spending on marketing promotion per car by 31 percent last year, and acknowledged that spending to increase sales can only go so far.
""Raising incentives beyond these levels won't necessarily translate into higher sales. We need to grow sales by promoting our products better,"" managing executive officer Yasuhiro Aoyama told reporters at a results briefing earlier this month.
While automakers flag the need for more discipline on discounts, industry experts are skeptical as to whether they can keep spending in check as an expected 2.3 percent slide in annual sales to around 16.8 million vehicles this year will likely keep the race for market share fierce. Sales dropped 1.5 percent to 17.2 million in 2017.
""With the pie getting smaller, you'll probably see incentives continuing on the most profitable vehicles as well as where automakers do not want to lose their market share,"" said Brad Korner, general manager of Cox Automotive Rates and Incentives.
""As long as the other big volume players in incentives, like Ford, FCA, Hyundai, maintain their discounting, I don't think that Nissan (and the others are) going to let up any.""

Europe's pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.2 percent by 0824 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) also fell 0.2 percent. 
Another milestone in U.S. treasuries -- the two-year bill yield US2YT=RR touched 2.282 percent, the highest since September 2008 -- was a fresh reminder to investors of the tightening rate environment that triggered recent sharp falls in global equities. 
Telecoms (SXKP) was the only sector to gain, up 0.3 percent, after  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) and Orange (PA:ORAN) both signaled some relief from the heavy downward pressure on prices of recent years. [nL8N1QB0Z9[
Orange's (PA:ORAN) finance chief said the group remained available for consolidation talks in France. The comment failed to boost shares in its local peers, underlining the big obstacles to M&A in the sector.
Earnings updates from bank Lloyds (L:LLOY) and housebuilder  Barratt Developments  (L:BDEV) saw their shares rise. 
Declines among European stocks were broad-based, however, with industrials and the more defensive health care and consumer staples sectors taking the most points off the STOXX 600. 
Around halfway through earnings season, more than half of MSCI Europe firms have either met or beaten analysts' earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, with the bulk of beats concentrated in tech stocks and the energy sector. 
Outside of the STOXX, British mid-cap roadside recovery group AA (L:AAAA) was a notable faller, down 21 percent after cutting its dividend and saying that it expected lower profit in 2019.

85,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Union says it will strike if GM plans full South Korea exit,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean workers will go on a full strike if the U.S. automaker decides to completely pull out of the country, its union head told Reuters on Wednesday, adding he does not rule out the possibility GM might leave. 
For now, the 14,000-member union will focus on putting pressure on GM to come up with a concrete turnaround plan for its loss-making South Korean operations, Lim Han-taek, said in an interview.
GM announced last week it would shut its plant in the city of Gunsan, in southwest South Korea, by May and decide the future of the remaining three plants in the country within weeks.
GM has said it should make ""meaningful progress"" with stakeholders such as the labor union and the government by the end of February, when it will make ""important decisions"" on its next steps. 
Lim said GM's international operations head, Barry Engle, expressed hopes of wrapping up this year's annual wage talks as soon as possible during a meeting earlier on Wednesday. But Lim said it will be difficult to resume contract negotiations by mid-March because its umbrella union has to come up with its demands first. 
""The union will make some concessions, if needed, and the government will provide financial support to GM only if it presents a thorough turnaround plan,"" he said. 
GM has proposed a debt-for-equity swap and fresh investment in its South Korea unit as part of a plan to get financial support and tax benefits from Seoul, officials and sources have said. The South Korean government wants an audit on the company and its ""opaque management"" before any aid is approved.
Lim said the union will discuss a full strike and other options at a meeting tomorrow. 
""We don't want to go as far as a full strike,"" he said, citing negative public views of South Korea's auto unions. 
""But if GM says it will completely withdraw from South Korea, we will down our tools. This will be over. When GM left other markets, they did so boldly. I hope that does not happen in South Korea."" 
GM's Engle has said it will produce two new models in South Korea, but Lim said that would still fall short of turning around GM's operations in the country.

Lim said it will take four years for one of the models, which is a crossover, to begin production. Another model, the next-generation Trax SUV which is due early 2020, will not be able to revive factory utilization rates by itself.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's federal police have arrested a senior official of state-run  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK), the agency said on Wednesday, as an inquiry into a $1.8-billion fraud at the bank expands a week after it unveiled the size of the alleged scam.
India's federal police, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), said Rajesh Jindal, the former head of the bank's Brady House branch in Mumbai between August 2009 and May 2011, was arrested, taking to six the tally of bank officials arrested.
The branch is at the center of the alleged fraud involving firms tied to diamond merchants Nirav Modi, whose lawyer has denied any wrongdoing, and his uncle, Mehul Choksi, whose firm,  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), has said it has nothing to do with the case.
The bank has alleged that as far back as 2011, firms tied to the duo began receiving fraudulent letters of undertaking (LOUs) from its Brady House branch that enabled them to borrow money from overseas banks. 
""During his tenure at PNB Brady House branch, the practice of issuance of LOUs without sanctioned limits to Nirav Modi group firms had started,"" a CBI spokesman said, referring to Jindal.
Jindal, now posted as a general manager handling credit at the bank's head office in New Delhi, is the highest profile bank official so far arrested, said a second CBI officer, who declined to be identified. 
It was not immediately possible for Reuters to reach Jindal, who is in custody and expected to appear in court on Wednesday.Punjab National Bank has not commented on the arrests since it triggered the inquiry with a complaint to federal police that two of its employees had been issuing fraudulent letters of guarantees to firms led by Modi and Choksi.
Late on Tuesday, the CBI said it had also arrested five officials from the groups of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. 
Both groups have not commented on the latest arrests. 

Shares in PNB, which have lost more than a quarter of their market value since the scandal became public, were up 1 percent in early trading on Wednesday.

The investment, being proposed for the next 10 years in South Korea, is needed to produce new models, for research and development, to renovate facilities and for restructuring the business, said Hong Young-pyo, a ruling party lawmaker from Bupyeong, where GM Korea’s biggest plant is based. The automaker is also considering a $2.7 billion debt-for-equity swap at its Korean unit, Hong said in a phone interview Wednesday.
“We have a product plan for GM Korea which will be decided in March by our headquarters that will come with a significant amount of spending,” a spokesman at the carmaker’s local unit said. “We expect our operations and production to continue smoothly over the next 10 years through the plan,” he said, declining to specify the amount of support GM is seeking from South Korea.
The latest moves come amid a standoff between the U.S. automaker and South Korea after GM said it would shut its assembly plant in Gunsan by the end of May and could leave the country entirely if concessions weren’t made to stem widening losses. GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has been ditching poor-performing business units around the globe to play to the company’s strengths and had warned that its operations in South Korea were in dire need of a turnaround and costs were too high.
Seeking Support
GM Korea’s debt has mounted to about 3 trillion won ($2.8 billion). While GM has yet to specify the amount of support the carmaker is seeking from the Korean government and state-run Korea Development Bank, it’s expected to be around 500 billion won, or roughly the value of KDB’s 17 percent stake in GM Korea, the lawmaker said.
GM’s plan to normalize the business is focused on securing production volumes at its Korean plants, Hong said. The automaker is considering the production of a new SUV at the Bupyeong plant and another model at the Changwon factory, according to Hong, who said he and other lawmakers met GM International chief Barry Engle Tuesday.
The company needs to swap debt for equity to help its turnaround as the size of the accumulated debt means GM has to pay about 200 billion won in interest every year, Hong said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen's request to temporarily seal a lawsuit accusing his hedge fund firm Point72 Asset Management LP of sexism toward women.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said Point72 failed to overcome the presumption under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment that the complaint by Lauren Bonner, its head of talent analytics, should be accessible to the public.
Point72 had said the complaint revealed ""highly confidential and sensitive"" information about third parties, including employee pay, and should be sealed until Torres decided whether Bonner's contract required her to arbitrate with the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm.
But the judge found the request too broad, saying that even if the parties agreed to keep the information confidential, or Point72's privacy interest were strong enough, sealing the whole complaint was not ""narrowly tailored"" to serve those interests.
""Defendants could have, but did not, apply to redact the relevant portions of the complaint,"" she added.
A spokesman for Point72 said the firm declined to comment.
Bonner's lawsuit against Cohen, Point72 and its president, Douglas Haynes, alleged that the firm subjects women to a hostile environment, where their work and appearances are denigrated and men are paid better.
Point72 has denied Bonner's allegations and defended its treatment of women.
Cohen, worth $14 billion, according to Forbes magazine, has not been accused of inappropriate behavior.

The case is Bonner v Point72 Asset Management LP et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01233.

In recent months, other HNA units including Bohai Capital and HNA Infrastructure have pledged company shares to raise capital as the conglomerate seeks to alleviate strains caused by a $50 billion acquisition spree.
Many of HNA's listed companies are also known to have pledged shareholdings as collateral to leverage assets in the past few years.
HKICIM said in a filing it had pledged the shares on Feb. 14 but did not disclose terms of the deal. Based on its Feb. 14 closing price, a 41 percent stake would have been valued at about HK$3.1 billion ($392 million).
While levels of borrowing by share pledging do vary, typically lenders advance funds worth 30 percent of the shares pledged.
The HNA unit said it may pledge more shares as collateral to PAG if the loan-to-value ratio falls below a prescribed threshold. A spokesman for PAG declined to comment.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 08:06PM ET</span>",New corruption cases entangle Netanyahu aides,"By Jeffrey Heller and Tova Cohen
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police alleged on Tuesday that Benjamin Netanyahu's former spokesman tried to bribe a judge to drop a fraud case against Netanyahu's wife, the latest corruption investigation encircling the long-serving prime minister.
The new bribery case was one of two revealed on Tuesday involving the same former spokesman, a close Netanyahu confidant. Police also named him as someone they had arrested two days earlier in a separate case involving allegations of corruption at Israel's biggest telecoms company.
The rightwing leader, in office for 12 years since 1996, has seen his dominance of Israeli politics threatened by corruption investigations since police recommended a week ago that he be indicted for bribery and fraud.
He has denied wrongdoing in what are now four separate investigations, including two in which he is personally a suspect. He says the allegations are a political ""witch hunt"".
In the latest case, police said former Netanyahu spokesman Nir Hefetz had offered through an intermediary in 2015 to help a judge win the post of attorney-general if she agreed to use the position to block any proceedings against Netanyahu's wife Sara.
Last September Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said he was considering indicting Sara Netanyahu for fraud over suspected use of state funds for personal dining and catering services amounting to some $100,000. She has denied the allegations and a final decision on charges is pending.
""HALLUCINATORY""
The prime minister rejected the allegation about the attempt to bribe the judge, calling it ""hallucinatory"".
""I never approached Nir Hefetz about this, he never proposed to me anything about it, and you know what? I do not believe he raised the possibility with anyone,"" Netanyahu said.
A lawyer for Hefetz could not be reached.
In the other case revealed on Tuesday, police said they had arrested Hefetz and another Netanyahu confidant, Shlomo Filber, who once ran the Communications Ministry, over allegations of corruption involving the telecoms firm Bezeq. (TA:BEZQ)
Bezeq's main shareholder, Shaul Elovitch, was also arrested, along with his wife and son, and Bezeq's CEO Stella Handler. Elovitch is a family friend of the Netanyahus. The arrests took place on Sunday but were not disclosed for two days under standard Israeli procedure.
Police suspect Bezeq received regulatory benefits in return for providing favorable media coverage of Netanyahu on Walla, a news website that is controlled by Elovitch's holding company Eurocom.
Elovitch has denied any wrongdoing, as have his wife and son, and Bezeq CEO Handler, a Eurocom spokeswoman said. Filber's lawyer declined to comment.
Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case but Israeli media said he was likely to be questioned soon.
Last week, police recommended Netanyahu be indicted in two cases. In one he is suspected of bribery over his acknowledged receipt of gifts from wealthy businessmen, which police say were worth nearly $300,000. In the other, he is alleged to have offered the publisher of Israel's biggest daily to curtail circulation of a rival newspaper in return for positive coverage.
Netanyahu, who has maintained his normal working schedule and is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on March 5, has denied all the allegations and vowed to remain in office to serve out his term, which runs until 2019.

Mandelblit is weighing indictments in those investigations, with a decision possibly months away.

The dollar advanced.
Futures on equity indexes in Japan and Australia declined. The S&P 500 Index slipped below its average price for the past 50 days. Walmart sank the most since 1988. The U.S. Treasury on Tuesday sold $179 billion of securities, with yields on two-year notes and three- and six-month bills climbing to levels unseen since 2008. The dollar rose to the highest in a year against major peers.
The Treasury’s $258 billion of auctions slated for this week comes amid surging rates that gave impetus to one of the steepest equity selloffs in years two weeks ago. While investors seem to have adjusted to 10-year rates at a four-year high for now, the deluge of supply could push yields higher, weakening the case for owning stocks at elevated valuations.
Investors will also get to parse minutes this week from the most recent meetings of both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
Elsewhere, oil in New York rose to a two-week high amid signs of expanding worldwide demand for the growing abundance of U.S. oil. Bitcoin broke above $11,500, almost double its intraday low from just two weeks ago.

107,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 04:09PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Fed Minutes, Housing, Manufacturing, Service Data To Keep Dollar Rebound Alive?
The Federal Reserve publishes Wednesday the minutes of its January meeting at which the central bank voted to keep its benchmark rate unchanged but adopted a more hawkish tone in its monetary policy statement, citing improving inflation.
RBC suggested that the subtle change in the Fed’s language on inflation may have been a deliberate effort by the central bank to open the door to a more “forceful tone on rate hikes” as the year progresses.
A trio of reports on services, manufacturing, and housing are also expected to draw investor interest for clues on the underlying strength of the US economy.
Economists forecast manufacturing PMI to show a preliminary reading of 55.4 for February while services PMI is expected to improve on the prior month reading of 53.3.
Existing Home Sales for January is expected to show a rise of 0.9% in January to 5.6m.
The dollar continued its rebound Tuesday as an uptick in US debt issuance slated for this week, pressured Treasury prices, sending bonds yields surging.
2. Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher as Cushing Inventories Decline
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Wednesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 1.05 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 16.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday as investors cheered upbeat commentary on oil market rebalancing while data showing Cushing inventories declined lifted sentiment.
3. The Pound Attempts Test of $1.4 Against Greenback Again
A raft of UK economic data is slated to hit the wires on Wednesday which could draw a sharp reaction in sterling against the dollar. 
Data from the Office for National Statistics is expected to show, average weekly earnings grew by 2.5% in December, in-line with wage growth in the previous month.
Economist forecast the unemployment rate, meanwhile, remained steady at 4.3% in December, while the claimant count is expected to show a change of 4,100.
Investors will also look for clues about future inflation expectations, when the Bank of England releases inflation report hearings, with a speech by BoE governor Mark Carney likely to garner added attention following investor expectations that the central bank is poised raise rates sooner rather than later.
GBP/USD remained steady against the dollar after a Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources, that the European Parliament is working on a proposal calling for the European Union to negotiate an ""association agreement.""
The agreement was said to give Britain ""privileged"" access to the single market and membership agencies."
108,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",Judge denies AT&T access to White House correspondence on Time Warner deal,"By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday denied AT&T Inc's (N:T) request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether U.S. President Donald Trump pressured the Department of Justice to try to block the wireless carrier's purchase of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX).
The decision is a potential setback to AT&T's plan to argue in an upcoming trial that the Justice Department's decision to oppose the acquisition was politically motivated, perhaps spurred on by Trump's public criticism of the deal and his frequent attacks on Time Warner's CNN.
The trial to decide the fate of the $85 billion deal, which the companies agreed to in October 2016, is set to begin on March 19.
AT&T lawyers said in court on Friday that the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing as evidence statements by Trump as a candidate and as president that the deal was bad for consumers and the country. 
But Judge Richard Leon was not convinced. ""Defendants have fallen far short of establishing that this enforcement action was selective,"" Leon wrote in a seven-page ruling denying AT&T's access to the government communications, which might have bolstered its case. 
""We respect the judge's decision and look forward to the upcoming trial,"" said Dan Petrocelli, lead trial attorney for both AT&T and Time Warner. 
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump criticized the deal as a candidate in late 2016, saying it would concentrate too much media power in the hands of one owner, and once again in November, saying it would raise prices. He has also frequently attacked Time Warner's CNN for what he sees as negative coverage of his campaign and administration. 
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November aimed at stopping AT&T, which owns DirecTV, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, arguing that the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers. 
It is unclear how much the judge's decision will impact the case. Antitrust cases are judged legal or illegal depending on whether prices go up or innovation is lost because of a deal.
In a pre-trial hearing last week, AT&T's Petrocelli derided the government's case as ""weak,"" saying that their economists had determined the price of AT&T's DirecTV could go down and that there could be a small increase to non-DirecTV consumers. 
The Justice Department's Craig Conrath disagreed, saying the deal would cause ""hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.""

AT&T and Time Warner shares both fell slightly.

FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) - A Virginia state court judge on Tuesday rejected a request by the U.S. unit of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) to delay several of the company's trials over excess emissions because of ""inflammatory"" comments made by a lawyer representing car owners that it fears will prejudice the jury.
Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Bruce White said after a hearing that he would proceed with a Feb. 26 trial involving a North Carolina man who bought a 2014 diesel Jetta.
Volkswagen said publicity from a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) documentary that disclosed the company had jointly sponsored tests that exposed monkeys in 2014 to toxic diesel fumes could prejudice its chances of receiving a fair trial.
Judge White said he was satisfied a fair panel could be seated for the expected three-week trial. ""The jurors don't know much about these cases,"" White said generally of high-profile cases.
The German carmaker is being sued by some consumers after it admitted in September 2015 to cheating on diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history.
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers. About 2,000 owners, however, opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation.
Volkswagen of America had asked White to delay that trial for at least six months after a lawyer for more than 300 U.S. VW diesel owners, Michael Melkersen, gave an interview in the Netflix documentary in which he referred to the company testing diesel fumes on monkeys.
In the Netflix interview, Melkersen criticized the tests, adding: ""One cannot help to think back throughout history of another series of events involving individuals being gassed by a person who was actually at the opening of the very first Volkswagen factory,"" an apparent reference to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.
In its legal filing, VW’s lawyers argued those comments would prevent a fair trial.
Volkswagen lawyers said that ""pretrial publicity has connected (the company) directly with Hitler and the Holocaust,"" which they said was not relevant to a trial about claims of consumer fraud.
Melkersen previously said it was ""another tactic to postpone (Volkswagen's) day of reckoning.""

In response to Judge White's ruling, a VW spokeswoman said the company looks ""forward to demonstrating at the upcoming trial that the plaintiff has suffered no damages and that his demands for compensation are extravagant and unfounded.""

(Reuters) - Puerto Rico's beleaguered electric utility has received court approval to borrow $300 million to help pay expenses, well below the $1.3 billion initially sought but enough to avert power outages it had warned about.
On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain approved the loan which had been opposed by creditors of the U.S. commonwealth and its utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, better known as PREPA.
The federal oversight board, which represents Puerto Rico and PREPA in the island's historic financial restructuring, initially sought $1.3 billion to assist with restoring power after Hurricane Maria cut off electricity across much of the island.
The board had argued the utility faced power outages without an immediate cash infusion.
Creditors of the utility and the U.S. territory opposed the initial loan over its terms and size. Last week, the two sides squared off in court, and the judge prodded Puerto Rico's board to reduce the loan to $300 million and rework its terms.
Bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp had questioned whether PREPA even needed a loan while Puerto Rico's general obligation bondholders argued the board sought to subsidize PREPA with funds needed by the island's government.
Puerto Rico is more than $70 billion in debt and PREPA has more than $14 billion in liabilities, including some $8 billion in Power Revenue Bonds.
Quarreling over the loan package has been taking place amid a separate fight between Puerto Rico and creditors over the territory's revised fiscal plan.
The plan would use $18 billion from the U.S. government to turn Puerto Rico's deficit into a $3.4 billion surplus within six years.
Last week, creditors cast doubt on the plan, saying in a joint statement it ""fails to provide a credible basis on which to restructure the island's debt.""

(Reuters) - U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy drug store chain  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD) to create a company with $83 billion in annual revenue, giving it more clout to compete with bigger chains in an industry fearing the entry of Amazon.Com (O:AMZN).
The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the drug retailing sector, which is looking to cut costs amid weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. At the same time, Amazon's foray is widely expected to disrupt the industry, prompting drug chains to beef up their businesses.
Backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, Albertsons hopes the deal will help it become a formidable competitor to CVS Corp (N:CVS) and Walgreens (O:WBA), and give its private equity owners a way to exit their decade-long investment in the grocer.
Cerberus first took a stake in Albertsons in 2006 and scaled it through acquisitions including that of Safeway in 2014. It planned to sell its stake through an IPO in 2017, but dropped the plans after Amazon bought grocer Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) in May.
""The new company will have an expanded footprint and be ranked first or second in 66 percent of the top metropolitan areas in the United States and will be ranked first or second in 70 percent of pharmacy locations,"" Albertsons and Rite Aid said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
Albertsons owns about 2,300 supermarket stores mainly on the east and west coasts of the United States and also operates about 1,800 pharmacies. Rite Aid owns about 2,569 drug stores, after it sold 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens for $4.38 billion.
Albertsons said it would convert its existing pharmacies to Rite Aid stores and let existing Rite Aid outlets operate as stand alone pharmacies.
Together, the combined company will operate about 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington.
Within three years the combined company is expected to deliver annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million, with more than 60 percent within the first two years, the companies said.
The combined company is expected to generate pre-tax earnings of about $3.7 billion within three years, they said.
Rite Aid's shares, which initially surged by as much as 25 percent premarket on Tuesday, were trading up 2.3 percent at $2.18 in afternoon trading.
TOUGH MARKET
The deal follows Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) move to team up with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to form a not-for-profit company to provide health care for their employees, challenging the existing U.S. healthcare system.
The threat of Amazon making further inroads has jolted U.S. drug store chains into action after several years of declines in traffic and sales at front-end stores.
Larger rival CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) reached a $69 billion deal to buy insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) last month, while Walgreens is also reported to have made a takeover approach for drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC).
""Drug retailing has had its own challenges with reimbursement pressure and weak front-end sales as evidenced in Rite-Aid's weak profits over the last couple of years,"" said Mickey Chadha, a vice president with credit ratings agency Moody's.
""Competing with much larger and more diversified drug retailers like CVS and Walgreens will be a formidable challenge,"" he said.
Based on the enterprise value of both Albertsons and Rite Aid, the combined company is valued at $24 billion, an Albertsons Companies' spokeswoman told Reuters.
Rite Aid shareholders can elect to get either one Albertsons common share plus about $1.83 in cash, or 1.079 Albertsons common shares for every 10 shares they hold.
Shareholders of Rite Aid, which had a market cap of $2.33 billion at midday Tuesday, will own between 28 percent and 29.6 percent of the combined company, while Albertsons' shareholders will own the rest based on the elections, the companies said. 

Depending on whether Rite Aid shareholders choose to be paid in cash and Albertsons stock or only stock, the deal values Rite Aid at between $1.30 and $2.65 per share, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said.

""It is not possible to stop that speculation from coming up again and again,"" Stadler was quoted as telling the Handelsblatt daily, adding that he feels ""very clearly"" that he has the support of the leadership of Volkswagen.
Audi Chairman Matthias Mueller, who is also CEO of parent company Volkswagen, appealed to workers last week to ignore a media report that Stadler was about to be removed.
German tabloid Bild reported that Stadler would leave in April because of his handling of the diesel emissions affair, in which Audi played a prominent role, adding Stadler would however be given a new role as VW group finance chief.
Volkswagen has repeatedly attempted to draw a line under a scandal that broke out in 2015 when it admitted cheating diesel-emission tests in the United States to conceal the amount of noxious gases emitted by some of its vehicles.
Stadler said the diesel scandal would continue to plague the company: ""Of course, I am aware that the legal proceedings will continue to occupy us for some time.""
But he added that he and his management team had enough space to focus on the company's future strategy: ""We are doing that with great passion.""
Stadler ran finance at Audi for four years before becoming CEO in 2007. He was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of Volkswagen's controlling clan who was himself ousted in 2015.
His position as CEO has been questioned before but so far Audi's board has rallied around him.

(Reuters) - A steep fall in Walmart shares put the skids on the blue-chip Dow's six-day winning streak, but gains in Amazon and technology stocks propped up the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
The world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer (N:WMT) reported a lower-than-expected profit and posted a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period. Its shares slumped 9.4 percent, on track for their biggest intraday percentage fall in more than two years.
Other retailers including  Target  (N:TGT), Kroger (N:KR) and Costco Wholesale (O:COST) fell between 1.3 percent and 3.7 percent, dragging the S&P consumer staples <.SPLICES> index down 1.62 percent.
""The big thing is the miss by Walmart, driven largely by its online business, and that's having investors scratching their heads,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst with Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. 
""The assumption is that we're all going to have one store and that is Amazon."" 
The online retailer's shares (O:AMZN) were up more than 2 percent.
At 12:47 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 0.34 percent at 25,133.32.
The S&P 500 (SPX) edged up 0.10 percent to trade at 2,734.86 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) gained 0.74 percent to 7,293.06, with support from tech heavyweights Apple (O:AAPL), Nvidia (O:NVDA) and Microsoft (O:MSFT).
""We had a really good last week and it is just a bit of a risk down today,"" said Paul Norte, portfolio manager at Kings view Asset Management in Chicago.
The S&P 500 racked up its biggest weekly increase in five years last week, easing fears that a deeper market correction was taking hold after a handful of large daily losses at the start of February.
The spark for those declines was a rise in U.S. bond yields. The benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields  were hovering at four-year highs of 2.9060 percent on Tuesday ahead of this week's deluge of $258 billion of government debt supply.
Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index (VIX), eased to a session low of 19.95, slightly above Friday's close of 19.46, but way off the 50 points it hit during the market rout earlier this month.
The S&P technology index's (SPLRCT) 0.91 percent gain was the biggest among the 11 major S&P sectors. The index is up 6.5 percent so far this year and is the second biggest gainer after the consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD), which includes Amazon.
 Home Depot  (N:HD) rose 1.1 percent after the largest U.S. home improvement chain's quarterly profit beat market estimates in an improving housing market.
Qualcomm (O:QCOM) fell 2.2 percent after the chipmaker raised its offer to buy  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI) to $127.50 per share from $110. NXP shares rose 6 percent.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,510 to 1,374. On the Nasdaq, 1,587 issues fell and 1,296 advanced.

Xerox could combine with a competitor that is actually willing to pay a significant premium, or Japan's Fujifilm Holdings themselves would step up and offer a full buy-out on fair terms, the shareholders wrote in an open letter. The activist shareholders, who own a combined 15 percent of the U.S. printer and copier maker, have repeatedly urged shareholders to oppose the Fuji-Xerox deal. Icahn and Deason said last week the agreement dramatically undervalued Xerox, and criticized the deal structure calling it ""tortured, convoluted"". ""Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason's letter is consistent with their misguided campaign to undermine Xerox's combination with Fuji Xerox,"" Xerox said in a statement on Tuesday. The company reiterated that among the range of strategic options, combination with Fuji Xerox is the superior path forward for Xerox. On Jan. 31, Fujifilm said it was set to take over Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal and combine it into their existing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. 
Shares of Xerox were up nearly 1 percent.

(Reuters) - Gap Inc (N:GPS) said on Tuesday it was disappointed with the progress at turning around the fortunes of its eponymous brand and that the head of the business, Jeff Kirwan, was leaving.
The surprise move comes just over a week before the apparel retailer is to announce fourth-quarter results. Gap shares were down 3.2 percent in mid-day trading, easing from a decline of as much as 7.6 percent.
""While I am pleased with our progress in brand health and product quality, we have not achieved the operational excellence and accelerated profit growth that we know is possible at Gap brand,"" Gap Inc's Chief Executive Officer Art Peck said in a statement.
The company is trying to tackle muted sales and a shift in consumer preference to online shopping by spending more to refresh underperforming lines, spruce up online offerings and bring new styles quicker to its stores.
Gap Inc raised its 2017 earnings and same-store sales forecasts in November, likely reflecting traction with those initiatives. But those efforts are shining through mostly at Old Navy, while Gap, the company's second-highest revenue generator, finally turned a corner only in the third quarter.
""While we remain confident in Old Navy's ability to post solid results against difficult comparisons, we have less confidence in an operational turn at Gap banner in the short to medium term,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Edward Yruma said.
Yruma expressed concern that the issues around the brand's products, perception and store fleet ""may be difficult to fix.""
The analyst said Kirwan had led the Gap brand since December 2014. Kirwan is not featured on the leadership section of Gap Inc's website.
Same-store sales at Gap, known for its mid-priced clothes, fell more than expected for most of fiscal 2016. The declines have slowed this fiscal and comparable sales rose 1 percent in the third quarter.
Analysts though expect sales dipped 0.17 percent in the holiday quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""I think it's just frustrating because in their last earnings report there was a lot of optimism that Gap was making a come back and at this point it indicates it really has not,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, CEO of retail consultancy firm A-Line Partners.
""Ultimately this is the right decision.""

Brent Hyder, Gap Inc's head of global talent and sustainability, will oversee the Gap brand in the interim. Hyder was previously chief operating officer of the Gap brand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT), the world's biggest retailer, on Tuesday posted a sharp drop in profit and online sales growth during the critical holiday period and forecast annual profit at the lower end of expectations.
Its shares fell 9.4 percent as investors worried that Walmart would not be able to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), the world's biggest online retailer, as it struggles with managing its online business. 
Even as comparable sales in the U.S. market rose for the 14th consecutive quarter, Walmart's online sales grew 23 percent in the fourth quarter that included the holidays. In the same period a year ago, sales grew 29 percent, while online sales were up 50 percent in the third quarter.
It was also slower than Amazon's North American sales growth of 40 percent during the holiday quarter.
Walmart's online performance was hurt during the quarter as growth fueled by the purchase of Jet.com began to lessen and the retailer struggled to balance its online inventory, Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call with investors.
While Walmart added more holiday merchandise like electronics, toys and gifts, it did not stock enough everyday items, which hurt sales. 
Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said Walmart's trouble figuring out online inventory during the quarter raised questions about its preparedness to fight Amazon. 
The company posted about $11.5 billion in U.S. e-commerce revenue for the year but lost money. McMillon expects e-commerce losses this year to be ""about the same"" as last year.
Analysts said the company's price war with Amazon weighed on margins. In November, Walmart's prices were within striking distance of matching Amazon's for the first time.
Walmart recently asked vendors to supply more merchandise priced at $10 and higher in a push to turn an online profit.
Walmart also said it is investing more in its website on a national basis and reducing marketing in Jet.com. The cost to market and acquire a new customer is cheaper with the Walmart brand nationally than for Jet, which targets high-income urban and millennial shoppers.
Walmart forecast earnings of $4.75 to $5 per share for the current fiscal year on a 2 percent increase in U.S. same-store sales. Analysts expected $5 per share for the same period.
Walmart also expects U.S. e-commerce growth for the fiscal year to be around 40 percent. 
Excluding special items that crimped profits such as restructuring charges and an impact from offering a one-time bonus to employees, earnings came to $1.33 per share in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. The average analyst estimate was $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net income dropped 42.1 percent to $2.18 billion from $3.76 billion. Consolidated operating income fell 28 percent to $4.5 billion.
In January, the retailer said it would raise the minimum wage for hourly employees to $11 an hour and offered a one-time bonus to store employees as it benefited from the new U.S. tax law.
Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.6 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, while the market expected a rise of 2 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. The retailer has recorded more than three straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer.
Total revenue increased 4.1 percent to $136.3 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $134.9 billion. 
The company estimated its tax rate would be between 24 percent to 26 percent in the current fiscal year after the new tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to as low as 21 percent. 
""We are currently analyzing the accounting impact of the Tax Act, but our analysis is incomplete,"" the company said in a statement. The retailer recorded a provisional benefit of $207 million for both the fourth quarter and full year.

The stock was down $9.43 to $95.35.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday thanks to a slew of well-received results, though banks were a weak spot after HSBC (L:HSBA) reported weaker than expected earnings and said it needed as much as $7 billion of fresh capital. 
The pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark ended the session with a gain of 0.6 percent, while the banking index (SX7P) declined 0.1 percent.
A weaker euro also helped euro zone stocks make headway after a lacklustre start to the week. 
HSBC dropped 3 percent after its trading update, the last under outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver, who has pushed through a painful restructuring of Europe's biggest bank by market value. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said HSBC's pledge to undertake share buybacks ""as and when appropriate"" could mark a change in capital-return strategy by the new management. 
Elsewhere, some positive earnings buoyed sentiment. 
 Edenred  (PA:EDEN) was among top performers, rising 6.5 percent after the French provider of prepaid meal vouchers and cards reported record 2017 earnings, increased its dividend and expressed confidence for 2018.
Danish software developer  Simcorp  (CO:SIM) led the STOXX index with a 12.2 percent rise after its full-year results. 
Energy stocks supported indices, with  BP  (L:BP),  Total  (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (AS:RDSa) and  ENI  (MI:ENI) up between 0.2 percent and 1.6 percent.
Among regional indexes, London's FTSE 100 was flat, with the world's biggest miner, BHP (L:BLT), joining HSBC among fallers as it dropped by 4.6 percent after missing results forecasts. 
InterContinental Hotels (L:IHG) fell 2.7 percent after putting shareholder payouts on ice as it pursues a new strategy to accelerate growth. 
Swiss financial software company Temenos (S:TEMN) was 6 percent lower after news that it was in talks to buy British rival  Fidessa Group  (L:FDSA) for about 1.4 billion pounds. 

Germany's HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG) gained 0.3 percent after raising its target for savings resulting from the takeover of Italcementi for the third time in less than a year.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Qatar says may switch part of A350 order to biggest model,"By Alexander Cornwell
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus got a boost for its largest twin-engined jet on Tuesday when Qatar Airways said it was considering upgrading some of its A350 orders to the largest model as it took delivery of the first such plane.
The A350-1000 is designed to seat 366 people and competes head-to-head with Boeing's profitable 777. The first A350-1000 was handed over to the Gulf carrier on Tuesday, joining the smaller A350-900, which has been in service for three years.
Airbus says the lightweight A350-1000 is 25 percent more efficient than the most popular current version of the 777, the 777-300ER. 
But sales of the 777-300ER have picked up, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) is working on plans to leapfrog the A350-1000 with an upgraded 777X boasting over 400 seats. 
Boeing last year sold 32 777-300ERs against just one order for the A350-1000. Some airlines have begun downgrading some A350-1000 orders to the 325-seat A350-900.
Qatar Airways, which has ordered both the A350-1000 and the 777X, indicated it was moving in the opposite direction and said it could shift more of its A350 orders to the largest model.
""There is a possibility that we could convert some of the 900s to the 1000,"" Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said.
Qatar is the top A350 customer with 76 on order, including 37 A350-1000s, which have a list price of $367 million. 
It recently canceled four A350-900 orders following delays, but subsequently re-committed to the new European jet family.
NO NEW A350 MODEL
The prospect of upgrades will come as a relief to Airbus, which is gambling on the A350-1000 to contain any market pressure from the 777 as Boeing develops its new model.
Last summer, the European planemaker shelved tentative plans for an even bigger A350 that would compete more directly with Boeing's planned 777X.
Fabrice Bregier, speaking on his last day as Airbus chief operating officer, said on Tuesday studies had shown the idea worked in principle, but that Airbus would focus instead on pushing the A350-1000.
""It's now time to start to be more aggressive and to explain to our customers, or Boeing's customers, that this aircraft will be a better choice than a 777-9X,"" Bregier said.
Boeing insists that its jet will be the world's most efficient aircraft in its category, thanks to new wings.
Baker said Qatar Airways, one of the world's major fleet buyers, is not interested in an ultra-long-haul version of the A350-900 being floated by Airbus for carriers like Qantas (AX:QAN) but could buy more of regular A350 jets.
""Yes, there may in future be a requirement for more of these airplanes for Qatar Airways, especially when we do further enhancements of our acquisitions,"" he said.
""And of course there is a probability we will buy more of these airplanes to put in our leasing company.""
He also ruled out orders for the largest and smallest Airbus jets - whether the 544-seat A380, of which it has bought 10 and has options for another three, or the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries, a 110 to 130-seater that Airbus agreed to rescue last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A six-day rebound in world stocks sputtered on Tuesday, hurt by rising bond yields and disappointing earnings from U.S. retailers, while the U.S. dollar extended a rebound from three-year lows.
Pressured by higher yields, Wall Street's main equity indexes fell after six straight days of gains as the market reopened following the Presidents' Day holiday on Monday.
Shares of the world's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) slumped more than 9 percent after the company reported a lower-than-expected profit and a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period. 
Shares of other retail majors Target and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) also fell, dragging the S&P consumer staples index down 1.93 percent. (N) 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 188.27 points, or 0.75 percent, to 25,031.11, the S&P 500 lost 10.19 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,722.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.76 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,251.23. 
World equity markets also sank, with the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shedding 0.42 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.58 percent, and Asian stocks were also subdued. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.38 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 1.01 percent.
European shares held steady, supported by softer domestic currencies. (EU) The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent. 
Investors looking to the greenback shrugged off worries about the U.S. budget deficit, focusing on large U.S. government debt auctions this week and sending the dollar higher.
""What we are seeing is just a little bit of profit-taking (in other currencies), a little bit of bargain-hunting,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. 
""Given the focus on the deficit, the dependence on foreign investment, I think we will have to see relatively strong demand at these auctions,"" he said. 
U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield hovering near a four-year peak as investors made room for this week's deluge of $258 billion of government debt supply.
The dollar index, tracking the unit against key world currencies, rose 0.59 percent, continuing its rebound from three-year lows. The euro was last 0.51 percent lower at $1.2344.
The stronger dollar and uncertainty about big Treasury auctions weighed on gold prices, which dropped for a third session.
Spot gold dropped 0.6 percent to $1,338.00 an ounce.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 11:19AM ET</span>",Home Depot's earnings powered by strong U.S. housing market,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc's (N:HD) profit and revenue topped Wall street estimates for the sixth straight quarter as more shoppers visited the No.1 U.S. home improvement chain and, on average, spent more in an improving housing market.
Shares of Home Depot, which raised its quarterly dividend by 15.7 percent to $1.03 per share, were up about 1.4 percent at $189.55 in morning trading. They rose more than 4 percent premarket.
The U.S. housing market has been on a winning streak, helped by rising employment and higher wages. That has encouraged homeowners to buy new homes or remodel existing ones, benefiting Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW).
""The U.S. economy is strong and tax reform is net positive for the housing industry,"" Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said on an earnings call.
""We expect higher job growth, higher income growth, and higher mortgage rates. But with that comes higher home price appreciation and rising housing demand, which should drive home improvement spending,"" she said.
However, Home Depot's comparable store sales growth forecast for its current fiscal year was shy of analysts' estimates. But that did not deter Wall Street's expectations.
""The outlook will prove conservative given continued momentum in housing and the company's ability to execute,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said.
Home Depot's results are in contrast to that of Walmart Inc (N:WMT), which on Tuesday reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and posted a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period.
Home Depot said sales at its stores open for more than a year rose 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28. That beat analysts' average estimate of a 6.5 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Customer transactions rose 2 percent, while the average check value rose 5.5 percent.
The company expects comparable store sales growth of 5 percent in the current fiscal, while analysts were expecting a 5.4 percent increase.
The retailer's quarterly net sales rose 7.5 percent to $23.88 billion, beating estimates of $23.66 billion.
Home Depot's profit rose 2 percent to $1.78 billion, or $1.52 per share, though growth was curbed by a $127 million charge related to the U.S. tax law changes.

Its adjusted earnings of $1.69 per share beat analysts' estimate of $1.61.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 10:33AM ET</span>","U.S. top court rejects investor appeals over Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac","By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to revive litigation in which shareholders accused the federal government of overstepping its authority when it restructured mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac following the 2008 housing crisis. 
The justices left in place a lower court's 2017 ruling that the investors, led by hedge fund Perry Capital, could not pursue legal claims accusing the government of unlawfully channeling profits from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the U.S. Treasury Department.
The government seized so-called government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at the height of the financial crisis as they teetered on the brink of insolvency. The government took a majority stake in each. 
The Treasury Department ended up pumping $187.5 billion into the companies. They have since returned to profitability. In court papers, Perry Capital said the Treasury Department has now received back its entire investment plus an additional $88 billion.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last year that a lower court had correctly barred claims that the government overstepped its authority in 2012 by eliminating dividend payouts to various shareholders and requiring the companies to pay the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to their quarterly net worth.
That court said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors could still pursue some damages claims, including for breach of contract.
Perry Capital, which in 2016 announced plans to shut down, was among those that sought to challenge the lower court's dismissal of lawsuits, arguing the government's confiscation of profits was illegal. 
Other shareholders that sued included Fairholme Funds Incand individual investors. Another hedge fund, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP, the biggest common shareholder in both companies, filed a brief asking the justices to take the case.
The appeals court said the government had the authority under a 2008 law that laid the groundwork for its seizure of the two companies.
Both companies are now under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said before taking office last year that the companies should be returned to private control but has since said that they should not be privatized.

171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Fed's Haste Makes Canadian Debt a Better Bet Than Treasuries,"(Bloomberg) -- Canadian government bonds are outperforming their U.S. counterparts by the most in seven months, an advantage that’s unlikely to disappear soon with the northern central bank in less of a rush to raise interest rates.
“There’s way too much optimism priced into the Canadian curve,” said Darcy Briggs, a Calgary-based portfolio manager at Franklin Bissett Investment Management with C$5.4 billion ($4.3 billion) in fixed income. “I don’t expect Canadian rates to move as high or as fast as in the U.S.”
Traders have boosted wagers that the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase interest rates steadily this year amid evidence U.S. inflation is creeping higher and concerns over the federal government’s fiscal deficits. In Canada, expectations for monetary tightening have held steady amid signals of slower growth, including January’s job slump, the biggest decline in payrolls since 2009.
Canadian five-year bonds were yielding 2.12 percent at 9:52 a.m. in Toronto, 54 basis points less than similar maturity U.S. notes. That gap could widen to more than 80 basis points, according to Briggs.
Mark Chandler, Toronto-based head of fixed-income research at RBC Capital Markets, expects the spread to stay steady in the next few quarters before widening at the end of the year and reaching as much as 85 basis points by the end of 2019.
“The U.S. is somewhat ahead of Canada on a cyclical basis,” and so, at some point, Fed expectations should further surpass those for the Bank of Canada, he said.
Hike Odds
James Dutkiewicz, Toronto-based chief investment officer at Sentry Investments Inc., is skeptical the gap can get much beyond 50 basis points, which has been about the limit for most of the past 25 years.
“We are likely close to the extreme,” said Dutkiewicz, whose team manages about C$14 billion. “Seventy-five basis points would be my guess for how far it can go this time.”
Fed funds futures indicate a March hike by the U.S. central bank is almost certain and the prospect of three full hikes for 2018 is increasingly being priced in. That would match the median projection among policy makers, yet there’s a growing number of economists who expect that they could tighten as many as four times in 2018.
In Canada, swaps traders expect the central bank to increase rates two or three times more this year after tightening policy in January for the third time in six months. But the Bank of Canada may prefer to see the Canadian dollar weaker than near C$1.25 per greenback to protect the country’s competitiveness, according to Franklin Bissett’s Briggs.
“There’s a lot of headwinds and a lot of uncertainty,” he said. “The market is saying: Well, you gotta hike rates. But the Bank of Canada is more likely to take its time, if it needs to hike rates at all.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The emergence of self-driving electric cars and travel sharing are set to dent oil consumption by 2040, oil and gas giant  BP  (L:BP) said, forecasting a peak in demand for the first time.
In its benchmark annual Energy Outlook, BP forecast a 100-fold growth in electric vehicles by 2040, with its chief economist Spencer Dale painting a world in which we travel much more but instead of using private cars, we increasingly share trips in autonomous vehicles.
While travel demand more than doubles over the period as economies in countries such as China and India grow, higher oil demand will be more than offset by increased engine efficiency standards as well as the larger number of EVs and shared traveling.
Unlike many other forecasts, including previous BP Energy Outlooks, which looked solely at the growing share of EVs in the car fleet, BP this year focused on the share of vehicles kilometers powered by electricity.
Under BP's Evolving Transition scenario, which assumes that policies and technology continue to evolve at a speed similar to that seen in the recent past, some 30 percent of car kilometers are powered by electricity by 2040 from almost zero in 2016. 
At the same time, the number of EVs is set to increase from 3 million today to over 320 million by 2040, representing roughly 15 percent out of a total car fleet of 2 billion.
The gap between the increasing number of EVs on the road and the kilometers powered by electricity is due to the expected growth in so-called shared mobility by EVs, Dale said.
""Cars will be used much more intensely over time,"" Dale told reporters in a briefing on Monday ahead of the release of the report on Tuesday.
As a result, fuel demand from the car fleet is forecast to dip to 18.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2040 from 18.7 million bpd in 2016, when it represented around one fifth of total oil demand, according to BP. 
CHEAPER RIDES
BP expects autonomous vehicles to become available in the early 2020s. Their initial high cost means the vast majority of the cars will be bought by fleets offering shared mobility services.
The average electric car is expected to be driven about two and a half times more than an internal combustion car, according to Dale. 
""What we expect to see in the 2030s is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars ... Once you don't have to pay for a driver, the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about 40 or 50 percent,"" Dale said.
The vast majority of the shared mobility is expected to be EVs because of their lower maintenance costs. 
Car makers including General Motors (N:GM) and high-tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo and Uber Technologies have poured billions into the autonomous vehicles industry hoping gain a first-mover advantage. Robo-taxi services are seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles.
BP sharply raised its estimate of growth in electric vehicles in the coming decades from last year's forecast that EVs would reach 100 million by 2035. The big upwards revision is due to an increase in hybrid cars and an expected sharp growth in EV purchases in the second half of the 2030s, Dale said. 
PEAK OIL
London-based BP joined other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) in forecasting a peak for oil demand in the late 2030s, when it is expected to slightly decline at around 110 million bpd.
It did not foresee a peak in demand in its previous outlooks that stretched into 2035.
While the transportation sector will continue to dominate the growth in oil consumption, demand for plastic manufacturing will become the main source of growth in the 2030s. 
Oil companies such as BP, Shell and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) are betting on growing demand from the petrochemical sector in the coming decades. 
Dale however said changes in regulations for plastics consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags and packaging could dent oil demand by as much as 2 million bpd, roughly the same as the impact of EVs.
Overall energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades, rising by a third into 2040, or roughly 1.3 percent per year, driven by growth in China and India, but the world is learning to ""do more with less energy"" as economies become more efficient, Dale said.
For example, the European Union's gross domestic product is set to treble in 2040 from 1975 but the level of energy demand will be the same.
China's energy demand will continue to grow but at a slower pace by the 2030s, when India will become the main driver of growth.
BP once again revised upwards its forecast for growth in renewable power, which is set to grow by 40 percent by 2040, with its share in the energy mix increasing from 4 percent to 14 percent. 
The revision is due to technological gains as well as more aggressive government policies, particularly in India and China.
""There is plenty of scope for policy to continue to surprise us"" to further boost the growth in the renewables, Dale said.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 09:47AM ET</span>","Reshaped Maersk aims to deliver competition for UPS, Fedex","By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) plans to compete directly with package delivery companies UPS (N:UPS) and Fedex (N:FDX) as it expands its transport and logistics business, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, sold its North Sea-focused oil and gas business in August to France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) in a $7.5 billion deal in August as it focuses on transport and logistics. 
As part of its restructuring, Maersk aims to expand its services to all parts of the supply chain, giving customers the chance to deal with one firm when shipping goods from one side of the world to another.
""We're building this company that is a global integrated container business, a company very similar to UPS and Fedex,"" CEO Soren Skou told investors at a capital markets day in Copenhagen on Tuesday.
""I hope they will be considered peers of ours, when we are done with this journey in 3-5 years,"" he added.
The capital markets day was being held less than two weeks after the world's largest container shipping firm missed profit forecasts and gave what analysts saw as a conservative outlook.
Maersk has acknowledged that despite handling one in seven containers globally, being the biggest is no longer enough, as the growth of e-commerce is driving demand for quicker, easier and more flexible shipping.
""Our customers businesses are to a large extent changing, they are being disrupted by new technologies, by e-commerce and new ways of doing things,"" said Maersk's chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc.
Maersk is betting that a digital drive, in which it for example has teamed up with  IBM  (N:IBM) to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform, will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas such as freight forwarding and trade finance.
However, on Tuesday investors were left with little detail on Maersk plans to monetize the blockchain project or how it will use the proceeds from breaking up the conglomerate.
Shares in Maersk were trading 4.6 percent lower at 10,400 Danish crowns at 1420 GMT, below the August level when the Total sale was announced and around same level as when it announced its new strategy in September 2016. 
""Many had hoped for something more specific for example with regards to how the proceeds from the sale of Maersk Oil will be distributed,"" said Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard of the fall in share price.

The firm still aims to find solutions this year for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, which is being valued at $4.7 billion and $0.6 billion respectively according to analysts' consensus.

Ford Credit Europe (FCE) sought a German banking license, to run alongside its existing British one, last year because the future of passporting, which allows financial firms to serve the whole EU from a single base, is uncertain after Brexit.
""We anticipate that the German bank will be established in the second half of 2018,"" said a spokesman.
""Any reorganization of FCE’s business involving finance companies depends on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.""
FCE said it would keep its headquarters in Britain and that the plan would not include job losses or significant changes to where employees are based. 
FCE, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Ford, provides financial services to dealers, retail, fleet and business customers in Britain and 11 other countries in Europe.

It said that as part of its Brexit contingency plans it may need to set up finance companies in markets where it currently has branches.

However, the word’s largest retailer  reported better-than-expected revenues of $136.27 billion, where analysts polled by Bloomberg had anticipated $134.83 billion. On a per share basis, Walmart missed, bringing in an adjusted $1.33 versus the $1.37 that was expected.
Online sales grew 23% in the final quarter of the year, the company said, down from 50% a year ago as it finalizes the integration of its  $3.3 billion Jet.com  acquisition from 2016.
""Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23 percent, down from 50 percent in the third quarter,"" CEO Doug McMillan said in a statement. ""The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as creating a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected, as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth.""
Walmart has plenty of room to go in order to catch  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which last year bought natural grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.
Since Amazon's entrance into the grocery industry, Walmart has teamed up with  Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to explore voice-command shopping much like Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo devices, as well as cut prices in stores, and rolled out curbside grocery pick up in thousands of locations.
Shares of Walmart have gained 38% in the past year.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",EU studying U.S. tax reform in depth before deciding on any action,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Top European Union finance ministers said on Tuesday the bloc is considering how to respond to last December's U.S. tax reform, and will have a clear view on whether it is in breach of international rules in the spring.
The reform slashed corporate tax rates in the largest change to U.S. tax laws since the 1980s, but the EU said some of the measures could breach World Trade Organisation rules and hamper trans-Atlantic trade and investment.
The European Commission was asked to prepare a detailed assessment of the impact of the reform and its compatibility with WTO rules, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday, after EU finance ministers discussed the issue in a regular monthly meeting in Brussels.
Asked whether the EU could file a complaint at the WTO, Le Maire told a news briefing: ""On the basis of the commission's conclusions we will see what will do next. All options are open."" 
His German counterpart, Peter Altmaier, echoed Le Maire's remarks. ""As a last resort we could insist that WTO rules should be respected,"" he said.
""We will look into the economic aspects of the reforms. We want to avoid that companies move their headquarters to the U.S. and that investment flows might be reversed. This is important to keep jobs in Europe. We will do everything to prevent unfair competition,"" he added.
EU finance ministers and top EU commissioners wrote to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in December saying the reform posed double taxation risks for EU financial firms operating in the United States.
The EU Commission's Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said the assessment of the EU executive on the overall impact of the U.S. reform will be ready in spring.

""It is too early to speculate on possible retaliatory measures,"" Dombrovskis said.

186,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 09:02AM ET</span>",Rand's `Ramaphosa Rally' in Doubt Amid Mixed Technical Signals,"(Bloomberg) -- Is the party over for the rand?
South Africa’s currency reached a three-year high after Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in as head of state on Feb. 15, fueling optimism among investors that management of South Africa’s economy will improve. Benchmark bond yields fell to levels last seen in 2013, while stocks had their best week in more than eight years. With the rand paring some of its advance this week, traders are divided about whether there’s scope for further gains.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). thinks the market has run ahead of itself, and took profit on its rand and interest-rate bets this week. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). agrees, but is staying put in the absence of any near-term triggers to spark a correction.  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, on the other hand, increased its overweight exposure to South African sovereign debt, while  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc is betting on further rand strength.
Read more here about Ramaphosa’s economic challenges
“There has been a fantastic run in rand assets,” Luis Costa, a strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Ltd., wrote in a note Monday. “The so-called Ramaphosa rally has indeed materialized. It is now time for some reflection.”
These charts provide some food for thought:
Momentum indicators suggest the rand’s not about to surrender its gains. The dollar’s 14-day relative strength index versus the rand has remained above the 30 level since the beginning of February, and is moving higher. A level below 30 indicates to some traders that the rand has strengthened too quickly and is due for a correction. While a reading just above 30 hardly suggests further rand gains, it also indicates that the market’s not yet ripe for a retreat.
While JPMorgan sees the rand at about 7.5 percent overvalued, the currency’s real effective exchange rate -- a measure of its value against a basket of majors -- is close to its long-term average, suggesting it’s about as fairly valued on a trade-weighted basis as it’s been in the past ten years. Short-term risks -- such as a downgrade of rand debt to junk by Moody’s Investors Service -- are diminishing, so there’s nothing to push the rand off its pedestal for now, JPMorgan’s Anezka Christovova wrote in a note to clients.
The rand’s implied volatility is on the decline from the elevated levels it reached during the leadership battle between Ramaphosa and Jacob Zuma. That suggests traders are anticipating price swings to narrow even as short-term risk factors -- including Wednesday’s budget presentation and the debt-rating review by Moody’s -- approach. The premium of options to sell the currency versus those to buy it, known as the 25-Delta risk reversal, is also ticking lower as traders cut back on bearish bets."

Richard, who also serves as Orange's chief executive officer, faces legal charges, which he denies. But Orange said in a statement it was renewing Richard's mandate as a member of its board, in anticipation of renewing his position as chairman of the board.
Shareholders will vote on renewing his mandate at the company's annual general meeting in May, Orange said.
Richard faces charges over payments to businessman Bernard Tapie of about 400 million euros ($494 million) from public funds. The payments were made in 2008, when Richard was chief of staff to Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister. He denies any wrongdoing.
Last month, Richard got the backing of French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said Richard's contract should be renewed. The French state is Orange's biggest shareholder.
In December, Richard told investors that he would invest in upgrading networks rather than in content.
Richard is credited with improving Orange's results in the fiercely competitive French market, where it contends with the likes of  Bouygues  Telecom (PA:BOUY), Altice (AS:ATCA) and  Iliad  (PA:ILD).
France's telecoms and media industries face the challenge of dealing with contrasting demands from customers who want both fast Internet services and appealing media content.

 Deutsche Bank  chose the new office for its London headquarters in March last year, signaling a vote of confidence in London's future as a global financial hub despite Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
The German lender entered into exclusive negotiations with Land Securities over a 25-year lease on a new building to be constructed at 21 Moorfields, close to the head offices of  Standard Chartered  Bank (L:STAN) and Legal & General (L:LGEN).
Since then Germany's biggest bank has also said it expected to relocate fewer UK-based staff than some senior officials had estimated following Britain's departure from the EU.
The deal with Land Securities was conditional on achieving revised planning consent, with Deutsche Bank committing to take a minimum of 469,000 square feet, the developer said.
Land Securities, who described Deutsche Bank as ""one of the largest employers in the city"", expects practical completion for the ""strategically important site"" in November 2021.
""Deutsche Bank's move demonstrates a high level of confidence in the City of London as a leader in financial and professional services,"" Chris Hayward, Planning and Transportation Committee Chairman at the City of London Corporation, said in the statement.

Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

SOWETO, South Africa (Reuters) - Ndumiso Madlala, head of the Soweto Gold Brewery, says he is banking on new South African President Cyril Ramaphosa to kick-start the economy and help his business grow.
The micro brewery was founded five years ago in the Johannesburg township but has struggled to grow in a fiercely competitive market for beer as high unemployment and a weak economy strangled consumer spending.
Madlala places much of the blame on the administration of Jacob Zuma, who reluctantly resigned as president last week after a nine-year tenure plagued by corruption allegations and economic stagnation.
""We started at the time when the economy was not doing so well,"" Madlala, a chemical engineer who previously worked at Heineken, told Reuters at his brewery where the walls are adorned with photographs of anti-apartheid heroes.
""Now with Ramaphosa coming in, we really hope the economy is going to grow fast and with the economy growing fast, small businesses like ourselves can also grow at a much faster rate.""
He did not give more specific details of his expectations for the new government, but said his goal of selling 1 million hectolitres of beer by 2020, from 50,000 hectolitres now, could be achieved sooner if Ramaphosa boosted consumer confidence.
Soweto Gold currently only distributes its products to South Africa's wealthiest province Gauteng, but plans to extend to five more provinces by the end of March before launching nationwide in August.
Madlala is one of many business leaders in South Africa, as well as investors at home and abroad, who are pinning hopes on Ramaphosa, a former businessman who held stakes in mining company Lonmin (L:LON), mobile operator MTN Group (J:MTNJ) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) South African franchise.
Yet despite the early optimism of Madlala and others, some economists and analysts caution there may be no quick fix for an economy that is forecast to grow just 1.4 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2019.
Africa's most developed economy needs faster economic growth to reduce the high joblessness rate - currently at 27 percent - and alleviate the widespread poverty that has persisted since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.
'NEW COURSE'
Financial markets roared their approval when Ramaphosa of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) was sworn in last week. South Africa's main stock index surged as much as 5 percent, the rand <ZAR=D3> hit its strongest levels in three years while bond investors pushed the yields on the benchmark 2026 note sharply lower.
Banks, considered the barometer of South African political and economic sentiment, are among the best performing stocks on the bourse, up nearly 8 percent - far outpacing a largely flat blue-chip JSE Top-40 index (JTOPI) as of Monday.
""President Ramaphosa has an opportunity to set out a new course and chart a clear vision for South Africa,"" said Mike Brown, chief executive of No.4 lender Nedbank (J:NEDJ). ""We urge him to set out clear policy ambitions that will help unlock investor confidence and pent up economic activity long stymied by policy uncertainty.""
Apart from the revitalizing the economy, business executives would like see more policy certainty - particularly in the mining industry, an important economic engine which has been fighting in court with Zuma's mines minister over an increase in black ownership targets.
Mining industry lobby group, the Chamber of Mines, agreed at the weekend to delay a court challenge, which was set to resume on Monday, against the regulations following an intervention by Ramaphosa.
Mining companies have said the new rules, which also stipulate they must pay 1 percent of their turnover to local communities, were deterring investment in a sector grappling with unpredictable commodity prices.
""I'm very optimistic about the future of South African mining,"" said Peter Steenkamp, chief executive of Randfontein-based gold miner Harmony Gold. ""It's early days but we know the leadership of the new elected ANC leadership is very familiar with mining, we've got both (ANC chairman) Gwede Mantashe and Cyril Ramaphosa, ex-mining people there.""
Investors, business leaders and rating agencies are watching closely for how Ramaphosa is going to deal with corruption and clean up cash-strapped state-owned enterprises.
""There is no time to celebrate,"" said Bonang Mohale, chief executive of business lobby group Business Leadership South Africa. ""Our state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are bankrupt. We need to address the leadership, capital structure and governance issues gripping these SOEs.""
But for Madlala, the real test awaiting Ramaphosa is to raise the disposable income of consumers.
""We've had doom and gloom for the past few years under the Zuma leadership and now with Ramaphosa coming in there's new energy and we certainly hope it will translate into people visiting restaurants and trying out our brand,"" he said.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 06:51AM ET</span>",The brand Olympics: getting attention without getting in trouble,"By Liana B. Baker
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - In packing for the Winter Olympics, Canadian entrepreneur Domenico Ciarallo stuffed his bags with hats and t-shirts bearing the logo of his company, which makes locker-room dryers.
Once on the ground, though, he is wary when handing them out to any Olympians even if he sponsors them.
""The athletes put them in their bag right away but they know that they can't wear these here because you can get caught not wearing official team merchandise,"" Ciarallo said.
Ciarallo's Montreal-based Rocket Sport, whose equipment keeps ice-hockey gear dry, is among a group of companies, big and small, trying to grab attention at the Pyeongchang Games without infringing on official Olympic sponsors.
They also include Apple Inc (O:AAPL), camera maker  GoPro Inc  (O:GPRO) and  Under Armour  (N:UAA) which have been looking for cracks in the IOC's sponsorship wall without ruining the party for Olympic sponsors such as Samsung (KS:005930), Panasonic Corp (T:6752) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) , which sponsors Team USA.
""Guerilla marketing tactics around large-scale events like the Olympic Games are more comprehensive and complex than ever,"" said David Abrutyn, a marketing expert at sports investment firm Bruin Sports Capital.
Sponsorship accounts for a fifth of revenues for the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which protects that income by monitoring closely for any infringements.
""The IOC and its partners in the Olympic movement take the threat of ambush marketing very seriously,"" an IOC spokesman said.
But guerrilla marketing can still find legitimate opportunities at the Games, though it can involve a lot of legwork and can be toughest for small entrepreneurs like Ciarallo who is advertising his presence at Pyeongchang on his website and by word of mouth but can do little else.
Brewer Red Stripe, controlled by Heineken Holding (AS:HEIO), took its golden opportunity when Jamaica's women's bobsled team suddenly parted ways with their coach, who had also been helping to finance their Games campaign.
Red Stripe gave them the funds to carry on, earning global news coverage. But the firm still had to be careful: it created Twitter hashtags #RedstripeToTheRescue and #SleighAllDay which skirted its link to the team and made no reference to the Games.
The Jamaican team confirmed their agreement with Red Stripe. Red Stripe could not be reached for comment.
Under Armour also helped Nigeria's women bobsledders, outfitting them and making a documentary ahead of Pyeongchang about the first bobsledders to represent an African country.
Online fashion magazine Teen Vogue was among media outlets that posted the Under Armour video during the Olympics, a move the outfitter said brought the ""story to consumers that we could never have afforded to market to in the traditional sense"".
'PLAYING BY THE RULES'
Some big firms, which support individual Olympic athletes or teams without being Games sponsors, can also ask for Olympic waivers which give them approved marketing opportunities on the condition they cannot use Olympic symbols or references.
GoPro, whose cameras are used in extreme sports, secured waivers allowing it to stream video starring Olympians such as U.S. snowboarder Jamie Anderson on social media before the Games. Anderson won the women's slopestyle gold in Pyeongchang.
At the Games, GoPro also hunted for smaller marketing opportunities. It planned to fit its cameras to non-competing skiers who test the alpine course right before races and to share the footage online, a GoPro executive said in Pyeongchang.
GoPro, which sponsors the U.S. ski and snowboard team, did not respond when asked if this went ahead.
""We try to be very respectful of IOC and USOC (U.S. Olympic Committee) and existing sponsors that we know are paying exorbitant amounts of money to be part of the Olympics,"" said GoPro's global head of marketing, Todd Ballard.
Apple has also found a small opportunity at Pyeongchang.
It lent about 15 gold iPads and more than a dozen Apple watches to the U.S. bobsled team's coaching and support staff at the Olympics. The coaches had been using outdated iPads to analyze training runs and asked Apple last year for new ones.
""We were surprised when we opened the box from Apple and the iPads were gold. We thought this was a good omen,"" said U.S. bobsled and skeleton spokeswoman Amanda Bird.
On the sidelines of the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, Apple sold limited edition Apple watchbands in national team colors.
Apple declined to comment.
Ciarallo, the entrepreneur with the upstart dryer company, also knows he must be careful. ""I'm playing by the rules. If I do something not so kosher, I'm dead.""

240,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>",Murdoch's Fox seeks to win bid approval by extending Sky News guarantee,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox has strengthened its offer to protect the independence of Sky's loss-making news channel to try to overcome regulatory concerns about Fox's takeover of the parent company.
Britain's competition regulator has said Fox's $15.7 billion deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own should be blocked unless a way is found to reduce the influence Murdoch could wield through the ownership of Sky News.
The objections marked the latest twist in Murdoch's eight-year battle to take control of Europe's leading pay-TV company, forcing Fox to come back with more and more concessions to try to allay concerns about the deal and win regulatory approval. 
The takeover is being closely watched in the United States where Murdoch has agreed to sell a string of assets to the Walt Disney company, including Sky, for $52.4 billion. 
Last week, Fox pledged to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for five years, and on Tuesday it upped this offer to run for 10 years. 
It had already proposed to establish a fully independent board to oversee the 24-hour news network, including the appointment of its head, who will have sole responsibility for editorial strategy and staffing.
It said on Tuesday the Sky News board would now be required to prepare an annual statement confirming it had not come under any influence or attempted influence in the way it creates its editorial output. 
""21CF (Fox) is willing to offer the revised undertakings"" to address the objections raised by the regulator, Fox's lawyers Allen & Overy said in a letter to the Competition and Markets Authority. 

Shares in Sky were broadly flat at 11.05 pounds at 1054 GMT, above Fox's 10.75 pounds a share offer price plus a dividend due to be paid of 13.06 pence.

The Japanese automaker on Tuesday said it had developed a magnet which replaces some of the neodymium, a rare earth metal used in the world's most powerful permanent batteries, with more abundant and cheaper lanthanum and cerium, adding that it aimed to use the magnets in electric vehicle motors within the next 10 years.
As production of hybrid and other electric cars is expected to ramp up in the coming years, automakers and electronics companies have been developing new high-powered magnets which require less rare earth metals to reduce costs and trim exposure to possible fluctuations in supply.
A temporary export ban of neodymium by major supplier China in 2010 during a territorial dispute with Japan and periodic supply shortages have highlighted automakers' dependence on these materials.
""An increase in electric car production will raise the need for motors, which will result in higher demand for neodymium down the line,"" Akira Kato, general project manager at Toyota's advanced R&D and engineering company, told reporters at a briefing in Tokyo.
""If we continue to use neodymium at this pace we'll eventually experience a supply shortage ... so we wanted to come up with technology which would help conserve neodymium stocks.""
At the moment, magnets used in most automobiles to operate motors for everything from hybrid and other electric drivetrains to power steering systems comprise a total of around 30 percent of the rare earth elements neodymium, terbium and dysprosium.
Automakers including Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) have found ways to eliminate dysprosium and terbium, which cost around $400 and $900 per kilogram, respectively, from magnets by increasing the amount of neodymium, which costs around $100 per kilogram.
Toyota has come up with a way to cut out the expensive metals from the magnets and also reduce the amount of neodymium in favor of lanthanum and cerium, which each cost around $5-$7 per kilogram.

Kato declined to give specific details on cost reductions, but said that Toyota could replace up to half of the neodymium used in magnets for motors which operate conventional vehicle functions like power windows with lanthanum and cerium, and around 20 percent for electric motor magnets.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  (L:HSBA) reported a smaller than expected rise in annual profits and unveiled plans to raise up to $7 billion to bolster its capital, as CEO Stuart Gulliver hands over to a new leadership team on Tuesday.
Gulliver is stepping down after more than seven years at the helm of Europe's biggest bank by market value, which has been through a painful restructuring that has cost thousands of jobs. But now, coupled with a more benign market environment, the overhaul is starting to pay off.
""In my own view my performance has been satisfactory,"" Gulliver said of his tenure, citing the bank's steady flow of dividends and the restructuring he pushed through.
HSBC's profit before tax was $17.2 billion for 2017, which compared with $7.1 billion the year before but came in below the $19.7 billion average estimate of 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
HSBC shares fell as much as 4.4 percent in London by 0905 GMT, as investors registered the profit performance and disappointment over the absence of a share buyback.
""Nothing outstanding, more steady as we go,"" Hugh Young, head of Asia at Aberdeen Standard, a top-ten investor told Reuters, describing the results as ""respectable"". 
""The soon-to-be old team has done a good job tidying up and refocusing, whilst still leaving plenty of scope for the new team,"" he added, flagging significant remaining upside for investors as the bank moves toward a targeted 10 percent return on equity.
The analysts' earnings estimates did not all take into account a $1.3 billion writedown for 2017 that HSBC took, triggered by cuts in the U.S. corporate tax rate which meant banks had to book losses on deferred tax assets they built up during loss-making times.
The bank's year-ago profit figure reflected a $3.2 billion impairment of goodwill in the global private banking business in Europe and the impact of its sale of operations in Brazil.
HSBC said it was planning additional tier 1 capital issuance of between $5 billion and $7 billion during the first half of 2018, and that it would undertake share buybacks ""as and when appropriate.""
LOOKING EAST
HSBC veteran John Flint, who is taking over from Gulliver, is charged with steering HSBC back to growth and will likely look to Asia, where HSBC made over 75 percent of its profits in 2017.
The bank plans to push on with a strategy of investing in China's southern Pearl River Delta region.
""We're 2,500 people at the end of last year, we would continue to invest and add headcount ... the opportunity for this organization is very compelling,"" Flint, who has been with the bank since 1989, told Reuters.
Those growth plans should benefit from a more favorable interest rate environment for the bank's deposit-heavy franchise than Gulliver enjoyed.
Rising interest rates helped the bank to increase revenues in its retail division by 9 percent in 2017, particularly from growing deposits and charging higher spreads in its second home market of Hong Kong.
""If you want to play global rising rates, I think HSBC is the best option; you’ve got exposure to Asia, America and the UK,"" said another investor in the bank.
HSBC grew revenues in its investment banking division by a more modest 3 percent, a relatively strong performance given the subdued market environment throughout 2017 that hammered banks' bond trading income in particular.
The bank reported a $218 million increase in bad loan charges in the fourth quarter compared with the previous period, which it blamed on 'two individual corporate exposures in Europe'.
Two prominent HSBC clients during that period have run into trouble, namely, British infrastructure outsourcing company  Carillion  (L:CLLN) and South Africa and Germany-listed retailer Steinhoff International Holdings (J:SHFFp).
Flint said he would update investors with his thoughts on where to take the bank's strategy before it reports half-year results in June.
That could include the results of a review into HSBC's underperforming U.S. business which has long suffered from a lack of scale and the after-effects of the bank's disastrous acquisition of Household International in 2003.
""We are doing a piece of work around the U.S. business at the moment, I don't want to prejudge any conclusions,"" Flint said.

246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Says Stock Slide Was Appetizer for Real Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. stock market only had a taste of the potential damage from higher bond yields earlier this year, with the biggest test yet to come, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
“Appetizer, not the main course,” is how the bank’s strategists led by London-based Andrew Sheets described the correction of late January to early February. Although higher bond yields proved tough for equity investors to digest, the key metric of inflation-adjusted yields didn’t break out of their range for the past five years, they said in a note Monday.
While many have warned that faster inflation could hurt stocks, in theory bigger price gains should be at worst neutral, if they boost earnings along the way. Higher real yields, on the other hand, mean a bigger discount rate to value future earnings. Should they break out of the range over the past five years as investors anticipate greater central bank policy normalization, that could hit stocks harder, according to the Morgan Stanley thinking.
Relatively low real yields were a big support for equity valuations, so a break higher would indicate that stocks will have to rely on earnings -- not multiple expansion -- to drive them higher, Sheets and his colleagues wrote. And the challenge there is that a slowdown may loom starting in the second quarter, they said.
“It’s when growth softens while inflation is still rising that returns suffer most,” the strategists wrote. “Strong global growth and a good first-quarter reporting season provided an important offset. We remain on watch for ‘tricky hand-off’ in the second quarter, as core inflation rises and activity indicators moderate.”
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists have also pointed to real rates as a potential inflection point for markets, though they identified in December the inflation-adjusted cash rate as the one to watch. That measure has a ways to go until their threshold.
(Updates with alternative view on real yields in final paragraph.)

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) has offered to convert debt of around $2.2 billion owed by its ailing South Korean operation into equity in exchange for financial support and tax benefits from Seoul, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The restructuring proposal comes after the Detroit automaker announced last week that it would shut its plant in the city of Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, by May and decide the future of the remaining three plants in the country within weeks.
The debt for equity swap would allow GM's business in South Korea to continue operating. It was not immediately clear how the deal would affect the interest of the state-run Korea Development Bank, which owns 17 percent of GM Korea.
GM's decision was the latest in a series of steps it has made to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015, GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia. 
It was not immediately clear how much fresh capital GM has demanded from the South Korean government to keep operating its Korean business, which employs nearly 16,000 people.
But one of the sources said GM had asked Seoul to provide financial support worth over $1 billion, while several sources said GM wanted its South Korea factory sites designated as special foreign investment zones that would make the company eligible for tax breaks for seven years.
""GM says it will recapitalize its Korean unit, and in return it's asking South Korea to accept its packaged proposal that includes government support worth over $1 billion,"" the person said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. 
A GM Korea spokesman said the company would continue to work with the government and labor union to secure support for its viability plan.
On Tuesday, Barry Engle, head of GM's international operations, met with a task force headed by a ruling party lawmaker from Bupyeong, where GM Korea has its biggest manufacturing plant, to discuss its restructuring plan.
After the meeting, Engle told reporters the company wanted to stay in South Korea.
""It is certainly our preference to stay and to fix the business and continue to be an important part of the Korea economy,"" he said. ""I'm encouraged by the discussions and I am optimistic that that is an outcome that together we can achieve."" He declined to comment further on the discussions between GM and the South Korean government.
A South Korean lawmaker, Kim Sung-tae, said Engle told the lawmakers that the company planned to produce two new models in South Korea.
Engle did not elaborate on whether GM's plan for the two new car models were dependent on government support for the automaker, said Kim, who attended the meeting.
Engle told lawmakers that GM Korea would try to maintain output at the current level of around 500,000 vehicles a year, according to Kang Hoon-sik, a spokesperson for the ruling party. GM's South Korean unit produced 519,385 vehicles last year, compared with 942,805 a decade ago.
Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon told reporters on Tuesday that the government would ""closely consult with GM to normalize its management,"" adding that a due diligence on the company should come first.
South Korea's presidential office also said Tuesday that it would designate Gunsan an employment ""crisis zone"", opening the way for government subsidies like cheap loans and and other financial support for those laid off. 
NO DECISION YET
South Korean government officials said it was too early to decide on any financial backing, as it wanted to conduct due diligence before committing fresh investment in GM Korea.
The tensions also come at a difficult time for U.S.-South Korean relations given U.S. President Donald Trump's determination to renegotiate the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. 
Korea Development Bank believes the auto maker has not shared sufficient information about its finances or the cause of its mounting losses, according to officials from the bank and government officials. 
""They have requested for help and a thorough audit of the situation is among many preconditions before any public funds can be set aside,"" a government official told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, referring to GM.
Another government official said GM had not filed an official application to get its South Korea factory sites designated as foreign investment zones, but it was ""testing waters"" to check the possibility.
South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak.
But the automaker's decision to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe.
GM Korea posted a total of 1.9 trillion won ($1.8 billion) in net losses between 2014 and 2016.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 03:54AM ET</span>",Fashion firms dither over instant shopping on the catwalk,"By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - Fashion labels may be falling over themselves to court young, smartphone-wielding shoppers, but there's one millennial-inspired trend that is only catching on slowly: catwalk shows where clothes are available to buy instantly rather than months later. 
The timing of product drops is becoming an experimental battlefield for luxury goods companies juggling a constant demand for novelty and the lengthy manufacturing cycles needed to make sumptuous fabrics or hand-stitched handbags. 
Britain's Mulberry is the latest label to usher in a ""see now, buy now"" model - cutting out the usual six-month delay in delivering a runway collection to stores - two years after Burberry embraced the idea and set rivals abuzz. 
Yet it is still far from becoming an industry standard even as brands take other steps to modernize, with more frequent collections rather than just two a year, and questions linger over its benefits.
At Mulberry, known for its leather handbags made in southwest England, the strategy should boost sales of full price goods, extending the time they are in store before seasonal clearance periods, said Chief Executive Thierry Andretta.
Its linen suits unveiled during London Fashion Week last Friday are already on sale, while most brands still present spring and summer looks in September and deliver them around March.
""We make luxury that is relevant for a younger generation,"" Andretta said in an interview in the weeks before the show. 
""As soon as they've found something online they want to buy it immediately. If it's not there, in the majority of the cases ... they will not wait for months."" 
But some early adopters of 'see now, buy now', such as U.S.-based designer Tom Ford, found it backfired. 
Ford dropped his one-season dalliance with the concept in 2017, and was quoted in industry media saying that his label lost out on a month of selling while clothes sat in storage before the runway presentation.
""There are people who have been tempted by this model and have turned back on it,"" said Eve Corrigan, whose Paris-based business Malhia Kent makes fabrics for Chanel, LVMH's Louis Vuitton and other labels. 
BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS
One challenge is to keep up the pace of sales after an initial rush when an ""instant"" collection goes live. 
Burberry tweaked the format at its latest show, offering some items such as 350-pound ($490) sneakers in rainbow-colored check for sale immediately, with others to land in the coming months. 
That twist comes as Italy's Moncler, maker of 1,000 euro-plus puffer jackets, ditches the usual fashion calendar altogether in favor of monthly product launches. 
It will unveil designs under the new strategy later on Tuesday ahead of Milan Fashion Week, and aims to start selling the first ones in June.
Much depends on brands' aspirations and business set-up, including whether, like Mulberry, they own the majority of their own shops, meaning they are less reliant on the needs and orders of intermediaries like department stores.
To make the instant shopping format work, fashion houses would have to order textiles well in advance of shows, and get early feedback from commercial buyers so they can avoid the risk of unsold stocks piling up. 
But many argue designers need to be free to make last-minute changes before a show and run with their emotions.
""Our clients would be tempted to make more low-key clothing to ensure it will be sold, which would be detrimental to their creativity,"" Corrigan said.
Top couture houses from France's Christian Dior, part of LVMH, to Italy's Gucci, owned by  Kering  (PA:PRTP), have so far resisted the instant runway-to-shop model. ""The fact we question the way of working is intelligent,"" said Laurent Garigue, a London-based luxury textile producer.
""(But) we have to make sure fashion doesn't become less beautiful by organizing it in a way that makes it easier - it's about blood, sweat and tears.""

253,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 02:33AM ET</span>","NuStar, other energy partnerships simplify business models to spur growth","By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Some publicly-traded U.S. energy pipeline and oil-storage partnerships are restructuring into simpler business models to help attract new investors and spur growth.
Rising oil and gas production has spawned billions of dollars of new transport, gathering and storage projects. But the companies most responsible for these projects can allocate up to 50 percent of their income to the general partner, leaving less for other holders or to invest in new projects.
Historically, these firms have passed most of their income along to holders and sold equity or debt to finance new projects or acquisitions. But in the last year, what they have had to offer investors has jumped. MPLX Energy Logistics LP, for instance, paid a 9.7 percent annualized distribution last quarter to its holders, up from 7.9 percent a year earlier, according to figures from investment firm East Daley Capital Advisors.
""The higher cash yield makes the economics of these projects a little tougher,"" said Kendrick Rhea, an analyst at East Daley Capital. He estimates the cost of equity has risen nearly a third for some companies in the last year.
NuStar Energy (N:NS) and ArchRock (N:AROC) in recent weeks said they would cut income distributions to the general partners and combine units, shifting away from the general and limited partners structures common among energy pipeline and storage firms. Competitor TallGrass Energy (N:TEP) in early February said it was considering a similar change.
""Removing a layer of complexity makes [partnerships] a lot more investible,"" said James Mick, a portfolio manager for Tortoise, which invests in energy master limited partnerships (MLPs). Private equity firms have been successfully acquiring pipeline operators in the shale patch because of their lower cost of capital. They are proving strong rivals to MLPs for these deals because of their willingness to use more debt financing.
Nustar, Archrock and TallGrass did not respond to requests for comment.
An early move away from partnership models came in 2014 when  Kinder Morgan  Inc (N:KMI), then the largest publicly traded pipeline partnership, folded three units into a single company to address investor concerns about its growth and financial structure.
Mick estimates that up to 75 percent of the MLPs Tortoise covers will have eliminated incentive distribution rights within the next two years to free up cash for growth. As of last year, about 51 percent had eliminated their payouts, called Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs), compared with 4 percent in 2007, he said.
Another factor in the restructurings are institutional investors seeking stronger governance and more independent boards. In some cases, about 80 percent of a limited partner's board will be comprised of individuals appointed by the general partner, investors said.
""In the real world, I don't see how directors can be truly independent and represent the best interests of the limited partners if they can be fired by the general partner,"" said Kevin McCarthy, chief executive officer at investment firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors.
Restructuring the partnerships to resemble corporations could draw renewed interest from investors, helping the firms raise new cash.
""Our view is that governance has to change if the sector is going to move to the next level and attract the attention of long-only institutional investors,"" McCarthy added.
Although mature MLPs are revamping their structures, newer firms that go public are expected to continue using mechanisms such as IDRs to encourage growth.  Hess Corp  (N:HES) and BP Plc (N:BP) last year both launched MLPs that included incentive distribution payments to partners.

""It is unlikely they will go away for new issuance and partnership structures moving forward. They are simply too lucrative if executed correctly,"" said Ethan Bellamy, a senior research analyst with R.W. Baird & Co.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Kazakhstan's frozen billions sound alarm for sovereign funds,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - When a Belgian court ordered a bank to freeze $22.6 billion of assets held in trust for a Kazakhstan sovereign wealth fund (SWF), it set a worrying precedent for other SWFs.
The case is one of several brought to courts in Europe by Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati who is attempting to force the Kazakh government to pay up in a dispute about his energy investments in the oil-rich country.
Court rulings imposing asset freezes in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Luxembourg are significant because they address the issue of whether SWFs should be treated as investment arms of governments, or as independent institutional investors.
SWFs, which often invest the proceeds from the sale of national resources or manufactured goods, have traditionally enjoyed the legal immunity reserved for a sovereign to protect their assets in foreign jurisdictions. 
The rulings in the Kazakhstan case made waves because they ignore that immunity. 
""This is a dangerous and worrisome precedent for other funds,"" said Paul Rose, an Ohio State University law professor specializing in SWFs. ""Lots of funds will be looking very carefully at the outcome of this case and wondering whether their assets can be frozen."" 
The Kazakh government has said it will challenge the judgments. 
Whether Kazakhstan succeeds in getting the accounts unfrozen or not, those watching the case reckon it is a landmark for SWFs, whose $7 trillion in global investments range from real estate to equities and government bonds. 
In countries such as Norway, where disputes between investors and the government are more likely to be dealt with through efficient and independent domestic courts, SWFs have little cause to worry, analysts say.
But the Kazakh case should be a concern for countries with a poor track record on investor protection, as it could encourage disgruntled investors to target SWFs' offshore-held assets.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, predicted repercussions from the Kazakh case.
""SWFs represent a significant (share of) global capital and any attacks on SWFs may trigger significant market turbulence,"" he said. 
Orders in Dutch and Belgian courts required Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) to freeze monies it held in custody for the Kazakh National Fund and the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The Dutch court order has since been lifted. The Belgian ruling is still in place but Kazakhstan will challenge it at a court hearing that has been adjourned until April 27.
Kazakh assets in Luxembourg and Sweden are still frozen. 
ALARM BELLS 
SWF assets have been frozen before, but only in exceptional circumstances. For instance, the United Nations imposed a freeze on the Libyan Investment Authority's overseas assets in 2011 as it feared personnel in the deposed government would spirit them away.
The Kazakh asset freezes followed a 2013 decision by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to award Stati and his co-investors some $500 million in an arbitration. The body provides dispute resolution services to international businesses but it is not a court and is up to national courts to enforce its decisions. 
Kazakhstan is refusing to pay and President Nursultan Nazarbayev's government said it has done nothing wrong. It has argued that this ruling was based on fraudulent information, according to a press release from the Kazakh Justice Ministry. 
Stati's petition to a Belgian court to enforce the award resulted in an order requiring BNY Mellon to freeze $22.6 billion in Kazakh National Fund and Republic of Kazakhstan assets. The assets are held in custody by BNY Mellon's European bank, Brussels-based The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV.
BNY Mellon declined to comment. 
Stati also obtained a separate order from a Dutch court to freeze an approximately $5.2 billion stake in KMG Kashagan B.V. owned by Samruk-Kazyna, another Kazakh SWF. KMG Kashagan is a special purpose vehicle through which the country holds a stake in the Kashagan energy project.
There were further orders to freeze assets in Luxembourg and Sweden. 
Stati has also tried to get the award enforced in courts in London and Washington, according to press releases from the Kazakh Justice Ministry. Those decisions would apply to Kazakh assets held in England or the United States. 
Both attempts have run into difficulties.
In a preliminary hearing in June 2017, the English High Court found that the initial arbitration award may have been obtained by fraud. Proceedings are ongoing, with a full trial scheduled to begin in October, the Kazakh Justice Ministry said.
Kazakhstan has also filed a separate claim against Stati in Washington with regard to the alleged fraud. 
IMMUNITY IN QUESTION
Industry participants are watching the court cases closely. 
""If 40 percent of a sovereign fund is frozen and you don't have access to it, that should be an alarm bell for policymakers,"" said Simon Quijano-Evans, a strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. ""It's been assumed so far that these assets were relatively immune.""
SWFs have labored for years to position themselves as little different from any other institutional investor, mostly to allay concerns countries might have about selling assets to foreign governments. 
Some SWFs have even renounced their sovereign immunity in investment contracts, according to Professor Fabio Bassan, an SWF law specialist and International Law Chair at Roma Tre University.
But by depicting themselves as commercial investors rather than as agents of the state, SWFs have allowed their claim to sovereign immunity to be eroded, experts say.
""The more they act like ordinary commercial investors and not as vehicles of the state, it creates a risk that courts will not view them as instruments of the state, and are less likely to give them immunity,"" Ohio University's Rose said.
As in the Kazakh case, courts in different countries have different interpretations of the status of an SWF.
Graham Harris, a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs, noted that English law still makes it difficult to seize sovereign wealth, but continental European courts are increasingly likely to view an SWF as a commercial entity. 

""It's a moving target,"" he said.

The U.S. markets were closed on Monday for a holiday, meaning Asian investors did not have their usual leads as they continued to look for clues on whether Wall Street would continue its recovery.
The Nikkei followed the softer tone in European equities yesterday and closed 1.1% lower as exporters and bank drag on Tokyo stocks. A stronger yen was cited as the catalyst for the selling. The country’s finance minister Taro Aso said today that policymakers needed to do more to achieve their 2% consumer price target. The speech came after the reappointment of Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda was reportedly “certain to be approved in parliament”, and that his aggressive quantitative easing policy would remain in place.
The Japan-listed Sony Corp (T:6758) said it planned to form a joint venture to develop an AI-based taxi-hailing system. The announcement came after several Japanese companies, including  Softbank Corp.  (T:9984), said they were aiming to roll out ride-hailing services amid a global battle to control the technology increasingly central to urban transport.
Meanwhile, the mainland Chinese markets are still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday until Thursday, but reports that the country would restrict companies starting equity investment funds overseas received some attention. Taiwan and Vietnam markets were also closed today.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index came back online today and opened 49 points higher, swung between gains and losses throughout the day and was trading 0.3% lower by 1:30am ET. Chinese banks and developers were the underperformers in the morning trading sessions, while HSBC earnings made headlines as it missed analysts’ estimates and reported a $51.5 billion adjusted revenue and $2.3 billion in adjusted pre-tax profit for the last three months of 2017. The bank’s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 2.03% following the report.
Singapore’s budget was in focus today as finance minister Heng Swee Keat said in a speech that the top marginal Buyer’s Stamp Duty, which would apply to the portion of residential property value in excess of S$1 million, would be boosted to 4% from the current 3%. The highly-expected increase in the Goods and Services Tax would not take effect this year, according to the speech.
Singapore-listed Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG) was also in focus after it issued a new profit warning today, flagging a $5billon loss. The company would post its earnings on 28th February.
Elsewhere, Australia’s RBA received some focus as it said there are “pockets” of financial stress in the household sector, and that it was monitoring the situation.
""The historically high levels of mortgage debt in Australia raises questions about the resilience of household balance sheets to a change in circumstances and the ability of the financial system to absorb a widespread increase in household financial stress,"" said Michele Bullock, the central bank’s assistant governor for the financial system. The RBA also warned that a strengthening Australian dollar could lead to a slower-pick in economic activity and inflation.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi, one of the prime accused in the country's largest ever bank fraud, denies allegations leveled against him by  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK), his lawyer said on Tuesday.
""There is nothing, there is nothing in it,"" Vijay Aggarwal, a lawyer representing Modi, told Reuters, referring to the police complaint filed by PNB that alleges that companies linked to Modi and one of his relatives received credit worth nearly $1.8 billion between 2011 and 2017 using false guarantees supplied by two bank officials. 
Aggarwal, speaking by telephone, declined to comment on where Modi was. Indian officials are on the lookout for Modi and his family, who police say left India in January prior to the case being filed. 
""Everything is documented,"" Aggarwal said of Modi's dealings with PNB, adding that the state-owned bank had regularly levied fees on its dealings with the jeweler's firms.
Asked about his legal strategy, Aggarwal said: ""Until there is no chargesheet, there is no strategy. When there is a chargesheet, there will be a strategy.""
According to a police complaint by PNB, the two officials at a Mumbai branch of the bank steered fraudulent loans to companies linked to Modi and entities tied to jewelry retailer Gitanjali Gems, which is led by Modi's uncle, Mehul Choksi.
""They are covering themselves up,"" Aggarwal said of the complaint. ""They want to avoid liability ... that is why they are cooking up this story.""
Choksi, who has also left the country, has not commented. Gitanjali, in a stock exchange filing, has denied Choksi's involvement in the alleged fraud.
Five bank officials, including the two at the Mumbai branch, have been arrested.
The fraud case has stunned financial markets and it sent PNB shares tumbling for a fifth straight trading day on Tuesday. 
Shares in PNB, which has shed nearly a third of its market value since disclosing the fraud, were down 3.5 percent in early trading after rating agency Fitch placed the bank on negative watch. Later, Moody's also placed the bank's ratings under review for a downgrade.
Separately, in a letter to PNB officials, Modi stated that his companies owe the bank under 50 billion rupees ($775.25 million), much lower than the amount alleged by the bank. He also said PNB has jeopardized its chances of recovering the sums owed by going public with its allegations.
""The erroneously cited liability resulted in a media frenzy which led to immediate search and seizure of operations, and which in turn resulted in Firestar International and Firestar Diamond International effectively ceasing to be going-concerns,"" he wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. ""This thereby jeopardized our ability to discharge the dues of the group to the banks.""

Both companies are controlled by Modi. The fraud allegedly involves at least three firms controlled by Modi and others by Choksi.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","Relax and invest, Saudi prince tells investors after corruption crackdown","By Stephen Kalin, Marwa Rashad and Tom Arnold
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Three months after Saudi Arabia detained scores of people in a crackdown on corruption, its rulers are trying to reassure investors that the kingdom remains open for business.
Foreign and local investors have long complained about corruption, and confronting it is an important part of reforms unveiled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to transform the country and reduce the economy's reliance on oil exports.
Yet some business leaders were unsettled by the swoop on top princes, businessmen and government officials in November because of the secrecy around the crackdown and their suspicions that it was at least partly politically motivated.
""This is not a recommendation for why you should invest in Saudi Arabia,"" said a Western businessman with extensive contacts in the kingdom. ""This whole thing has become one big ball of contradictions.""
Saudi authorities are loathe to say they mishandled the anti-corruption campaign.
But top officials, including Prince Mohammed, met senior local businessmen last month to reassure them that the crackdown was mostly over and that it was safe to do business, according to five Saudi and Western sources who spoke with people who attended the meetings. Most detainees have now been released.
In front of global political and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss town of Davos last month, Saudi officials highlighted the positives of the detentions, dismissing worries about the way the crackdown was conducted but conceding that it might have been sold slightly differently.
""It's true we could make mistakes here and mistakes there. Saudi Arabia is not a perfect country. Saudi Arabia is like any other country. But the ... road to success is always under construction and the whole momentum of Saudi Arabia is going toward that end,"" Minister of Commerce and Investment Majid bin Abdullah al-Qasabi told a Davos session.
Government spokesmen in Riyadh did not respond to requests for comment, but Attorney General Saud al-Mojeb has described the sweep as ""an independent judicial process"" and ""part of an overhaul to ensure transparency, openness and good governance"".
The message delivered in the January meetings underscores a difficult balancing act for Prince Mohammed and his team as they try to reform the country. 
They must deliver change, and one way to do that is by tackling corruption in Saudi Arabia's opaque business world. But the judicial system is underdeveloped and the crackdown contrasted sharply with Western-style due process.
That means each attempt at reform in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom risks exposing other shortcomings.
The government has said that financial settlements made with the detainees in exchange for their freedom have raised more than $100 billion, mostly in the form of land, stakes in businesses and other illiquid assets rather than cash.
That should help raise tens of billions of dollars for huge development plans, such as a $500-billion economic zone in the northwestern desert.
But only a handful of specific allegations against those detained have been revealed. Details of the financial settlements are also being kept secret, and Reuters has been unable to verify the government's gross estimate.
Authorities say that not naming detainees protected people's reputations, and settling cases out of court avoided protracted legal battles that would have distracted from other priorities.
Yet the secrecy of the crackdown -- during which detainees were held inside the same opulent hotel where days earlier investors had rubbed elbows at an international business conference -- could undermine transparency promises.
MEETINGS
The January meetings between Saudi officials and the local business community were in multiple locations including the capital Riyadh and Jeddah, according to the sources, who declined to be named because the conversations were private.
The primary message was that another wave of mass detentions is not on the cards, the sources said, a relief to businessmen who worried that authorities might now take the same approach to the next echelon of the Saudi business world.
""They were told the anti-corruption campaign is done: continue with your business as normal and invest in the economy,"" said one of the sources, a senior banker.
Another message was that the Saudi authorities define corruption relatively narrowly. While they want to improve Saudi business practices, the officials told business leaders, they will not try to change that culture so radically that normal business ties are damaged, the sources said.
That was a relief to many businessmen in a country where personal relationships often help determine transactions between companies, and where gifts of cash or land are sometimes deemed necessary to get things done.
At one of the meetings, officials told attendees that the government understood business payments to third parties were sometimes required, said one of the sources.
Businessmen and economists in contact with the government do not expect a firesale of seized assets to raise money. That should minimise pressure on the Saudi real estate and stock markets, they said.
Instead, cash is likely to trickle slowly into government coffers, and authorities are not expected to interfere hugely in most of the companies in which they have obtained stakes, said an economist briefed on the government's plans. 
The meetings with the crown prince have calmed the nerves of some attendees, the sources said, but others remain worried that they could be detained at any time and that instability has become the new norm.
""The whole business community is traumatized,"" said one of the sources, a Saudi businessman.
The government has demonstrated it is willing to move quickly and ruthlessly to seize the assets of people it believes have acted wrongly.
One banker who spoke to Saudi officials and attendees at one of the meetings said some of those released from detention had been told they may be asked to help fund certain projects. 
""There's an understanding that the government might at some point tap those released on the shoulder and say, 'Hi, we're building an infrastructure project and need some funding: Please contribute',"" the banker said.

260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",Singapore Property Stocks Fall on Higher Home Purchase Tax,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore property stocks declined after the government raised taxes on home purchases of more than S$1 million ($761,600), just as the housing market starts to recover from a four-year slump.
UOL Group Ltd. and City Developments Ltd. fell more than 2 percent in early trading, making them the biggest decliners on the benchmark Straits Times Index. CapitaLand Ltd., the city-state’s largest developer, dropped for the first time in a week.
Stamp duty on the portion of a property’s price above S$1 million will be raised effective immediately, to 4 percent from 3 percent, the government said in its budget Monday. The move comes after home prices rose the past two quarters, ending a four-year decline.
The tax increase isn’t “enough to derail an ongoing home price recovery,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note to clients on Monday, “but this could weigh on sentiment on Singapore developer stocks in the near term.”
Source: Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
“Given the heightened interest in the residential market, the government has timed the increase well as prices and transaction volumes could return with a vengeance after Chinese New Year,” Christine Li, a director of research at Cushman & Wakefield Inc. “The effective increase in the tax revenue is quite minimal, hence this measure acts more as a deterrent to the red-hot property market.”
The move is less about cooling the real-estate market than about making the tax system more progressive, S. Iswaran, minister of trade and industry, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. Existing property curbs have had the desired effect, and if there was any concern about the real-estate market, “we would have seen far more significant measures,” he said.
The increase will have more of an effect on ultra-luxury properties, Li said. The stamp duty on a S$10 million property will increase by about 0.9 percentage point to 3.8 percent, she estimates.
Singapore developers have been aggressively bidding for land as rising apartment sales and prices signaled an end to the downturn. Still, the central bank has warned that rising vacancies and slowing population growth may undermine a residential property recovery.
While a recovery in home prices is not a cause for concern, “exuberance” in the so-called en-bloc market for redevelopments may not be warranted, Ravi Menon, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said at a conference last month.
Collective apartment sales for redevelopment in the first two months of 2018 totaled more than S$3.1 billion, almost double the S$1.66 billion seen in same period during the last en-bloc market peak in 2007, Nomura analyst Min Chow Sai wrote in a note dated Feb. 19.
Li said developers may pull back from these purchases “as the price tag can be hefty for most collective sale deals, which easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Japan’s Topix index dropped after staging its second-best performance this year, while shares in Australia and South Korea also fell, taking their cue from European markets as U.S. equities and Treasuries took a break for the Presidents’ Day holiday. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined. Hong Kong shares bucked the trend, climbing after traders returned to their desks after a holiday.
Investor focus now turns to the U.S. Treasury, which opens its auction floodgates this week, beginning with $151 billion of short-term bills on Tuesday. With little in the way of significant economic data on the schedule, the sales will provide the clearest gauge yet of how steeply bond yields may rise in the world’s largest economy. Traders will also be parsing minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda did not discuss monetary policy during an appearance in parliament. Speculation has been swirling about the possibility the BOJ is scaling back its stimulus since the central bank reduced its purchases of government bonds in January.
Elsewhere, oil climbed above $62 a barrel for the first time in more than a week as an alliance of some of the world’s largest oil producers signaled further cooperation to tighten supplies through the end of the year. Bitcoin broke above $11,000.

Engle, president of GM International, did not elaborate on whether GM's plan for the two new car models were dependent on government support for the automaker, said Kim Sung-tae who attended the meeting.

GM announced last week it will shutter a plant in the city of Gunsan, in South Korea's southwest, by May and decide within weeks on the fate of the remaining three plants in the country.

The Nikkei traded 1.4% lower by 9:20pm ET as exporters and banks drag on Tokyo stocks. A stronger yen was cited as the catalyst for the selling. The country’s finance minister Taro Aso said today that policymakers needed to do more to achieve their 2% consumer price target. The speech came after the reappointment of Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda was reportedly “certain to be approved in parliament”, and that his aggressive quantitative easing policy would remain in place.
Japan-listed Sony Corp (T:6758) received some attention after it said it planned to form a joint venture to develop an AI-based taxi-hailing system. The announcement came after several Japanese companies, including  Softbank Corp.  (T:9984), said they were also aiming to roll out ride-hailing services.
Mainland Chinese markets are still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday until Thursday, but reports that the country would restrict companies starting equity investment funds overseas received some focus. Taiwan and Vietnam markets were also closed today.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index came back online today and opened 49 points higher, but quickly dropped to the red and was trading 1.2% lower by 9:20pm ET. Chinese banks and developers were the underperformers in the morning trading sessions, while HSBC will report its 2017 full year results later today.
Singapore’s budget was in focus today as finance minister Heng Swee Keat said in a speech that the top marginal Buyer’s Stamp Duty, which would apply to the portion of residential property value in excess of S$1 million, would be boosted to 4% from the current 3%. On the other hand, the highly-expected increase in the Goods and Services Tax would not take effect this year, according to the speech.
Singapore-listed Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG) made headlines after it issued a new profit warning today, flagging a $5billon loss. The company would post its earnings on 28th February.
Elsewhere, Australia’s RBA received some focus as it said there are “pockets” of financial stress in the household sector, and that it was monitoring the situation.
""The historically high levels of mortgage debt in Australia raises questions about the resilience of household balance sheets to a change in circumstances and the ability of the financial system to absorb a widespread increase in household financial stress,"" said Michele Bullock, the central bank’s assistant governor for the financial system. The RBA also warned that a strengthening Australian dollar could lead to a slower-pick in economic activity and inflation."
264,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",UK Supreme Court hears key case on gig economy worker,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court was hearing on Tuesday whether a plumber hired on a self-employed basis should have received workers' rights, in a case which could affect the business models of major firms operating in the gig economy.
Taxi app Uber [UBER.UL], car service Addison Lee and takeaway food courier Deliveroo are among those who hire their drivers as self-employed, entitling them only to basic protections such as health and safety.
Workers receive the minimum wage, holiday pay and rest breaks, prompting unions to take legal action to end what they say are exploitative practices in the gig economy, where people tend to work for several firms without fixed contracts.
Uber and other companies have defended their business models saying their drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and on average earn more than the minimum wage, but have lost a series of court cases on the issue. 
Tuesday's case involves Gary Smith who worked for the firm Pimlico Plumbers between 2005 and 2011 and took the company to an employment tribunal after being dismissed.
A tribunal judge said the firm imposed restrictions on the work Smith could do and that he was obliged to perform a certain number of minimum hours on agreed days, meaning he should be considered a worker. 
Pimlico Plumbers has said that Smith's pay was ""extremely good"", allowing him to take care of his own holiday and sickness pay and that he fully understood his employment status. 
The firm unsuccessfully appealed the original decision at the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal, with the case now reaching the Supreme Court.
Britain's top judges will hear the case on Tuesday and Wednesday and are expected to make a decision within three to six months, which would apply to everyone working on a self-employed basis in the same way across thousands of firms, according to a court spokesman.

The government has faced increasing pressure from lawmakers and unions on how to handle modern working practices in recent months and launched a consultation after a review said many people at the biggest firms deserved more rights.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Britain's pensions regulator ignored trustee requests on Carillion: lawmakers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pensions regulator twice ignored requests from trustees of collapsed outsourcing firm  Carillion  (L:CLLN) to force the company to plug its pension deficit, lawmakers said on Tuesday.
The Pensions Regulator has come under fire for taking insufficient steps to protect pension scheme members of troubled companies, following the collapse of department store chain BHS in 2016. 
Carillion collapsed on Jan. 15, with only 29 million pounds ($41 million) of cash left. It had pension liabilities of around 2.5 billion pounds, two parliamentary committees examining Carillion's collapse said.
The Pensions Regulator did not use any formal powers regarding Carillion while the company was solvent even though trustees urged it to do so in 2010 and then again in 2013, the lawmakers said in a statement.
The regulator opened a formal investigation into Carillion on Jan. 18, three days after its collapse.
""With characteristic alacrity, the Pensions Regulator started its arduous process of chasing money down from Carillion a few days after it was formally announced there was no money left,"" said Frank Field, chair of parliament's Work and Pensions Committee.
The Pensions Regulator said in a statement that while it did not use its formal powers before Carillion's collapse, its threat to use them in 2013 had a positive impact.
""Our intervention resulted in a significant increase in the amount of money the company was prepared to pay into the scheme,"" it said. 
""We believed this was reasonable based upon our understanding of the company's trading strength, as set out in its audited accounts.""
Carillion's trustees said in a letter to the regulator in 2010, published by lawmakers, that additional deficit payments offered by the company were ""not acceptable"". In 2013, in another letter, they said the scheme was ""taking a disproportionate amount of risk"".

Carillion's pension scheme is in the process of transferring to the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat for pension funds of failed companies, which will likely mean a loss of benefits for the majority of the 27,500 scheme members.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Corbyn warns bankers: finance will serve Britain under Labour government,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial sector will be ""the servant of industry not the masters of us all"" if the opposition Labour Party gets into power, its leader Jeremy Corbyn will say on Tuesday, accusing bankers of taking the economy hostage.
Corbyn, a socialist who has won over many voters with his promises to renationalize services and increase public spending, has long targeted London's lucrative financial sector, saying politicians have become in thrall of money makers for too long.
In a speech to a manufacturers' conference, Corbyn will renew his pledge to rebalance Britain's economy if he wins power in an election not due until 2022, and will also criticize Prime Minister Theresa May for offering little clarity over Brexit.
""For a generation, instead of finance serving industry, politicians have served finance. We've seen where that ends: the productive economy, our public services and people's lives being held hostage by a small number of too big to fail banks and casino financial institutions,"" he will say.
""No more. The next Labour government will be the first in 40 years to stand up for the real economy. We will take decisive action to make finance the servant of industry not the masters of us all.""
Big business has been cautious toward Labour, with financial services company  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) warning investors that Corbyn winning power was a bigger political risk than Brexit.
But they have also started engaging with the party, and Corbyn's deputy, Labour's finance policy adviser John McDonnell took his message that capitalism was living on borrowed time to the global elite at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year.
Any deep mutual understanding looks far off for now, with Corbyn promising to end the spread of finance's ""extractive logic"" that ""has spread into all areas of life with short-term performance and narrow shareholder value prioritized over long-run growth and broader economic benefit"".
The 68-year-old leader will say if in power, his party would protect companies from hostile bids, citing the takeover bid of aero-engineer GKN (L:GKN) by  Melrose  (L:MRON).
""We rightly praise the growth of companies like GKN and their location in the UK. And yet when we are facing the possible destruction of that company, we are powerless to act,"" he will say.

""That's why the next Labour government will broaden the scope of the 'public interest test', allowing government to intervene to prevent hostile takeovers which destroy our industrial base.""

267,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Nexxus Capital fund to invest $350 million in Mexico, Spain, Portugal","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Private equity fund Nexxus Capital said on Monday it plans to invest $350 million over 12 to 18 months in small- and medium-sized firms with high exposure to middle-class consumers in Mexico, Spain and Portugal.
Nexxus, a Mexico City-based fund that has taken several firms public in recent years, said it will target Mexico for the country's young population coveted by consumer firms, senior managing partner Arturo Saval said.
The fund also sees opportunity in Spain and Portugal due to a dearth of private equity in those countries, he added. 
Saval said a couple of Nexxus companies may seek an initial public offering on the Mexico stock exchange within 18 months.
""Taco Holdings is probably the best candidate to list on the stock exchange first,"" he said.
The company operates fast food restaurant franchises in Mexico, including Carl's Junior, Taco Inn, Sixties Burger, Sbarro and Krispy Kreme.
Nexxus has in recent years taken public construction firm Desarrolladora  Homex  (MX:HOMEX), pharmaceutical company Genomma Lab (MX:LABB), fitness club Sports World (MX:SPORTS), financial group Credito Real (MX:CREAL), hotel Grupo Hotelero Santa Fe (MX:HOTEL) and logistics firm Traxion (MX:TRXIONA).

268,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Over half of Japan firms do not plan base pay rise this year,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - More than half of Japan's companies do not plan to raise base pay in annual wage talks in coming months, a set back for the prime minister and the country's main business lobby which has called for wage rises of 3 percent to fuel an economic revival.
In a monthly Reuters Corporate Survey, just less than half said they would raise pay and most in this group said the increase would be similar to last year's level of about 2 percent.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Keidanren business group have sought a 3 percent wage rise to encourage consumption and inflation, key elements of Abe's bid to vanquish the country of years of deflation.
A rise in fourth-quarter GDP reported last week marked Japan's longest continuous economic expansion since the 1980s but significant wage rises remain elusive even though the labor market is its tightest in about four decades.
In the past four years, major companies agreed to raise wages about 2 percent at annual wage negotiations with labor unions, a benchmark that sets the tone for talks across the country.
The bulk of that - about 1.8 percent - comes automatically under Japan's seniority-based employment system. Anything beyond that is a hike in ""base pay.""
But many firms are wary of raising wages as it commits them to higher fixed personnel costs, so they prefer to pay one-off bonuses instead.
The survey was conducted between Jan 31 and Feb 14 on behalf of Reuters by Nikkei Research. Of some 240 companies that responded, 52 percent said they would not raise base pay.
""It would leave a burden when the business environment turns for the worse,"" wrote a manager at a transport equipment maker in the survey.
The remaining 48 percent said they intended to raise base pay, but 76 percent of this group said the rise would be the same as last year. About 14 percent saw pay rises exceeding last year, while 10 percent said they would undershoot last year's increase.
The firms intending to boost wages cited returning a portion of profits to employees and motivating workers. Some even cited government pressure.
""We have no choice but to raise base pay because of policies by the government and Keidanren,"" wrote a manager of another transport equipment firm.
VIRTUALLY FROZEN
In Japan, base salary accounts for the bulk of monthly wages. Rises in base pay had been virtually frozen since the early 2000s amid persistent deflation.
Several economists have forecast major companies would agree this year to base pay increases of around 0.5-0.6 percent, which with the seniority-based automatic salary rise would bring overall wage growth to around 2.3-2.4 percent.
""Keidanren set an unusually high target of 3 percent for wage hikes and the government has expanded tax incentives for companies raising wages,"" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Securities, which forecast a wage hike of 2.3 percent.
Still, 52 percent of respondents said the 3 percent target was unrealistic and 7 percent said it was ""out of the question."" Some 41 percent said it was realistic.

Asked the same question in the December poll, 31 percent said it was realistic, 61 percent said it was unrealistic while 7 percent called it ""out of question.""

In a note on Monday, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill pointed to tax cuts in the United States and government spending plans as driving earnings growth and said the ratio of earnings upgrades to downgrades for U.S. large-capitalization companies was at its highest since records began in 1988.
Turnill said the ""swoon"" in equity markets in early February made U.S. valuations look more attractive, pushing the company's three-month view on U.S. stocks to ""overweight,"" from neutral. It is BlackRock strategists' first outright positive reading on U.S. stocks since May 2016.
""We believe the coming positive effects of new U.S. tax and spending plans are still underappreciated by markets,"" BlackRock's Turnill said in the note.
""We find earnings growth matters more than valuations over shorter time horizons at this stage of the bull market,"" Turnill said, adding: 
""Economic strength was already changing the tone of earnings momentum, but U.S. tax cuts and government spending plans lit a fire under the trend.""
Turnill noted that while earnings momentum in Europe was robust, it lagged other regions and said the euro's strength is a ""source of pain.""

The S&P 500 (SPX) index is up more than 2 percent this year, while Europe's STOXX 600 (STOXX) is down nearly 3 percent, in terms of price.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Uber suspends service in Morocco after two years,"By Julia Fioretti
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Uber said on Monday it would suspend operations in Morocco, two years after they began, as it tries to bring its business into line with local laws.
Uber has already halted services in Norway and Finland as it waits for the regulatory framework to change in those countries, a sign of the less pugnacious approach the company is taking toward local authorities.
The U.S. ride-hailing company has faced bans, restrictions and protests around the world as it disrupts conventional taxi services. But its new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has struck a more conciliatory tone after a string of controversies that emerged under the former CEO, Travis Kalanick.
""Since we launched in Morocco over two years ago, there has been a lack of clarity about new platforms like Uber and how they fit into the existing transport model,"" Uber said in a statement.
The company has engaged with policymakers to find a solution but ""despite consistent dialogue ... we have yet to see any constructive progress on the regulations and can safely say we have exhausted all measures.""
Uber will halt its services in Casablanca on Friday. It said services would resume as soon as new rules were in place.
Morocco only recognizes conventional taxis and has no provisions for private hire vehicles. 
Uber has had to suspend its service using non-professional drivers in several European cities like Paris and Brussels, but it still operates a licensed service there.
Khosrowshahi, who took over at Uber last year, said in October that ""regulating services like Uber is totally appropriate"".
Uber has 19,000 regular riders in Morocco and 300 drivers, who will be provided with financial support over the next two weeks.

""We are committed to supporting the hundreds of drivers that have benefited from the economic opportunities of using the Uber app. We will be working closely with them through this difficult transition,"" Uber said.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Uber drops opposition to London language test,"LONDON (Reuters) - Taxi app Uber [UBER.UL] is dropping a legal appeal against the introduction of more stringent English language tests for drivers in London after the city's transport regulator said it would water down its stringent proposals.
Uber took legal action in 2016 against Transport for London (TfL) after it said drivers should have to prove their ability to communicate in English, including to a standard of reading and writing which Uber said was too high and could cost it thousands of drivers. 
In March last year it lost that legal battle but had been granted the right to appeal the plans.
TfL said on Monday it would now work to introduce a new test that is more relevant to the role of a private hire driver and would allow applicants to ""demonstrate the appropriate level of English at the same level as the existing test."" 
Uber, which was stripped of its license to operate in London over safety concerns, welcomed the move. 
""We support raising standards and believe that a new test focused on situations drivers may encounter makes a lot more sense,"" said a spokesman. 
""This means we will no longer pursue our legal appeal,"" he added.
Uber said last week it would introduce new safety features, including 24-hour telephone support for riders and drivers, in concessions to TfL. 

The substance of Uber’s appeal against its London license loss is due to be heard over five days from June 25 with a preliminary hearing scheduled to take place before then in April to discuss further administrative matters.

""We have not observed any major movement of funds being transferred, not at all,"" Herbert Scheidt told reporters during a tour of the Gulf.
Saudi Arabia detained dozens of top officials and businessmen last year and vowed to confiscate money and assets held by them, raising fears that authorities would also target Saudi assets parked in offshore centers such as Switzerland.
Scheidt was part of a group accompanying Swiss Vice President and Minister of Finance Ueli Maurer, who visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for talks on cooperation in financial and tax matters.
Scheidt said there had been no discussions with Saudi Arabia during the trip about freezing assets, adding that any such requests would be made to the Swiss prosecutor's office. 
Most Saudi detainees were released last month after settlements secured just over $100 billion from members of the elite, the attorney general has said, without providing details.
The detainees included some of the kingdom's richest people including global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, property mogul Mohammed Aboud al-Amoudi and Waleed al-Ibrahim, founder and chairman of MBC Group, the Middle East's largest private media company.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>",World stocks break recovery streak with U.S. and China closed,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were set to post their first loss in five days on Monday, breaking a winning streak that saw them recover almost half their losses from a violent sell-off two weeks ago.
In a day of relatively quiet trading owing to market holidays in the United States and China, losses in Europe weighed on stocks globally, which had earlier been propped up by gains in Japan.
European markets had opened positive, setting up the MSCI world index for its sixth day of gains but, by afternoon, the pan-European STOXX index had slipped over half a percent. 
A poor update from Reckitt Benckiser hit the consumer staples sector, outweighing gains among financials and strength in steel makers after the U.S. outlined proposals for hefty import curbs.
Shares in Tenaris, Outokumpu and Arcelor Mittal - which have facilities in the United States - were the biggest gainers in Europe, up between 1 and 4 percent.
The MSCI world index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent. The index has recovered nearly half what it lost between late January and last week's low. The 4.3 percent gain it ultimately posted last week was its best weekly performance since December 2011.
INFLATION FEARS 
January's two-week rout, triggered by worries about a rise in U.S. inflation, had wiped more than $6 trillion off the value of global stock markets.
The sell-off took place despite global growth was helping to improve the corporate earnings outlook.
Just before the plunge, world shares were trading at 16.66 times expected earnings, the highest levels since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. They are currently at 15.33 times.
""Investors knew market volatility would be low as the U.S. and Canada celebrate public holidays, and that weighed on enthusiasm in this part of the world,"" said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets. ""Dealers decided to lock in their profits from week.""
Equity investors have drawn some reassurance from a fall in the VIX - a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"".
The index has remained below 20 for three days, last reading at 19.46. It spiked to a 2-1/2-year high of 50.3 two weeks ago, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who had bet equity markets would stay stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation.

The minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting, held amid the equities tumble on Jan. 30-31, are due on Wednesday. Besides the outlook on rates, markets will be keen to see what, if anything, the Fed makes of the gyrations in markets.
DOLLAR EDGES UP
The dollar edged up from three-year lows against a basket of currencies.
The euro stood at $1.2396, backing down from Friday's three-year high of $1.2556.
The dollar traded at 106.53 yen, bouncing back from its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb. 16 [FRX/].
The U.S. currency has been weighed down by various factors, including worries about widening U.S. trade and budget deficits and speculation that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy.
There is also talk that foreign central banks may be re-allocating their reserves out of the dollar.
Commodities, which enjoyed gains as the dollar weakened, were steady as it edged up.
Oil prices hit their highest level in nearly two weeks, lifted by the recovery in stocks and by tensions in the Middle East. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.2 percent to $62.47 per barrel.
Brent crude rose over 1 percent to $65.63 per barrel.

The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa (SEIFSA), an employer federation representing the metal and engineering industry, said it is concerned the implementation of the tariff could decrease local production. 
""The latest developments have the potential of further dampening production in the local steel industry, reducing steel exports to the U.S., squeezing margins and depriving the steel industry of much-needed foreign reserves,"" SEIFSA chief economist Michael Ade said in statement. 
The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas, including a tariff of at least 53 percent on all steel imports from 12 countries, including South Africa.
South Africa imposed a three-year emergency safeguard tariff on imports of certain flat hot-rolled steel products last year to protect the local industry.

295,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Global mining deals jump 15 percent by value in 2017: EY,"LONDON (Reuters) - The value of global mining and metals deals hit a four-year high in 2017, according to accountancy firm EY, as financial distress abated and companies sold off non-core assets.
Mining and metals deals totaled $51 billion last year, up 15 percent from 2016 and dominated by coal and steel transactions, although the volume of transactions fell 6 percent.
""The focus for most of the sector in 2017 was consolidating balance sheet strength and maintaining capital discipline,"" EY said in a quarterly report on the sector, published on Monday.
Coal transactions surged 156 percent to $8.5 billion as the world's move to renewables prompted miners to shift away from thermal coal.
One of the biggest coal deals last year was Rio Tinto's (L:RIO) sale of its Coal and Allied mines to Australia's Yancoal (AX:YAL) for $2.7 billion.
Steel deals doubled to $13.3 billion, mainly comprising large Chinese mergers and divestments in Latin America, while gold transactions fell 34 percent to $7.3 billion.
Money raised by mining companies from stock exchange listings rose to $2.8 billion, the highest in six years but paltry compared to the $17 billion raised in 2011 at the height of the commodities boom. 
For the coming year EY expects deals to be fueled by the industry's return to investment-led strategies aimed at building portfolios rather than divestment-oriented deals that dominated in 2017.
""We expect to see more deals in 2018 as investment-led strategies begin to dominate, but the return of transformational consolidation across the industry is unlikely as capital discipline is maintained,"" said EY global mining and metals transactions leader Lee Downham.
Prices of commodities such as copper, zinc, coal and iron ore surged for a second straight year in 2017 on a combination of dwindling supply and higher demand.
There will be renewed pressure on miners this year to participate in battery technology and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, EY said, while the drive to focus on business in lower risk jurisdictions should influence deals in precious metals.

299,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 10:25AM ET</span>",What correction? $6.3 trillion manager BlackRock just boosted its outlook on US stocks," On the heels of the stock market's first 10% correction in two years, BlackRock has turned positive on US equities.
Enticed by the earnings growth that should result from tax cuts, the $6.3 trillion investment firm raised its outlook on US stocks to overweight from neutral.
By BlackRock's measure, the number of US companies getting upward earnings revisions outpaces those getting downward adjustments by a ratio of more than 2-to-1. That's the highest on record, according to data going back to 1988.
The revision ratio ""confirms that the fundamental momentum is really in place for the US,"" Kate Moore, the chief equity strategist for BlackRock, told Business Insider by phone. ""We've been waiting for greater real data on the impact of tax cuts and fiscal stimulus on potential earnings before we made an assessment on the US. We can't deny that the US — which was already in very good shape — has been super-charged by this stimulus.""
Of course, any investors who found the stock market too expensive before were aided by the sharp selloff seen in major indexes the week before last. As traders sold their stocks amid inflationary concerns and spiking bond yields, the entry point for investors got more appealing.
""The timing is helped by the weakness in the market we saw the week before last,"" said Moore. ""We saw a multiple contraction during that period. But the evolution of our call is all about the earnings story.""
Still, BlackRock notes accelerating inflationary pressure could hurt margins, while increasing real rates may also reduce multiples. But the firm retains a high conviction when it comes to its equity call.
""We see the tax windfall providing an earnings buffer against these forces,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist wrote in a client note."
300,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Amazon got bigger than Microsoft by beating it at its own game,"For the next 20 years, despite Amazon's skyrocketing growth, Microsoft maintained it's lead. But Amazon's web services division, called AWS, was quietly sneaking up. And last week it finally paid off. On Wednesday,  Amazon officially surpassed Microsoft's market value, making it the third-largest publicly-traded company in the United States.
In 2017, AWS brought in $18 billion of revenue for Amazon — 20% less than Microsoft's competing cloud service's $27.4 billion, but has been growing at a much more rapid pace. From 2016 to 2017, AWS revenues grew 42% from $12 billion to $17 billion, while Microsoft's cloud revenue contributions grew just 9%, according to each company's respective balance sheets. 
And when it comes to clients who are actively using cloud services, Amazon's lead becomes even more clear: 
As the chart from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) shows, Amazon's on-ramps — or number of clients tapping into AWS data centers to do business — far outpaces any competitor, and are more than double Microsoft Azure's. 
And while the two companies jockey for position, both in cloud-computing and in the race for market cap, they may be able to grow their businesses together. The size of the cloud will grow significantly, to $342 billion by 2021 according IHS Markit. That's a compound annual growth rate of 22% — something both Amazon and Microsoft would be more than happy to keep up with. Their current revenues combined are just one-sixth of what the market is expected to reach.

Hedge funds and other large speculators turned net short on Nasdaq 100 Index futures for the first time in 21 months, according to weekly data compiled by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through Feb. 13. In fact, they became the most bearish since 2011. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy index gained 5.6 percent in the five days through Friday, the most since October 2014.
Even though technology stocks led the rebound in the S&P 500 Index last week, the piling bets against the Nasdaq 100 may signal there’s room for equities to move higher. While hedge funds may be bracing for pain to come, eventual short covering may add fuel to the rebound following the recent turmoil.
The flip to net short follows a similar bearish outcry expressed in the $61 billion PowerShares QQQ Trust Series last week. The fund saw its biggest five-day outflow since the 2000 dot-com bubble as investors yanked nearly $4 billion in the five days through Feb. 9.

LSE's CurveGlobal derivatives arm is set to launch its three-month SONIA futures contract in the second quarter of this year. SONIA or Sterling Overnight Index Average, is a benchmark administered by the Bank of England.
Regulators around the world aim to wean over $350 trillion of derivatives and other financial contracts away from Libor, after a widespread rate-rigging scandal brought the benchmark into disrepute and left submitting banks facing billions of dollars in regulatory fines.
UK regulators have set a 2021 deadline for moving to SONIA in Britain, with central banks elsewhere in the world taking similar action with other ""risk free"" rates.
Although Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, has been reformed and being administered by a unit of ICE, regulators say it is not being traded enough to be reliable.
A liquid futures contract will help markets meet this transition challenge, said Andy Ross, CurveGlobal's chief executive, said in a statement.
ICE Futures Europe has already launched a one-month futures contract referencing SONIA.
A financial industry official said choosing between ICE or LSE will depend to some extent on where a customer wants to clear and net against other derivatives contracts held in the same clearing house to save on costs.

CurveGlobal said it was offering its contract free of clearing and exchange fees for the remainder of this year.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 09:08AM ET</span>",Russian magnate Deripaska to quit roles at his two biggest firms,"By Polina Devitt and Anastasia Lyrchikova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska plans to step down as the president of the two companies he controls, aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486) and En+ Group (L:ENPLq), two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The change comes less than a month after the inclusion of Deripaska and dozens of Russian billionaires on a U.S. government list of Russian oligarchs. While it is not a sanctions list, Western banks may be reluctant to deal with Russian companies whose owners are on the list.
En+ has invited international banks to pitch for the sale of $1 billion of shares in the company, three sources told Reuters last week. However, the inclusion of Deripaska on the U.S. list is making some U.S. banks who worked with En+ on its initial public offering in November wary about participating this time, one of the sources said.
Deripaska's En+ owns assets in metals and energy, including a 48 percent stake in Rusal, a Hong Kong-listed Russian aluminum producer, which is a big consumer of hydroelectricity produced by En+'s power companies.
Deripaska has decided to relinquish direct operational control in the two companies because En+ became a publicly-listed company after its share sale in November, one of the sources told Reuters. The boards of directors of En+ and Rusal will consider the management changes at their meetings on Feb. 22, the source added.
The upcoming management re-shuffle was first reported by the Russia's Kommersant newspaper on Monday. Maxim Sokov, En+ current chief executive officer, will become En+'s president, Kommersant said.
Vladislav Soloviev, Rusal CEO, will become CEO of En+ and president of Rusal, while Rusal's current chief financial officer, Alexandra Bouriko, will be appointed Rusal CEO, one of Reuters' sources said.
Rusal and En+ declined official comment.
Most metal sector analysts saw the news as neutral for Rusal and En+ given that a succession plan has already been lined up, drawing on existing company managers, which should ensure continuity.
But some analysts questioned the timing of Deripaska stepping down.
Rusal owns a stake in Norilsk Nickel (MM:GMKN), and a power struggle over the nickel producer resurfaced on Friday. Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin has offered to buy the $1.5 billion stake in the mining group held by Roman Abramovich, owner of the Chelsea soccer club. Deripaska tried to block the deal.

""The timing looks a bit strange, coinciding with the resumption of the shareholder conflict at Norilsk Nickel,"" analysts at Aton said in a note.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The  Punjab National Bank  branch in south Mumbai sits just down the road from both the Bombay Stock Exchange and the Reserve Bank of India, at a physical center of one of the world's fastest growing major economies.
The branch, clad in a stately colonial edifice, is now also at the heart of a fraud case linked to billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi that has shaken confidence in a state banking sector that accounts for some 70 percent of India's banking assets.
It was here, according to accounts from Punjab National Bank (NS:PNBK) executives and government investigators, that a lone middle-aged manager, later aided by his young subordinate, engineered fraudulent transactions totaling about $1.8 billion from 2011 to 2017.
The bank says it is still investigating how they were able to do so and go undetected for so long. The accounts given by current and former executives who spoke to Reuters suggest an answer as simple as it is alarming: no one was paying attention.
The still unraveling story of how the fraud happened - which includes the alleged misuse of the SWIFT interbank messaging system and incomplete ledger entries - points to a breakdown in checks and balances, and standard banking practices, they said.
The apparent failure of anyone to notice the largest fraud in Indian banking history until this January reveals a ""rot"" in the state financial sector that goes beyond one lender, said Santosh Trivedi, who spent nearly four decades at Punjab National Bank before retiring in 2016 as a senior manager of audit and inspection in the New Delhi head office.
""Unless this rot is controlled at this stage, to the satisfaction of the international community, it is dangerous for the Indian system,"" Trivedi said.
JEWELER TO THE STARS
Last month, Punjab National Bank, known as PNB, filed an initial criminal complaint with the country's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) accusing celebrity jeweler Nirav Modi and others of defrauding the bank and causing it a loss of 2.8 billion Indian rupees (more than $43 million).
The allegations against a man whose diamond creations have draped Hollywood stars such as Kate Winslet and Dakota Johnson generated a flurry of coverage across India's TV screens and newspapers. Modi has not publicly commented on the case. He and his family left the country in early January, according to Indian officials, and a call on Sunday to a corporate spokesperson who has handled media for Modi in the past went unanswered. No charges have been filed against him.
But as more details surfaced about what is alleged to have happened at the state-run bank, which was founded in 1894, the stakes have gotten higher. 
A review of bank and government documents related to the case - and interviews with current and former PNB executives, bank auditors and experts - points to a lack of accountability and standards in the country's public banking system.
As of last September, those banks held about 87 percent of the Indian banking system's 9.46 trillion rupees (about $147 billion) of soured loans that are non-performing, restructured or rolled over.
A preliminary investigation by the nation's tax authority said of the PNB fraud that ""the hit Indian banks would take in the end may well exceed"" $3 billion, according to an internal note seen by Reuters.
""Yes, there is a problem. We have recognized it,"" bank Chief Executive Officer Sunil Mehta said during an investor call on Friday. ""We are in the process of fixing it up. We'll see wherever the loopholes are there. The people-related risk, we are going to mitigate.""
But despite that promise of action, one current senior executive at the bank's headquarters in New Delhi said further problems could not be ruled out.
""In Indian banks, we don't work under ideal situation,"" the executive, who declined to be identified, said during an interview at his office. ""We are in the business of risk, you can't say there won't be road accidents.""
FRAUDULENT GUARANTEES
According to court documents filed on Saturday by the CBI, branch deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty issued a series of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking – essentially guarantees sent to other banks so that they would provide loans to a customer, in this case a group of Indian jewelry companies.
These letters were sent to overseas branches of banks, thought to be almost all Indian, that would then lend money to the jewelry firms.
Shetty did so using the bank's SWIFT system to log in with passwords that allowed him, and in at least some instances a more junior official, to serve as both the person who sent messages and as the person who reviewed them for approval, according to court documents and interviews with bank executives.
""The involvement and connivance of more staff members and outsiders at this stage cannot be ruled out,"" said a CBI document submitted to the court in Mumbai.
Shetty is now in custody and he has not publicly responded to the allegations. Calls to a cell phone listed for his wife on court documents were not answered. 
Asked about the password sharing, the senior Punjab National Bank executive said it was not best practice but in the everyday bustle of Indian banks it happens.
""When you are flooded with customers in the morning, with 101 demands, you look for shortcuts,"" he said. ""You do somebody else's work, somebody else does your work. You are not working in an ideal situation.""
A second senior executive at the bank's headquarters, who also asked that his name not be used, echoed that sentiment.
After entering the transactions on SWIFT, the CBI documents said, Shetty – who worked at the same branch from 2010 to 2017 despite normal bank practices of regular rotations - did not record them on the bank's internal system.
Because PNB's internal software system was not linked with SWIFT, employees were expected to manually log SWIFT activity. If that was not done, the transactions did not show up on the bank's books.
A SWIFT spokeswoman said in a statement last week that the company does not comment on individual customers.
All together, there were at least 150 such fraudulent Letters of Undertaking during a seven-year period, according to a CBI official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In addition to detaining Shetty and the junior employee, the CBI has arrested a man who it described in court documents as both being ""aware about the modus operandi of the entire scams"" and serving as a director in ""15 to 16 companies of Nirav Modi Group"".
An older brother of the man, Hemant Bhatt, said outside a courtroom on Saturday that he was innocent and the allegations were the result of a ""media trial"". The brother did not give his name.
An uncle of the junior bank employee, Manoj Kharat, told a Reuters reporter outside the court that his nephew was ""just following orders of superiors"" and added ""he wasn't aware of what he is doing"".
All three are to be held in custody until March 3. No charges have so far been laid against them.
Police searched the bank's south Mumbai branch on Sunday and have also questioned five more Punjab National officials, the CBI official said, taking the total number bank staff who have been questioned so far to 11.
FINANCIAL HIT
A Feb. 12 note seen by Reuters, sent from PNB to other banks and marked ""confidential"", said: ""None of the transactions were routed through the CBS system"" - the bank's internal network – ""thus avoiding early detection of fraudulent activity.""
The Reserve Bank of India did not respond to a request for comment about whether it had earlier detected any anomalies in Punjab National Bank's operations or whether it would take additional action in auditing banks.
In a statement late on Friday the central bank called the fraud at PNB ""a case of operational risk arising on account of delinquent behavior by one or more employees of the bank and failure of internal controls"". It also said the central bank ""has already undertaken a supervisory assessment of control systems in PNB and will take appropriate supervisory action"".
The CBI paperwork says the fraudulent Letters of Undertaking are likely to add up to ""the vicinity of"" 60 billion rupees, or more than $930 million. Bank executives say the amount tallied by working back through internal records is $1.77 billion.
With assets of about $120 billion as of December, according to bank filings, PNB will be able to cover any associated losses, though it is still a huge hit for a bank whose stock market value was only $6.1 billion before it revealed details of the alleged fraud last week. It has since seen $1.4 billion wiped off that market capitalization. 
The mechanics of how the fraud happened, and what it says about the underlying industry culture, are worrying, said Abizer Diwanji, national leader for financial services in India at accounting firm Ernst & Young.
""Checks and balances are there in public banks as well but they are not followed earnestly,"" said Diwanji, who has tracked India's financial services industry for more than two decades.
""This is where the discipline, the culture is not there. I always believe that we don't have the culture to manage risks, even operational risks. PNB is not an outlier in this.""
To control such risks, most private sector banks require branches to route SWIFT messages through their central offices, Diwanji said. They also usually integrate their own software systems and SWIFT, meaning that activity such as a Letter of Undertaking being sent would get automatically recorded.
Neither is the case at PNB or most state-run banks in India, Diwanji said.
Representatives of two of the external audit firms listed on PNB's annual report for the 2016-17 fiscal year said they could not have known what happened.
""It was off-books, so auditors will not be in a position to detect it,"" said Sudesh Punhani, a partner at Chhajed & Doshi.
Asked whether the bank's failure to integrate its software system and SWIFT was a cause of concern, Neeraj Golas, a partner at R. Devendra Kumar & Associates, also an external auditor of the bank, said: ""True, true - we have to really get into it and understand what all these things are.""

315,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Catalan corporate property market cools on political uncertainty,"By Sonya Dowsett
MADRID (Reuters) - Global pension funds, insurers and other investors are holding back on buying office space in Catalonia due to fears a split from Spain could lead to an exodus of business from the region.
Corporate property in the wealthy northeast and its capital Barcelona has been a hot ticket but interest has cooled since October's disputed independence referendum and pro-independence parties' bid to reinstate sacked leader Carles Puigdemont.
Investment in office space in Catalonia from October to December dropped by 63 percent from the previous quarter and 84 percent on the year-ago period to 71.5 million euros ($88.4 million), according to data provided by Los Angeles-based real estate services and investment adviser CBRE.(For a graphic on the Spanish office market rentals click http://tmsnrt.rs/2o1XQ5I) 
The concern is that if Catalonia splits from Spain, it would drop out of the European Union, forcing companies to move from the region to avoid being subject to tariffs.
""We speak regularly to our investors and they have told us they don't want to touch Barcelona office investments for now,"" said Carsten Czarnetzki, country head for Spain at AEW Europe which has 26.6 billion euros of assets under management in Europe of which 430 million euros are in Spain.
The figures, along with a drop in tourist numbers, are a sign the political standoff is already having an economic fallout as funds wait to if companies which have already moved their registered headquarters follow up by shifting employees.
Some investors are using the uncertainty to win discounts.
Meridia Capital, a Barcelona-based fund investing in Spanish real estate on behalf of global pension funds, insurers and sovereign funds, got five percent off the price of Barcelona shopping center Barnasud, bought for 21 million euros in November, said Javier Faus, founder and chief executive officer.
""I said: 'Give me a small discount to reflect the Catalan situation',"" said Faus, whose firm has invested 800 million euros in real estate over the last four years, mostly in office space split more or less equally between Madrid and Barcelona.
Meridia has 400 million euros of assets under management in Barcelona and Faus said high demand and a scarcity of buildings had made discounts harder to get earlier in the year.
IMPORTANT FOR SPAIN
Real estate accounted for 11 percent of foreign investment in Spain in the first nine months of 2017, making it the second-biggest sector to receive funds from abroad after energy, according to economy ministry figures.
Spain is still an attractive destination for those seeking to invest in commercial real estate. The government expects the economy to grow by around 3 percent this year, making it one of the fastest-growing in Europe.
However, the weighting of Catalonia in investment in Spanish office space roughly halved in the fourth quarter compared to the three previous quarters to 18 percent, the CBRE data showed. 
Catalonia's capital Barcelona is a thriving Mediterranean city that has drawn many corporate tenants in the technology and media businesses in recent years from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to online game maker King, creator of Candy Crush.
The region is a manufacturing and industrial hub, accounting for one fifth of the Spanish economy and a quarter of exports, and it was named top European large region of 2018/19 for its strategy in attracting foreign investment by FDI Intelligence, a Financial Times unit.
""It's true that many have put investment on hold. On the bright side, no-one has told me to get out of Catalonia for the next ten years,"" said Faus of Meridia Capital.
The Catalan rental market, which has seen prime office rents rise by nearly a third since Spain emerged from recession in 2013, has so far held up, said Ines Arellano, director of investor relations at Merlin Properties (MC:MRL), which has around 250,000 square meters of office space under management in Catalonia.
There were fewer deals in the office rental market in the fourth quarter, but rents and occupancy rates continued to rise, she said, adding that the rental market took longer to react to external factors than investors.
Rents averaged 23.5 euros per square meter for prime office space in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 31 euros in Madrid, according to CBRE. Average yield was 4.25 percent. 
That compared to 17.75 euros per square meter in the fourth quarter of 2013, the year that Spain emerged from recession.
AMAZON MOVES IN
More than three thousand companies moved their registered headquarters out of the region from October to December after a chaotic referendum led to a declaration of independence and the sacking of the regional administration. 
Madrid attempted to derail the independence movement by calling elections. But pro-independence parties won the December election and it is unclear whether the new administration - yet to be formed - will continue to push for secession.
Previous leader Carles Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Brussels and faces arrest on charges of sedition and rebellion if he comes back to Spain. Pro-independence parties are trying to put him back in power.
Companies continue to move their registered headquarters from the region, with the Spanish units of RayBan sunglasses maker Luxottica and chewing gum company Wrigley both shifting to Madrid earlier this month, according to company register data.
But there has not been a flow of office jobs out of the city, however, and business areas like new development 22@ in the north of the city continue to draw big name tenants.
Office blocks under construction in 22@ - a trendy area aimed at technology and media companies - have been pre-rented to Amazon.com Inc, U.S. shared office space company WeWork and Norwegian media company Schibsted.
Amazon closed the deal to rent 11,000 square meters in June 2017, according to the building's then owner, Grupo Castellvi. Amazon declined to comment on the details beyond saying the office would house a research and development center for machine learning and a seller support hub for southern Europe.
Schibsted announced the move to the new Barcelona building in January. They hope to move in during the first quarter of 2019, a company spokesman said.
Investors are resigned to continuing uncertainty.
""We don't know what effect the political situation will have on demand,"" said Czarnetzki of AEW. ""We don't think this situation is going to be resolved quickly. It's a new reality that we'll have to live with.""

316,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Indonesia expects to have more than 5 unicorns by 2019: minister,"By Ed Davies and Cindy Silviana
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is likely to have more than five startups worth at least $1 billion each by 2019, with healthcare and education the most promising sectors to spawn new unicorns in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, the communications minister told Reuters. 
Driven by a youthful population of more than 250 million people owning at least 100 million smartphones, Indonesia has seen a rapid growth in the number of startups trying to capitalize on this potential in a growing economy.
The country currently has four unicorns - companies that have reached $1 billion in valuation without tapping the stock markets - including ride-hailing company Go-Jek, travel site Traveloka, and market places Bukalapak and Tokopedia. 
""In ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) we have seven unicorns and, out of seven, four are coming from Indonesia,"" said Minister of Communication and Information Rudiantara, noting that even one of the unicorns in the region outside Indonesia derived most of its revenue from the country.
""I believe that we'll have more than five unicorns until 2019,"" Rudiantara, who uses one name, said in an interview. 
Investors in Go-Jek include Tencent Holdings (HK:0700), with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google joining the latest fundraising. Tokopedia has backing from  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and SoftBank Group (T:9984), while Traveloka's backers include  Expedia  (O:EXPE) and JD.com (O:JD). Bukalapak investors include Singapore's GREE Ventures.
The minister said that a unicorn was likely to come from the education sector. 
""If we see the numbers, I project that has to come from the education (sector),"" he said.
Under Indonesia's constitution, the government has to spend a fifth of its annual budget on education, so even excluding private spending an app or startup only needed to get a small percentage of this ""huge"" potential, he said.
Indonesia's state budget for education was 400 trillion rupiah ($29.50 billion) in 2017.
The minister said the biggest local app for education currently was Ruanguru. 
The other most promising sector to develop a unicorn is healthcare, which has a state budget of more than 100 trillion rupiah, he said.
He noted the development of startups like HaloDoc offering online medical consultation, while others include Alodokter.
On funding, the minister said that he wanted to help make it easier for unicorns to apply for initial public offerings in Indonesia. Local regulations prevent listings before companies have made a profit for a number of years.
""If necessary, I will go to the OJK (financial regulator) to solve this issue,"" he said, adding the government should no longer be just a regulator.
""It's an old model. The government has to be the facilitator,"" said Rudiantara.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares dipped in choppy trade on Monday as a poor update from  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) hit consumer staples, outweighing gains among financials and strength in steel makers after the U.S. outlined proposals for hefty import curbs. 
Shares in  Tenaris  (MI:TENR), Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) and Arcelor Mittal (AS:MT) - which have facilities in the United States - were the biggest gainers in Europe, up between 1.7 and 3.1 percent.
Their gains and strength in financial stocks helped STOXX 600 (STOXX) post small gains at the open but the pan-European benchmark index was later dragged lower by a fall in consumer staple stocks. The index was down 0.1 percent by 0930 GMT.
Monday's slight decline took place after the STOXX posted a 3.3 percent gain last week when strength of corporate updates and a return of inflows into equity funds helped global equities rebound from a turbulent start of the month. 
The index needs to rise another six percent to climb back to the 2-1/2 year peak hit at the end of January. 
Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB) missed profit expectations and its profit margins declined, hurt by a tougher pricing environment in developed markets and increased commodity costs. It said these issues would continue in the near term. [nL8N1Q910Z]
Reckitt Benckiser (L:RB), the maker of Durex condoms, Lysol disinfectant and Mucinex cold medicine, fell 5.4 percent. Shares in  Unilever  (L:ULVR),  Diageo  (L:DGE), Nestle (S:NESN) and  Danone  (PA:DANO) also declined.
Analyst at Investec affirmed their sell rating on Reckitt following the update, saying operating margin missed expectations and sales growth fell a little short of the more optimistic hopes given the strong flu performance from peers.
The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended that President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas. [nL2N1Q60V8] 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said the European Commission could respond with measures to limit steel imports to the European Union, and that ArcelorMittal and SSAB (ST:SSABa) would benefit the most from rising U.S. spreads. SSAB rose 2.5 percent. 
Banks (SX7P) were among the leading gainers, up 0.4 percent. The sector was supported by a 1.6 percent gain in shares of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) after analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch upgraded the German lender to neutral on optimism over investment banking trading revenues. [nL8N1Q911U] 
German industrial giant  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) rose one percent after announcing plans to list its healthcare division in the first half of the year. 

Mercedes maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) was a weak spot, down 1.7 percent, after reports said U.S. investigators probing Daimler had found that its cars were equipped with software which may have help them to pass diesel emissions tests. [nL8N1Q8080]

318,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 04:04AM ET</span>","South Korea's Moon bemoans GM plant closure move, calls on government to help workers","By Christine Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Monday General Motors Co's (GM) (N:GM) decision to shut down a factory south of Seoul will hurt that region, and called upon his administration to take measures to boost economic activity there.
GM announced last week it will shutter the plant in the city of Gunsan, in South Korea's southwest, by May and decide within weeks on the fate of the remaining three plants in the country.
Gunsan employs 2,000 out of GM's 16,000-strong workforce in the Asian nation, with local authorities saying one out of five people in the city were dependent on GM for their livelihood.
""Especially, the decline in employment (at GM) and subcontractors will be difficult to bear for Gunsan City and North Jeolla province,"" Moon told his aides at a regular meeting, according to a statement released by his office.
Addressing the issue publicly for the first time, Moon asked his administration to look ""aggressively"" into any possible mitigation measures like designating Gunsan as an ""employment crisis area"" and called for urgent measures to aid workers affected by pending layoffs.
Since taking office last May, Moon has pushed hard on job creation, especially those for young South Koreans, and the closure of the GM plant is viewed as a setback for his plans regarding boosting employment in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
Workers at the Gunsan GM plant have called the shutdown a ""death sentence"" and threatened a strike.
The factory had been running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years even before the U.S. car maker announced the shutdown, the latest of steps taken by GM to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. 
A GM Korea spokesman said on Monday the company was committed to supporting the affected workers. The U.S. automaker launched a voluntary redundancy program last week for all its workers in the nation.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has recently approved import tariffs on washing machines, took the shutdown announcement last week as an opportunity to launch fresh criticism of the free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea.
Trump has been critical of the deal ever since his bid for presidential office and the two countries are in renegotiation.
Moon on Monday also asked his government to act sternly in trade talks with the United States, expressing worry over curbs on imports from other countries recently imposed by Washington.
""Due to the expansion of U.S. import curbs on our export products like steel, electronics, solar panels and washing machines, I worry about our exports as a whole despite our international competitiveness,"" said Moon in the same meeting. 

""I ask the government to act firmly and sternly to unreasonable protectionist measures, such as by lodging complaints to the World Trade Organisation and checking for violations of the U.S.-South Korea free-trade agreement.""

320,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 01:58AM ET</span>","Nippon Steel worries about U.S. trade action, yen's surge","By Yuka Obayashi and Kentaro Hamada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401), Japan's biggest steelmaker, is worried that potential U.S. trade action to cut steel imports could flood Asia with products and that the yen's recent surge may hurt customers such as carmakers.
U.S. President Donald Trump said early last week he was considering a range of options - including tariffs and quotas - to address steel and aluminum imports he said were unfairly hurting U.S. producers. 
In the latest step, the U.S. Commerce Department on Friday recommended that Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries, ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas. 
""If any measure comes, it will loosen steel markets, sending supplies back to Asia as there is nowhere else for them to go,"" Toshiharu Sakae, Nippon Steel's executive vice president, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. 
""That would be negative for us,"" he said. 
Nippon Steel's rival JFE Holdings Inc (T:5411) voiced similar fears about possible U.S. trade actions last week. 
""Any U.S. action may trigger retaliation by other countries. What is most troublesome is to see the world heading toward protectionism,"" JFE President Eiji Hayashida said. 
Sakae said Japan's steel industry will ask Tokyo to let Washington know that ""we oppose such steps as we support free trade.""
Yasuji Komiyama, director of the metal industries division of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, on Monday declined to comment on the U.S. Commerce Department's proposal, saying a U.S. final decision has not been reached. 
""As we have repeatedly said before, Japan believes any steel and aluminum imports by the U.S. from Japan do not pose any threat to the U.S. national security,"" he said. 
YEN SURGE A FRESH RISK
Japanese steelmakers are enjoying the best market conditions in at least three years. Steel prices have risen on increased production by automakers, while construction is in full swing for Tokyo's 2020 Olympics. 
Nippon Steel early this month reported a 108 percent jump in April-December recurring profit, led by healthy demand and higher prices for steel products. 
But the yen's surge poses a fresh risk, Sakae said. 
The yen  rose to a 15-month high against the U.S. dollar last week amid concerns that the United States might pursue a weak dollar strategy and that Trump's tax cuts and fiscal spending may stoke inflation and erode greenback value. 
Direct impact from the stronger yen on Nippon Steel's earnings will be limited as damage on its exports could be offset by lower import costs for raw materials, Sakae said. 
""But we can't ignore it because our main customers are exporters such as automakers and construction machinery makers,"" he said. 
""The strong yen would hurt their exports, sales and profits, which would also make them tougher negotiators on steel prices."" 

Nippon Steel and its peers have been trying to raise product prices to cope with higher raw materials costs such as for coking coal, iron ore, zinc and manganese.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Carnival Corp (N:CCL), the world's largest cruise operator, said on Monday it was investigating the response of its security personnel to a brawl that broke out on one of its South Pacific cruises that resulted in 23 passengers being removed.
The American-British company said in a statement that it was investigating ""all aspects including the security response"" of the incident, which was captured on video and posted on social media.
The 10-day cruise to the South Pacific returned to the Australian southern city of Melbourne on Saturday, a day after 23 people were removed in the New South Wales (NSW) town of Eden for what the company described as ""disruptive and violent acts"".
""The level of excessive behavior experienced on the cruise was unprecedented,"" the Carnival statement said, referring to the passengers who were removed from the cruise. ""We have apologized to guests who were directly affected by it,"" it said. The statement did not say when the investigation will be concluded.
Carnival has offered passengers a 25 percent ""cruise credit"" on future trips.
A NSW police spokeswoman told Reuters on Monday that inquiries were continuing with no charges laid yet.
The video on social media shows passengers brawling with each other and with security officers. A Carnival spokesman said the company could not confirm the veracity of the video.
Several passengers who got off the cruise in Melbourne, including Michael Haddara and Jacob Summers, told local media on Saturday that the security staff made matters worse.
Companies and their brands can suffer reputational damage from the actions of their employees. Last April, United Airlines reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum with a passenger who was dragged from a Chicago flight.
Videos of the passenger, Dr. David Dao, being dragged down the aisle of a United jet and the company's handling of the incident touched off a public outcry and even prompted calls from congressmen for new industry regulation.

323,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 07:41PM ET</span>",Lego builds foundations in China classrooms as old markets slow,"By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Danish toymaker Lego is hoping to build a following with Chinese parents by promoting its place in the classroom as well as the toy box.
The firm, famous for its brightly colored building blocks, is working with local education departments, state schools and the private education providers to get kids playing with Lego as a way to boost motor skills, creativity and attention spans.
The educational push in China goes beyond what Lego does in other markets, in part a nod to the country's disciplined focus on learning but also a reflection of how the market is booming in importance as growth in the United States and Europe slows.
It also taps into the desires of Chinese parents to give their children a competitive edge - even at a young age.
Deng Xianyu, 48, has been buying her 8-year-old son Lego blocks since he was 2 and now sends him to Lego classes every weekend. She said she likes that the students learn specific skills such as computing and science as they play.
""If it was just putting blocks together, I don't think that would be totally necessary,"" said Deng Xianyu, 48. ""But I think it is great that they do coding (as part of the) classes.""
The focus on learning, in a market notorious for its rigid exam-oriented education system and piles of homework, could help Lego in China as business elsewhere softens.
In September, Lego said it would lay off 8 percent of its staff and revamp its business after reporting its first sales decline in more than a decade, with weakness especially in the United States and Europe.
Its most recent revenue figures, for the first half of 2017, showed a decline of 5 percent to 14.9 billion Danish krone ($2.5 billion at the current exchange rate) compared with the same period in 2016.
China's toy market was estimated at about $9.6 billion last year, growing close to 10 percent against 2016, according to the China Toy and Juvenile Products Association. And the preschool segment of its for-profit education market alone is expected to reach 540 billion yuan ($85.20 billion) by 2020.
In China, Lego competes with the likes of  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT),  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) and local market leader Alpha Group (SZ:002292). It opened a local plant in 2016 and last month signed a deal with tech giant Tencent (HK:0700) to develop games.
Education with a streak of fun is also an attractive goal for local education bodies and schools as they look to broaden their curriculums.
""We see that there's a lot of interest in terms of in the government and interest in educational communities to develop children's creativity, to develop some of the soft skills like global collaboration, problem solving, communication,"" Lego's chief marketing officer, Julia Goldin, told Reuters in Beijing. ""These are, of course, all the skills that they develop through Lego.""
TIME TO PLAY?
The building blocks are especially attractive to younger parents in major cities, who are more receptive to the Western idea of ""free play"" - especially if it comes with an educational sheen.
Kevin Xing, a translator in Beijing, spends 10,000 yuan per year sending his six-year-old son to classes at a Lego training center. In 2016, the two traveled to Shanghai for a Lego-building competition.
""Practically speaking, it's not like piano, taekwondo or English classes - you don't see an immediately tangible impact with Lego right away,"" said Xing, adding that he was motivated more by his son's enjoyment and long-term development. 
""So I keep paying for (the classes) anyway,"" he said.
Lego, via its education arm – which it says is kept separate from its commercial toy business – and major shareholder Lego Foundation work with academic centers such as Beijing's Tsinghua University and other education bodies.
China's Ministry of Education and Lego also collaborated on an ""innovative talents training program,"" in which more than 10,000 grade school teachers take part annually. 
""We are engaging with the government,"" Jacob Kragh, general manager of Lego in China, told Reuters in an interview in Beijing, adding this was mostly related to ""curriculum development and teacher training.""
The education business aims to ""generate a new and more progressive way of teaching science, technology, engineering, and math"" - highly prized subjects in China often studied by the country's political and business elite.
That could be of interest to parents who are worried about their children falling behind in a highly competitive school system.
""Kids still live in a very rigid system where they are sleep deprived and don't have much time to play,"" said Yang Dongping, dean of Beijing-based 21st Century Education Research Institute.
Tu Qiaoliu, a primary school teacher in the port city of Ningbo, said her school had created a Lego project with one giant wall and smaller ones for each class.
""We chose Lego because teachers believe the toys can help kids grow and develop,"" she said.
Lego China head Kragh said the education business did not actively try to sell Legos to consumers. But parents said there was a clearly pressure to buy if their kids enjoyed the classes.
A box of Lego classic blocks with 790 pieces costs 499 yuan ($78.82) at Lego's official China online store on Alibaba's (N:BABA) Tmall, versus $59.99 at its U.S. online store.
""Though kids can play Lego in class, my son still asks me to buy him Lego when he gets back home,"" said Xing, the parent. ""It is quite costly.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) sees a pickup in overseas lending after a slowdown last year in the United States, where a recently enacted corporate tax cut is widely expected to spur mergers and acquisitions (M&As).
Major Japanese banks are placing increased emphasis on lending abroad, particularly in busy M&A markets such as the U.S., as they seek more means of growth while their domestic lending businesses suffer persistently low interest rates. 
""We expect companies that become cash-rich from the tax cut to accelerate acquisitions,"" said Akira Sugano, head of overseas business at Japan's third-biggest bank by market value. ""There are actually companies planning such moves among our clients.""
Mizuho is already working with U.S. clients to provide finance for billion-dollar deals, Sugano said.
Mizuho has made acquisition finance for blue-chip firms one of the core businesses of its overseas operations. It plans to provide bridge loans - or short-term funds - to firms needing to arrange large finance quickly and secretly, after which it aims to win business when clients switch to more permanent funding such as through sales of bonds and shares.
But a slowdown in U.S. deals led to weak growth in overseas lending last year. Sugano attributed the slowdown to big firms delaying M&As until there was certainty regarding the corporate income tax rate, which was cut to 21 percent from 35 percent.
""The tax cut would change companies' cash flows, which would have an impact on the value of acquisition targets, making both buyers and sellers wait,"" he said. ""We are seeing recovery in M&A activity since the cut became certain in late December."" 
Mizuho's outstanding overseas loans grew just 1.3 percent to $204 billion in April-September, compared with 9.3 percent and 14 percent in the corresponding periods of the previous two years.
Overseas net interest income - or profit from lending - was 83.5 billion yen ($784.55 million) in the period, compared with domestic net interest income of 252.3 billion yen.
On Mizuho's own M&A strategy, Sugano said his bank might take a different approach to Japanese peers when expanding in Asia's emerging economies.
Bigger lenders Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (T:8316) have bought into Indonesian banks and are seeking to turn their interests into majority stakes.
""We've also been following opportunities in the past five, six years but haven't done any deals. Why? Because they are expensive,"" Sugano said.
""We've been thinking about the acquisition of a local bank, but now think there could be another means of market entry,"" he said. ""One idea is to team up with a local big business and provide (financial services) using digital technology.""

325,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",German carmakers in a spin ahead of diesel ban ruling,"By Edward Taylor and Markus Wacket
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - A court will decide on Thursday whether German cities can ban heavily polluting cars, potentially wiping hundreds of millions of euros off the value of diesel cars on the country's roads.
Environmental group DUH has sued Stuttgart in Germany's carmaking heartland, and Duesseldorf over levels of particulate matter exceeding European Union limits after Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) 2015 admission to cheating diesel exhaust tests.
The scandal led politicians across the world to scrutinize diesel emissions, which contain the matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx) and are known to cause respiratory disease. 
There are around 15 million diesel vehicles on German streets and environmental groups say levels of particulates exceed the EU threshold in at least 90 German towns and cities.
Local courts ordered them to bar diesel cars which did not conform to the latest standards on days when pollution is heavy, startling German carmakers because an outright ban could trigger a fall in vehicle resale prices, and a rise in the cost of leasing contracts, which are priced on assumed residual values.
The German states concerned, where the carmakers and their suppliers have a strong influence, appealed against the decisions, leaving Germany's federal administrative court - the court of last resort for such matters - to rule on whether such bans can legally be imposed at local level.
""The key question is whether bans can already be considered to be legal instruments,"" said Remo Klinger, a lawyer for DUH. ""It's a completely open question of law.""
Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a shift to electric vehicles.
DIESEL? NEIN DANKE 
Evercore ISI forecasts a 5 percent fall in diesel residual values could result in a drop of 1.6 billion euros ($2 billion) in operating profit across eight European and U.S. carmakers.
Analysts at Bernstein Research have said that diesel bans in Europe would hit French carmaker Peugeot hardest, followed by  Renault  (PA:RENA). Among German carmakers, Daimler's global fleet exposure to diesel is around 38 percent, BMW's 35 percent and VW's (DE:VOWG_p) 26 percent, Bernstein said in a report from 2016.
Carmakers have sought to avert total bans by updating engine management systems to improve exhaust-treatment filters, a step only possible on vehicles equipped with software-based engine-management systems.
Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars with Euro-6 and Euro-5 emissions standards to receive hardware updates of their exhaust treatment systems, costing at least 1,500 euros per vehicle.
Europe's love affair with diesel is already fading, with its market share in the European Union falling from 53.6 percent at the end of 2014 to 49.9 percent at the end of 2016, European automotive association ACEA's most recent data shows.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",All aboard for hedge funds as trade tide lifts shipping,"By Jonathan Saul and Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - Forced to abandon ship after mistiming their investments five years ago, hedge funds are venturing back in a bid to profit from growing global trade flows. 
Around 90 percent of traded goods by volume are transported by sea and global shipping sectors, including dry bulk, are on course for a recovery this year after a near-decade long crisis, ratings agency S&P said in a report last week.
The IMF has forecast GDP growth at 3.9 percent for 2018 and 2019 versus 3.7 percent last year, which analysts say is boosting sentiment for shipping. 
As a result, many hedge funds are loading hundreds of millions of dollars into the sector, putting behind them losses suffered in 2013 when, based on forecasts of improved world economic growth, they piled in to shipping debt and equity.
That strategy hit the rocks for many investors when the shipping companies they had put their faith in over-ordered new vessels and saw their shares fall by as much as 80 percent.
""They all came in too early,"" Tor Svelland, chief investment officer at hedge fund Svelland Capital, said, adding that the market is different this time around as capacity is shrinking.
""It looks like the new building market will not be able to 'kill' the positive demand story. This is a dream scenario.""
SHIPPING FORECAST
This time round it is not only shipping stocks, but also freight forward agreements (FFA), which allow investors to take positions on freight rates at a point in the future, that are more widely used to get into what is still a niche sector.
For Demetris Polemis, a portfolio manager at $250 million Guernsey based hedge fund Paralos Fund, the tide is turning and with less chance of a shipping glut there are now ""some interesting opportunities for investors"".
Another new feature are exchange traded funds which U.S. filings show are being set up to focus on shipping investments. These would allow hedge funds and retail investors to access FFAs, Polemis said.
""A lot of people have been talking about shipping recently. Last year, a few funds were setting up bespoke products,"" said a London-based hedge fund investor.  
One example is Tufton Ocean, a hedge fund and private equity firm, which started a long-only strategy run solely for a U.S.-based investor in January.
The wave of new money is clear from data last week which showed that hedge funds bet at least $675 million on shipping stocks in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Hedge fund participation in 14 of the top shipping stocks reached 29 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 23 percent in the previous three months, data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings compiled by Symmetric showed. 
And activists, who buy up shares in undervalued companies and agitate for change to drive up the share price, have also been increasingly moving into shipping stocks.
Activist hedge funds made public demands of five shipping companies in the 12 months to Jan. 31, the highest number of campaigns in more than five years, with three in the previous year and two between Feb. 1, 2013 and Jan. 31, 2014, according to research group Activist Insight.
UNCHARTED WATERS
Duncan Dunn, senior director with leading FFA broker SSY Futures Ltd, said a number of investment funds started betting on dry bulk FFAs when the sector downturn started to bite at the end of 2008. 
He said there had been an increase in the estimated underlying transaction value of dry bulk FFAs to $16.5 billion in 2017 from around $9 billion in 2016 and hopes that the underlying value could reach $24 billion if both volume and values grow by 20 percent this year.
""Last year’s improvement in time charter rates was such that not only will there be more hedging opportunity for dry FFA traders, but also a compelling case for renewed investment."" 
Elsewhere, the London-run Baltic Exchange, founded in 1744, is creating the possibility of its globally tracked main sea freight index, which gauges the cost of shipping dry bulk commodities including iron ore, grain and coal, becoming a tradeable instrument.
The Baltic is also looking into launching a freight index for LNG (liquefied natural gas), creating further scope for trading plays. 
Such developments are likely to be a boost for those who caution against stocks as a way of gaining shipping exposure.
Nicholas Tsevdos, managing director of Ocean Way Navigation, a London-based shipping investor and asset manager, said shipping stocks are a particularly poor way in.
""This is due to the exorbitant combined G&A (general and administrative expenses) and management fees, which on average are around three times the market standard,"" Tsevdos said, adding that the correlation between underlying asset values and the share price is often not as expected.
""You can watch a company achieve a phenomenal price for a vessel or fleet sale, and watch the stock tank as the market views it as a retraction,"" Tsevdos said. 
Others, such as Jens Rohweder, managing partner with German-based investment and asset manager Notos Group, say some markets such as dry bulk, which accounts for an estimated 18 percent of the world’s cargo fleet, may already be past their peak, leading him to prefer counter-cyclical investments such as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) stocks.
""This will be the third time round for them (hedge funds), let’s hope they get the timing right,"" one shipping industry source said.

MILAN (Reuters) - Global dividends rose 7.7 percent to an all-time high of $1.25 trillion (1 trillion euros) last year boosted by a buoyant world economy and rising corporate confidence, Janus Henderson (N:JHG) said on Monday, predicting another record year ahead.
The surge - the strongest since 2014 - was driven by increases in every region and almost every industry with record showings in 11 countries including the United States, Japan, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Netherlands, the investment manager added.
For 2018 Janus Henderson expects dividends to keep the same 7.7 percent growth rate to reach around $1.35 trillion, as corporate and economic growth remains strong even in more volatile financial markets.
""Companies are seeing rising profits and healthy cash flows, and that's enabling them to fund generous dividends. The record payout last year was almost three-quarters higher than in 2009, and there is more to come,"" Ben Lofthouse, Director of Global Equity Income at Janus Henderson, said.
""The next few months are set fair, and we expect global dividends to break new records in 2018.""
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) kept its position as the world's biggest dividend payer. China Mobile (HK:0941) rose to second from 19th last year and was followed by  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), Apple (O:AAPL) and Microsoft (O:MSFT), the report said. 
The top 20 payers accounted for 15.7 percent of the total payout. 
Adjusting for movements in exchange rates, special one-off dividends and other factors, global dividends rose 6.8 percent last year and are expected to rise another 6.1 percent in 2018.
EUROPE LAGS
Janus said 2017's dividend growth showed less regional divergence than in previous years, reflecting the broadly based global economic recovery, though Europe lagged behind. 
European dividends rose just 1.9 percent to $227 billion, weighed down by cuts from a handful of large companies in France and Spain, lower special dividends and a weak euro during the second quarter, when most dividends are paid, it said. 
In the UK, headline growth was held back at 3 percent by the weak pound, but underlying growth was 10 percent as UK-listed multinational mining companies rapidly restored dividends that had been cut during the lean years for commodity prices.
The Asia Pacific region posted the strongest headline growth rate of 18.8 percent to 139.9 billion, followed by Emerging Markets, up 16.5 percent to $102.4 billion, while dividends in North America grew 6.9 percent to a record of $475.6 billion.
Janus said every industry saw higher underlying dividends in 2017 except telecoms, which was flat. The mining industry saw by far the fastest growth, up 27.2 percent on an underlying basis.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Chanel, Farfetch pair up for digital push at fashion label's stores","By Sarah White and Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - French couture house Chanel has taken a minority stake in London-based online retailer Farfetch, the companies said on Monday, as part of a tie-up to develop digital services such as chats to connect the label's clients with store assistants. 
Luxury goods companies worldwide are trying to expand their digital services to court younger or more tech-savvy clients.
Privately-owned Chanel, famed for its tweed suits and quilted leather handbags, has been an outlier in the industry push to move more shopping online by deciding not to roll out web sales of its clothing and leather goods. 
Under the new deal, the label will not sell its wares through Farfetch but would work with the platform in coming years on digital innovations linked to customer services, said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's fashion president. 
These could include smartphone applications allowing people to flag their preferences and sizes online before entering a store, meaning assistants can cater to their needs, or help them locate an item spotted in a magazine for instance, he said. 
""This is about how to enrich our relationship with our customers,"" Pavlovsky told Reuters, adding that Chanel was not trying to take a ""Big Brother"" approach of tracking clients but giving those who wished it more tailor-made assistance. 
He did not give any financial details about the tie-up. 
Farfetch has long been tipped for a stock market listing, and investment banks were recently pitching to work on a U.S. flotation later this year, sources said in January.
Farfetch's other investors include Chinese online retailer JD.com (O:JD), French investment company Eurazeo (PA:EURA) and Singapore state investor Temasek. 
The online retailer's shopping platform connects buyers to luxury fashion items from more 700 boutiques worldwide. The firm has also invested in developing digital functions for stores, which can be adapted to suit its partners. 
Britain's Burberry said on Thursday it would team up with Farfetch.
""The challenge for our luxury industry is that our clients are used to ultra-personalized experiences,"" Farfetch's Portuguese founder and Chief Executive Jose Neves said. ""When you walk into a store, people don't know you.""
Chanel already offers select clients some digital support but wants to make this more widely available, Pavlovsky said, adding the firm would start testing new services this year.
The brand has close to 200 stores. It sells cosmetics, eyeglasses and perfumes online, but says releasing other items on the web would make them less exclusive.

Rivals such as LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton,  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci or Hermes (PA:HRMS) have taken a different tack, chasing sales growth by selling more online.

Brambles reported an attributable profit of $447.2 million for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with $146.2 million a year earlier, beating estimates of $323.8 million, according to an average of two analysts.
The company said profit was helped by the absence of impairments incurred in the previous year and recognition of the one-time benefit of $130.1 million from the U.S. tax reform.
Underlying profit for the first-half, however, rose only 1 percent on a constant currency basis to $493.7 million, impacted by previously flagged factors such as loss of large Australian reusable plastic containers contract and investments related to the Hoover Freguson joint venture.
The company declared an interim dividend of A$0.145 per share, the same as last year and said sales revenue for the first half rose 5 percent on a constant currency basis to $2.75 billion. 
Under pressure from stiff competition in the Unite States, and hurt by the shutdown of Australia's car manufacturing sector, the company maintained its full-year revenue growth to be in mid-single digits and expects underlying profit growth slightly higher than the revenue growth.

330,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","In boost to reform, Saudi Arabia's cabinet approves bankruptcy law","By Tom Arnold, Reem Shamseddine and Katie Paul
DUBAI/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's cabinet has approved a bankruptcy law, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday, giving a boost to efforts to make the kingdom more enticing to investors.
Modern bankruptcy legislation does not currently exist in Saudi Arabia, creating difficulties for struggling companies seeking to restructure debt with creditors since the 2009 global financial crisis and, more recently, the dip in oil prices.
The kingdom is embarking on an intensive drive to overhaul its economy - including updating outdated laws - as it seeks to create an investor-friendly climate to push through a multi-billion dollar pipeline of asset sales such as the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, expected to be the world's largest public share sale.
""The timing is excellent,"" said Bader al-Busaies, managing partner at Al Suwaiket and Al Busaies law firm. 
""Lots of companies are facing financial difficulties. Before it was either liquidation or stakeholders had to inject money. The new law is an alternative solution - the international practice has proven that insolvency law offers a good solution for companies.""
King Salman endorsed the bankruptcy law after the cabinet approved it, the sources said, citing a document dated last week.
The Ministry of Commerce and Investment did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and it was not clear when the law would be promulgated and take effect. 
Saudi Arabia's Shura Council, a top advisory body to the government, in December approved a draft of the law which consisted of 231 articles in 17 chapters. It regulated bankruptcy procedures such as settlements and liquidation, for individuals as well as local and foreign companies, according to a government statement at the time.
No details of the framework of the law have yet been released but an earlier draft version created a provision whereby approval of a debt restructuring deal could be achieved if at least two-thirds of creditors approved the plan.
That might help to resolve existing distressed debt disputes such as one faced by Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Brothers (AHAB), a local conglomerate which currently has two-thirds of creditors' support for its debt proposal.

AHAB and another company, Saad Group, defaulted in 2009 in Saudi Arabia's biggest financial meltdown, leaving international and regional banks and other creditors owed about $22 billion.

There has been growing scrutiny of diesel vehicles since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to installing secret software on 580,000 U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit up to 40 times legally allowable emissions while meeting standards when tested by regulators.
Daimler, which faces ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions, has said investigations could lead to significant penalties and recalls.
The Bild am Sonntag newspaper said that the documents showed that U.S. investigators had found several software functions that helped Daimler cars pass emissions tests, including one which switched off emissions cleaning after 26 km of driving.
Another function under scrutiny allowed the emissions cleaning system to recognize whether the car was being tested based on speed or acceleration patterns. 
Bild am Sonntag also cited emails from Daimler engineers questioning whether these software functions were legal.
A Daimler spokesman declined to comment on the content of the documents, saying the German company was fully cooperating with the U.S. authorities and had agreed upon strict confidentiality with the Department of Justice.
""The authorities know the documents and no complaint has been filed,"" the spokesman said. ""The documents available to Bild have obviously selectively been released in order to harm Daimler and its 290,000 employees.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) will start using postcards sent by U.S. mail later this year to verify the identities and location of people who want to purchase U.S. election-related advertising on its site, a senior company executive said on Saturday.
The postcard verification is Facebook's latest effort to respond to criticism from lawmakers, security experts and election integrity watchdog groups that it and other social media companies failed to detect and later responded slowly to Russia's use of their platforms to spread divisive political content, including disinformation, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Facebook revealed the plans a day after U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller unsealed an indictment accusing 13 Russians and three Russian companies of conducting a criminal and espionage conspiracy using social media to interfere in the election by boosting Republican Donald Trump and denigrating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The process of using postcards containing a specific code will be required for advertising that mentions a specific candidate running for a federal office, Katie Harbath, Facebook's global director of policy programs, said. The requirement will not apply to issue-based political ads, she said.
""If you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States,"" Harbath said at a weekend conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, where executives from  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google also spoke.
""It won't solve everything,"" Harbath said in a brief interview with Reuters following her remarks. 
But sending codes through old-fashioned mail was the most effective method the tech company could come up with to prevent Russians and other bad actors from purchasing ads while posing as someone else, Harbath said.
Foreign nationals are prohibited under U.S. law from contributing or donating money or anything else of value or making any expenditure in connection with any federal, state or local election in the United States.
The indictment released on Friday laid out in specific detail how prosecutors believe Russians adopted false online personas to push divisive political content, including ads. The Russians also allegedly posed as Americans to stage political rallies in the United States and persuade real Americans to engage in pro-Trump activities. 
Harbath did not say when Facebook would begin relying on postcard codes, but said they would be in use before this year's mid-term congressional elections in November.
A Facebook spokesman declined to provide further details on the plan, but referred to a company blog post from last October announcing plans to roll out more robust identification verification measures for political advertisers.

That blog post did not specify what the verification process would entail.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Takata Corp's U.S. unit received court approval for its bankruptcy exit plan, a plaintiffs' law firm said on Saturday, clearing the way for a $1.6 billion sale of Takata assets and providing compensation for those injured by the company's deadly air bags.
Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, filed for bankruptcy last year in the wake of the largest automotive recall in history. The company's air bags can inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments, and have been linked to hundreds of injuries and at least 22 deaths.
""We are pleased that Judge (Brendan) Shannon has approved what we believe to be fair options for current and future victims of Takata airbags that provide swift resolution and allow victims to try to move on with their lives,” said a statement from the Motley Rice law firm.
The law firm represented more than two dozen injured drivers in the U.S. bankruptcy case.
The U.S. unit's reorganization plan will include funds provided by automakers to help compensate those injured by the air bags.
On Friday, a lawyer for Takata's U.S. unit told the bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, that the U.S. government will complete its review of the planned sale of Takata's non-air bag businesses by March 26.
The non-air bag inflator businesses are being sold to Key Safety Systems, a unit of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp (SS:600699).

338,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2018 01:46PM ET</span>","Tesla delays, tax credit concerns spur sales of Chevy Bolts","By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some potential buyers of Tesla's long-delayed Model 3 sedan are concerned that they will miss out on big federal tax breaks and are looking for alternatives, including General Motors Co's (N:GM) Chevrolet Bolt, according to postings by would-be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) buyers on websites and interviews with GM dealers.
Last week Tesla told some holders of Model 3 reservations that they would not get their cars until 2019, eliciting howls of complaint on Tesla online fan forums. Tesla declined to comment.
GM dealers in California, the top U.S. market for electric vehicles, say brisk demand for Bolts is driven in part by frustrated Tesla buyers who are afraid they will lose a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit if they wait. The tax credit drops in value and eventually disappears once Tesla sells 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, which Edmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo expects Tesla to hit by the fall.
Tesla's Model 3 production troubles give rival auto makers a chance to snatch customers. Tesla has said that the net number of refundable $1,000 reservations for Model 3s was stable late last year and grew in recent weeks, with hundreds of thousands in line. But some buyers are running out of time or patience. 
Chevrolet dealer Yev Kaplinskiy said his dealership located between San Francisco and Silicon Valley sold 15 Bolts last weekend, after Tesla's latest delay.
""We're getting the Tesla people who wanted their Model 3,"" Kaplinskiy said. ""We ask them, 'What other cars are you interested in?' They're mostly Tesla. But they want the car now. They don't want to wait."" Some of the weekend buyers had turned to Chevy because of the most recent Tesla delay, he said.
Chevrolet sent an email to some prospective buyers this week, announcing in bold case, ""Bolt EV: Now available.""
The Bolt and Model 3 both start at about $35,000 and can travel more than 200 miles (322 km) on an electric charge, although the Tesla and its Chief Executive Elon Musk have received much more media attention.
While Tesla is struggling with production of the Model 3, GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017, with monthly sales mostly rising. Kelley Blue Book reported that Bolts are in relatively short supply as measured by days in inventory, which fell to 42 in January from a high of 65 in August. By comparison, the Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) Leaf, an electric car with shorter range, was in inventory for 202 days.
For a graphic on 2017 Bolt sales, click here: http://reut.rs/2sxeVt9
Last Wednesday, some of those who made early reservations for the base version Model 3 received emails from Tesla saying their vehicles would not be delivered until early 2019, delayed from 2018.
""I'm feeling extremely fleeced by Elon - guy secured an interest free loan from me (reservation payment) for a car I hadn't seen before reserving, and just told me that it might be another year before I should receive it,"" wrote one person from Seattle, ""206er"", who was among a handful on TeslaMotorsClub.com saying they were cancelling reservations after the new delay.
Reuters was unable to contact the posters or confirm that they were cancelling reservations.
""My objective...was always a $35,000 Tesla for the price of a decently optioned Civic (with full federal tax credit),"" 206er added.
Tesla is closing in on 200,000 U.S. electric vehicle sales thanks to the popularity of its luxury Model S sedan and Model X SUV. If it hits 200,000 U.S. electric vehicle sales in the third quarter, then the $7,500 tax credit would phase out in stages over 2019. GM also is getting close to the limit, having sold nearly 170,000 plug-in cars, including Bolts, Volts and others, through the end of last year, Green Car Reports estimated. 

Sonoma Chevrolet General Manager Ken Scholl, said the subsidy had been a key draw for Bolts and a concern for those who had given up on a Tesla. ""If I had 50 (Bolts) in December, we would have sold every one,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian banks could take a hit of more than $3 billion from loans and corporate guarantees provided to diamond companies at the center of a massive alleged fraud at the state-run Punjab National Bank, the tax department has estimated.
As of March 2017, banks had extended loans and guarantees worth 176.32 billion rupees ($2.74 billion) to companies tied to billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, the tax department said in a note seen by Reuters.
Since then, the loans and guarantees would have increased over the past year and the total ""hit"" to Indian banks ""may well exceed"" $3 billion, according to an internal note prepared by the tax authority on its preliminary investigation into India's biggest bank fraud case.
According to a complaint by PNB, the biggest fraud in Indian banking history involved two junior officials at a Mumbai bank branch issuing ""letters of undertaking"" to firms linked to Modi and Choksi for them to obtain credit from overseas branches of other Indian lenders. 
The bank said these fraudulent transactions had taken place over a number of years and amounted to $1.77 billion.
None of these letters of undertaking - essentially credit guarantees - were recorded on the bank's internal software system and instead were transmitted through the SWIFT interbank messaging system, ""thus avoiding early detection of fraudulent activity"", the tax note said.
It said that Choksi's Geetanjali Gems and its subsidiaries led by Choksi dealt with 32 banks. Among those that offered credit to Choksi and Modi, famous for his chain of stores stretching from New York to Beijing, were the  Union Bank of India , Allahabad Bank and  Axis Bank , the tax note said. 
Union Bank of India (NS:UNBK), another state-run lender, said on Friday it has an exposure of $300 million as a counter-party lender. Axis Bank (NS:AXBK), a private sector lender, has said it has sold all its exposure related to the fraud.
Among the findings of the tax department was that several firms in which Modi and his uncle were involved had people of limited means listed as majority partners. Those people were not identified in the tax department note.
The total loans in the three firms of Modi, Stellar Diamond, Solar Exports and Diamonds ""R Us was 39.929 billion Indian rupees, while total capital of the partners was 4 billion Indian rupees, it said. 
It said the three firms' ""trade receivables"", or the amount being billed to customers, were ""much higher than total turnover of the three companies involved in the fraud, which shows that goods are being sold for related party and are either over-invoiced or not coming at all"".

Modi and Choksi have not made any comment so far. Federal police say they both left India in early January and there whereabouts are unknown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended that President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas, according to proposals released on Friday.
China's Commerce Ministry responded by saying the report was ""baseless"" and did not accord with the facts, and that China would take necessary steps to protects its interests if the final decision affects China.
The long-awaited unveiling of Commerce's ""Section 232"" national security reviews of the two industries contained global tariff options of at least 24 percent on all steel products from all countries, and at least 7.7 percent on all aluminum products from all countries. 
Trump authorized the probes under a 1962 trade law that has not been invoked since 2001. He has until April 11 to announce his decision on steel import curbs and by April 20 to decide on aluminum restrictions.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross emphasized that Trump would have the final say, including on whether to exclude certain countries, such as NATO allies, from any actions.
""The president has the discretion to modify any of these or to come with something totally different,"" he told reporters on a conference call.
He said a global tariff would cover every steel and aluminum product entering the American market from China.
China's Commerce Ministry urged the United States to exercise restraint in using trade protection tools, respect the rules of multilateral trade and make a positive contribution to the international economic and trading order. 
""If the final U.S. decision affects China's interests, China must take necessary measures to protect its own reasonable interests,"" the ministry added, without giving details.
Steel stocks soared with U.S. Steel closing up 14.7 percent, AK Steel up 13.7 percent,  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) ended up 4.5 percent and the broader S&P 1500 steel index 5.3 percent higher.
Century Aluminum shares closed up 8.3 percent, while  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA), which has operations across the globe, ended off 0.44 percent.
Alcoa said in a statement the U.S. trade actions should focus on Chinese overcapacity and not penalize nations that abide by the rules.
Ross said he would not be surprised if countries challenged the measures at the World Trade Organization.
He said ""there has been no dialing back"" of the recommendations due to objections from industries that use steel and aluminum.
""The objective of both reports is to get the production up to a level which will result, in our judgment, in the long term viability of each industry,"" Ross said, adding that he did not believe that the recommendations would lead to significant price hikes.
U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he hoped the proposals ""are the beginning of efforts by this administration to finally get tough on China.""
SPECIFIC COUNTRY OPTIONS
Alternatively, Commerce recommended a tariff of at least 53 percent on all steel imports from 12 countries -- Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, India, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.
Other countries would be subject to a quota limiting their tariff-free access equal to their 2017 steel exports to the United States.
The country-specific aluminum option would impose a 23.6 percent tariff on all products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam. All others would be subject to quotas equal to their 2017 exports to the United States. 
A third option called for Trump to impose global quotas based on 63 percent of each country's 2017 steel exports and based on 87 percent of their aluminum exports to the United States.
South Korea's trade ministry said in a statement that it had met with executives from steel makers and agreed to make outreach efforts until Washington makes a final decision.
Separately, Seoul plans to take a dispute to the World Trade Organization against the United States for imposing high anti-dumping duties on the country's steel products.
Ross said the remedies were designed to raise U.S. capacity utilization to about 80 percent for each industry, from the current 48 percent in aluminum and 73 percent in steel.
""That is the level we believe would provide the industry with long term viability,"" he said.
Some U.S. companies will be able to request exclusions for specific products if the U.S. lacks sufficient domestic capacity or for national security considerations, Ross added.
Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, welcomed the proposals saying they could be ""meaningful and effective"" in tackling global excess capacity and relentless steel imports.
But in a joint statement the National Tooling and Machining Association and Precision Metalforming Association said steep tariffs would ""devastate"" downstream U.S. steel consuming manufacturers, which employ 6.5 million Americans.
""If these tariffs are imposed, the U.S. will become an island of high steel prices resulting in our customers simply importing the finished part and threatening thousands of jobs,"" the groups said. 
Cowen and Co. analysts Novid Rassouli and Han Zhang told clients in a research note they believe Trump will likely go for more targeted options.
""Utilizing a blanket tariff is too broad, in our view,"" they said. ""There is a higher level of precision needed than a blanket tariff because depending on the product spread, it could for instance knock out one product, and do little to nothing for another.""
Trump met with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators and representatives at the White House last week, signaling he would take at least some action to restrict imports of the two metals.

Some U.S. lawmakers and steel and aluminum users have urged caution in any restrictions to avoid disruptions or price spikes in the raw materials, used in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. grain merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co has settled a lawsuit with Syngenta over the seed company's launch of a biotech corn strain that roiled grain exports to China, according to regulatory documents filed on Friday.
ADM sued Syngenta four years ago for selling the corn variety known as Agrisure Viptera or MIR 162 before it was approved for import by China, an importer on U.S. grain. China rejected U.S. corn cargoes that contained the unauthorized strain, which caused financial losses for ADM, according to the lawsuit.
China ultimately approved imports of Viptera corn in 2014.
ADM and Syngenta reached a confidential settlement over the matter in December, according to an annual report the grain handler filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), another major grain handler, and U.S. farmers also sued Syngenta. Last year, Syngenta, now owned by ChemChina [CNNCC.UL], agreed to settle farmers' lawsuits for close to $1.5 billion.
The Cargill case is set for trial in September, according to Syngenta.
""Syngenta is continuing to defend against the claims of other exporters, and continues to believe that American farmers should have access to the latest U.S.-approved technologies to help them increase their productivity and crop yield,"" spokesman Paul Minehart said in an email.
Growers also sued ADM over the matter, claiming the company was negligent in failing to screen for biotech corn. China's rejections of U.S. shipments caused corn prices to plummet, according the farmers' lawyers. ADM remains a defendant in court actions in Illinois, which the company has sought to dismiss, the SEC filing said.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 07:27PM ET</span>",Stock volatility: back with a bang and here to stay,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets are unlikely to return to the unusually calm conditions seen last year, even though equities have already recovered more than half the ground lost in the recent selloff and traders have rapidly dialed down fear.
Stock market volatility spiked to a multi-year high in the selloff and some products that flourished in low volatility collapsed. A higher-volatility environment means the 1 percent stock market swings of the past two weeks will become commonplace, strategists said. 
It is something that investors will have to get used to. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks, last year logged a historically low average of 11.
""We expect the current shock to herald a higher volatility regime,"" said Jim Strugger, derivatives strategist at MKM Partners in New York.
The VIX reached a 2-1/2-year high of 50.30 on Feb. 6. Since then it has slipped to 17.60, still well above the record low of 8.56 hit in November.
""Fear has come down dramatically but certainly not to the level of complacency seen pre-correction,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas. 
""VIX futures seem to indicate that the VIX could trend down from current levels to maybe as low as 15 over the next couple of months, but there are few, if any, signs we'll see 10 again any time soon,"" he said.
The VIX is derived from the price of S&P 500 options and is an indicator of investors' collective estimate of near-term gyrations for the benchmark stock index.
With the S&P 500 at 2,744, a VIX of 15 implies a daily move of the index of 21.54 points, or close to 0.8 percent, Frederick said.
There have been eight days this month when the S&P 500 logged a single-day move of more than 1 percent, compared with eight days in all of 2017.
""You are probably going to be bopping up and down based on stuff that happens,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.
Several high-profile U.S. investors including Jeffrey Gundlach, known as Wall Street's Bond King, and hedge fund manager Douglas Kass from Seabreeze Partners Management Inc see more stress ahead for stocks.
To be sure, a higher floor to volatility would not necessarily mean an end to the bull market in equities. The three years when the VIX logged its highest annual average, 1999, 2003 and 2009, coincided with 20 percent or bigger gains for the S&P 500.
""The velocity of the shift is what really matters here,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. ""And the velocity of that shift is slow."" 
""There's no reason stocks can't range higher with some higher volatility,"" he said.
Ever-growing herds of volatility sellers and investors looking to buy the dip have quashed each instance of higher volatility over the last few years.
Despite the recent shock that led to the shuttering of popular exchange-traded products used to bet on stock market calm, traders are pouring money into that trade again.
The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:SVXY), which gains as long as volatility declines or stays low, has drawn about $418 million on a net basis since Feb. 6, the day the VIX peaked, according to ETF.com data.
But things may be a little different this time. The Federal Reserve is shrinking its balance sheet and raising interest rates. U.S. corporate earnings could be the other factor to watch.
Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to keep rising for the next few profit periods, peaking at 21.3 percent growth in the third quarter and moving to 17.8 percent growth in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""When earnings growth starts to roll over and go from positive growth to negative growth, a deceleration, you see volatility increase in the market place,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco PowerShares, in Chicago.
""I have been counseling clients to think about using products like low volatility or quality to help essentially mitigate some of the downside risks that are present,"" he said.
Sharper equity market gyrations could serve up opportunities for stock pickers to shine.

""That will place more of an emphasis upon the quality of active management and stock picking, asset allocation and all the stuff that theoretically we get paid for because we are good at,"" Orlando said.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: GE exploring industrial gas engine business sale - sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) is exploring a sale of its industrial gas engine business that could be worth as much as $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The move comes after Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, who took over as CEO last summer, indicated to analysts and investors for the first time last month that he was open to breaking up the company and said that a spinoff of any of its units, which include power, healthcare and aviation, was a possibility.
Divesting the industrial gas engine business, which includes the Jenbacher and Waukesha engines, would help streamline GE's power division, whose profit plunged 45 percent last year as sales of power plants and services fell sharply.
GE has hired  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) to prepare a sale process for the industrial gas business, the sources said on Friday. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
A GE spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Citigroup spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The unit for sale makes multi-ton gas turbines that generate on-site power to keep industrial plants running. Jenbacher and Waukesha engines cover the small to mid-sized segment of GE’s power business, ranging from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts.
Flannery said last November that GE would exit at least $20 billion in operations, as it tries to shore up its financial performance. 
As part of this review, GE is exploring options for its transportation unit, which makes railway locomotives; its iconic lighting division, which makes bulbs for consumers; and its healthcare information technology business.
The company's stock has lost half its value in the last 12 months and Flannery is under pressure from investors, including activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP which sits on its board of directors, to turn the business around.
GE disclosed last month that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its accounting for part of its services backlog, and a set of actuarial calculations that caused GE to take a charge for long-term-care policies it underwrote a decade ago.
GE took a $6.2 billion after-tax charge on those policies in the fourth quarter and said it will set aside $15 billion more in reserves over the next seven years to cover potential claims on the policies.

Earlier this week, GE said it had reached a deal to sell parts of its overseas lighting business to a company controlled by former executive Joerg Bauer for an undisclosed amount.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday moved to prevent AT&T Inc (N:T) from arguing that politics played a role in the government's decision to stop its merger with Time Warner Inc (N:T), a deal that President Donald Trump had publicly criticized.
""There was no selective enforcement,"" Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said at a pre-trial hearing. ""The president is unhappy with CNN. We don't dispute that. But AT&T wants to turn that into a get-out-jail-free card for their illegal merger.""
AT&T and Time Warner's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, however, cited Trump's repeated criticism of the deal as reason to allow the company to argue that the government opposed the deal for political reasons. It is seeking records of communications between the White House and Justice Department that describe Trump's views on the merger.
AT&T wants the judge to review any communications found to see if they bolster their contention that the transaction was singled out because of Trump’s anger with CNN.
The documents were requested as preparation for a March 19 trial in which Judge Richard Leon will decide if the $85 billion deal would raise prices. The Justice Department sued to stop the deal on the grounds that it is illegal under antitrust law.
The government has asked Judge Leon to rule that AT&T may not cite politics, formally known as selective enforcement, as a defense and to quash a request for documents to support that defense.
AT&T's Petrocelli defended the request. ""If there is something in those documents, it's important for us,"" he said at the hearing at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
Leon said he would rule on Tuesday.
The deal has been followed more closely than most antitrust matters because Trump attacked it while on the campaign trail in 2016. Trump has also repeatedly criticized Time Warner's CNN news network and, in November, he reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction. 
Conrath said the government's lawsuit was not motivated by Trump's irritation with CNN and said it had offered several settlement options that would have allowed AT&T to acquire CNN.
As recently as November, Trump stood by his criticism of the proposed transaction. 
""Personally I've always felt that that was a deal that's not a good deal for the country,"" the president said. ""I think your pricing's going to go up, I don't think it's a good deal for the country.""
Conrath warned that if the Justice Department were forced to conduct a much broader search for additional documents it could delay the trial until July. Leon also said he did not want the case to get “sidetracked.”
""We have no intention of losing this schedule,"" Petrocelli said.
Petrocelli said Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes had laid out in extensive detail the company’s belief that Trump’s improper influence was a factor in a deposition Thursday.
AT&T had taken the unusual step of including the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, on its witness list as it looks to find evidence to support its position that the government was bringing a case because of Trump’s anger.
Conrath offered an affidavit from Delrahim in which he said he had not been instructed or ordered by anyone at the White House or at the Justice Department to bring the lawsuit.
Merger cases, however, are judged illegal or legal depending on whether prices go up or innovation is lost because of the deal.

Petrocelli derided the government's case as ""weak,"" saying that their economists had determined the price of AT&T's DirecTV could go down and that there could be a small increase to non-DirecTV consumers. Conrath sharply disagreed, saying the deal would cause ""hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.""

The complaint by Christopher Musso comes after mutual fund company Fidelity, which also operates one of the largest U.S. online brokerages, said on Feb. 6 that its website experienced ""intermittent technical difficulties"" as brokerage clients watched a stock market rout reverberate around the globe. The lawsuit is seeking class-action status.
Musso said he could not execute trades using Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform when the market opened on Feb. 6, according to his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey. 
""Considering the volatility (a day earlier), it was important for (Musso and others) ... to have access to Fidelity’s Active Trader Pro platform in order to monitor their respective investments and be able to execute fast and quick trades,"" according to the complaint. 

Mike Aalto, a spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity, declined to comment, citing company policy about ongoing litigation.

352,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week.
1. US Equity Markets Make Comeback as Volatility Retreats
The violent upswing in volatility that sent global markets tumbling last week abated, paving the way for US stocks to recover some of their losses.
Volatility as measured by the so-called fear index VIX fell below the 20 after rising to levels not seen since 2015 a week ago.
The recovery was made all the more the impressive as it came amid improving inflation, which Morgan Stanley said was one of the reasons that stocks had sold off last week.
Morgan Stanley said that investors were not worried by macro fundaments – which remains stronger for longer – but rather “the perceived rise in inflationary pressures and the accompanying rise in interest rates.”
Also supporting equities was a rise in shares of steel manufacturers after U.S. Commerce Department Friday recommended a 24% tariff on steel imports from all countries, and a 53% tariff on imports from 12 countries that constitute the majority of U.S. steel imports.
The Commerce Department also recommended a 7.7% tariff on all aluminium exports, or a 23.6% tariff on all products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam.
The S&P 500 notched its best week since 2013 as it ended the week at 2,732.22.
2. WTI Crude Snaps Two Week Losing Streak
Crude oil prices shrugged off a week of mostly bearish reports, snapping a two-week losing streak.
Both OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) claimed earlier this week that non-OPEC output, led by the US, was set to surge in the months ahead and could weighed on major oil producers’ efforts to restore rebalancing in the market.
Offsetting that somewhat, was weekly crude supply totals from the Energy Information Administration showing U.S. crude supplies rose less than expected. A slowdown in refinery activity as maintenance season gets underway, however, could see supply totals build as demand for crude falls.
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose 34 cents to settle at $61.68 a barrel.
3. Euro, Yen Pressured Vulnerable Dollar
The dollar ended Friday nursing heavy weekly losses pressured by sterling, euro and yen. Weakness in the dollar was somewhat surprising given a raft of upbeat economic data reported this week including a solid inflation report, lifting Fed rate hike expectations.
Some pointed to investor jitters concerning the U.S. deficit, which is forecast to climb near $1 trillion in 2019 following the announcement of infrastructure spending and large corporate tax cuts.
Others suggested, however, that diverging global monetary policy was supporting demand for euro and yen assets limiting advances in the greenback.
“The dollar sell off Wednesday in spite of higher Fed tightening probability reinforces our view that monetary policy divergence is raising the attractiveness of euro and yen assets to international investors,” Mizuho Bank said.
4. Gold Prices Posted Weekly Gain For First Time in 3 Weeks 
A falling dollar helped gold prices avoid a third straight week of losses. The yellow metal traded within a roughly $50 price range this week, recovering from lows of about $1,316 an ounce to end the week at $1,349.70.
The bullish week for gold comes against the backdrop of falling demand as CFTC COT data showed money managers cut their long bets on gold for the third straight week.
5. Cryptos Rebound as Bitcoin Meets $10,000 Again, Litecoin Steals the Show
A report highlighting South Korea’s plan to pivot toward more ‘friendly’ approaches to regulate the crypto-industry rather than issue an outright ban appeared to be just what the crypto-doctor ordered, paving the way for fresh inflows into the industry.
The total cryptocurrency market cap rose to about $480 billion, at the time of writing, from $420 billion a week ago.
Rising inflows and limited outflows characterised earlier rallies in cryptocurrencies, so it was somewhat unsurprising to see bitcoin rise more than 16% over the past seven days.
Yet, Litecoin garnered all the attention after surging more than 40% over the past seven days. The rally came amid Litecoin’s announcement that it would launch a LitePay payments processor. Litecoin reportedly said that merchants in 41 countries will have access to the LitePay merchant payment processing.
Others, however, cited an upcoming split or “fork” in Litecoin, creating Litecoin Cash, as the more plausible reason. Investors piled into Litecoin on expectations of receiving free Litecoin Cash, which will be distributed, at the time of fork, to any user ""hodling"" Litecoin."

363,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 03:39PM ET</span>","GE faces shareholder lawsuit over insurance shortfall, SEC probe","By Alwyn Scott and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co was sued on Friday by a shareholder who accused the conglomerate of concealing mounting insurance liabilities and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe, saying it cost shareholders tens of billions of dollars.
The complaint filed by the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund appears to be the first proposed shareholder class action accusing GE of securities fraud since the company surprised investors with two negative announcements last month.
On Jan. 16, GE said it would take a $6.2 billion pretax charge and set aside $15 billion in reserves to help cover insurance operations held by its GE Capital unit, mainly concerning long-term-care insurance policies.
Eight days later, it said the SEC had begun probing how it handled its insurance obligations, as well as how it accounted for service agreements related to power plants, jet engines and other equipment.
Other defendants in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, include GE Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, his predecessor Jeffrey Immelt, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller and her predecessor Jeffrey Bornstein.
""The company will defend itself against these claims,"" a GE spokeswoman said.
Daniel Berger, a lawyer for the plaintiff, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of shareholders from Feb. 26, 2013, to Jan. 24, 2018.
GE's market value fell to roughly $143 billion by the end of the class period from more than $290 billion in July 2016.
The Boston-based company has faced earlier shareholder lawsuits over its falling stock price.
Long-term-care insurance has become a more troublesome and costly business, including for the Genworth Financial Inc (NYSE:GNW) business that GE spun off in 2004, as policyholders live longer.
The complaint said GE knew or should have known it was not immune from that trend, and quoted from analysts covering GE who wrote that it was ""hard to believe"" or ""hard to imagine"" that the company suddenly discovered its problems.
GE stopped writing long-term-care insurance contracts in 2006, but has said it provides reinsurance on about 300,000 policies.

The case is Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund v General Electric Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01404.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Airbus concerned about German coalition's tougher stance on arm sales,"By Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold
MUNICH (Reuters) - The head of Airbus's defense unit criticized Germany on Friday for not spending more on defense and said the new coalition agreement's call for a tougher approach to arms exports could prompt the weapons maker to re-examine its business plans.
A coalition deal between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), which must still be ratified by the SPD, has pledged an immediate ban on arms sales to countries involved in the war in Yemen and a tougher approach to arms sales in general.
""If additional restrictions are imposed, we would have to consider that in our strategic planning,"" Dirk Hoke, chief executive of Airbus Defence and Space, said in a telephone interview during the annual Munich Security Conference.
""A unilateral restriction on European arms exports by Germany not only hurts domestic industry, but also reduces the room for maneuver of a strategic European security and defense policy,"" said Hoke, who is German.
""Many European partners already do not consider us a reliable partner because our arms export policies change depending on the outcome of our elections,"" he said.
French defense minister Florence Parly told the same conference that European arms makers needed to export to maintain their ability to meet future European weapons requirements.
""If one day we decided only to produce for ourselves with no ambition to export, then before long we'd have to question whether we were still able to protect our own citizens,"" she said. ""Arms exports have to be done seriously and rigorously, but we shouldn't make it into a kind of specter in what is a very sensitive political debate.""
Hoke also joined criticism of Germany for not meeting NATO countries' agreement to spend 2 percent of their annual economic output on defense by 2024.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is not expected to reach that target by then.
""The defense budget situation is not helpful and will lead to a decidedly difficult position for Germany in Europe,"" Hoke said. ""With just 1.2 percent of economic output, we are falling short of our responsibilities in Europe.""
""If Germany wants to get anywhere near meeting the obligations (to NATO) that were once again reiterated in the coalition agreement, there must be significant increases in the military budget,"" he said.
U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis this week told European allies to step up efforts to increase military budgets, echoing the tough message he first brought to NATO a year ago when he said allies needed to honor spending pledges or risk less military support from the United States.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, however, said in Munich on Friday that ""all NATO allies have put forward plans to increase spending in real terms.""

MUNICH (Reuters) - Initial details of a planned Franco-German program to develop a next-generation fighter jet should emerge in the second half of 2018, the head of Airbus's (PA:AIR) defense unit told Reuters on Friday.
Dirk Hoke said France and Germany would work out in coming months how to proceed with the program, including whether to bring in an additional partner country, such as Britain.
""We expect basic issues, such as how the project will be structured, to be discussed in the second quarter, so that the initial contours will be set in the second half of the year,"" Hoke, chief executive of Airbus Defence and Space, said in an interview during the Munich Security Conference.
He said Airbus supported bringing other countries into the program, which is envisioned as a family of systems rather than just a single new aircraft, noting that other countries could bring their expertise to bear on various aspects.
No decisions had been made on which company would lead the new program, he said, noting that different firms could lead different segments of the broad project. 
Much would also depend on the level of investment pledged by participating countries, he added.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in July announced plans to jointly develop a successor for the Eurofighter Typhoon.
The new combat system could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft and would eventually replace the Rafale and Eurofighter, rival jets that compete fiercely for global sales, as well as the older Panavia Tornado.
Hoke said it was imperative to avoid mistakes made in the last big European military program, the troubled A400M military transporter, which has been plagued with cost overruns and technical challenges.
""It's important that the specifications (for the new fighter jet program) are developed with a sense of proportion,"" he said. He said it was important to ""prevent requirements that are too comprehensive and that cannot be delivered by industry.""
Airbus this week took a further 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion) charge on the A400M program for 2017, bringing total charges on the project to over 8 billion euros. But it said agreement by NATO buyers to stretch out the delivery schedule and accept certain changes would limit future losses.
Hoke lauded an agreement reached this month by NATO buyers, Airbus and the OCCAR pan-European procurement agency to negotiate a new delivery schedule for the aircraft.
He said he was confident that agreements with individual countries could be finalised by the end of the year, and said the declaration of intention had helped repair frayed relations with A400M buyer nations.
""It was a very constructive cooperation, and there was strong support from all participants,"" he said. ""I believe we have significantly improved relations.""
Hoke said Airbus expected to release details about the next steps on a European program to develop a drone by late April at the Berlin air show.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",France to broaden scope of veto over foreign takeovers: PM,"PARIS (Reuters) - France is to broaden the scope of legislation which can be used to veto foreign takeovers, extending it to the fields of artificial intelligence, microchips, space and data storage, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Friday. 
The French government adopted a decree in 2014 under which any foreign takeover of French groups operating in sectors considered as strategic can be blocked. These currently include energy, water, transport, telecoms and health.
""We must strengthen the tools to protect French interests, that's what China and the United States have been doing for a long time,"" Philippe said at an event in a plant belonging to cosmetics group L'Oreal (PA:OREP) in northern France. 
New measures will be added to draft legislation to be presented on April 18, the prime minister said. 
Stake acquisitions by foreign entities in strategic firms generally receive a green light from authorities in exchange for binding commitments, he said. 
The government also plans to create a legal framework to pave the way for a so-called ""golden share"" rule that would preserve state control over companies in which it has a minority stake. 
Philippe confirmed state investment bank Bpifrance and the country's State Shareholding Agency APE were working on a financial envelope to fend off foreign takeovers of French groups.
Bpifrance's head said last week this envelope should amount to 3 billion euros.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 01:43PM ET</span>",Qualcomm says open to more deal talks with Broadcom following meeting,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Diane Bartz
(Reuters) -  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) on Friday called a meeting with Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO) to discuss the latter's $121 billion bid constructive and opened the door to more talks, but continued to reject the proposed deal between the semiconductor companies.
Qualcomm's response raises the stakes in a battle over what would be the technology sector's largest-ever acquisition. The two companies have less than three weeks to negotiate a potential deal until Qualcomm shareholders are asked to vote on a challenge by Broadcom to Qualcomm's board of directors.
Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom's acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to its shareholders and proxy advisory firms that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible.
""While the current Broadcom proposal is unacceptable, our board is intensely focused on maximizing value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether through executing on its growth strategy or by selling the company,"" Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs wrote to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan on Friday in a letter released by Qualcomm.
Broadcom offered no immediate comment. Qualcomm shares were up 0.4 percent at $65.60, significantly below Broadcom's latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer. Broadcom shares were down 0.8 percent at $249.89.
Qualcomm's meeting with Broadcom on Feb. 14 was the first time the two companies met to discuss a potential combination since Broadcom unveiled its unsolicited bid last November.
As part of the takeover battle, Broadcom is asking Qualcomm shareholders to back its effort to replace a majority of Qualcomm's board of directors in a vote scheduled for March 6. It has called its latest bid its best and final offer.
""While it sounds like the parties remain very far apart on the specifics (price, risk mitigation, etc), actual negotiations (with an understanding of opening positions) do appear to have kicked off, and Qualcomm is at least contemplating the bare possibility that they might get sold,"" analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein said. 
In the meeting this week, Singapore-based Broadcom was willing to make certain divestitures to satisfy antitrust regulators, but was still resistant to ""other commitments that could be expected"" to be required by government regulatory bodies, Qualcomm said.
Broadcom has already said it is willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.
In the meeting, Broadcom agreed to divest if needed its own Wi-Fi business, instead of Qualcomm's, a source familiar with the confidential details of the meeting said.
Broadcom also wanted Qualcomm to include in the merger agreement that Qualcomm will refrain from lawsuits related to licensing while the deal is being reviewed by regulators, according to the source. Qualcomm did not agree to that.
Qualcomm reiterated that Broadcom's promised breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal did not come close to compensating for risks related to the deal.
NXP DEAL
The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.
Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.
Qualcomm is currently seeking to complete a $38 billion deal to acquire  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI). NXP shares are trading at around $119, significantly above Qualcomm's $110 per share offer, as some NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have called on Qualcomm to raise its price.
Broadcom has said its acquisition offer is contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at currently disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash or the deal being terminated.

China's MOFCOM is the only regulator around the world that has yet to approve the Qualcomm-NXP deal. With the start of the Chinese New Year public holiday this week, Qualcomm could potentially delay its decision on raising its offer for NXP until after the March 6 Qualcomm shareholder meeting.

385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>","Alcoa, Century Jump as Commerce Said to Recommend Import Tariffs","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. aluminum producers  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp. and Century Aluminum Co. jumped along with the price of the lightweight metal as the U.S. Commerce Department was said to recommend that President Donald Trump impose tariffs and quotas on imports.
Commerce proposed a 7.7 percent tariff on all aluminum imports and 23.5 percent on the metal when it comes from China, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam, according to three people familiar with the recommendation. The department also proposed an aluminum quota of 86.7 percent of 2017 exports, they said, requesting anonymity because the recommendations aren’t public. Commerce is scheduled to brief reporters on its recommendations on both aluminum and steel imports on Friday.
Century surged as much as 9.9 percent while Alcoa gained 4 percent. Aluminum on the London Metal Exchange rose as much as 2.4 percent as of 4:58 p.m. in London.
Trump instructed the Commerce Department last year to probe whether imports of steel and aluminum represent a threat to U.S. national security. The investigation took place under the seldom-used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month submitted his department’s final reports to Trump on steel and aluminum. The president now has until about mid-April to decide on any potential action.
Imposing tariffs on such widely used commodities may trigger retaliatory measures from China, the world’s biggest producer of steel and aluminum. It could also inflate manufacturing and consumer prices in the U.S., and inflame tensions with allies such as Japan, India, Germany and Canada. Group of 20 economies have pushed back against the threat of steel tariffs, warning such a move could set off a trade war.
Trump is facing resistance to tariffs from lawmakers in his own party. At a meeting this week at the White House, at least seven Republican lawmakers argued against any action that might set off a tit-for-tat response from China or other countries.
Trump said the U.S. steel and aluminum industries “are being decimated by dumping and from many countries.” The administration is now considering “all options, and part of the options would be tariffs,” he told lawmakers at the meeting. Such measures would encourage steel and aluminum producers to come back to the U.S., he said. Some companies in the steel industry, as well as unions such as United Steelworkers, have been pushing the president to come down hard on imports.
Speculation about possible U.S. action has roiled the metals industry. Imports of steel increasing last year on anticipation that new tariffs would elevate costs.

386,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Peter Thiel Had $244 Million Bet on Volatility Jump at Year-End,"(Bloomberg) -- Peter Thiel is known for venture investments like those in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and PayPal Holdings Inc. But it was a macro strategy that positioned him to make a killing on last week’s spike in market volatility.
Thiel Macro, which invests the billionaire’s fortune, held a bet at the end of 2017 tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday from the San Francisco-based firm. Thiel, 50, would have reaped big profits if he continued to hold the wager -- composed of put options -- when stocks tumbled last week and the VIX soared.
Until this month, investors worldwide had earned handsome returns on as much as $2 trillion they had bet on markets remaining calm. Investors poured into the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures, an exchange-traded fund that moves opposite the VIX. Its shares more than doubled last year to close at $128.21 on Dec. 31.
Read about how Thiel is ditching San Francisco for Los Angeles
Thiel was part of the crowd, with a $404 million bet against volatility as recently as the end of 2014, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But the contrarian changed direction during last year’s second and third quarters, wagering on renewed volatility by purchasing put options on a split-adjusted 1.9 million shares of the ProShares ETF.
ETF Collapses
The options, which entitle the holder to sell the underlying shares at a set price in the future, increase in value when those underlying shares decline. Thiel Macro still held the put options on 1.9 million shares of the ETF as of Dec. 31, according to the filing. The face value of those shares was $244 million.
After closing at $121.67 a share on Feb. 1, the ETF collapsed in the ensuing days, hitting a low of $9.58 a week later. The shares covered by Thiel’s put options lost about $213 million of market value during that week.
If Thiel held onto the options, his gains would equal some portion of the $213 million decline. For instance, if the average exercise price of his options was $100 a share, and he exercised or sold the securities when the ETF was trading at about $10 a share last week, his overall gain on each ETF share would have been $90, or a gross profit of about $171 million.
Thiel has roots on Wall Street as well as Silicon Valley, having worked as a derivatives trader for a unit of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. In 1996, he set up Thiel Capital International, a hedge fund that traded futures on equity indexes, debt and foreign exchange. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel sold the online payment company to EBay Inc. in 2002 and then started Clarium Capital Management to carry out “high-conviction directional investments” based on macroeconomic trends, according to regulatory filings.
Spokesmen for Thiel and his macro firm didn’t return calls and emails seeking comment on whether they still owned the put options."
387,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Three Question Marks for the Trump Economy: Richard J. Carroll,"(Bloomberg View) -- No president is responsible for the economy, whether good or bad, in his first year in office. So when commentators this year leap to judge Donald Trump's economic record, whether based on market gyrations or the federal debt or inflation or unemployment, they should use the benchmarks from 2018, not 2017.
Let's start with where the indicators are now, and then look at the president's economic policies, to see how they give us a good indication of where the economy is going.
GDP is a decent 2.3 percent, and unemployment is a very low 4.1 percent. Though inflation rose this month more than expected, it is still a low 2.1 percent. And despite the recent volatility, the stock market is 21 percent higher than a year ago.
Some underlying factors for these numbers are reassuring, too.
Remember how some forecasters were worried that the Fed policy of quantitative easing for many years would result in substantial inflation and that it was artificially pumping up the stock market? But the surge in inflation never happened, only a minor uptick. And if the huge gains in the previous eight years were the result of QE, then the market surely would have corrected somewhere well below 20,000 long ago.
Now that the market has at least partially corrected itself, it is apparent that even the expected increase in after-tax profits as a result of the new tax law could have limited effects going forward. 
Another reassuring indicator is the poverty rate, which, at 12.7 percent, is relatively low. That figure, released in September 2017, is for 2016; the rate may well be lower when the 2017 figures come out this fall, since it has been trending downward for some time. President Trump has drawn special attention to the poverty rate for blacks. It fell from 27.4 percent to 21.8 percent from 2010 to 2016. End-of-year unemployment rates for blacks have been dropping steadily since 2009, from a high of 16.1 percent down to 7.9 percent in 2016 to 6.8 percent in 2017.
Yes, there is one pretty big exception to the good economic climate: The federal debt is at 106 percent of GDP. While Trump did not face nearly as large a deficit as Barack Obama did when he first came into office ($660 billion in 2017 as opposed to $1.4 trillion for 2009), Trump doesn't have a lot of fiscal space to work with, and even less if interest rates go up and debt servicing gobbles up a larger share of the federal budget. 
But there’s a stabilizing factor to help counter the high federal debt: the reduction of consumer debt. Household debt fell from 98 percent of GDP in 2009 to 80 percent in 2016, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. The reduction of this debt was one reason for slower-than-average growth under Obama, since it meant that people cut back on spending. But it puts consumers in a much better position to fuel growth in the near future.
An external factor that is likely to be more favorable to Trump than to Obama is the rate of global growth, which jumped from 2.5 percent in 2016 to 3.0 percent in 2017 and is projected at 3.1 percent for 2018, according to the World Bank. This helps support the U.S. economy in a number of ways, especially U.S. exports. Under Obama, global growth was below average (and had been since the mid-1990s).
A number of other measures also create a favorable start for the Trump economy, including improved energy independence and a more solid banking sector, with all large banks passing stress tests required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.
Though it's premature to draw any meaningful conclusions about Trump's economic record from any of these indicators, we can look at the policies he has pursued and assess what the likely effects are going to be. Let's focus on three areas: taxes, deregulation and trade.
Tax Policy
The tax law that went into effect this year cuts marginal rates, including the top rate, from 39.6 percent to 37 percent and the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Some deductions were capped at lower levels. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the tax cut would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt.
By itself, any tax cut, like any spending increase, will stimulate economic growth, at least temporarily. But if the cut is poorly designed or carried out in an unfavorable economic context, then it can cost more than it’s worth. 
As for the Trump tax cut, the context could not have been less favorable for five reasons.
First, the economy is near full employment at 4.1 percent, so the prospect for job gains is not that great.
Second, economic growth has already been accelerating in 2017 and early 2018 with little or no benefit from a tax cut.
Third, there is a historically high concentration of wealth at the very top tier of the population, so a tax cut that favors high-income earners, as this one does, will worsen that wealth distribution and be less effective in generating consumption.
Fourth, the high federal debt means that any cut would need to generate a great deal of taxable growth to offset the revenue losses to the treasury and reduce debt as a share of the economy. Rising debt in a full employment economy is not good.
And fifth, effective tax rates (rates actually paid) on individuals (13.5 percent) and corporations (18.6 percent) are not as excessive as statutory rates suggest.
In fact, this climate would have been much more conducive to a tax increase (at least on higher-income individuals) than a cut. The resulting debt reduction would have put the economy on a much stronger footing with greater fiscal space in the event of a downturn, space that the U.S. doesn’t currently have.
Deregulation
Trump stated at the Davos economic forum that he had exceeded his campaign promise to eliminate two regulations for every new one by removing a staggering 22 regulations for each new one. What really counts is if the right regulations are eliminated and if the effective ones are supported and properly enforced.
For example, reducing regulatory compliance costs for small banks is a good thing, something the previous administration also supported. But reducing bank capital requirements in a way that leads to taking big, ill-advised risks is not.
The same is true for environmental regulations. If rules interfere with business activity without much environmental benefit, they should be revised or eliminated. But we are seeing rules being rolled back to allow more air pollution and climate-change emissions from power plants. Combine this with increased tariffs on solar panels (a form of reregulation), and we can expect health and other quality-of-life costs down the road.
If deregulation is excessive, creating additional risk in the financial sector, and the tax cut proves ineffective, then we could find ourselves in another boom-and-bust situation like the one in the George W. Bush administration. As was the case then, the chain of events would take a few years to play out, and after a possible re-election campaign.
Trade
The trade deficit has been rising, from $521 billion in 2016 to $571 billion in 2017. If the U.S. could get a better outcome from trade deals, that would be great. But in the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, no reputable study attributes much job loss to it, and consumers would have to pay more if it is scaled back.
The biggest Trump trade move has been to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That will likely have a negative effect on the U.S. economy. Already China has moved into the space the U.S. has vacated, through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and has been negotiating for access advantages in Asian markets, particularly in Japan, over U.S. competitors.
These changes in policy will eventually have substantial effects on the economy, but it will take a few years. From an economist’s viewpoint, it’s hard to argue that such a strong shift in course was warranted -- particularly since the Obama economy produced benefits for eight years and counting.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Takata has resolved most objections to its U.S. bankruptcy: lawyer,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - A lawyer for Takata Corp's U.S. business, bankrupted by a recall of faulty air bags, indicated on Friday that the company is on the verge of receiving court approval for its reorganization and $1.6 billion sale of its non-air bag businesses.
At the start of a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, lawyer Marcia Goldstein told the court that Takata's U.S. unit had resolved nearly all objections to the reorganization.
""I would call it a largely consensual plan,"" Goldstein, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges lawyer for Takata's U.S. unit, said.
The judge will hear from some objectors before reaching any decision. 
Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, filed for bankruptcy last year in the wake of the largest automotive recall in history. The company's air bags inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments. They have been linked to hundreds of injuries and at least 22 deaths.
As part of the company's bankruptcy plan, automakers are contributing between $80 million and $130 million to help compensate those injured by Takata air bag inflators.
That agreement removed a major obstacle to the plan of reorganization by Takata's U.S. unit and helps ensure the sale of Takata's non-air bag inflator businesses to Key Safety Systems, a unit of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp.
Goldstein said that the U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, plans to complete its review of the sale by March 26. 
To accommodate the CFIUS review, the U.S. Department of Justice extended to April 13 from Feb 27 its deadline for Takata to meet its obligations under a plea agreement, Goldstein told the court.
The plea agreement reached early last year requires Takata to provide a $850 million restitution fund for automakers, which have been saddled with tens of billions of dollars in recall-related costs, and $125 million for injured drivers.
The sale to Key Safety Systems will help provide the funds for the plea agreement.

A reorganized Takata will continue to provide automakers with replacement kits as tens of millions of recalled air bag inflators have yet to be replaced.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 11:38AM ET</span>","After weeks in lockstep, stocks and bonds go their separate ways","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks seem to have finally stopped worrying about their bond market cousins.
The last few weeks' turbulence on world equity markets was triggered largely by a slide in U.S. Treasuries that saw 10-year borrowing costs surge towards 3 percent for the first time in four years.
And until this week, wherever bonds went, equity was sure to follow.
But when bond market angst went up another notch following forecast-topping U.S. inflation data, stocks suddenly ignored their fixed-income counterparts and staged an extraordinary comeback, bringing them back into the black for the year.
In fact, MSCI's main gauge of world stocks was set on Friday to post its best weekly performance since late 2011. (MIWD00000PUS)
Rising bond yields typically price in rising inflation and, ultimately, interest rates. And a rising interest rate environment is often assumed to be negative for stocks, as higher borrowing costs slow the economy and earnings growth and tempt portfolio managers to switch back to bonds from equity. 
But economists argue that historically, stocks and bond yields have often moved in tandem and that this is typical in a fast-growing economy. Higher growth and inflation keep investors wary of fixed income, support consumption by eroding household debt in real terms and increase corporate pricing power and margins.
Here are three charts that may shed light on recent market moves:
1) BONDS FROM MARS, STOCKS FROM VENUS 
After hitting record highs, world stocks sold off on Feb. 2, following higher than expected wage data in the United States.
The data stoked fears of a wage-driven pickup in inflation, which led to a selloff lasting for a week. This week however, stocks rebounded strongly in tandem with a rise in bond yields.

2) THE LONG VIEW
As the following graphic shows, since the late 1990s, stocks and bonds have tended to move in lockstep over the long-term, particularly during periods of economic growth.
The long view: stocks vs. bonds - http://reut.rs/2o2J7rk 
3) EQUITY RISK PREMIUM FADES 
Equity risk premium is a measure of the extent to which investors are compensated for investing in equities versus bonds. It is calculated by taking the difference between the earnings yield (inverse of the P/E ratio) of a stock or stock index, and a bond yield. The size of the difference indicates how much more they are being compensated for taking on the additional risk of investing in stocks. The recent climb in bond yields has eaten away at this premium, thus making stocks less desirable versus bonds.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 11:07AM ET</span>","Coca-Cola sales beat on strong sales of vitamin water, coffee","By Sangameswaran S
(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Friday as it sold more teas, coffees and vitamin water, offsetting sluggish sales of fizzy drinks, sending its shares up as much as 2 percent.
Coke also said it planned to use cash it held overseas and savings generated from the U.S. corporate tax rate changes to reduce its debt by $7 billion, making it the latest company to take advantage of the new tax law to bolster its balance sheet.
For the fourth quarter, however, the company took a $3.6 billion charge related to the tax law, resulting in a net loss compared with a profit a year earlier.
Coke and rival PepsiCo (O:PEP) have been struggling with lower sales of their sugary sodas as consumers shift to healthier drinks. Earlier this week, Pepsi also reported weak quarterly sales of sodas and sugary drinks.
To stem the decline, Coke relaunched its iconic low-calorie Diet Coke in four new flavors - ginger-lime, feisty cherry, blood orange and twisted mango - earlier this year, and has focused on its non-fizzy beverages such as Georgia coffee and Glaceau vitamin water.
Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the new flavors and packaging were a step in the right direction and that sales of Coke Zero Sugar were picking up following a relaunch.
Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier due to ongoing efforts to refranchise its bottling operations, but beat the average analyst estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Global volume growth remained unchanged even as North America volumes increased 1 percent.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnnie Herzog said flat unit case volume growth was a concern but positive momentum in many international markets was encouraging.
The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a $3.6 billion charge related to the new tax law. A year earlier the company had posted a profit of $550 million, or 13 cents per share. 
On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 39 cents, beating analysts' average estimate of 38 cents.

For 2018, the Coke said it expects organic revenue to grow 4 percent and adjusted earnings per share to grow between 8 and 10 percent.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Mining sector unloved as investors find it hard to trust,"By Clara Denina and Barbara Lewis
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are shunning the mining sector, data from Thomson Reuters shows, as they struggle to forget the string of multi-billion dollar takeovers and expensive development projects that left them empty handed. 
A decade-long commodity boom coincided with years of economic growth when China took off, but when the global economy slowed, so did the market for commodities from oil to copper. 
Data shows that two years after the worst of the raw materials slump is over, investors are still not ready to pour in fresh funds despite a price rally. 
The mining sector (FTNMX1770) led the FTSE higher in 2016 as it rebounded from the previous year's deep price crash, but it is still well below levels seen in 2011. 
Thomson Reuters data shows mining funds shrank slightly last year after a surge in 2016.
Returns of 16 UK-domiciled natural resources funds fell 2 percent last year after a 74 percent increase in 2016. Assets under management fell to 3.78 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) last year from 3.81 billion in 2016. 
""It seems that investment in mining companies has gone from sector-specific funds to generalist and more diversified funds. After the good bounce in 2016 people may have decided to take their money out of sector specific funds,"" Investec Asset Management portfolio manager Hanré Rossouw said.
Rossouw said there was a general lack of trust in mining management because of lingering concerns they ""will just do the same as they've done in the previous supercycle in not returning cash to shareholders and making poor capital allocation decisions"".
Mining more than other sectors is prone to boom and bust because of its exposure to commodity price movements and its need to spend large amounts of capital developing assets over long periods before they generate returns.
In boom years, miners have notoriously overpaid by billions to acquire assets in bidding wars.
A Bank of America-Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers published in February found European investors were more overweight on cyclical sectors such as autos, construction and oil and gas but were 24 percent underweight on basic resources, including mining. 
Portfolio managers usually make investments underweight when they believe they will underperform compared to the other sectors in which they invest. 
The market capitalization and enterprise value of the big miners is far below the peaks of 2012 when M&A deals were done at unsustainably high prices.
The correction now reflects wariness that another boom will lead to bust, as well as concerns about sustainability as miners continue to see profits in carbon-intensive coal and operate in countries of high risk.
Jonathan Miller, head of UK manager research at Morningstar, said the miners had attracted attention in the early 2000s in line with interest in emerging market growth, but were now stuck in the ""unloved camp"" as investors bearing the memory of the financial markets crash avoided the most highly cyclical stocks.
""The sector has been in outflow mode for six out of the last seven years, with the only positive in this period being 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) of net inflows in 2016,"" he said.
SHARE BUYBACKS
Miners, which will continue reporting results next week, have started to reward their long-suffering shareholders. 
 Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) (AX:RIO) has carried out buybacks and last week announced record dividends, while BHP Billiton (L:BLT) (AX:BHP) has not carried out a buyback since 2011, but last August announced a record dividend.
 Anglo American  (L:AAL) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN), which scrapped dividends at the height of the crash, have reinstated them.
For the risk-averse there are warning signs the dividends may not endure.
As Glencore regained confidence last year, it embarked on a bidding war to buy coal assets and has its eye on expanding its agriculture assets.
Glencore and all the other big miners, however, promise they will not get carried away.
Rio Tinto's Chief Financial Officer Chris Lynch told Reuters the company was delivering ""a great shareholder return story"".
""I don't think you're going to find many people in my position who are going to say we are overvalued,"" he added. ""We are delivering through the cycle.""

Directors considered recent progress toward new targets when setting Corbat's pay, according to a public filing on Friday.
A year earlier, Corbat's annual compensation was cut 6 percent to $15.5 million after the bank missed financial performance targets and saw one-third of its voting shareholders disapprove of his prior pay.
After that vote, the company made changes to its pay plan, which was then endorsed by 97 percent of voting shareholders at its annual meeting in April.
In July, Citigroup recast targets set in 2013 as new goals for 2020.
In 2017, Citigroup stock jumped 25 percent and its profit rose 4 percent, excluding a charge for the impact of the U.S. tax law change on the value of its deferred tax assets.
Corbat, 57, has been CEO since 2012. Citigroup is the fourth biggest U.S. bank by assets. 
The change in Corbat's pay compares with annual raises of 5 to 20 percent for some other Wall Street executives. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) the biggest U.S. bank, was paid $29.5 million, a 5.4 percent increase.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) CEO James Gorman's compensation was raised 20 percent to $27 million.
Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) received a 9 percent raise to $22 million, the company said on Friday. Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan was paid $23 million, up 15 percent.
Citigroup made additional disclosures on Friday which indicate that other senior executives received approximately these amounts of compensation in 2017:
James Forese, president and chief executive of Citi's Institutional Clients Group received $20 million, up 31 percent from 2016.
John Gerspach, chief financial officer, got $11 million, up 22 percent.
Stephen Bird, chief executive of global consumer banking, received $10.5 million, up 17 percent.

Jane Fraser, chief executive for Latin America, received $8.5 million, up 8 percent.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 08:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Walmart in talks to buy more than 40 percent of India's Flipkart - sources,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) is in talks to buy a stake of more than 40 percent in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, a direct challenge to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) in Asia's third-largest economy, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
In what would be one of its biggest overseas deals, the U.S. retailer is looking at buying new and existing shares in Flipkart and due diligence is likely to begin as early as next week, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks were private.
Terms under discussion were not immediately available, but Flipkart would be valued at more than the $12 billion figure given when Japan's SoftBank Group Corp's (T:9984) Vision Fund took roughly a fifth of the firm last year for $2.5 billion, they added.
A spokesman for Flipkart said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. An India-based representative for Walmart declined to comment.
A deal with Walmart would give Flipkart much-needed muscle in its fight against Amazon, which has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands aggressively, including into online grocery deliveries, which analysts tip as the next big battleground for the country's e-commerce sector.
Besides its own e-commerce site, Flipkart owns fashion portals Myntra and Jabong, and controls nearly 40 percent of India's online retail, ahead of Amazon, according to estimates by research firm Forrester. It is also looking into expanding into grocery deliveries.
""Walmart's expertise in selling groceries and low-cost apparel could help Flipkart remain ahead in India's e-commerce market,"" said Satish Meena, senior analyst at Forrester.
For Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, a deal would open a new front in its efforts to take on Amazon, giving the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has estimated will rapidly grow to be worth $200 billion in a decade.
It would be part of a huge e-commerce push that has seen Walmart acquire a slew of start-ups including paying roughly $3 billion for online retailer Jet.com. Last month it also said it was partnering with Japan's  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755) in online grocery deliveries.
""As large as they are, Amazon has eaten away a significant chunk of their revenues and I think... they view India as the largest market possibly for this (taking on Amazon),"" one of the sources said.
Walmart has for years tried to enter India but has remained confined to a 'cash-and-carry' wholesale business amid tough restrictions on foreign investment. It currently operates 21 such stores in India.
Walmart's push into e-commerce comes as Amazon has embraced offline retail, with an affiliate of the Seattle-based company picking up a $27.6 million stake in Indian retailer Shopper's Stop Ltd (NS:SHOP).
In the United States, Amazon also bought high-end grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM) for $13.7 billion last year.
Former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 in India's tech hub of Bengaluru.
Like Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos, they began by selling books, but have diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones such as China's Xiaomi and Motorola (NYSE:MSI) through exclusive flash sales, and now compete with Amazon on almost all product categories.

Flipkart's success has attracted a bevy of deep pocketed and tech-savvy investors including U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), online marketplace eBay Inc (O:EBAY) and software giant  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).

Shares of the world's biggest soup maker fell 2.1 percent to $46.70 in premarket trading.
Fewer orders from Walmart Inc (N:WMT) have weighed on Campbell's earnings in the reported quarter and could be a major reason for a decline in sales of canned soups in the U.S., RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a pre-earnings note.
Organic sales in the company's Americas simple meals and beverages unit, which make canned soups and V8 juices, fell 4 percent.
Still, the company reported net sales that beat estimates marginally helped by a rise in demand for its Pepperidge Farm Snacks.
Net earnings attributable to the company rose to $285 million, or 95 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Jan. 28, from $101 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.
The reported quarter benefited from a $124 million gain related to the overhaul of the U.S. tax code.
Excluding items, the company earned $1 per share on net sales of $2.18 billion.
Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 81 cents per share on revenue of $2.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

427,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>",Rising Yields Are Hurting One of 2017's Top Portfolio Blueprints,"(Bloomberg) -- Rising bond yields have taken the wind out of one of 2017’s most successful fund strategies.
So-called balanced portfolios, the quintessential strategy of investing 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds, have gone from hero to zero this year after debt yields surged and equities slumped. After posting their best performance in decades last year, U.S. funds using such a methodology have dropped 7.3 percent since Jan. 26, while European and Japanese peers lost 5.9 percent and 7.2 percent respectively, according to Goldman Sachs.
Investor fears over rising inflation forced a sharp correction in equity markets last week and triggered a spike in volatility, while government bond yields both sides of the Atlantic have climbed to multi-year highs in the face of tightening central bank monetary policy. That is in contrast to last year, where stocks rallied amid an improving economic backdrop and inflation remaining anchored -- known as a “Goldilocks” scenario.
“In 2017 a balanced 60 percent stock/40 percent bond portfolio had one of the strongest risk-adjusted returns since the 1960s as bonds and equities went up together, with very low volatility,” Goldman strategists led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann wrote in a note to clients dated Feb. 15. “But the faster-than-expected increases in inflation and rising uncertainty of inflation have challenged the Goldilocks narrative, resulting in a material pick-up in rates volatility, which has spilled over to equities.”
Still, the U.S. bank argues that fading concerns on inflation and better-than-expected growth could create a more risk-friendly narrative for investors, recommending that they overweight equities and commodities, and underweight government bonds."
428,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 07:55AM ET</span>",Backstory: Warren Buffett's Valentine's Day surprise for investors,"By Lauren Young
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett had a Valentine’s Day surprise for investors in Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA).    
A regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), known as a 13F, showed that Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) took a stake in the generic drugmaker in the fourth quarter of 2017. The news pushed Teva shares up more than 10 percent on Feb. 14. 
Hedge funds are notably hush hush about their portfolio holdings. Quarterly disclosures offer a look at what influential money managers are buying and selling. 
The 13F filings are published on the SEC’s website 45 days after the end of each quarter. Once they land, the Reuters stocks team in Bangalore pulls the data into an excel spreadsheet. Working with our investments team in New York, they look for quarterly changes in stock holdings as well as new positions. 
While holdings in bigger companies are headline-worthy, we also watch for positions of more than 20 percent in small or mid-cap companies. It is also news when a hedge fund unwinds an important stake.  
Analyzing what the “smart money” is doing allows us to spot investment themes and trends. For example, in late 2017 big hedge funds made bets on companies poised to take advantage of rising wages and prices. 
Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn added 13 new positions in consumer discretionary companies, including stakes in amusement park company SeaWorld Entertainment Inc (N:SEAS), photo printing service  Shutterfly  Inc (O:SFLY) and department store  Nordstrom Inc . (N:JWN).
Since 13F disclosures come more than a month after the end of quarter, they may not reflect current positions at actively traded hedge funds. But, for more traditional buy-and-hold investors like Buffett, the filings shed a light on investment strategy. 
In addition to Teva, Buffett bought more shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in the fourth quarter and sold most of International Business Machines (N:IBM).
“There is value in tracking 13Fs,” says Jennifer Ablan, U.S. Investments editor. ""It's one the few documents we have that details what the Big Money is doing in the stock market.""

LONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A consortium of infrastructure funds at Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Macquarie (AX:MQG) is seen as the front runner in the sale of European bulk port terminal operator HES International, worth around 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), industry sources said. 
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is mandated to sell the asset, two sources, whose organizations had considered bidding for it, said. They added that the expectation Goldman Sachs and Macquarie would win put off some prospective bidders. 
The sources, both in the infrastructure investing industry, said the growth projections provided by the company were too aggressive. Final bids and a winner were expected in mid-March. 
Another source said “less than a handful” of bidders remain, but none had emerged as a clear favorite.
HES, owned by energy and power-focused private investment firm Riverstone and private equity firm Carlyle (O:CG), delivers around 100 million euros in earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the two sources said, estimating it would achieve an enterprise multiple in the 20s times EBITDA.
Riverstone, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Macquarie and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
HES provides transshipment, storage, blending and processing services of dry bulk and liquid bulk products at 19 sites across eight countries, with more than 1,350 staff. A spokeswoman for the company could not immediately comment.
Separately, Brookfield Asset Management, Antin Infrastructure Partners and Arcus Infrastructure Partners are selling container port operator Euroports.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 06:35AM ET</span>","World shares set for best week since 2011, dollar hits lowest since 2014","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were set to post their best week of gains in six years on Friday after two consecutive weeks spent in the red, shrugging off a rise in global borrowing costs while the dollar hit its lowest level since 2014.
The MSCI world index of stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.4 percent after European bourses opened. (MIWD00000PUS) After suffering its biggest weekly drop since August 2015 last week, this week's recovery puts the index on track for its best weekly showing since early December 2011.
The index has now reclaimed more than half of the 10.7 percent plunge from a record intraday high on Jan. 29 to a four-month intraday low a week ago.
Investors have been puzzled at this week's quick rebound in stock markets, which has also coincided with a rise in bond yields on evidence that inflation is starting to creep up globally.
The argument most commonly offered by economists has been that historically, it's not unusual for stocks and bond market borrowing costs to rise in tandem with a rapidly expanding economy.
""For me it's really a question of maybe. Markets are taking a look at the inflationary outlook and saying OK, maybe rates are going up and maybe the economy will compensate for that,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. 
""That might change if we move to 3 percent on the 10-year (Treasury).""
The global rise in borrowing costs has been led by the U.S. 10-year Treasury, which hit a four-year high of 2.944 percent this week. It last stood at 2.8932 percent. (US10YT=RR)
Yields across the euro area were mostly steady, although Germany's benchmark bund yield was within sight of 2-1/2 year highs and set for its biggest weekly rise in eight weeks. (DE10YT=RR) 
Investors were also watching for a sovereign debt rating on Greece from Fitch Ratings, set for release later in the day.
European shares were set to chalk up healthy weekly gains, snapping a three-week losing streak as earnings updates continued to impress, and volatility and jitters over rising inflation eased. Among country benchmarks, the UK's FTSE (FTSE) was up 0.6 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) added 0.8 percent, while Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) outperformed, up 1.2 percent.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.4 percent, though many Asian markets were closed on Friday for the Lunar New year.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 1.2 percent, with investors relieved to see the government appoint Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for another term, suggesting the central bank will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus program.
The pan-European benchmark (STOXX) is up 3 percent so far this week, set for its best week since December 2016, but still down around 6 percent from the 2-1/2-year peak it hit in January.
Some put the rebound in equities down to investors being reassured by a fall in the VIX (VIX) index - a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"". The index dropped below 20 for the first time since its spike to a 2-1/2-year high of 50.3 last week, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who bet equity markets would be stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation.
DOLLAR IN THE DUMPS
Extending the previous day's losses, the dollar's index against a group of six major currencies fell to 88.253 (DXY), the lowest since December 2014. The index was on track to lose around 2 percent on the week in its largest decline since February 2016.
There is no strong consensus yet on what is driving the dollar's persistent weakness, especially in light of rising yields. Some say it simply reflects a return of risk appetite and a shift to higher-yielding currencies, including many emerging market ones.
But others cite concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy as well as talk that foreign central banks may be reallocating their reserves out of the dollar.
There are also worries President Donald Trump's tax cuts and fiscal spending could stoke inflation and erode the value of the dollar.
""His protectionist policies could also fan inflation. Markets appear to have calmed down for now but fundamentally it is different from last year,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
""You could say that right now, rather than stocks rising around the world, it is the dollar falling against almost everything,"" he added.
Oil prices maintained this week's gains, with U.S crude futures trading at (CLc1) $61.74 per barrel, up 4.1 percent so far this week. Brent crude traded at $64.77 <.LcOc1>

Elsewhere, virtual currency bitcoin recovered the $10,000 mark for the first time in two weeks (BTC=BTSP), gaining more than 70 percent from its near three-month low of $5,920.7.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 06:03AM ET</span>",Lost in translation? GM plant shutdown shocks South Korea,"By Hyunjoo Jin, Ju-min Park and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - Only weeks into a new job heading General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's international operations, Barry Engle flew into a frigid South Korea in January and held a series of meetings with government officials to discuss the future of GM's loss-making local unit.
In what they thought were meet-and-greet introductions, senior officials agreed to work with the global automaker on problems at GM Korea, according to South Korean officials with direct knowledge of the meetings. 
Last week, Engle made another visit, meeting with the head of state-run Korea Development Bank, which owns 17 percent of GM Korea. Bank and government officials said Engle asked for financial support and in return, KDB suggested an audit before it would consider committing any fresh funding. 
South Korea officials said they left reassured they were making progress working through issues, albeit slowly.
Then came the bombshell. 
On Tuesday morning, GM announced it would shut its Gunsan plant, which employs 2,000, and decide the future of the remaining three other Korean plants within weeks. 
""GM only talked about the difficult situation they were in, and asked for our help, but did not say a word about the closure before. It was a shock to us,"" a South Korean government official said.
The discord and lack of communications point to rocky negotiations ahead as South Korea seeks to prevent further job losses and provide support for a critical part of its manufacturing sector while avoiding criticism for spending tax payers' money to support private industry. 
The tensions also come at a difficult time for U.S.-South Korean relations given U.S. President Donald Trump’s determination to renegotiate the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Any undermining of the Seoul-Washington relationship could also factor against efforts to pressure North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. 
""DEEPLY ROOTED DISTRUST"" 
The government official and another source said GM informed Seoul about the decision in a phone call only the evening before its announcement.
The sources declined to be identified because of the sensitive ongoing nature of the matter.
A GM Korea spokesman confirmed the company notified the government about Gunsan closure on Monday, but said the matter had been already discussed and approved by the board, including board members nominated by KDB, last week.
“We plan to seek full support from government and other stakeholders about our turnaround plan,” he said. 
KDB declined to comment. 
South Korea's government said it deeply regretted GM's unilateral decision and any aid would depend on GM's new investment into its Korean operations.
GM said it will invest if it is successful in ""working with our stakeholders to restructure and get to a viable cost structure"". 
""There is deep rooted distrust about GM among government officials. Trust has collapsed a long time ago,"" a person familiar with the South Korean government's thinking said. 
KDB believes GM Korea has not shared sufficient information about its finances or the cause of its mounting losses, this person added. 
The GM Korea spokesman said it will explain its ""transparent practice"" to the government during upcoming discussions. 
GLOBAL WINDS OF CHANGE
South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak. 
But the automaker's decisions to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe.
In December 2013, GM announced its decision to pull Chevrolet out of Europe. Last year, GM agreed to sell its Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe to PSA Group 
GM Korea, which South Korea's trade ministry says directly employs nearly 16,000 workers and supports another 140,000 jobs in its supply chain, posted a total of 1.9 trillion won ($1.8 billion) in net losses between 2014 and 2016. 
A further complication is pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to address the U.S. trade imbalance with South Korea and bring manufacturing back to the United States. 
""Trump is putting pressure on GM to shift production to U.S. It is Government Motors, not General Motors,"" the person said. 
However, the GM Korea spokesman said: ""The Gunsan plant announcement is related to our need to restructure our business in South Korea,"" and is not being done for political reasons. 
Sources familiar with GM’s future planning say the company’s global production strategy is still fluid, but GM could shift production out of Korea to an existing plant in another country.
WORST TIMING
GM's announcement of the Gunsan plant shutdown and launch of voluntary redundancy plans couldn't have come at a worse time.
Many salaried South Koreans get bonuses and gifts to celebrate Friday's Lunar New Year holiday. 
South Korean officials are also in the middle of hosting the Winter Olympic Games and have been focused lowering tensions with North Korea, which sent a high level delegation last week.
A Detroit-based source at GM told Reuters the timing of the announcement was dictated by urgency of the matter as its 2018 wage negotiations with South Korean workers have begun. Top management decided the time had come to put a lid on the losses, starting with closure of the Gunsan plant, the person said.
GM's approach has prompted speculation in South Korea that the automaker is seeking to maximize pressure on President Moon Jae-in's administration, which has touted job creation as its top economic policy. 
""Bail out or not, the decision will be inevitably a political one,"" said Yun Chang-hyun, an economics professor at Seoul National University. 
""Politicians and lawmakers representing regions affected will come forward to push the government to help the company. But a painkiller won’t do, what GM needs is a major surgery.""
Hong Young-pyo, a ruling party lawmaker from Bupyeong where GM Korea's biggest factory is based, said he had met Angle early this month, and he did not hear about the shutdown. 
“Of course, I was surprised,” he said. “Engle has repeatedly said they are not considering withdrawing from the country. But he said GM Korea needs government help and restructuring to normalize its operations.”
Now, the outlook is uncertain, Hong said.
""We should prepare for the possibility of GM’s exit. I see a 50 percent chance of GM’s complete withdrawal,"" Hong said. 
Shareholder KDB, meanwhile, said it has lost a key bargaining chip. 
KDB said a veto power on strategic decisions it held as part of an agreement with GM expired last October, leaving South Korea with few legal options if GM wants to pull out of the country. 
""We have to find out first how sustainable GM Korea is. We can’t just pour taxpayers money as a ransom to keep GM from leaving the country,"" one government official said.
In Gunsan at least, GM Korea workers are downbeat.

""Eventually the closure has become a reality,"" said Kim Gyo-myoung, a 58-year-old GM worker. ""Even if the government injects funds, it probably won’t be the amount that satisfies GM. I can’t see a breakthrough.""

It’s the question brought into focus by last week’s equity market rout, partly sparked by the recent sharp move upward in U.S. government bond yields, and reiterated Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices data pushed them higher again. As equity traders around the globe wake up to the prospect of higher inflation and interest rates -- and adjust to a higher yield range -- many are seeking the best trades to capitalize on movements in the bond market.
“We have clearly seen a shift in expectations on monetary policy and global rates over recent months,” said Mahmood Noorani, the founder of Quant Insight, whose past experience includes roles at BlueCrest Capital Management and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). “The challenge for equity investors is to identify stocks that are sensitive to these macro shifts.”

RBC
Strategists at RBC Capital Markets note that since the financial crisis, value stocks have outperformed when the 10-year yield is on the rise, while growth has won when yields are falling. That relationship has broken down in recent months, but may return, according to RBC’s Lori Calvasina. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are among banks predicting a rebound in the value style.
Energy, materials and financials shares are positively correlated with 10-year yields and inflation expectations, suggesting they should lead in a rising rate environment, RBC says.
HSBC
While equity traders are scrambling to find ways of benefiting from rising yields, HSBC strategists are looking to do the opposite. The bank is recommending that European investors consider buying equities poised to benefit from falling bond yields, based on its view that the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will peak around the end of the first quarter and weaken to 2.3 percent by year-end.
Sectors that stand to gain from falling yields are growth shares such as luxury goods and ones with higher dividend yields like utilities and energy. HSBC has an overweight position on those in Europe, while it’s been cutting its position in financials, where it still holds a modest overweight, but says the yields environment will be a headwind.
UBS
U.K. grocer  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Plc is among UBS’s top single-stock picks, as it’s relatively low-beta and has historically demonstrated limited exposure to 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, the bank’s strategists wrote in a note. Overall, UBS’s wealth-management unit does not believe yields will rise to levels that will prevent equities moving higher in the next six months.

439,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 06:02AM ET</span>",Japan Funds Waiting for Powell Before Return to Treasuries,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury yields may be a lot higher than can be found in Japan, but Japanese investors beset by a strengthening currency are looking for some additional inducements before ramping up their purchases.
First off, potential buyers want to hear from newly installed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who’s scheduled to testify on the economy at Congress Feb. 28. After stronger-than-anticipated U.S. wage and inflation data in recent weeks, the key questions are what’s his take on the outlook for monetary tightening, and what does he make of the jump of almost a percentage point in the 10-year yield since September.
""Investors will be reluctant to take positions until Fed Chairman Powell’s testimony,” said Kenta Inoue, a senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. in Tokyo. ""There is a vague concern about how the Fed would communicate with the market under the new leadership.""
Recent data back up that hypothesis:
The speed of the recent move up in U.S. yields has caught many by surprise. And accompanied by a tumble in the dollar that’s made it more costly for Japanese investors to hedge foreign-exchange risks, it’s raised the bar for Japan-based buyers. The yen has climbed 6.6 percent this year. It strengthened past the 106-per dollar level on Friday for the first time since November 2016, and was up 0.4 percent at 105.70 as of 2:06 p.m. in Tokyo.
The question for Japan-based investors is ""how do you balance the attractive yield with the cost of hedging if you expect the dollar to weaken,"" said Jean Medecin, a member of the investment committee at French asset manager Carmignac Gestion SA.
The 10-year Treasury yield probably needs to hit at least 3 percent to spur the appetite of Japanese funds, a number of market participants said.
""Japanese investors are expected to buy if the 10-year bond yield rises to 3 percent and markets stabilize after the recent selloff in global shares,"" said Jun Kato, chief market analyst at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
Shuichi Ohsaki, chief rates strategist for Japan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, had much the same take, while adding that some investors may want to hold off further, until the Japanese financial year begins on April 1.
Before that comes Powell’s testimony in what’s referred to as Humphrey-Hawkins hearings at House and Senate committees, followed by the Federal Reserve’s March 20-21 policy meeting that includes a press conference with the chairman.
Given the danger that Trump administration’s fiscal policies pose for bond yields, investors will be watching whether Powell can convince that inflation and market volatility are under control, Kato at Shinkin said.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 05:39AM ET</span>",Dashed hopes for Mexico oil boom leave Gulf Coast hotels idle,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - When a Mexican real estate investment trust bought four hotels along the country's Gulf coast operating under the Marriott, Quality Inn and Fiesta Inn brands, it expected the government's recent energy reform to attract droves of oil executives, engineers and technicians.
Instead, FibraHotel's properties in Ciudad del Carmen and Villahermosa and an earlier purchase in Coatzacoalcos, like many along the Gulf, are pinched for guests.
President Enrique Pena Nieto's 2013-14 legislative overhaul of the energy sector, which broke a 75-year monopoly by state oil firm Pemex, had been expected to jumpstart the economy and revive the declining oil industry. It coincided, however, with a global collapse in oil prices that muted investors' interest.
Prices are now rebounding, and the government forecasts that some of the world's largest oil companies will ultimately invest about $150 billion in Mexico if they succeed in extraction efforts. But experts say the promised growth could still be several years coming.
In the hardest-hit oil towns, hotel occupancy rates have fallen by as much as half, said real estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle, with some in the region operating with barely a third of their rooms full.
Hotels in Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz state registered 36 percent occupancy last year. The state's main port, Veracruz, and the neighboring Boca del Rio area fared a little better with 43 percent, as did Villahermosa in neighboring Tabasco state. 
That is well below the booming rates seen last year in tourist hotspots such as Cancun and Riviera Maya, the tourism ministry says, and lower than automobile manufacturing hubs such as Guadalajara and Leon.
""It's been weaker than in past years,"" said Guillermo Bravo, head of FibraHotel's corporate development. He declined to give occupancy figures for the Gulf Coast properties the company bought in 2012 and 2015. But he said they are below the average for the rest of its portfolio, which stretches across more than two dozen Mexican states.
Now, the company says its best option is to wait. 
""It wouldn't be a good moment to sell,"" Bravo said.
SLASHING COSTS 
Hotels typically need 40 percent occupancy to break even, according to Christian Lega, a director of tourism at real estate services firm CBRE Hotels. While hotel owners and operators on the Gulf were reluctant to provide specific figures, several acknowledged the falling occupancy. 
A source familiar with Hyatt Place in Ciudad del Carmen, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the property is about a third full and recently closed some of its rooms.
Hyatt declined to provide current data, but said Ciudad del Carmen hotels had 80 percent occupancy in 2014. That is in line with other cities in the area in the years before oil prices plummeted.
Hoteles City Express, which says 13 percent of its Mexico portfolio is largely reliant on the energy industry, has seen its Gulf Coast occupancy rates slip since 2015. Spokeswoman Blanca Herrera said the company is targeting other business sectors and leisure travelers in the area.
Hotels are faced with slashing costs to break even and, in the most dire cases, could risk losing partnerships with prestigious brands such as Hyatt, Marriott and Holiday Inn, Lega said.
Hotel brands typically agree to emblazon their names on properties if they expect 60 percent occupancy, Lega said. Lower levels can pose a risk to their reputations.
Hotels in major oil towns are operating well below that level, according to tourism ministry data compiled by Jones Lang LaSalle.
""They thought the energy reform would generate investment much sooner,"" Lega said. 
FibraHotel recently changed one of its Ciudad del Carmen sites from a Courtyard Marriott to a Fiesta Inn, matching the brand of its other nearby properties.
""Running both hotels under one operator gave us more synergies and economies of scale,"" Bravo said, adding that it was not Marriott's decision. 
A spokesperson for Marriott International Inc did not respond to a request for comment. 
Although many in the sector are hopeful that hotels will again fill with oil workers as firms that won contracts in Mexico's early auctions begin deploying staff, Gulf Coast hoteliers worry travelers will be deterred by the country's worst ever surge in violent crime. 
""There's the perception that we're always in fear,"" said Esteban Enriquez Espana, president of the Coatzacoalcos hotel and motel association in Veracruz, the state with the fifth highest number of murders in Mexico last year. 

""It's a problem that's gotten out of control,"" he said.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 05:16AM ET</span>",Audi chairman rubbishes report of CEO Stadler ouster,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Audi (DE:NSUG) Chairman Matthias Mueller appealed to workers to ignore a media report that Chief Executive Rupert Stadler was about to be ousted, hoping to quell another outbreak of unrest at the diesel scandal-hit Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group.
German tabloid Bild reported on its front page on Friday that Stadler would leave in April for his mishandling of the diesel-emissions affair, in which Audi played a prominent role, but would switch to a new role as VW group finance chief.
In a message to Audi staff, Mueller, who is also CEO of parent company Volkswagen, said the luxury carmaker needed the full concentration of management and workers to overcome its current challenges under Stadler's ""proven leadership"".
Audi's headquarters were searched last week by German prosecutors widening their inquiry into the manipulation of diesel-emissions tests, which was exposed by U.S. authorities in September 2015 and has plagued VW ever since.
""Please pay no attention to the personnel speculation spread by the media, which lacks any foundation,"" Mueller said in the message sent to Reuters by email.
Stadler ran finance at Audi for four years before becoming CEO in 2007. He was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of Volkswagen's controlling clan who was ousted in 2016.
Sources close to Audi said there had been no discussion on the supervisory board about replacing Stadler. The controlling panels at Audi and parent VW are due to hold separate regular meetings next week.
 Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p), the group through which the billionaire Porsche and Piech families control their majority stake in VW, declined comment.
A senior source close to VW told Reuters last week that Stadler still had the backing of the Porsche-Piech clan.
Audi, VW's main profit contributor, did not admit to using illicit emissions control devices in the United States until November 2015, two months after the scandal at parent VW was revealed.

But Audi developed the bigger 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models that in 2015 were found to be equipped with illicit software and to exceed U.S. emissions limits.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Unpublished data shows India's fraud problems extend far beyond PNB,"By Aditi Shah and Devidutta Tripathy
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Investors may have been shocked when one of India's biggest banks disclosed a $1.77 billion fraud by a billionaire jeweler, but the central bank has recorded data that shows the problem runs far deeper and wider. 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, which a Reuters reporter obtained through a right-to-information request, shows state-run banks have reported 8,670 ""loan fraud"" cases totaling 612.6 billion rupees ($9.58 billion) over the last five financial years up to March 31, 2017.
In India, loan frauds typically refer to cases where the borrower intentionally tries to deceive the lending bank and does not repay the loan.
The figures expose the magnitude of the problem in a banking sector already under pressure after years of poor lending practices. Bad loans surged to a record peak of nearly $149 billion last year.
Bank loan frauds have steadily increased as well, reaching 176.34 billion rupees in the latest financial year from 63.57 billion rupees in 2012-13, according to the data, which doesn't include the PNB case.
Punjab National Bank, India's second-largest state lender, said on Wednesday two junior officers at a single branch had illegally steered $1.77 billion in fraudulent loans to companies, most of them controlled by billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi. It was India's biggest fraud ever.
""This might be the tip of the iceberg or the middle, and that is the worry,"" said Pratibha Jain, partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates, who advises on bankruptcy cases.
""The fact is we don't know what else is out there."" 
BANK DISCLOSURES 
The RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in June 2017 the central bank, in its Financial Stability Report, called frauds in banks and financial institutions ""one of the emerging risks to the financial sector"".
""In a number of large value frauds, serious gaps in credit underwriting standards were evident,"" the RBI said, adding that some of the gaps include lack of continuous monitoring of cash flows and cash profits, diversion of funds, double financing and general credit governance issues in banks. 
The RBI has been commended for forcing Indian banks to fully disclose its bad loans, speed up their recovery, and stop hiding fraud cases as non-performing assets. 
Yet to some critics, the RBI has, at the same time, been too guarded about publicly sharing data on loan defaults or fraudulent loans. This is partly due to legal constraints on disclosing individual cases and worries investors would pummel the affected banks, making loan recovery even harder.
In fact, the numbers of loan fraud cases across India could be even higher since they only include cases reported to the RBI, which involve only loans of 100,000 rupees or more.
In its right-to-information request, Reuters sought data from 20 of India's 21 state-run lenders and obtained 15 replies.
PNB topped the list with 389 cases totaling 65.62 billion rupees ($1.03 billion) over the last five financial years, in terms of the total amounts involved.
Reuters was unable to obtain a detailed breakdown on the exact nature and method of the loan frauds the banks reported to RBI over the last five financial years.
After PNB, Bank of Baroda had the highest amount of loan fraud reported, with 44.73 billion rupees from 389 cases and Bank of India ranked third, with loan frauds totaling 40.5 billion rupees from 231 cases over the same period, the data shows. 
India's biggest lender, State Bank of India reported 1,069 loan fraud cases in the last five financial years but did not disclose the amount.
It was also unclear how much has been recovered by the banks over the years. 
WHOLESALE REFORMS
The magnitude of the bad debt in India forced the government last year to bail out the sector by pledging to inject $32 billion over this financial year and next. 
Yet analysts and credit rating agencies have long warned that solving the bad debt at India's banking sector needs to also involve wholesale reforms of the lending practices that led to the surge in bad loans.
Bankers have been blamed for steering funds to politically connected business tycoons, such as Vijay Mallya, without due diligence, or after being pressed by government officials to steer funds to sectors it wanted to promote, such as infrastructure. 
Mallya stands accused in India of fraudulently palming off losses from his now defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines onto banks by taking out loans he had no intention of repaying, an allegation he denies.
Nirav Modi, the jeweler accused in the PNB fraud case, posed for pictures with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he was part of India's delegation of corporate leaders.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has denied any link with Nirav Modi, who is not related to India's Prime Minister.

446,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 04:37AM ET</span>",Powell Seeks to Bury Era of Fed `Barons' in Tapping Wider Staff,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell is the first Federal Reserve chairman in more than a decade to have any background in the private sector. That could explain changes he’s implemented in his first weeks on the job.
Powell has made it clear within the institution he wants more direct interaction with the Fed’s army of Ph.D. economists, and on a faster and more informal basis than sought by his predecessors, according to two Fed insiders familiar with the moves and who asked not to be identified.
The changes are more evolution than revolution, the people said. They build on other steps taken in recent years to relax a once-rigid system that strictly controlled the flow of information between politically appointed policy makers and the rank-and-file staff. Still, several former senior Fed officials said, it’s a notable shift in the way it flattens the central bank’s traditional hierarchy and further liberalizes internal communication.
Former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said he had no direct knowledge of Powell’s changes, but they struck him as positive steps that could help the new chairman as he attempts to shepherd the U.S. economy through an uncertain period of low unemployment, low inflation and still tepid, but quickening economic growth.
‘Loosening it Up’
“I don’t know that this is about getting alternative perspectives as much as it is about opening the funnel a bit,” Kohn said. “Loosening it up and also getting alternative perspectives and having informal conversations, that’s probably a good idea.”
Powell, who was sworn in as chairman on Feb. 5, is by many accounts a voracious reader of economic research. At the same time he lacks the academic grounding of Ph.D economists who have recently led the Fed, such as Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. Perhaps in recognition of that potential weakness, he’s keen to engage staff on topics that grab his attention.
Spur-of-the-moment exchanges between the chair and junior staffers would have been largely unthinkable at the Fed a generation ago. Even in recent years, a request for information would often result in a carefully vetted formal presentation that might take weeks to prepare and an hour to deliver.
Powell, who spent a dozen years in banking and private equity, has no patience for that, the two current insiders said. Nor does he want staff to over-invest their time in a complex production when all he needs is a substantive and frank discussion with just the right expert -- but right now.
Designated Responders
To accommodate this, division directors have each designated one or two lieutenants charged with responding to Powell’s requests, either by providing information themselves or by quickly rounding up the right economists to meet with the boss and answer his questions.
With these steps, Powell is taking aim at the last vestiges of the Fed’s ancien régime, a system that once gave enormous influence to the directors of the three key economic research divisions -- monetary affairs, research and statistics, and international finance. Even today, though it’s uttered in jest as often as in fear, those directors bear a famous nickname: the barons.
“That came from the head of personnel, who hated us,” said Edwin Truman, director of the division of international finance from 1977 to 1998, the hey-day of the barons. “He invented this term because he had so much difficulty dealing with us.”
Powerful Gatekeepers
The barons’ power stemmed mainly from their role as unchallenged gatekeepers, overseeing the flow of information between the decision makers on the Board of Governors, including the chair, and the staff.
That task had a practical side. It helped to manage the deluge of information that might influence monetary policy. They also had an interest in managing resources, and requests from policy makers that circumvented their offices could disrupt that. In his day, Truman conceded, that sometimes made for conflict.
“You could argue there was tension between division directors as gatekeepers and division directors as responsible for knowing who’s doing what,” he said.
Others have a less generous take on those days. To Alan Blinder, who served as vice chairman from 1994 to 1996, the barons enforced a rigid order that over-filtered information, suppressed internal debate and frequently kept Fed governors in the dark about important matters.
‘Information is Control’
“Information is control,” Blinder said. “If some of the governors don’t know about something and the staff does, that’s an advantage in terms of moving influence from the governors to the staff.”
Under Bernanke, the barons’ grip began to loosen. It became easier for governors to get an economist assigned exclusively to them to serve as an assistant and guide to the institution. After Yellen became chair, some measure of internal dissent was even encouraged.
In early 2014 the Fed’s internal website added an “alternative view” page, where individual economists can air their disagreements with official staff forecasts and positions. Also under Yellen in mid-2016, the staff created and the Board of Governors had access to an internal system known as the “data and analysis hub” where staffers share data, memos and papers about their topics of study.
Powell’s recent moves, which he initiated even before being sworn in as chair, are aimed at nudging things further, creating a more relaxed and ongoing exchange of knowledge.
Kohn, who served as both a baron and policy maker, said he hoped the division directors would embrace Powell’s changes.
“The whole point is to help decision makers come to the best possible decisions, and staff should do whatever seems to contribute to that outcome,” he said. “Different decision makers have different needs. If this is Jay’s need, they should adjust to it.”

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares were set to chalk up healthy weekly gains on Friday, snapping a three-week losing streak as earnings updates continued to impress, and volatility and jitters over rising inflation eased.
Gains in the energy sector on rising oil prices and solid reports from large-cap companies including Schneider, Eni and  Renault  (PA:RENA) lifted the STOXX 600 index 0.9 percent.
The pan-European benchmark is up 3 percent so far this week, set for its best week since December 2016, but still down around 6 percent from the 2-1/2-year peak it hit in January. 
Among country benchmarks, the UK's FTSE was up 0.6 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.8 percent, while Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed, up 1.2 percent.
This week's recovery follows a turbulent start to February, when worries that rising U.S. inflation could trigger faster interest rate hikes caused a global sell-off in equities.
The euro zone's volatility index dipped and remained well below the 19-month peak it reached earlier this month.
""The reason for the change in sentiment may well be down to the fact that the overall global economic picture continues to remain fairly positive,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, wrote in a note.
According Thomson Reuters data, European fourth-quarter earnings are seen rising 14.6 percent, a big upwards revision from last week's 11 percent growth forecast and following 15 weeks characterized by a string of downgrades. 
That brought Europe to just below the 14.8 percent growth rate expected for the S&P 500, though earnings beats in the U.S. stand at 78 percent versus 50 percent in Europe.
On the day, the biggest gainer in Europe was Vopak, up 14.9 percent after earnings at the Dutch oil and chemical storage firm fell less than expected.
French satellite operator Eutelsat soared 5.8 percent following its update. Even though its first-half core profit fell 7.4 percent, weighed down by slowing demand in its video division, one trader said net profit beat expectations and cost-cutting surprised positively.
Food giant Danone's shares rose 1.2 percent after it published 2017 results.
Swedish defense firm Saab plummeted 10 percent, leading losers in Europe after it posted fourth-quarter operating earnings below analysts' forecasts and proposed a smaller dividend hike than expected.
Air France was another top faller, down 5.8 percent. Its shares reversed course after a positive open that traders linked to the airline's positive comments on pricing.

Roche gained 0.9 percent after the Swiss drugmaker said it would buy the rest of Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion to speed development of cancer medicines.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s largest banks have stepped up screenings of mortgage loan applications amid a powerful government-backed inquiry into the nation's lenders and their sales practices, potentially hurting revenues from their most lucrative products.
National Australia Bank communicated on Friday to mortgage brokers its stricter conditions to assess mortgage applications, according to emails seen by Reuters, becoming the latest of Australia's 'Big Four' banks to do so. 
Citing regulatory concerns, the country's fourth-largest lender by market value, went a step further than rivals and lowered the amount it is prepared to lend - to a ratio of seven times a borrower's income from eight times previously.
Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, and Macquarie Group have also communicated to brokers in recent weeks changes in the way loans are assessed and approved, according to the emails reviewed by Reuters.
The stricter screening processes include emphasizing accuracy of loan application details and employing methods to better estimate the living expenses of potential borrowers. 
Mortgages are Australian banks' money-spinners, with the Big Four - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ, Westpac and NAB - holding about 80 percent of the country's A$1.7 trillion ($1.36 trillion) mortgage market. 
Australia's big banks are among the most profitable in the world and the sector is a key contributor to the nation's economy. The lenders have been under regulatory pressure to boost capital and rein in lending to speculative investors amid fears of a downturn in the property markets of the country's biggest cities. 
Moreover, a government-backed inquiry into banks began earlier this week following years of scandals including interest-rate rigging, poor financial advice and accusations of breaking money laundering rules.
Selling tactics on mortgages will be the first focus of the inquiry, whose final recommendations could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation.
The banking regulator, meanwhile, earlier this week proposed higher risk weightings on some mortgages.
The changes are likely to put pressure on revenues as they could result in fewer mortgage loan applications being approved, analysts say. 
""Revenues would be somewhat lower,"" as a result of the new focus on mortgage affordability imposed on banks, as well as the higher risk weightings, said TS Lim, banking analyst at Bell Potter Securities.
A spokesman for ANZ said the bank had recently added a higher level of approvals for some mortgage serviceability assessments to ensure ""lending standards are in line with community expectations and our own risk appetite"". 
A Westpac spokeswoman said the bank had recently bolstered their lending practices, ""with our staff and brokers now seeking more detailed information from customers to determine their borrowing capacity"".
A spokeswoman for Macquarie, which has a much lower exposure to mortgages than the Big Four, said the bank conducts regular reviews of its lending parameters and pricing. 
Representatives from CBA and NAB did not return requests for comment.
None of the banks addressed questions on whether the enhanced diligence would affect their sales.

China is Australia's largest wine export market, where a 60 percent surge in sales last year lifted Treasury to a record half-year profit for the six months to December 31. 
Penfolds wines and, especially, the ultra-high-end Grange vintages, are popular and profitable, and are sold under the brand name ""Ben Fu"" in China.
Melbourne-based Treasury last year won a legal challenge in China over its right to use ""Ben Fu"" as a trademark and said it launched its action against wine-seller Rush Rich, in a bid to protect its reputation.
""Of particular concern is the issue of copycat wine,"" Treasury said in a statement.
"" (It) is believed to be sourced and bottled through bulk wine suppliers...then exported under labels that copy the look and feel of Penfolds wines, infringing TWE's rights to the Penfolds and Ben Fu trademarks.""
Australian corporate filings show Rush Rich is based in Adelaide.
Court filings were not immediately available. Reuters was unable to immediately find a publicly-available telephone number for a representative of Rush Rich, which does not have an Australian website. 
Australian and New Zealand suppliers of goods from wine and lamb to honey have lately been stepping up efforts to combat fakes, particularly in the lucrative Chinese market.
""Our strong regulatory system is pivotal to our export success,"" Tony Battaglene, chief executive of the Winemakers' Federation of Australia, is quoted as saying in Treasury's emailed statement.

""This success relies on the integrity and quality of our wine – a reputation that is put at risk by copycat wines.""

455,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 02:00AM ET</span>",Fraud-hit Indian lender PNB slides for third day,"By Devidutta Tripathy and Tanvi Mehta
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Stung by a $1.77 billion fraud, Punjab National Bank shares sank for a third day on Friday, with India's second largest state-run lender losing nearly a quarter of its market value since its shock disclosure earlier this week.
With investors fretting over the extent of its liability,
The Economic Times newspaper reported that India's central bank had directed PNB to pay the entire amount to counterparties. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated on Thursday if PNB had to assume all the liability from the fraud it would need 80 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in additional capital, which at the stock's current valuation would mean a 14 percent dilution.
Comments from PNB Chief Executive Sunil Mehta on Thursday had fallen short of saying the bank would assume any potential liabilities. Mehta said PNB would wait for the outcome of investigations, but added it would comply with any regulatory order.
Analysts said the fraud case was likely to cast a long shadow over the banking sector, particularly state-run lenders, several of which had also provided loans under the assumption they were being backed by PNB.
PNB has lost 90 billion Indian rupees ($1.41 billion), 23.4 percent, of its market value since its disclosure on Wednesday that a investigation was underway into suspected fraud, as a result of two junior officials at a branch in Mumbai steering unauthorized loans to customer accounts, including some firms e linked to Nirav Modi, a billionaire jeweler and diamond merchant.
Federal investigators have raided Nirav Modi's Mumbai home and offices, though the jeweler is outside the country and his whereabouts is unknown.
Modi launched an eponymous jewelry business branded NIRAV MODI, in capitals, with a chain of boutiques stretching from New York to London to Beijing.
As recently as last month, he was at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Indian media carried a group photograph with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the foreground and Nirav Modi, who is no relation, grinning between rows of Indian business leaders behind him.
In noon trade on Friday, PNB's share was down 3 percent after sliding more than 18 percent in the previous two sessions.
The state-run banking sector index was down 1.54 percent in a flat Mumbai market. 
Jayant Manglik, president of retail distribution at Religare Broking, said he was recommended investors be cautious about India's state banking sector. 
""As a general rule, I would suggest staying away till there is clarity on this,"" he said.
PNB said in an announcement to the stock exchange on Thursday evening that it had suspended 10 employees during the investigation into the fraud, which Mehta said had gone on undetected for years. 
PNB also said it had requested Hong Kong branches of two other Indian banks - Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank to provide it with documents and communications with the borrowers.
Companies related to Nirav Modi had used the fraudulent credit guarantees from PNB to get loans from overseas branches of Indian banks, including Allahabad and Axis, according to a previous police complaint from PNB.
Axis has said it sold down all its exposure based on the PNB guarantees, without giving further details.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 01:57AM ET</span>","As mining investors push caution, Glencore differs from rivals","By Susan Taylor and Melanie Burton
TORONTO/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - As shareholders push the world's cash-rich miners to maintain lush dividends and make the most of existing assets,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) is taking a slightly different tactic that positions it for shrewd acquisitions.
Like other big rivals, Glencore is expected to lift its dividend payout when it reports results next week, but the Swiss miner and trader is also ""open for business"" when it comes to buying mines or companies, its chief financial officer said in December.
""Glencore's deal-making is now very strategic. They're trying to find businesses with the highest margin and get into sectors where they will have a competitive advantage,"" said David Neuhauser, managing director of Livermore Partners, which holds Glencore shares.
""They want to do deals where they are not just first movers, but can become leaders,"" he added.
Rising commodity prices, cost cuts and global growth have improved their balance sheets, but most miners are not plowing money into mega-mines or big acquisitions - caution welcomed by investors burned by massive losses in the last downturn.
""I don't think they've really got a mandate to do that (spend on major projects) at this stage,"" said Rohan Walsh, investment manager at Melbourne-based Karara Capital, which holds BHP and Rio shares, a view echoed by multiple investors interviewed by Reuters. 
""Returning capital is appropriate, particularly after going through a pretty major investment boom we saw a couple of years ago,"" Walsh added. ""They ... will have to optimize the capital that has already been invested, run those existing assets pretty effectively and then look for exceptional opportunities going forward.""
Between 2012 and 2016, the world's top 40 miners booked more than $200 billion in impairments, according to a recent PwC report, as the value of assets acquired in a deal-making binge crumbled alongside commodity prices.
Still smarting, most top miners reporting earnings this month are expected to keep a grip on capital expenditures, even as cash generation improves. 
In 2016, $49 billion in capex from the world's top 40 miners was a record low, and none announced new projects, PwC said. Additionally, a series of expected M&A deals failed to materialize as numerous large asset sales were withdrawn, PwC said. For a graphic, click [http://reut.rs/2C0DZg3] 
In contrast to that caution, Glencore declared its appetite for growth from acquisitions at its annual investor day, alongside expanding existing projects and joint ventures. 
""I'm supportive of their current M&A strategy,"" said Neuhauser. ""They are focused not just on getting scale but on substance. Once they get scale, they can have a say on price.""
Last year, Glencore unsuccessfully pursued U.S. grains merchant Bunge Ltd, now the target of Archer Daniels Midland Co - a scenario that could set up a bidding war for Bunge, whose current market value is $10.56 billion. 
 Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) may not lag far behind Glencore. S&P upgraded the miner Tuesday, partly due to its potential for M&A.
Commodity prices are expected to stay strong, and give miners a short-term boost, reflecting under-investment in growth. But long term, miners must invest to replace the commodities they mine out, or face declining production. 
As a trader, Glencore is well-placed to capitalize on any supply tightness that pushes up prices.
It is also banking on battery minerals strength as it holds a dominant position in Democratic Republic of Congo, home to some two-thirds of global cobalt supply.     
""I think Glencore is more willing to grow than the (other) majors, based on their recent history of buying half of Rio Tinto's thermal coal business,"" said Clarksons Platou Securities global mining analyst Jeremy Sussman.
China's Yancoal won a $2.7 billion bidding war for Rio's Australian coal mines last year, but Glencore went on to buy a 49 percent stake in the asset via deals with Yancoal and Mitsubishi Corp worth just over $1.1 billion. 
AVOID THE TEMPTATION
While top miners are always hunting for quality, long-life mines, it makes sense to pay dividends and buy back shares until they find them, said portfolio manager Robert Cohen at Toronto's 1832 Asset Management, with C$105 billion ($83.27 billion) in assets under management. 
""It's probably better for the diversified miners to pay out higher dividends - it forces management to be more disciplined with their capital,"" said Cohen, whose funds hold Glencore and Rio shares.
Free cash flow at the ""Big 4"" - BHP Billiton (LON:BLT), Rio, Vale SA and Glencore - has soared in past two years, paving the way for Rio's record-setting dividend last week and Glencore's $1 billion dividend reinstatement in 2017. 
Freeport-McMoRan, the world's biggest publicly-traded copper miner, ended a three-year dividend drought last week, citing better market conditions and free cash flow expectations. 

""This is a cyclical business - it always has been, it always will be. So when you do have cash, you need to avoid the temptation to suddenly spend it all, which is what has happened in the past,"" said Freeport shareholder Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>",Pot Pharm: Booming Canada weed sector plots next-wave medicines,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canopy Growth Corp, one of the world's biggest medical marijuana producers, now wants to take on the world's pharmaceutical giants.
The Canadian firm launched Canopy Health Innovation in late 2016 to build a portfolio of patented and federally approved cannabinoid-based medicines. The venture is one of a small but growing number of companies here aiming to compete with established drugs treating diseases ranging from anxiety and chronic pain to multiple sclerosis and childhood epilepsy.
They're developing research-backed formulations to be sold as pills, inhalers, solutions and creams, with the goal of convincing doctors and insurers to embrace marijuana as a mainstream medicine.
""You'll see a lot of companies like Canopy Health starting to form, and they're basically going to create medical cannabis 2.0,"" Canopy Health Chief Executive Marc Wayne said in an interview. ""There is a gold rush for cannabis intellectual property, and it's accelerating.""
Canada's relaxed regulations, mature marijuana industry and free-flowing capital offer such firms a unique opportunity to advance research without the legal and political risks that bog down cannabis firms in the United States and elsewhere.
While U.S. federal law continues to ban weed in all forms, Canada approved medical pot in 2001 and will legalize recreational use this year. Its government welcomes and even finances the research and clinical trials needed to fully legitimize medical cannabis.
Canada is also one of only two nations - along with the Netherlands - that currently exports marijuana, allowing firms here to take immediate advantage of recent medical pot legalizations in more than 20 countries. Research firm Brightfield Group last year forecast the global medical cannabis market would quadruple to $31.4 billion by 2021. 
Offerings in today's Canada medical marijuana market differ little from those used recreationally - the smokable plant and, more recently, oil extracts. More than 70 companies have licenses from the federal drug regulator, Health Canada, to cultivate, produce and sell medical marijuana, with more than half those licenses granted in 2017 or 2018.
Canopy Health and other firms now aim to craft new formulations with varying cannabinoid levels; to find the best dosage delivery systems, such as rapid-release or long-acting tablets or metered-dose inhalers; or to combine cannabinoids with other drugs or supplements to improve effectiveness.
Canada opened the door to serious medical research in 2015 with the approval of cannabinoid extract sales, allowing for the isolation of cannabis components that could form the basis of more sophisticated medicines.
The pace of research - and investment - quickened last year after the government introduced legislation to legalize recreational use. Equity offerings by Canadian marijuana firms tripled to nearly $1 billion in 2017. 
Canopy Health raised C$16 million ($12.77 million) last year to finance medical trials alongside other institutions and researchers, Wayne said. It has filed 27 patents for treatment of insomnia relief and is now working on remedies for anxiety. The firm expects to have its first federal approval by about 2020.
Canopy Growth, a publicly listed firm valued at C$5.3 billion, retains a 46 percent stake in the new private company.
Canopy Health's competitors include CanniMed, which last month agreed to be acquired by Aurora Cannabis to form what would be a C$6 billion firm, the world's biggest marijuana producer by market value. 
CanniMed has partnered with universities including McGill University in Montreal and the University of Manitoba on research into managing symptoms of multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis and pediatric epilepsy. 
""Canadian companies are taking the lead because we've more freedom to operate and can actually afford it now,"" Chief Executive Officer Brent Zettl said in an interview.
Other players forging ahead with medical research include MedReleaf, Emerald Health Therapeutics, Emblem Corp and Tilray, an unlisted company owned by private equity firm Privateer Holdings.
CONVINCING DOCTORS, INSURERS
Although some medical uses for marijuana have been long established - to reduce nausea, for instance, or treat glaucoma - little research exists to convince the health care establishment of its medical value.
Patients are typically only prescribed marijuana when they ask for it, and it's open secret that ""medical"" marijuana is often used recreationally.
""The way the medical cannabis world now works is really patient-driven,"" said Avtar Dhillon, executive chairman of Emerald Health Therapeutics and a medical doctor. ""I can relate to physicians who want evidence.""
Emerald will soon start human clinical trials of a cannabis formulation to manage pain, he said.
Only a few Canadian insurance plans cover medical cannabis, including grocery chain Loblaw Cos' employee insurance plan, Veterans Affairs Canada and insurer Sun Life Financial.
""There's a lot we need to learn about this plant, and the research goes a long way to quantify and demonstrate its medical benefits,"" said Jason Zandberg, a research analyst focused on small-cap growth companies at PI Financial.
Government money is helping the cause. Canada's National Research Council awarded C$1.7 million for the study of cannabis between 2014 and 2017. Among the recipients were Emerald, MedReleaf and Tilray.
In January, the Canadian Institute of Health Research approved C$1.4 million for studies led by hospitals and universities into subjects including the impact of cannabis on driving and mental health.
LITTLE RESEARCH, MUCH DEBATE
Debates still rage over the effectiveness and risks of prescribing pot.
The concerns include addiction from long-term use, impaired cognitive function, anxiety, depression and lung cancer, according to a 2014 paper posted on the U.S. National Institutes for Health website.
""Cannabis has not been through Health Canada's rigorous pharmaceutical regulatory process,"" said Canadian Medical Association President Laurent Marcoux. ""Physicians do not know about the appropriate dosage, the potential side effects and how it could interact with other medications.""
CanniMed Therapeutics has financed physician and pharmacist training programs developed by professionals in each field and accredited by their certification bodies, a company spokeswoman said. 
Emblem Corp, which received Health Canada approval to sell medical marijuana in August 2016, is spending C$3.2 million over the next two years on studies to find the best cannabinoid strains to treat pain and reduce dependence on opioids.
The chief of the firm’s pharmaceutical division, John Stewart, previously worked as the Canadian and U.S. CEO for Purdue Pharma, the creator of OxyContin, a painkiller widely seen as a major contributor to North America's opioid crisis.
But the firm needs more data, Stewart said.
“We don't know yet how you might initiate cannabis therapy in a patient who wanted to discontinue their opioid therapy but certainly doesn't want to discontinue their pain control,"" he said.
Medical marijuana firms have an unusual advantage in that they can continue to sell a legal but largely unregulated medicine as they raise money for research into fully regulated products that might have “enormous potential” in the pharmaceutical market, said MedReleaf CEO Neil Closner. 
""We're allowed to sell a product that many people view as being a possible replacement for many pharmaceutical products,"" he said. ""But we're not obligated to take it through the traditional Health Canada approval process.""

458,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2018 12:44AM ET</span>",SEC blocks Chicago Stock Exchange sale to China-based investors,"By John McCrank
(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday killed the politically sensitive sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) to a group led by China-based investors, saying a lack of information on the would-be buyers threatened the ability to properly monitor the exchange after the deal.
The move by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ends a two-year battle to gain approval for the sale and underscores the more hostile environment facing Chinese buyers under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump brought the CHX deal up twice during the election campaign as an example of how jobs and wealth were leaving the United States.
SEC staff initially approved the sale of the privately owned exchange in August, but within minutes of the announcement SEC commissioners, led by Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump appointee, put the decision on hold for further review.
U.S. lawmakers from both parties had harshly criticized the deal in joint letters to the SEC, arguing that it would give the Chinese government access to American financial markets and questioning the SEC's ability to regulate and monitor foreign owners.
""This has been a long fight, and I am grateful we now have a President who recognizes the national security threats of allowing a Chinese government-affiliated company to own the Chicago Stock Exchange,"" Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger said in a statement on Thursday.
""We must continue to be vigilant, with thorough oversight, to prevent the highly-coordinated and strategic efforts of the Communist Chinese government to threaten our national security through malicious business investments.""
CHX is a niche player in the industry, handling just 0.5 percent of U.S. equities trades.
The acquisition, which was proposed in February 2016 and worth around $25 million, was led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, a privately held company that invests in real estate development and financial holdings.
Casin, through CHX, has denied any affiliation with the Chinese government and no connections have been shown.
CHX declined to comment on Thursday on the final decision.
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
The SEC's decision comes at a time of rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
In the latest signs of friction, Beijing earlier this month launched an anti-dumping investigation into U.S. sorghum shipments following the U.S. Commerce Department's 'self-initiated' dumping probe into Chinese aluminum imports in late November.
The Chinese foreign and commerce ministries did not respond immediately to emailed and faxed questions requesting a comment. Friday is Lunar New Year's day, a public holiday in China.
Casin had said it saw potential in CHX and that its long-term goal was to list Chinese companies in the United States on the bourse. It also planned to eventually build an exchange in China using CHX technology.
If the deal had been approved it would have marked the first time Chinese investors had been direct owners of a U.S. stock exchange, although not the first time a U.S. exchange had foreign owners. Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG bought the U.S.-based International Securities Exchange for $2.8 billion in 2007, before selling it to Nasdaq Inc for $1.1 billion in 2016.
The CHX deal was approved in December 2016 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, but also needed SEC approval.
The Wall Street regulator on Thursday did not mention the China connection, but said it found several reasons why the deal did not meet laws governing the ownership of U.S. exchanges, which are stricter than usual ownership rules due to the role they play in the economy.
Critically, the SEC said in a filing posted on its website that it was not satisfied about the source of funds for the deal and who the ultimate consortium owners would be, raising worries the structure of the deal could allow new, unknown entities to assume stakes over time.
The SEC, which conducted its own extensive due diligence when reviewing the case, said that the CHX was not able to provide key information it had requested, including access to the potential owners' books, ""leaving various questions unanswered.""
The CHX's inability to verify the ultimate potential owners would also make it difficult for the bourse to satisfy its ongoing compliance monitoring obligations, and would obstruct the SEC's own capacity to oversee CHX, it said.
In particular, the SEC said it was not satisfied it would have full access to the exchange's books and records if the deal were to go through.
FUTURE IN DOUBT
After a two-year delay, the SEC's decision puts CHX's future in doubt. The exchange said it needed the infusion of capital to invest in its operations and attract business.
CHX's other key initiative to boost its volumes centers around giving certain trading firms faster access if they agree to strict trading obligations aimed at making it easier for others to buy and sell stocks on the exchange.
SEC staff approved that plan in October, but the SEC commissioners also put that decision on hold and there is no deadline for a further ruling. 
Technically, CHX could still resubmit its proposal or seek other buyers.

CHX competes against the New York Stock Exchange and its three affiliated exchanges, all owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, and Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc, both of which own four U.S. stock exchanges.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, locked in a trade dispute with the Canadian government, has applied to stay in the race to supply Canada with 88 new fighter jets, three well-placed sources said on Thursday.
Companies had until Feb. 9 to express an interest in taking part in a competition for planes worth between C$15 billion ($12.1 billion) and C$19 billion. Ottawa will release its specifications next year, at which point firms can bid.
Boeing did let Canada know it was interested, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The decision does not mean the firm will necessarily put forward its F-18 Super Hornet.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. aerospace company infuriated the Canadian government last year by launching a trade challenge against planemaker Bombardier Inc  Although a U.S. trade commission dismissed the complaint on Jan. 26, Boeing can still appeal the decision or launch another complaint against the Canadian firm. Well-informed sources said last week Ottawa has made clear to Boeing that its chances of winning the 88-jet deal would be harmed if it pursued the Bombardier case. Defense experts say  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's new F-35 stealth fighter is likely the front runner. Dassault Aviation SA and Airbus SE also are expected to compete, but with planes that first flew in the 1990s. Ottawa says bids will be evaluated in part on the basis of ""past and recent economic behavior of potential bidders leading up to the procurement."" 
That test is months away from being finalised, meaning Boeing has no idea whether Ottawa would be satisfied if it did drop the challenge, the sources said.

Revenue from commodity trading, selling derivatives to investors and other activities in the sector fell to $2.5 billion in 2017 from $4.3 billion the previous year, it said in a report.
""Low volatility and subdued client activity, coupled with trading underperformance witnessed in 1H17, led to the overall decline,"" it said. 
Revenue was the lowest since Coalition began analyzing bank data in 2006, it said. 
Banks' commodity revenue has been on a steady downward path in recent years as they have exited or slimmed down their commodity businesses due to heightened government regulation and poor performance from the sector.
A number of firms suffered heavy losses in the first half of 2017 after a slide in natural gas prices, while others lost money in the second half due to swings in oil prices during Hurricane Harvey, analysts have said.
Coalition did not mention individual banks, but in the second quarter Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company.
Coalition tracks Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and UBS.

Bauer most recently served as President of GE Hungary where GE Lighting's Europe, Middle East, Africa and Turkey business is headquartered, the company said in an emailed statement.
The deal, which marks the first step in the divesture of the lighting business, includes GE Lighting in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Turkey, along with its Global Automotive Lighting businesses.
The remaining pieces of GE Lighting, as well as the Current, will now be marketed as part of a separate sale or sales, the company also added.
The lighting business dates to the earliest days of GE, which was co-founded by Thomas Edison more than a century ago.
GE has been preparing to sell the lighting business, as part of a broad restructuring plan aimed at shedding $20 billion worth of assets and focus the remaining company on three core divisions: power, aviation and health care.
Profit fell sharply at GE's lighting business last year. It earned $93 million on revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2017, down from $199 million on $4.8 billion in 2016.
GE Chief Executive John Flannery last month said the conglomerate was looking at restructuring options ""including separately traded assets"" after it announced more than $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws.

The fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, which would announce its quarterly results on Friday, said it slashed its operating costs by over 5 percent since it acquired Kraft Foods Group in 2015. 
Shares of the company, which owns brands such as Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup, closed up 1 percent on Thursday ahead of the presentation that it had announced earlier this week.

(Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) topped Wall Street's quarterly revenue and profit estimates on Thursday as U.S. and international distributors licensed more of its shows.
The owner of the most-watched U.S. TV network said it also expects high single-digit revenue growth for 2018 and earnings per share growth in the high teens, ahead of Wall Street's average estimates.
The company's shares were slightly higher in after-hours trading. 
CBS, whose shows include ""Big Bang Theory"" and ""NCIS,"" has focused on diversifying its revenue away from advertising as many brands shift spending online from TV. Advertising accounted for 44 percent of its revenue in the quarter, compared to 51 percent a year ago.
The company said it now has nearly 5 million subscribers for its CBS All Access and Showtime online streaming services. Its goal is to have 8 million subscribers of the two services by 2020.
The New York-based media company beat Wall Street's expectations despite a 3 percent drop in advertising revenue after hitting a record the previous year.
CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said on an analyst call he is ""optimistic"" that this year will see stronger political advertising than 2016 with the U.S. midterm elections.
CBS and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), which are both controlled by Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari, recently announced they had set up special committees to explore a merger. Executives declined to address any discussions on the analyst call. 
Revenue from content licensing and distribution rose 33.4 percent to $1.19 billion.
Excluding one-time items, CBS reported a profit of $1.20 per share, helped by a lower weighted average of shares outstanding related to the split off of CBS Radio and its share repurchase program. Analysts on averaged had estimated a profit of $1.14, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
CBS's total revenue rose 11.5 percent to $3.92 billion.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.7 billion.

(Reuters) - Planned Parenthood, other organizations and a Washington state county filed lawsuits on Thursday challenging a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to defund more than $200 million in teen pregnancy prevention programs.
The four lawsuits in federal courts in Washington state, Maryland and the District of Columbia seek to have funding reinstated for programs that the groups say serve 1.2 million young people.
Those suing include affiliates of Planned Parenthood; Washington's King County, which includes Seattle and its suburbs; and Baltimore-based Healthy Teen Network.
The U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS) did not respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuits center on the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which Congress created in 2010 during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. It provides grants for evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs.
HHS currently funds 84 grants. Since the program's inception, the teen birth rate in the United States has fallen 41 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to one of the lawsuits.
But in July, the department under the Republican Trump's administration told recipients of 81 of the five-year grants that it would be terminating their agreements two years early. The remaining three were terminated in September, the groups say.
Affiliates of Planned Parenthood, a non-profit that provides contraception, health screenings and abortions, in their lawsuit called the decision part of the Trump's administration's ""broader political agenda against sexual and reproductive health and evidence-based and science-based programs.""
The lawsuit said the early termination equals a loss of more than $200 million in funding and will mean depriving thousands of teenagers of information and education that could help them make decisions about their health.

The lawsuits seek injunctions barring the grants from being terminated based on claims the department failed to follow proper administrative procedures and that it violated the U.S. Constitution by endorsing religion.

Privately held Flatiron, backed by Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), taps into data on individual cancer cases to help doctors select promising approaches for their patients. 
It also stores billing data, doctors' notes and related information. Roche currently owns 12.6 percent of Flatiron.  In 2016, Roche led a $175 million investment into Flatiron, in part to help the Swiss company harness the deluge of still-underutilized data collected from cancer patients with the New York City-based company's products.  Roche has said Flatiron algorithms will improve not only its research and trials, but also buttress its arguments during head-to-head price talks with payers as new combinations of its expensive therapies hit the market. (http://reut.rs/2o9x6iY) ""It gives us better insights into the potential for our products,"" Roche's head of pricing Jens Grueger told Reuters in a 2016 interview.  ""But it also creates flexibility in how we can create value contracts in the future."" Roche has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions in recent months, including in December when it said it would buy U.S. cancer drug specialist Ignyta Inc for $1.7 billion in a deal to broaden its oncology portfolio. In 2014, Google Ventures led a $130 million investment in Flatiron as healthcare had become a hot area for venture capital, especially companies related to health, data and software. (http://reut.rs/2CnuZxb) Roche and Flatiron expect the deal to close in the first half of 2018, after which the latter will continue its operations as a separate entity. 
Allen & Company LLC is the financial adviser to Flatiron Health and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is its legal counsel. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is acting as legal counsel to Roche.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 05:21PM ET</span>",U.S. market gurus who predicted selloff say current calm an illusion,"By Jennifer Ablan and Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - You ain't seen nothing yet.
Some veteran investors who were vindicated in calling for a pullback in shares and a spike in volatility could now be cheering. Actually, they're looking at the risks that still lie ahead in the current relative calm. 
The last week's wild market swings confirmed that the market was in correction territory - falling more than 10 percent from its high. The falls were triggered by higher bond yields and fears of inflation but came against a backdrop of a stretched market that had taken price/earnings levels to as high as 18.9. Adding to downwards pressure was the unwinding of bets that volatility would stay low. 
The fall had come after a growing number of strategists and investors said a pullback was in the offing - although the consensus opinion was that the market would then start rising again. 
The big question is: what comes now?
“Do you honestly believe today is the bottom?"" said Jeffrey Gundlach, known as Wall Street’s Bond King, last week, who had been warning for more than a year that markets were too calm. Gundlach had been particularly vocal in his warnings about the VIX, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" which tracks the volatility implied by options on the S&P 500. 
The sell-off in U.S. stocks derailed some popular short volatility exchange-traded products, which contributed to more downwards pressure on the market. Gundlach in May last year warned that the VIX was ""insanely low."" 
Hedge fund manager Douglas Kass from Seabreeze Partners Management Inc was short SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) and said he ""took a lot of small losses"" last year but says he still sees more stress ahead. He said he is now re-shorting that ETF. 
Investors who bet low volatility would continue will need time to unwind their strategies, Kass said.
Dan Fuss, known as Wall Street’s Warren Buffett of bonds, has been warning for years that Treasuries were vulnerable to a vicious sell-off and set for much higher yields and lower prices. “I‘m not trying to be an ‘end of the world person’ here, but it is a possibility,” Fuss told Reuters last November.
In a telephone interview this week, Fuss, the vice chairman of $268-billion Loomis Sayles and one of the world's longest-serving fund managers with six decades of experience, said he had built cash and cash equivalent reserves to their most extreme levels in his Loomis portfolio and had put some of that money to work last week. 
His biggest worry in 2018: “The geopolitical side. Nothing beats peace.”
Veteran short-seller Bill Fleckenstein, who ran a short fund but closed it in 2009, said that ""last week's action was an early indication that the end of bull market is upon us."" 
Fleckenstein said there was a lot of money in the market with no conviction behind it, for example, buying index funds and ETFs just ""to be part of the party"" which was an element of ""hot money.""
""Last week was just the preview to the bigger event that we'll see this year probably,"" Fleckenstein said. Fleckenstein said he is not short at the moment - although he did make ""a couple of bucks"" last week shorting Nasdaq futures. He said he is looking for an opportunity to get short again. He said he has ""flirted with the idea of restarting a short fund"".
""I'm not short at the moment, because the action was such that I covered, but I expect that I'll be short aggressively at some point this year. It's not quite time, but it's pretty close."" 
Many strategists have been bullish about the market's potential to stretch the near-nine-year-old bull market further. Many had said they expected a pullback, but then a resumption of gains. 
The drop in the benchmark S&P 500 last week did not dent strategists' expectations for mild to moderate gains in the U.S. stock market by the end of the year, as they cited strength in corporate earnings and interest rates not expected to derail equities.
Byron Wien, longtime Wall Street strategist who is vice chairman in the Private Wealth Solutions group at Blackstone (NYSE:BX), said in his predictions for 2018 that this year the S&P 500 would have a 10-percent correction. 
""I don't think we're done,"" said Wien, who ultimately thinks the bull run will continue some more and that the S&P would end the year above 3,000. But the path there could be bumpy. Wien thinks the correction ""did not cleanse the optimism sufficiently"" and sees further downside beyond the 10-percent fall - which has since been partially recouped.
""Everyone says: 'Oh, well, now we've had the 10 percent correction that everyone was waiting for, then we go back up again',"" said Wien. ""But it's not as simple as that."" 

(This version of the story was refiled to remove the erroneous ""percent"" from P/E level in paragraph 3)

1. Can Housing, Sentiment Data Rescue Dollar?
Building permits, housing starts and a raft of University of Michigan data will round off the week of top-tier US economic data on Friday as US investors gear up for a holiday weekend which usually sees trading volumes drop from normal levels. 
The Commerce Department is expected report building permits fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.290 million units, while housing starts are expected to show increase to 1.234 million units.
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, is expected to show consumer confidence in the economy remained bullish, as economist forecast the index to show a reading of 95.4 for February compared to 95.7 in the previous month.
The index serves a barometer of consumer confidence in the economy; a rising sentiment index points to signs of an uptick in increased consumer spending and thus economic growth.
Michigan’s consumer expectations are expected to show a reading of 84.5 for February, while current conditions are forecast to rebound to a reading of 112 in February from 110.5 in the previous month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.44% to 88.53
2. UK Retail Sales To Support Sterling Rise Above $1.41? 
The uptick in the pace of UK wage growth is expected to boost domestic retail sales. Economists forecast UK retail sales rose 0.5% in January, which would mark a return to growth following a 1.5% fall in December.
A stronger retail sales print could strengthen the Bank of England’s case to raise rates sooner rather than later after BOE governor Mark Carney, during the most recent BOE meeting, said that the central bank may have to raise rates faster and sooner than anticipated.
GBP/USD rose 0.69% to $1.4093.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count to Signal More U.S. Output Ahead?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 26 to 791, the highest level since April 2, 2015.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures settled lower on Thursday as traders mulled over recent data showing US oil producers ramped up production while a drop in refinery activity is expected to add to domestic crude supply totals in the weeks to come."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks may have recovered only about half the ground lost in the recent selloff, but traders in the derivatives market are fast dialing down their fears of more ructions.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility in the S&P 500 (SPX), while not quite back to where it was before last week's slump in equities, has retreated sharply from the high of 50.3 hit on Feb. 5. 
The index was up 0.2 points at 19.46 on Thursday.
Investors' fear of further losses for stocks has eased dramatically from last week, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
Still, investors are not as complacent as they were before the stock market correction, he said.
""When I see the VIX creeping a little higher today, even as equities are up, it tells me perhaps it overshot to the downside yesterday,"" Frederick said.
The VIX futures curve, a snapshot of prices of futures contracts on the volatility index across different expirations, also painted a less fearful picture.
The curve moved into backwardation over the last two weeks, meaning investors were paying more for near-term insurance than for contracts that would protect them farther out in time. That rare situation highlighted the extreme level of fear of further near-term losses for U.S. stocks.
(Graphic: VIX futures signal smoother sailing - http://reut.rs/2C2VPPz)
On Wednesday the backwardation had reached its most extreme level since Aug. 11, 2011, when rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating.
With Wednesday's expiry of February VIX futures, the curve was approaching its more typical contango, where investors pay more for farther out contracts than for near-term contracts.
""Any time the front-month contracts expire, you immediately see a big adjustment in the curve,"" said Frederick.

Wall Street surged on Thursday and was on track to end higher for a fifth straight session, led by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other technology stocks as investors shrugged off recent inflation worries.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Legal win for CLO funds may aid Trump’s efforts to dismantle Dodd-Frank Act,"By Kristen Haunss
NEW YORK (LPC) - A legal victory for Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) funds may help President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, a massive regulatory package that was signed into law by his predecessor, President Barack Obama.
CLO funds, one of the largest lenders to U.S. companies including retailers Toys “R” Us and J. Crew Group, are celebrating the win, which exempts the $501 billion asset class from the Dodd-Frank risk-retention rules that require managers to hold some of their funds’ risk.
The decision last Friday in the three-year legal battle helps Trump’s call to roll back regulation, which critics say stifles lending and limits economic growth, without having to wrangle Congressional votes or send morning tweets.
The legal victory may help other asset classes to argue that they should also avoid risk-retention requirements, which was a key argument made by regulators who said that exempting CLOs would drive a freight train through the rule.
The court ruling could apply to other securitizations structured in a similar way to CLOs, according to Travis Norton, counsel at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. These could include residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts. 
Dodd-Frank introduced the ‘skin-in-the-game’ rules for some funds, including CLOs, banned banks from speculating with their own money and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
CLOs were lumped in with more exotic Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) funds, which were widely blamed for causing 2008’s meltdown, forcing managers to hold 5% of their fund although CLOs suffered minimal losses during the recession. 
The Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA), the trade group representing the US CLO and leveraged loan markets, sued the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2014 saying risk retention was “arbitrary, capricious"" and ""an abuse of discretion,” and could cut off funding to the neediest companies. 
On February 9 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed, saying that the agencies went beyond their statute and ruled that CLOs are exempt from risk retention.
Regulators have 45 days to seek an en banc review, a hearing in front of the active DC Circuit Appeals Court judges. The government also has a 90-day window to seek review from the Supreme Court, Richard Klingler, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin and the LSTA’s counsel, said. 
Managers of US CLOs will no longer need to hold retention in around two months if regulators do not appeal. This will benefit smaller funds most, which do not have the capital to rework old deals or raise new funds.
“We are reviewing the court’s decision,” a Fed spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.
LOOPHOLE
The case largely centered on the use and differing interpretations of the word “transfer” in the Congressional text. The three-judge Appeals Court panel agreed with the LSTA’s argument that CLO managers do not transfer loans into their funds.
The ruling may open the regulation up to challenges from other asset classes, including CDOs, which use similar structures, a concern shared by Joshua Chadwick, the regulators’ counsel. 
“If you accept [the LSTA’s] reading of transfer, it would drive a freight train through what Congress intended to do,” Chadwick told the Court of Appeals judges last year. 
Some of the most “dangerous, toxic assets of the financial crisis” such as ‘CDO Squared,’ a CDO, composed of other CDOs, use the same management structure and also buy debt in the open market to be transferred into a securitization vehicle, he said.
Regulators’ concerns about loopholes were overstated and to an extent a problem of the agencies’ making, Senior Circuit Judge Stephen F. Williams said in his opinion last week. 
Law firm Sidley is studying the implications of the ruling for CLOs as well as other products. 
“Could you now seek to design a [Collateralized Mortgage Obligation] CMO with a manager structure akin to the CLO one that was exempted? Absolutely,” said Karen Petrou, a co-founder of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics. “I’m sure hard thinking is already at work on that score.”
A White House spokesperson did not respond immediately to an email requesting comment.

(Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Thursday and was on track to end higher for a fifth straight session, led by Apple and other technology stocks as investors shrugged off recent inflation worries that threw the market into a sell-off at the start of the month.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 3.2 percent and contributed more than any other stock to gains on the S&P 500 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) made the iPhone maker its top investment.
A Labor Department report showed U.S. producer prices rose in line with expectations in January, likely calming fears that inflation was picking up faster than expected.
Investors instead focused on recent strong quarterly earnings and expectations that more earnings growth is still to come, thanks to newly-implemented corporate and personal tax cuts. 
""The economic environment is still very strong,"" said Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""And I think consumers will spend more when they see more money in their paychecks. You will see that reverberate through the economy.""
Following many forecast increases by corporations in recent weeks, analysts on average now expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share in 2018 by 18.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Cisco surged 4.8 percent following upbeat results and a strong forecast, as the network gear maker's years-long efforts to transform into a software-focused company began to pay off.
Wall Street investors were not alone in their optimism. Bullish sentiment among individual investors hit its highest level since mid-January in the American Association of Individual Investors' weekly survey.
At 3:14 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.99 percent at 25,139.51 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 1.00 percent to 2,725.57.
The Nasdaq Composite added 1.42 percent to 7,244.94.
Energy was the only major S&P 500 sector index to fall, pulled down 0.48 percent by weaker oil prices.
U.S. Treasury yields slipped as investors took a breather from selling bonds and readjusted positions to prepare for more inflation-related volatility, a scenario that could take yields even higher.
Fears of inflation and higher interest rates had sent the S&P 500 sharply lower at the start of February. In the past five sessions, the S&P 500 has gained 5.6 percent, and it remains down 5 percent from a Jan 26 record high.
""We're stabilized for the moment. The real question was how the market reacted to the CPI and PPI numbers and it seems to have taken higher inflation in stride,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.
The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" rose to 19.57 points, but was well below the 50 point-mark it touched last week.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.99-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",U.S. regulator warns of cryptocurrency 'pump-and-dump' schemes,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator warned investors on Thursday about cryptocurrency ""pump-and-dump"" scams that aim to rip off investors by inflating the price of volatile virtual tokens through spreading bogus information.
The Commodities Futures Trading Commission said in a statement that it had received complaints from investors who had lost money in such schemes, and warned against buying cryptocurrencies based on tips found on social media. 
""As with many online frauds, this type of scam is not new - it simply deploys an emerging technology to capitalize on public interest in digital assets,"" CFTC director of public affairs Erica Elliott Richardson said in the statement.
The CFTC's warning comes as financial regulators worldwide intensify their scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, which are virtual coins not backed by governments. Cryptocurrency trading has been booming over the past year, with the price of coins such as bitcoin and ethereum hitting record levels in volatile markets. 
Bitcoin topped $10,000 on Thursday for the first time in more than two weeks, as investors bought the digital currency after it had fallen 70 percent from its record peak in December. (BTC=BTSP)
Cryptocurrencies are traded on largely unregulated and anonymous online exchanges, many of which have been plagued by problems such as hacks and technical glitches. The CFTC considers bitcoin a commodity and has anti-fraud and manipulation enforcement authority over virtual currency markets. 
Cryptocurrency ""pump-and-dump"" schemes are generally carried out anonymously on public chatrooms or on mobile chat apps.
In the ""pump"" phase, organizers typically post fake or misleading information enticing other investors to buy a token and thus inflate its price. The organizers then quickly sell their holdings of that token - the ""dump"" - and make a profit at the expense of other investors. 
""The price falls and victims are left with currency or tokens that are worth much less than what they expected,"" the CFTC said in its statement.
The CFTC has been expanding its reach over cryptocurrencies, having authorized two large U.S. exchanges to list bitcoin futures late last year.
At a Senate hearing this month, CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo noted that the regulator was focused on cracking down on manipulation of cryptocurrency markets. 
""What we will do and we are doing is looking for fraud and manipulation,"" Giancarlo said. ""And we intend to be very aggressive.""

481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Boeing CEO says 'getting closer' to a deal with Embraer: CNBC,"(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is ""getting closer"" to a deal with Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer (SA:EMBR3), the U.S. plane maker's Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in an interview with CNBC television on Thursday.
Boeing had presented a plan to Brazil's government that would give it an 80 to 90 percent stake in a new venture encompassing Embraer commercial jet business, according to reports last week.
""We have structured a deal concept that will satisfy the needs of everybody involved... I am hopeful we can bring that deal to a successful conclusion... We have some work to do, but we are making clear progress,"" Muilenburg told CNBC.
Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer would give it a leading share of the smaller passenger jet market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries aircraft program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR). 
Both Boeing and Airbus are raising production rates for new commercial aircraft to record levels as they compete with each other for orders amid strong demand for air travel. 
Muilenburg told CNBC the company was ramping up capital expenditure as a percentage of its revenue, with help from recent cuts in the U.S. tax rates.
Boeing expects to makes more than 900 aircraft a year, up from the record 763 in 2017 and 810-815 aircraft deliveries expected in 2018, Muilenburg said, adding that higher production would drive cash flow.
""Last year, our operating cash flow was a little over $13 billion. This year we're guiding to $15 billion of operating cash flow,"" Muilenburg said.
When asked about the possibility of a trade skirmish between the United States and China, Muilenburg said he was keeping a close eye on dialogues between the two countries.

""We've had very good dialogue with the administration, as well as with our Chinese customers and the Chinese government. I think it's important that we have a balanced approach to trade with China.""

482,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 03:11PM ET</span>",Rights group sues to block Ohio Down syndrome abortion ban,"By Kim Palmer
CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The ACLU filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging an Ohio law that criminalizes abortions if a doctor performing a termination is aware that the woman has received a diagnosis that her fetus has Down syndrome.
The Ohio state chapter of the American Civil Liberties union filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, arguing the law violated the liberty and privacy clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Cleveland abortion provider Preterm, seeks to delay enforcement of the law, which is scheduled to go into effect March 23.The law was passed by the state legislature and signed by Governor John Kasich last December. Kasich had previously called the law ""appropriate.""
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.
Under the law, doctors would lose their medical licenses in the state and face a fourth-degree felony charge if they were to perform an abortion with that knowledge. Mothers would not face criminal charges. 
""If Ohio politicians wanted to proactively take a stance for people with disabilities, they should improve access to health care, education, or other services,"" Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. ""This ban is just a thinly-veiled attempt to criminalize abortion in Ohio.""
Officials with the Ohio Attorney General's office could not immediately be reached to comment.
Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis criticized the ACLU suit calling the act of ending a pregnancy after a Down syndrome diagnosis a ""discriminatory abortion."" 
""It is a shame that an organization that claims to be the very biggest and best at defending victims of discrimination completely disregards the most vulnerable members of our society,"" he said in a statement.
The Ohio law marks the 20th restriction on abortion and reproductive rights signed by Kasich since 2011, according to Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio.
Similar laws have been passed in Indiana and North Dakota. An Indiana District Court issued a permanent injunction on a similar Down syndrome abortion ban on Sept. 22, 2017.

Last year, the IRS challenged the company's taxes for 2007-2012 and federal law enforcement officials searched three of its facilities in March in connection with an investigation related to profits earned by a Swiss parts subsidiary, Caterpillar SARL, or CSARL.
That subsidiary was the subject of a 2014 U.S. Senate committee report that concluded Caterpillar shifted billions in profits abroad and had $2.4 billion in taxes deferred or avoided from 2012.
In a regulatory filing, the heavy machinery manufacturer said the relevant transactions were in compliance with the law. ""We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations,"" Caterpillar said in the filing. The U.S. tax overhaul signed into law in December has raised hopes of a settlement with the government. Chief Executive James Umpleby last month said the company was cooperating with authorities and hopeful of a quick resolution. 
The company's shares were up more than 1 percent at $159.31 in afternoon trading.

(Reuters) - Global package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said on Thursday it has secured some of the customer identification records that were visible earlier this month on an unsecured server, and so far has found no evidence that private data was ""misappropriated.""
The server stored more than 119,000 scanned documents from U.S. and international citizens, such as passports, driving licenses, and security identification, according to a report from security research firm Kromtech. https://tinyurl.com/y733bxkb
Kromtech said its researchers found the unsecured server on Feb. 5 and it was closed to public access on Wednesday.
The data was stored on a Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) S3 storage server and collected by a company FedEx acquired in 2014, Bongo International, which calculated international shipping prices and provided other services. FedEx later discontinued the service.
""After a preliminary investigation, we can confirm that some archived Bongo International account information located on a server hosted by a third-party, public cloud provider is secure,"" FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said in a statement. 
""We have found no indication that any information has been misappropriated and will continue our investigation,"" McCluskey said.
McCluskey declined to elaborate on what portion of the records were secure, or whether FedEx had notified authorities. The incident affected a tiny portion of FedEx customers globally.
The exposure appears far less disruptive than a cyber attack last year on Fedex's Dutch TNT Express unit, which slashed $300 million from its quarterly profit.

The Memphis, Tennessee-based company joined a string of companies that reported big drops in earnings because of the NotPetya virus, which hit on June 29, crippling Ukraine businesses before spreading worldwide to shut down shipping ports, factories and corporate offices.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shipping stocks may still be in the doldrums in the view of many investors, but hedge funds have bet at least $675 million on signs of renewed buoyancy in the industry.
Hedge funds made initial forays into shipping stocks in the third quarter of 2017, but significantly stepped up their bets in the final three months of the year, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings compiled by Symmetric show.
""Shipping has been in a terrible trough for a number of years,"" Chris Walvoord, global head of hedge fund research at investment consultant Aon Hewitt, said.
""Hedge funds are starting to see opportunity ... and are calling the bottom on these companies and there are at least a couple out there getting into this space.""
The move by hedge funds comes as signs of a fragile recovery in segments of the global industry are appearing, after a near-decade long slump caused in part by a glut of ships ordered.
""You're looking, over the next two years, for these stocks (in shipping) to rise 50 to 100 percent,"" said William Homan-Russell, head of shipping at $1.5 billion hedge fund and shipping investor Tufton Oceanic. 
""When adjusting for our estimated shipyard costs, share prices are at the lowest prices they've been since 1999.""
HIGH AND DRY
Dry bulk shipping - one of the hardest hit parts of the industry - is expected to see better prospects as fleet growth slows and an expected pick up in demand for commodities such as coal, iron ore and grains bolster employment for bulker vessels.
By contrast, oil tankers are likely to see tougher times for now with weak freight rates hitting bottom lines of operators. 
Hedge fund ownership of Nordic American Tanker, which ships oil, for example, rose to 27 percent at year-end, from 2.4 percent at end-September, according to the data from Symmetric, which tracks investment funds. Data for earlier periods was not immediately available. 
And ownership by hedge funds of Dryships Inc, which is active in dry bulk, tanker and offshore shipping markets, meanwhile, rose to 80 percent, from 10.3 percent. 
Hedge funds had invested $308 million in Kirby Corp, $26 million in Nordic American Tanker and $9 million in Dryships.
Dry bulk firm Golden Ocean and oil transporter Teekay Tankers were also popular as well as Ship Finance International, which has a diversified fleet, the data showed. 
Funds had also invested $35 million to their holdings of Golden Ocean and $77 million in Ship Finance International.
Greywolf Capital Management, which initially invested in Tanker Investment before it merged with Teekay Tankers, is now among the hedge funds holding a combined $39 million in Teekay stock, and is bullish for the sector's prospects.
“We’re starting to see fundamental improvement in many shipping markets with rates moving up, not because of temporary events, but rather as a result of a true balancing of supply and demand,"" a spokesman for Greywolf said. 
""With global growth accelerating, this an industry we continue to focus on and that should deliver highly attractive returns in the coming years.”
A spokesman for Blue Mountain declined to comment.
Some hedge funds have started moving into liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker stocks, investing $4 million in Dynagas LNG Partners, and $62 million in Golar LNG Partners after pulling back from the sector in the preceding three months. 
Although other investors pulled back from LNG stocks, a pick up in transport demand has helped the outlook for vessel owners in the LNG sector.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission inspector general will investigate whether its chairman was biased in favor of Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, which is seeking approval from the watchdog for a $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, a member of Congress said on Thursday.
Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, in November asked the inspector general to investigate, citing FCC decisions he said had benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a media report that the election campaign of President Donald Trump struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.
""I am particularly concerned about reports that Chairman (Ajit) Pai may have coordinated with Sinclair to time a series of Commission actions to benefit the company. I am grateful to the FCC’s Inspector General that he has decided to take up this important investigation,"" Pallone said in a statement. 
Pallone cited the FCC's decision in April to reverse a 2016 decision limiting the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy, paving the way for the Sinclair-Tribune deal.
Pallone also said the FCC's decision to allow the TV industry to transition to a new digital standard ""could provide billions of dollars in licensing fees to Sinclair through its patent holdings"" and a vote to change existing broadcast media ownership limits removed obstacles ""to Sinclair increasing its reach beyond the Tribune merger proposal.""
Political media company Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December 2016 that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.
Pai has repeatedly denied he has taken actions aimed at benefiting a single company and Sinclair has denied improper conduct.
A spokesman for Pai said on Thursday the ""accusation that he has shown favoritism toward the company is absurd,"" citing the FCC's $13 million proposed fine of Sinclair over undisclosed paid programming. He said Pai's actions on media rules ""have been consistent with his long-held reviews."" 
The inspector general's office has not confirmed the investigation.
Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said last year ""it has reached a point where all our media policy decisions seem to be custom built for this one company.""
Sinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.
The FCC's said last month it was pausing its informal 180-day timetable for completing its review of the transaction to evaluate Sinclair's offer of divestitures.

504,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 12:33PM ET</span>",U.S. Bancorp to pay $613 million for money-laundering violations,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has reached a $613 million settlement with U.S. Bancorp (N:USB) over charges that it willfully failed to have an adequate anti-money-laundering program, the department said on Thursday.
As part of the settlement, U.S. Bancorp agreed to forfeit $453 million and to pay fines to the Treasury Department, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department said in a statement.
It said that the bank, through its subsidiary U.S. Bank National Association, deliberately ran an inadequate anti-money-laundering program from 2009 to 2014. U.S. Bancorp failed to detect large numbers of suspicious transactions and concealed its missteps from regulators, it said.
""We regret and have accepted responsibility for the past deficiencies in our AML (anti-money-laundering) program. Our culture of ethics and integrity demands that we do better,"" President and Chief Executive Andy Cecere said in a statement.
Under the settlement, the Justice Department agreed to dismiss the charges against the Minneapolis-based bank in two years if it meets the terms of the agreement. The bank said it has overhauled its anti-money-laundering policies in recent years to address the issues.
The Justice Department said the bank limited the number of transactions its systems would flag as suspicious based on its staffing levels. A 2009 memo from the bank's anti-money laundering officer warned that staff was ""stretched dangerously thin,"" and U.S. Bancorp hid its limitations from regulators, it said.
The Justice Department also claimed the bank processed Western Union transactions for non-customers, even though those transactions would not be monitored. The bank barred those wire transfers in 2014.
Authorities also charged that the bank willfully failed to report suspicious banking activities of a longtime customer, Scott Tucker, from 2011 to 2013.
Tucker, who ran a payday lending business through various Native American tribes, ran roughly $2 billion through the bank's accounts. He was convicted in October of charges tied to that business, although he intends to appeal.
The Justice Department statement said the bank overlooked several red flags from Tucker's business, including using accounts bearing the names of tribes for his personal expenses, such as a vacation home and a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) racing team.
The bank did not flag any of Tucker's activity to regulators as suspicious until served with a Justice Department subpoena in 2013.
The Justice Department recommended that the $453 million forfeiture be remitted to people who took out high-interest loans with Tucker.

Shares in U.S. Bancorp were down 0.0904 percent at $55.26 at 11:45 a.m. EST, in line with the Dow Jones U.S. Bank Index (DJUSBK).

510,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",What Turns Corrections Into Bear Markets,"Investing.com - Corrections may be considered healthy occurrences for stock markets, but there's always the chance that they are actually just the beginning of a bear market.Unfortunately, for anxious investors there's no way of knowing if that will happen.History, however, offers some grounds for hope.First off, less than half of all corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning a decline of 20% from the market peak over a two-month period.Secondly, most bear markets are associated with recessions, and there are no signs the economy is in trouble.Only one of the dozen corrections since 1976 that were not accompanied by a recession evolved into a bear market.Still, some analysts are worried trouble lies ahead because market declines as swift and severe as the recent one are quite rare. The last time stocks fell 10% in less than two weeks time was in 1928, and that was followed by the stock market crash of 1929 and the worst bear market in history."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A panel of U.S. regulators will next week discuss whether global insurer Prudential (N:PRU) should continue to be subject to stringent oversight, according to a public notice and a company statement.
The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which designates which financial companies would pose a risk to the country's financial system if they failed, said on Wednesday it would hold a meeting on Feb. 21 to discuss the ""annual reevaluation of the designation of a nonbank financial company"".
Prudential said in a statement Thursday it was the company under review. The insurer has said it does not merit the ""too big to fail"" designation it was pinned with in the wake of the financial crisis.
""We have and continue to maintain that we do not meet the standard for designation and that flaws in the designation process led to this outcome,"" said company spokesman Andrew Simonelli in a statement. ""We look forward to making our case to FSOC as part of our annual designation review, which is now underway.""
Prudential is the only non-bank financial company currently designated as a ""systemically important financial institution"" by FSOC. The panel last year released rival insurer AIG from the label, and agreed this month to drop its earlier appeal against a court decision releasing MetLife (NYSE:MET) from the label.
The FSOC meeting is the first step towards Prudential also potentially being released from the label which demands more stringent oversight and higher capital requirements.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen asked a U.S. judge to force a female executive to arbitrate her claims that his firm, Point72 Asset Management LP, maintains a hostile working environment where women are mistreated and paid less than men.
In a Wednesday night filing in the U.S. district court in Manhattan, Cohen and Point72 said the plaintiff, Lauren Bonner, agreed to arbitrate employment disputes as a condition of working at the Stamford, Connecticut-based firm.
They faulted Bonner's ""indisputable failure"" to honor her June 2016 employment agreement, by suing for damages and an injunction against further discrimination, and said her lawsuit should be dismissed or put on hold.
Bonner plans to respond by a Feb. 28 deadline, her lawyer Jeanne Christensen said in a email on Thursday. Cohen has not been accused of inappropriate behavior.
Arbitration can offer defendants procedural protections not available in court, and keep potentially unpleasant details out of the public eye because proceedings are private.
Roughly 60.1 million U.S. workers are subject to arbitration agreements in their employment, according to the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute.
Bonner, an associate director, alleged that ""structural sexism"" pervades Point72, where men can be paid twice as much as women for the same work, and women's abilities and bodies are regularly denigrated.
Her complaint included an allegation that President Douglas Haynes, also a defendant, left the word ""pussy"" for several weeks on a whiteboard in his office.
In a statement after the complaint was filed on Monday, Point72 denied Bonner's allegations, stood by its treatment of women, and said ""our female investment professional workforce exceeds published industry averages - a direct result of our concerted and sustained focus on promoting diversity.""
Cohen has been preparing to resume handling outside money following the recent lifting of a two-year ban by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said he failed to supervise a portfolio manager who conducted insider trading at his former firm, SAC Capital Advisors LP.
Though Cohen was not charged in that case, SAC pleaded guilty and paid $1.8 billion to resolve various probes.
Point72 has been managing Cohen's personal fortune. Forbes magazine estimates his net worth at $14 billion.
On Tuesday, the defendants asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to seal Bonner's complaint, saying it revealed ""highly confidential and sensitive"" details, including pay, and accused Bonner of trying to harm Point72's reputation and perhaps ""generate publicity.""
Christensen plans to respond to that request by a Friday deadline.

The case is Bonner v Point72 Asset Management LP et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01233.

Blackstone last month agreed to buy a majority stake in Thomson Reuters' Financial & Risk division, which competes against privately held Bloomberg in providing bankers and investors with news, data and analytics.
Executives with Woodbridge Co, a private Toronto firm that holds the Thomson family's majority stake in Thomson Reuters, disagreed with David Thomson and supported the deal, the newspaper said. The Thomson family owns 64 percent of Thomson Reuters through Woodbridge.
Woodbridge CEO David Binet, who is also deputy chairman of Thomson Reuters, could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Thomson Reuters declined comment. 
Thomson eventually voted in favor of the deal, but only after telling other directors he was concerned they had not sought a higher price or considered other potential buyers for the business, according to the newspaper, which did not identify its sources. 
Blackstone last summer initiated talks to buy a majority of the Financial & Risk business, a deal strongly supported by Thomson Reuters Chief Executive Jim Smith and directors including Woodbridge's Binet, according to the newspaper. 

Reuters News will remain a unit of Thomson Reuters and provide news to the Financial & Risk business after the deal is completed.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Toyota design chief sees future without mass-market cars,"NAGOYA (Reuters) - As sharing services change car use and ownership, Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) new design chief believes that vehicles will shift towards either generic boxes on wheels for everyday use or ultra-luxury cars, wiping out the need for mass-market models.
Simon Humphries, responsible for design at the automaker's Toyota and Lexus brands, said that fleets of electric, self-driving shuttle bus-like vehicles could one day eliminate the need for people to drive themselves around on a daily basis. 
This could one day make cars like its popular Camry and Corolla models obsolete down the line.
""On one side we're going to see this optimized (transport) system, but on the other side you're going to see a pure race car,"" Humphries, who last month became general manager of Toyota's advanced R&D and engineering company, told reporters in Nagoya. 
""There will be an emotional solution, and a practical solution. So maybe the story is that the middle ground is increasingly going to disappear.""
Toyota, one of the world's largest automakers which for years has focused on building reliable, fun to drive cars, is now also looking beyond personal-use vehicles to survive in an industry which is being transformed by the onslaught of electrification, automation and other new technologies.
As automakers compete to come up with new, profitable transport services, Toyota last month showed a self-driving electric concept vehicle which can be used as buses, mobile shops or moving offices. 
Toyota plans to test these next-generation vehicles in the early 2020s.
The ability for cars to drive themselves in the future, along with the development of electric cars, will be a game-changer for vehicle design, Humphries said, as it will eliminate the need for steering wheels, engines, petrol tanks and other traditional parts, enabling more flexibility to design vehicles which are more fit-for-purpose.
""At the moment everything in a car from a design point of view is based on a 100-year old package -- engine in the front, and a driver holding a steering wheel behind,"" he said.
""When you don’t have to hold a steering wheel, the world is your oyster.""

First off, potential buyers want to hear from newly installed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who’s scheduled to testify on the economy at Congress Feb. 28. After stronger-than-anticipated U.S. wage and inflation data in recent weeks, the key questions are what’s his take on the outlook for monetary tightening, and what does he make of the jump of almost a percentage point in the 10-year yield since September.
""Investors will be reluctant to take positions until Fed Chairman Powell’s testimony,” said Kenta Inoue, a senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. in Tokyo. ""There is a vague concern about how the Fed would communicate with the market under the new leadership.""
The speed of the move up in U.S. yields has caught many by surprise. Accompanied by a tumble in the dollar that’s made it more costly for Japanese investors to hedge foreign-exchange risks, it’s raised the bar for Japan-based buyers. The yen has climbed almost 6 percent this year. It was at 106.39 per dollar as of 5:59 p.m. in Tokyo Thursday, having reached 106.18 earlier, the strongest since November 2016.
The question for Japan-based investors is ""how do you balance the attractive yield with the cost of hedging if you expect the dollar to weaken,"" said Jean Medecin, a member of the investment committee at French asset manager Carmignac Gestion SA.
The 10-year Treasury yield probably needs to hit at least 3 percent to spur the appetite of Japanese funds, a number of market participants said.
""Japanese investors are expected to buy if the 10-year bond yield rises to 3 percent and markets stabilize after the recent selloff in global shares,"" said Jun Kato, chief market analyst at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
Shuichi Ohsaki, chief rates strategist for Japan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) Ltd., had much the same take, while adding that some investors may want to hold off further, until the Japanese financial year begins on April 1.
Before that comes Powell’s testimony in what’s referred to as Humphrey-Hawkins hearings at House and Senate committees, followed by the Federal Reserve’s March 20-21 policy meeting that includes a press conference with the chairman.
Given the danger that Trump administration’s fiscal policies pose for bond yields, investors will be watching whether Powell can convince that inflation and market volatility are under control, Kato at Shinkin said.

A spokeswoman confirmed a report in the Manager Magazin monthly that the supervisory board had decided not to extend the contract of Jesper Andersen that is due to end in June, but declined to give reasons.
The magazine said the driving force behind the departure of the 47-year-old Dane was Michael Herz, co-owner of the coffee chain Tchibo. The Tchibo holding company, which owns a 51 percent stake in Beiersdorf, declined to comment.
Andersen, who previously worked for more than two decades at consumer products group Colgate-Palmolive (N:CL), was appointed to the Beiersdorf executive board in 2015 and took over from long-serving CFO Ulrich Schmidt in 2016.
Beiersdorf last month posted a 5.7 percent underlying rise in group sales in 2017, faster than the 4 to 5 percent gain it had forecast, and said it was optimistic for 2018. It announces full 2017 figures on March 1. [nL8N1P359W]

The increase in inflation supports the Federal Reserve raising interest rates this year, with many analysts expecting three rate increases.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stocks were among the biggest movers after the morning bell, rising 2.35% after it announced it was looking to spend its build up of cash, as traders speculate it will increase its dividend. Meanwhile Teva Pharma Industries Ltd ADR (NYSE:TEVA) surged 9.88% while TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP) rose 14.05% after it reported higher than expected earnings results.
Elsewhere  Shopify Inc  (NYSE:SHOP) was down 4.16% while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dipped 0.65% and semiconductor Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) inched down 0.37%.
Investors remained unphased by mixed economic data. The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rebounded from near 45-year lows, but was still in line with expectations.
Meanwhile U.S. producer prices rose by 0.4% while the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing index rose to nearly three points to 25.8. In another report, the  Empire State manufacturing  index fell to a reading of 13.10 from 17.70 in January. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
In Europe stocks were up. In Germany the DAX rose 32 points or 0.26% while France’s CAC 40 increased 68 points or 1.32% and in London the FTSE 100 gained 31 points or 0.43%. Meanwhile Spain’s IBEX 35 was up 36 points or 0.38% and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 inched up 15 points or 0.36%.
In commodities, gold futures were down 0.12% to $1,356.40 a troy ounce while crude oil futures fell 0.43% to $60.34 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.34% to 88.61."

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  XPO Logistics  Inc (N:XPO) said on Thursday it expects to make or manage 750,000 deliveries of bulky goods like flat-screen televisions and furniture to homes in Europe in 2018, as the U.S.-based company dips its toe into a crowded and fast-growing market. 
The Greenwich, Connecticut-based delivery and warehousing company is the largest provider of ""last-mile"" deliveries from warehouses direct to homes in North America, handling or managing some 13 million drop offs in 2017. Last week XPO said it was taking that service to Europe, but did not disclose expected volume.
The company told Reuters its projected volume ahead of an announcement on the service expected later on Thursday.
""That's more volume than people would have expected in year one,"" said Stephens Inc analyst Jack Atkins. ""I don't think it's material for the profitability of the company, but it's a nice start.""
XPO has used rapid-fire acquisitions to grow from a $175 million truck brokerage company in 2012 to a $15.38 billion freight and logistics behemoth, but its European expansion, for now, is being built organically.
In Europe, XPO hopes to capture a bigger slice of a deeply fragmented market where, similar to U.S. trends, consumers are increasingly demanding delivery of unwieldy or intricate products they buy online or in stores, ranging from refrigerators to servers for data centers.
Seko Logistics, which competes with XPO in the United States on deliveries of large and bulky items, is also expanding its home delivery business in Europe for products that require extra installation like medical devices or golf simulation machines.
""The opportunity is immense across Europe, in the multi-multi billion-dollar range,"" said Seko spokesman Brian Bourke. 
XPO declined to name any new customers or quantify investments in new hubs, trucks and employees. It already counts Swedish furniture brand IKEA and Zara,  Inditex  SA's (MC:ITX) clothes retailer, as customers, and has been building its delivery network of trucking contractors on the continent.

The expansion comes after XPO began testing its direct-to-household service in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Netherlands in 2016, and has moved to Spain and France.

567,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 08:33AM ET</span>",VIX Curve Improves by Most Since 2008 as Volatility Jolt Fades,"(Bloomberg) -- For the VIX futures curve, time has healed all wounds.
The enormous spread between front and second-month VIX futures contracts, which are tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, was a barometer of just how roiled the market was during the recent downturn. It also caused severe pain (and in one case, death) for some products linked to the VIX.
Generally, the VIX futures curve tends to slope upward -- called contango -- in accordance with the notion that uncertainty surrounding the range of possibilities for equities increases over time. In times of stress, it shifts to the opposite curve structure, known as backwardation, a sign that traders are acutely fixated on the near-term risks. At the S&P 500 Index’s lows on Friday, this gap between the second and front-month contracts was nearly -9.5.
The spread between the second and front-month VIX futures contracts has tightened by 7.5 points. That’s primarily a function of the roll in VIX futures contracts, as a relatively expensive February contract is no longer trading as of yesterday. The active front-month contract is now March. The move has pushed the spread between the two contracts back into positive territory. It’s poised to be the second-largest daily shrinkage in this gap on record, surpassed only by Aug. 20, 2008.
Not coincidentally, that was also a day when VIX futures contracts rolled.
The February VIX expiry -- and the expiration of many stock-linked options on Friday -- will subtly shift the investment calculus for a handful of exchange-traded products that deal in derivatives, in some cases removing lingering overhangs.
In the case of VIX futures, for example, this move should relieve some of the headwind for surviving short-volatility products like the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded fund (SVXY) and reduce the recent tailwind that long-volatility products like iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note (ticker VXX) have enjoyed.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 08:16AM ET</span>",World stocks shrug off bond market angst over inflation,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks and commodities steamed higher on Thursday, suddenly shrugging off the angst that has burst out in recent weeks over higher global borrowing costs on the back of rising inflation.
Economists were struggling to explain the shift except for the argument that historically it's not unusual for stocks and bond market borrowing costs to rise in tandem with a rapidly expanding economy.
Some just blamed the weather and time of year. They speculated that Wednesday's strong U.S. inflation data that many had predicted could reignite the rout was probably distorted while Asian bears may be squaring up positions for Chinese new year. 
Whatever the reason though, the animal spirits were back for riskier assets like stocks. 
Big gains for Wall Street (N) and Asia overnight put MSCI's 47-country world stocks index (MIWD00000PUS) back in positive territory for the year and Europe's main markets followed with 0.6 - 1 percent gains. (EU) 
""For me it's a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam.
""The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,"" he added. ""2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that's still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long."" 
Wall Street futures (ESc1) (N) were also pointing higher but just as big a puzzle as the sudden rebound in stocks sentiment was the break down in correlation between rising U.S. bond yields and dollar. 
U.S. Treasury yields on benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) hit a fresh four-year high of 2.94 percent which also dragged gap to 0.786 percent German Bunds  out to its widest in 10 months. [US/][GVD/EUR]
The dollar tumbled though across the board, including to a 15-month low against the yen of 106.18 yen as worries about the U.S. government's finances seemed to set again after a White House-led spending splurge and recent corporate tax cuts.
That also marked a drop of 3.8 percent from its early February peak near 110.50 yen, while the euro (EUR=) and pound  both climbed back above the $1.25 and $1.40 thresholds. [FRX/]
""The story I hear most frequently from people is it's the re-emergence of the twin deficits,"" said RBC Capital Markets head of currency strategy Adam Cole, in London, of the dollar's persistent weakness. 
""There seem to be concerns on the U.S. fiscal position and what that implies for the current account.""
VOLATILITY DROPS
Asia's stocks rally overnight saw Australian shares (AXJO) climb 1.15 percent and South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) added 1.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei (N225) shrugged off the normal drag of a stronger yen to advance 1.5 percent following three successive down day that had taken it to a four-month low. (T)
Volatility shriveled back too. The VIX index (VIX) - Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" and a measure of market volatility - fell all the way back to 18, less than half the 50-point peak touched last week.
The dollar's weakness also lifted emerging markets and commodities though there were a number of idiosyncratic stories in play too.
After weeks of frenzied speculation, the resignation of South Africa's President Jacob Zuma sent the rand  to a 2-1/2-year high of 11.66 and put the country's stock market (JTOPI) on course for its best day in three years.
In reaction to Zuma's resignation, Moody's, which is about to make a decision on whether to remove the country last investment grade credit rating, said it was focused on the new leadership's response to low growth and implementing reforms.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) shot up over 1 percent meanwhile to $65.06 per barrel before losing momentum and trudging back to $63.87. [O/R]
While the greenback's woes were a big factor, the moves came after a surge the previous day triggered by supply data and comments from Saudi Arabia that major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than end supply cuts too early. [O/R]
Metals copper and gold  both shone too. 

Gold  rose to a 10-day top of $1,357 per ounce, while copper  - seen as a sensitive indicator of the health of the global economy - was on track for a weekly gain of more than 6 percent. [GOL/][MET/L]

570,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Virgin Money creates rare female top team with new hire,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Esha Vaish
(Reuters) - Virgin Money (L:VM) on Thursday appointed former HSBC (L:HSBA) executive Irene Dorner as chairwoman, creating a rare female duo at the top of one of Britain's FTSE 350 listed companies.
Virgin Money had said in October it was in talks to hire Dorner, who will join Jayne-Anne Gadhia who is the first female CEO of a listed British bank.
Dorner joins Virgin Money's board as chair elect and takes over from outgoing Chairman Glen Moreno on March 31.
Dorner held many roles at HSBC, including chief executive of HSBC USA, and has also been a non-executive director at French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) and British engineering group Rolls Royce (L:RR).
""Irene brings a wealth of experience and expertise in banking and financial services ... I am proud to be leaving a strong and diverse board,"" Moreno said. 
Gadhia has been an advocate for greater representation of women in senior roles in Britain's financial services sector, where the four big banks all have male chief executives and chairmen. 
Women directors are still relatively few in Britain despite government efforts to encourage companies to appoint more.
Dorner's appointment would make Virgin Money the only FTSE 350 company to have an all female duo at the helm.
Gadhia oversaw the creation of the government's Women in Finance Charter in 2016, which had 162 signatories as of November, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
Theresa May, who became only the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher, has criticized the finance industry for failing to promote and retain women and the government has a voluntary target for FTSE 350 companies to have 33 percent women directors by 2020.
There were only 38 women in executive directorship roles in 2017 across FTSE 250 boards, accounting for just 7.7 percent of the overall board representation, according to a report by Cranfield University and University of Exeter.
Based on the information in that report, Dorner would be only the fifth female executive director of a FTSE 250 finance company.
Other senior women in finance include Ana Botin, who is executive chairman of Santander (MC:SAN) and Inga Beale, who is CEO of Lloyd's of London . 
Last December,  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) appointed Val Rahmani as an independent non-executive director to its male-majority board.

Britain's finance industry has also faced criticism for lack of transparency about ethnic diversity in management. Britain's two biggest banks, Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) having recently set diversity targets.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>","EU tells Facebook, Google and Twitter to do more for users","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's justice commissioner told Facebook (O:FB), Twitter (N:TWTR) and Google (O:GOOGL) on Thursday to do more to bring their user terms in line with EU law, ramping up pressure on the tech giants after their efforts were deemed too little.
The European Union executive and consumer protection authorities said the three companies have only partially addressed concerns about their liability and how users were informed about content removal or contract terminations.
The authorities across the bloc, who requested the changes last year, have the power to fine the firms if they do not comply.
European Commissioner Vera Jourova said the use of social media networks as advertising and commercial platforms meant they faced the same rules as offline service providers.
""EU consumer rules should be respected and if companies don't comply, they should face sanctions,"" Jourova said in a statement. ""Some companies are now making their platforms safer for consumers; however, it is unacceptable that this is still not complete and it is taking so much time.""
Facebook said it had worked with EU authorities to make changes to its terms and to ensure greater transparency. It said further updates of the terms were planned later this year.
""We have long had tools in place to inform people about content removals and intend to expand these tools later this year,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said.
A Google spokesman declined to comment and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Commission said the U.S. trio had agreed to amend some terms that limit their liability, waive a users right to withdraw from online purchases and force European consumers to seek redress in California, where the firms are based, instead of the consumer's home country. 
They have also agreed to change terms that release the social media firms from the duty of identifying commercial and sponsored content, the Commission said.
U.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy issues to how quickly they remove illegal or threatening content.

The Commission said national authorities would monitor the implementation of changes made, make use of the procedures offered by the companies to handle illegal content and ""may take action including enforcement measures where necessary.""

""Our top line remains under pressure as we continue to operate in challenging macro and competitive conditions, particularly in our largest markets,"" Chief Financial Officer Jamie Wilson said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African stocks index rose as much as 5 percent on Thursday, putting the main index on track for its biggest one-day gain in more than three years, on hopes the resignation of Jacob Zuma as president paves the way for new leaders to quicken the pace of economic growth. 
Zuma quit late on Wednesday, reluctantly heeding orders by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to bring an end to a nine-year tenure punctuated by scandals, stagnant economic growth and policy uncertainty. [nL8N1Q51P4]
As of 1140 GMT, the blue chip Top-40 index (JTOPI) surged 4.19 percent to 52,683 points, pulling back from a high of 53,072 achieved earlier but still on course for its biggest one-day gain since September 2015. The broader All-share index <.JALSH> was up 3.3 percent at 59,317 points.
""The big news is that Zuma has now resigned and that has created a lot of euphoria ... South African incorporated, banks, retailers and the like are all looking sharply better as a result,"" said Independent Securities' trader Ryan Woods.
South African banks, considered the barometer of both economic and political sentiment, were a feature on the gainers' list. The banking index <.JBANK> surged 5.5 percent with Nedbank (J:NEDJ) rising 6.4 percent and rival FirstRand (J:FSRJ) up 6.2 percent. 
Banks have largely borne the brunt of Zuma's policy decisions that included the sacking of two respected finance ministers, Nhlanhla Nene and Pravin Gordhan. That, along with a weak economy, contributed to sovereign credit ratings downgrades to junk by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. 
In reaction to Zuma's resignation, ratings agency Moody's said it was focused on the new leadership's response to economic challenges and the progress it makes in pushing through policy reforms.
NEW ORDER
Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, former chairman of African biggest telecoms operator MTN Group (J:MTNJ), is expected to replace Zuma as president on Thursday. 
Ramaphosa, who has vowed to fight corruption and revitalize the economy, is seen by business leaders and investors as well placed to turn around the economy. South Africa's GDP is estimated to grow by less than 1 percent this year.
Another key issue facing the 65-year-old is policy uncertainty in South Africa’s mining industry, an important economic engine which has been fighting in court with Zuma's mines minister, Mosebenzi Zwane, over an increase in black ownership targets.
But some analysts said that the former union leader's to-do list is way too long to make an immediate impact.
""Financial markets, investors and business owners are not going to be distracted by the early removal of yet another sitting president for much longer and the attention will turn to what the new order intends to do and when it will do it,"" analysts at NKC African Economics said in a note. 
In the foreign exchange market, the rand also advanced, extending gains for a second straight day to levels last seen three years ago. 
The currency has been rising since December on signs that Zuma - under whose tenure in Africa's most advanced economy has hardly expanded - was heading towards being ousted.

At 1124 GMT, the rand  was at 11.6575 against the dollar, 0.5 percent stronger than its New York overnight close and at levels last seen in February 2015.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>",Google's app network quietly becomes huge growth engine,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google makes ads show up in more smartphone apps than any other technology company. That is the core of a resurgent business for parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. 
Google's ad network unit has posted three straight quarters of year-over-year double-digit sales increases. The business is nearing $20 billion in annual revenue, making it as important to Google’s top-line as its hardware, cloud computing and app store groups combined.
For years, the star of the network was Google's AdSense, which delivers ads to websites in exchange for a cut of ad revenue. But as consumers migrate from desktop computing to mobile, momentum has shifted to AdMob, Google's mass-market tool for third-party apps, and DoubleClick for Publishers, its higher-end mobile software.
Google has lured app developers from competitors by lowering commissions and simplifying software. And it is increasingly satisfying advertisers with hot new formats such as video.
Advertisers are taking notice. Alex Hewson, managing partner at M&C Saatchi Mobile, said the London-based ad buying agency has used AdMob for years, but only recently has it become the ""top supplier.""
""They've engaged big developers and done that well,"" Hewson said.
But it has come at a cost. Google is growing by giving app and website creators a bigger chunk of ad sales. In last year's final quarter, Google's portion fell by $33 million compared to the year-earlier period even though overall network revenue rose $559 million.
The company is feeling the heat. Alphabet shares dipped 5 percent after missing profit estimates this month.
""They are chasing top-line growth and beating the competition by losing margins,"" said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst with Pivotal Research, a New York City firm that provides stock guidance.
(For a graphic on Google's network revenue, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2Ejk1e2) 
TOP PLAYER
Still, Google's strategy is winning customers. Google gives developers about 70 cents of every $1 it collects from ad buyers, compared to 50 cents to 60 cents at some competitors. 
The high payouts, coupled with Google's entrenched relationship with millions of advertisers, has turned Google into the main revenue source for many apps. Purchases of in-app ads nearly tripled last year compared to 2016 on Google's DoubleClick Bid Manager, used by advertisers with the biggest budgets.
Over 1.1 million Android apps include Google's ad software, double from a year ago, making it by far the fastest-growing and most widely used ad service, according to research firm MightySignal. Google's iPhone market share is only slightly behind. 
The biggest choice for many app creators is between Google's AdMob and DoubleClick. It is not clear which is growing faster because Google does not provide that data. 
AdMob, which was designed specifically for mobile, tends to attract ads promoting apps and smartphone services. Google bought AdMob for $750 million in 2010, beating a bid from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Google needed technology fresher than AdSense to deliver in-app ads, according to Sissie Hsiao, who leads the company's apps business.
""Just taking our web stuff and slapping it on wasn't going to be a sufficient strategy,"" she said. 
Chinese app maker Cheetah Mobile Inc turned to AdMob last year, shifting focus from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's Audience Network. Google paid better and offered more ads, said Vincent Jiang, chief financial officer for Cheetah, which has 589 million monthly users for its games and a popular memory-clearing app known as Clean Master.
Google's DoubleClick ad tool, meanwhile, requires customization to maximize revenue. Companies with many websites and apps use it to integrate ads that they sell on their terms.
Argentine developer Etermax SA moved its well-known Trivia Crack game and another app to DoubleClick from AdMob last year and plans to shift three more this year, according to Tomás Cavanagh, business planner for Etermax. 
""They grow fast all the time and their user interface is easy to use,"" Cavanagh said of Google.
Simplicity has attracted advertisers, too. They now can eliminate a manual task and instead rely on Google to automatically resize video ads to a fit any phone.
Competitors can do little but grumble. Google overcame U.S. antitrust scrutiny to buy AdMob, and calls for breaking up the company's ad machine have not gained traction in Washington.
Abhay Singhal, chief revenue officer at InMobi, an AdMob competitor, said Google is not necessarily ""the best game in town, but put any product into Google’s huge ad pool with that muscle and it will drive huge penetration.""
NEXT STEPS
Financial analysts expect Google's profit to keep eroding as ad buyers gravitate to apps, where Google says developer deals remain costly. Cowen & Co analysts estimate Google to give developers nearly 80 cents on the dollar by 2023.
Staffing up in Asia and Latin America, the next big growth markets for mobile advertising, could cost Google as well.
Advertisers also want Google to make technology upgrades so they can better monitor where their mobile ads appear. 

Hewson of M&C Saatchi Mobile said he has told Google, ""It can’t just be, 'We’re Google. Trust us.'""

577,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 06:55AM ET</span>","Hedge funds wager on rising wages and inflation with consumer, materials shares","By David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In late 2017, several well-known hedge funds made bets on companies selling goods considered non-essential by consumers and on companies processing raw materials, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission published on Wednesday.
Companies in the ""consumer discretionary"" sector can take advantage of rising wages and prices, meaning the hedge funds may be well placed even as inflation fears have sent U.S. stocks into retreat for much of the past two weeks.
Tiger Management, run by billionaire investor Julian Robertson Jr., made broad bets on consumer discretionary stocks, with new positions in Papa John's International Inc, Penske Automotive Group Inc, and Domino's Pizza Inc.
Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn added 13 new positions in consumer discretionary companies, including stakes in amusement park company SeaWorld Entertainment Inc, photo printing service Shutterly Inc and department store  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN).
Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ)'s William Ackman made a new bet on sportswear maker  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), buying 5.8 million shares, late last year. He also increased his bet on snackfood maker Mondelez by 66 percent to own 23.3 million shares.
And George Soros' eponymous Soros Fund Management LLC took new stakes in retailers  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) as well as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), filings showed, becoming the third largest Overstock shareholder.
U.S. wages in January logged their biggest annual increase since the end of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, meaning consumers may have more to spend, even though Labor Department figures on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month.
In the past two weeks concerns that rising inflation will push the Federal Reserve to accelerate its forecast interest rate rises this year have erased the S&P 500 stock index's gains for the year, after a 5.6 per cent rise in January, the strongest performance for that month since 1997.
The quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings, in the so-called 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision, are one of the few public ways of tracking what managers buy and sell.
Relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy carries some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
Farallon Capital Management LLC, a $25.4 billion San Francisco-based fund founded by Tom Steyer, added new positions in materials companies  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co and Tronox Ltd, according to regulatory filings released on Tuesday.
Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, also added a position in Monsanto in the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to filings. Shares of the agricultural company are up nearly 3.0 percent for the year to date, about two percentage points more than the benchmark S&P 500 stock index.
Overall, hedge funds have their highest exposure to commodities since 2012, according to a report by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
HEDGE FUNDS GAIN 4.1 PCT IN JAN
Hedge funds posted an estimated 4.1 percent gain in January, the Credit Suisse report said, with the largest gains coming in positions in consumer discretionary and healthcare stocks.
""January's record performance provided a buffer to February's vol-inspired risk-off move,"" said Mark Connors, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in the note. ""Managers appear to be weathering the storm well.""
The 13F filings also showed that managers expected healthcare stocks to trade higher during the last three months of 2017.
A number added fresh positions before the sector came under pressure from the recent stock market volatility and from the move by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to team with  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to reduce employee healthcare costs.
Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors listed a new position in  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM), which is working with private equity firms to buy Kindred Healthcare Inc. The stock has gained 8.0 percent this year, likely benefiting Jason Karp's Tourbillion which bought in with 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter.
Brahman Capital bought nearly 10 million shares of Teva Pharmaceuticals not long after Kare Schultz was tapped to head the world's biggest seller of generic drugs.
Among notable activist investors, Carl Icahn increased his position in  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX) by 56 percent.
Greenlight's Einhorn, meanwhile, reduced his stake in General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) by 25 percent. Einhorn unsuccessfully lobbied the carmaker to split its stock in 2017. Shares of the company are up 2.0 percent for the year to date.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 06:44AM ET</span>",India's PNB says has ability to recover after uncovering giant fraud,"By Manoj Kumar and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Punjab National Bank , India's second-largest state-run lender, said on Thursday it has the capability and capacity to recover after uncovering a staggering $1.77 billion fraud at one of its branches that went undetected for years.
The loan fraud - the largest ever in Indian history - has sent PNB's (NS:PNBK) shares tumbling about 20 percent this week. 
""This cancer that's been going on since 2011, we have brought it out and we are resolving it,"" PNB's Chief Executive Sunil Mehta said at a press briefing, adding that the bank would honor all its commitments.
""If the entire onus is on us, we will take responsibility,"" Mehta said, adding the bank has taken action to book culprits and protect its financial interests.
The bank said Nirav Modi, a billionaire jeweler and diamond merchant it believes to be at the center of the fraud case, has so far not come up with any concrete plan to repay PNB. The bank said it has asked Modi to come up with a formal repayment plan.
Modi's jewelry stores and other business establishments were raided by law enforcement officials in Mumbai and New Delhi on Thursday, Reuters witnesses said. 
Modi, who has not spoken about the case so far, could not be reached for comment. His flagship company Firestar Diamond has said it had no involvement in the case.
Indian bank shares slid further on Thursday a day after being hit by news of the bank fraud.
PNB, which has assets of $120 billion, disclosed the fraud in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, saying it had referred the matter to law enforcement agencies.
Given the scale of the fraud, the fallout from the case could spread and give rise to fresh questions about lending procedures at Indian lenders, particularly public sector banks, mired in soured debt.
ONGOING PROBE
PNB first notified India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of its discovery in late January, and on Monday it issued a ""caution notice"" to warn other lenders about the suspected fraud.
PNB has said that two junior officials at one of its branches in Mumbai had illegally issued ""letters of undertaking"" to get overseas branches of other lenders to extend credit to ""a few select account holders,"" most notably companies with ties to Modi, who runs a global diamond jewelry business. 
Indian federal agents last week said they were investigating the jeweler and others over accusations that they defrauded PNB of $44 million. A CBI official said told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the cases were related.
Television news channels reported that investigators also raided Modi's home in Mumbai on Thursday.
A finance ministry official said the Enforcement Directorate, a government agency that fights financial crime, would investigate the case to see whether it involved money laundering.
SHARES TUMBLE
On Thursday, PNB shares sank more than 14 percent, its biggest fall since 2009, after having dropped 9.8 percent the day before. The steep fall has wiped tens of billions of rupees off PNB's market value.
The fall dragged the National Stock Exchange's Nifty PSU bank index (NIFTYPSU) down 2 percent on Thursday, after it fell as much as 2.8 percent on Wednesday.
India's broader NSE share index (NSEI) was up 0.2 percent by mid-afternoon, tracking gains in Asian shares, after losing less than 0.4 percent on Wednesday.
PNB has not named the other banks it said had advanced money to customers based on the fraudulent transactions.
The BTVI news channel cited unnamed sources saying that  Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK) had discounted 40 billion rupees ($624.4 million) worth of fraudulent LoUs from PNB and that it had sold a majority of this to SBI.
Axis Bank said on Thursday that it had dealt in transactions that had been guaranteed with letters of undertaking from Punjab National Bank, but that it had since sold those transactions.
Axis shares were down less than one percent in mid-afternoon trading.
""We await more details, but if the 'other banks' have advanced money to overseas suppliers against PNB's letter of credit, PNB would have to honor the payments, in our view, and would have to seek to recover the money from these overseas suppliers,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Sumeet Kariwala, in a note to clients on Thursday. 

""This could subject PNB to significant potential impairments,"" he wrote, adding this could increase the bank's capital requirement by 80 billion rupees.

Luxury groups from Louis Vuitton owner LVMH to Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) are putting more resources into e-commerce as they court young customers, developing websites for their brands or partnering with other retailers.
 Richemont  (S:CFR), owner of jeweler Cartier, is bidding for full control of Farfetch rival Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter.
Burberry, famed for its trench coats and trademark check in camel, red and black, was one of the earliest adopters of digital changes in the industry, experimenting with new technology in stores and embracing social media to show off its collections.
It said the Farfetch partnership would expand its distribution around the world, making its whole inventory widely available as it targets ""a young fashion-conscious consumer"".
It gave no financial details.
Farfetch, tipped for a New York stock market listing later this year, is a platform that allows people to buy luxury clothes or accessories from more than 700 brands and boutiques. Unlike some competitors it does not carry stock.
Analysts expect online shopping to account for a quarter of all luxury goods sales by 2025, up from close to 10 percent at present, making it a major motor of growth in an industry trying to ride a recovery in demand from key Chinese consumers.
Burberry's performance has recently lagged that of many of its competitors and the UK label is in the midst of an overhaul as it looks to move more upmarket.
Farfetch will provide around-the-clock deliveries in London of Burberry's latest collection in the 24 hours after it is presented during the city's fashion week on Feb. 17, the brand said.
The catwalk show will be the last by designer Christopher Bailey, who is leaving after 17 years at Burberry. His replacement has yet to be announced.

LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery rally in European stocks gathered pace for a second day on Thursday after investors brushed off a spike in U.S. inflation, turning their focus back to company earnings from heavy hitters including Europe's largest aerospace firm, Airbus.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.8 percent by 0933 GMT, hitting its highest level in a week. The main European stock index was still down 6.5 percent from its 2 1/2-year peak hit as recently as Jan. 23.
Cyclical sectors drove the market higher, with basic resources, industrials, banks and technology stocks the best performers, recovering from their sharp drop last week.
The rapid recovery from a higher-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation reported on Wednesday took some by surprise, and investors said the bounce back indicated underlying strength in the market. 
""For me it's a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,"" said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam.
""The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,"" he added. ""2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that's still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.""
Earnings took center stage once more, with strong results driving the top gainers Airbus,  Ipsen  (PA:IPN),  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), and Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN).
Airbus (PA:AIR) shares jumped 8.8 percent after Europe's largest aerospace firm beat profit and earnings expectations, though it booked a new 1.3 billion euro charge on its A400M military plane.
Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) was a top CAC 40 gainer, up 5 percent after the electrical equipment producer reported a strong profit margin despite headwinds from the rise in the euro.
Shares in Dutch insurer Aegon (AS:AEGN) gained 3.7 percent after the firm reported a doubling of quarterly net income and raised estimates for future earnings, thanks to a tax cut in the U.S. where it does around 60 percent of its business.
Insurer  NN Group  (AS:NN) fared less well than its rival Aegon. The Dutch firm's shares fell 3 percent after it reported profit undershooting analysts' expectations. 
Another notable faller was Nestle (S:NESN) whose shares hit a 10-month low, down 2.4 percent after the Swiss food giant reported last year's organic growth was the weakest since it began recording the measure in 1996.
Meanwhile bank and insurance firm  Old Mutual  (L:OML), and mining company  Anglo American  (L:AAL) rose to the top of Britain's FTSE 100 after President Jacob Zuma resigned in South Africa, sending the rand to near three-year highs.
Both firms derive a high proportion of their revenue in South Africa, where the parliament was set to confirm Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president later on Thursday.
Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) rose 10 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm, embroiled in an accounting scandal, said it would hold its annual shareholders' meeting on April 20.
Overall fourth-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the previous year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed.

""Earnings estimates have also been raised, so that's definitely one of the supporting factors of the rally,"" said Robeco's Daalder.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Electric airplane start-up Eviation Aircraft Ltd is aiming for its 9-seat commuter aircraft to be flying passengers by 2021 after signing up South Korea's Kokam as its battery supplier, the Israeli company's chief executive said on Thursday.
Venture capital-backed Eviation is one of a number of companies looking to develop small electric aircraft that would incur lower energy and operating costs, release less emissions and be quieter than their conventionally fueled counterparts.
Airbus SE (PA:AIR),  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Uber Technologies Inc are also investigating electric and hybrid aircraft technology.
Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay said his firm signed a deal with Kokam last week because, as a smaller supplier, Kokam was able to make batteries more specific to his company's needs.
""If I would go today to Samsung (KS:005930) or Panasonic or LG Chem or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for that matter and say I need a different cell size, they will probably laugh because the number of cells we are going to buy is not significant enough to start the design process,"" he told Reuters in a phone interview.
The battery will have 9,400 cells distributed throughout the aircraft including the ceiling, floor and wings, weighing 3.8 tonnes, or 60 percent of the maximum takeoff weight.
Electric airplanes are reliant on improvements in battery technology, which is why smaller aircraft are likely to be electrified years before large commercial jets.
Batteries are heavy and store far less energy per kilogram than jet fuel, but the ratio is improving gradually each year, allowing electric cars and airplanes longer ranges than they had previously.
Eviation's ""Alice"" airplane is expected to have a range of up to 650 nautical miles (1200 kilometers), compared to 1000 nautical miles for a similar-sized conventional Cessna Caravan. It will cost $2 million-plus, on par with the Cessna, but have far lower fuel and maintenance costs, Bar-Yohay said.
Eviation hopes to fly the Alice demonstrator for the first time by the end of the year, with the first public display at the Paris Airshow in mid-2019, he said. Moving to commercial production after that would require raising around $100 million of capital.
Given the advantages of going electric, major manufacturers are also investing in electric and hybrid aircraft technology.
Seattle-area startup Zunum Aero, backed by the venture capital arms of Boeing and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), announced plans in October to bring a 12-seat hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022.
Airbus is working on the CityAirbus concept, a four-passenger electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoffs and landings, with the first demonstrator flight expected later this year. Ride-hailing firm Uber is exploring a similar concept with Uber Elevate.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus took a 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion) hit on its delayed A400M military transport plane, lifting charges on Europe's troubled defense project above 8 billion euros and clouding higher than expected underlying profits and cash.
Shares in Europe's largest aerospace group gained 9.2 percent, touching a two-week high, as Airbus lowered costs on its new A350 jet and confirmed it was looking at raising output of the best-selling A320 model by 17 percent to 70 a month amid strong demand.
But it called on its engine makers to get to grips with delays that have disrupted deliveries of the upgraded A320neo and said its target of 800 total deliveries this year would depend on the performance of these suppliers.
""We have plenty of challenges going forward, but it is manageable,"" Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday.
Airbus posted an 8 percent increase in adjusted 2017 operating profit of 4.253 billion euros on flat revenues of 66.767 billion euros and predicted a 20 percent rise in the widely watched core profit item.
Analysts were on average expecting adjusted 2017 operating profits of 3.996 billion euros and revenues of 67.343 billion.
The company lifted its dividend by 11 percent.
""Our caution on FY18 EBIT appears unfounded,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, keeping the bank's ""hold"" rating on the stock. ""At Airbus Commercial, things simply seem to have clicked into place.""
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Phil Buller wrote: ""The most important item for us and many others is cash and this beat expectations by around 700 million euros or 34 percent in Q4. Barclays rates Airbus ""overweight"". 
The A400M charge comes after Airbus last week reached a provisional agreement with seven European NATO buyer nations over further delays for the new troop carrier..
""This certainly ain't pretty but we are making good progress overall,"" Enders told analysts, adding the deal would significantly reduce remaining risks.
Airbus also took a 117 million euro fourth-quarter charge following a settlement with German prosecutors over a corruption case linked to a fighter sale to Austria in 2003. The charge includes 35 million euros of ongoing legal costs.
ENGINE DELAYS 
On the commercial side, Airbus is in the midst of a switchover to an upgraded A320, but has been beset by delays in engine supplies mainly from Pratt & Whitney as well as some delays at engine maker CFM International.
The company said it was still looking at the impact of a fresh round of problems with Pratt engines that saw some jets grounded and certain deliveries halted this week.
Enders said he had been in touch directly with the heads of  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), the owners of CFM which has reported delays of several weeks in engine deliveries.
The planemaker, which competes with Boeing (NYSE:BA), reported ""good progress"" on production of the new A350 wide-body jet and reiterated plans to reach output of 10 a month by end-year.
In a respite from recent compliance rows, Airbus said it had reached agreement with European credit agencies allowing it to apply for export credits on a case by case basis. The funding was suspended in 2016 when Airbus acknowledged having made misleading applications, triggering a corruption investigation.
However, it also raised the prospect for the first time that the United States could be drawn into the Anglo-French probe, saying it had been asked to supply information to U.S. authorities about conduct under their jurisdiction.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp is removing cheeseburgers from U.S. Happy Meal menus and shrinking the french fry serving in one ""Mighty Meal"" as part of a new global plan to cut calories and make its food for children more healthy.
The changes announced Thursday come as the world's biggest fast-food chain for the first time established global limits for calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugar in Happy Meals, which consultants and franchisees say account for roughly 15 percent of sales in the United States.
By 2022, McDonald's aims to have at least half of the Happy Meals listed on its drive-thru, restaurant and digital menus around the world contain 600 calories or less, 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, 650 mg of sodium, and 10 percent of calories from added sugar. 
The chain's U.S. restaurants will continue to offer Happy Meal cheeseburgers on request, which nudges diners to change behavior. When it did the same thing with Happy Meal sodas in 2013, some customers switched to water, milk or juice.
McDonald's said it will reduce calories and sodium from its six-piece chicken McNugget Mighty meal for older children by halving the french fry portion size. 
The company also is adding bottled water to Happy Meal menu boards and offering chocolate milk on request as it is reformulated to reduce added sugars. 
Currently, 28 percent of Happy Meal combinations offered on menu boards in 20 of McDonald's major markets meet the new criteria. In June 2018, McDonald's USA will hit the new calorie, sugar and fat goals and be 78 percent compliant on sodium. 
As part of its continued partnership with the non-profit Alliance for Healthier Generation, McDonald's also is working on plans to incorporate more healthy Happy Meal options for entrees as well as fruit and vegetable sides. Among other things, restaurants in Italy offer a Happy Meal grilled chicken sandwich; pineapple spears are on the menu in Spain; and cooked corn is a vegetable option in China, Japan and Taiwan.
The company, which in the past has taken heat for using toys to promote its Happy Meals, plans to offer books as a year-round replacement option in 100 markets by the end of 2019 - up from 20 today. 
McDonald's does not break out Happy Meal sales but said that family trips represent 30 percent of all visits to McDonald's around the world.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hong Kong Express expects at least a six-month delay in deliveries of new Airbus SE A320neo jets due to issues with engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a source with knowledge of the situation said on Thursday.
The budget airline, which has five A320neo jets, has grounded one plane until May due to a lack of spare engines after the jet made a mid-air turnback due to engine issues last month, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
The U.S. aviation regulator on Wednesday said the Pratt & Whitney engines posed a potential shutdown risk, in a formal warning that followed similar action by European regulators on Feb. 9.
Pratt & Whitney's priority is to obtain replacement engines for all of the affected jets globally, the South China Morning Post reported earlier in the day citing an internal memo from Hong Kong Express to staff.
The memo said that could take months, while new A320neos on the production line could be delayed for ""six months or more"", the paper reported.
Hong Kong Express representatives were not immediately available for comment. Airbus on Thursday said it was assessing the impact the engine issue would have on 2018 deliveries.

598,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 03:04AM ET</span>",BNY Mellon Still Watching for Bigger Shakeout Outside of Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s still potential for market turbulence in asset classes outside of stocks, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp. says.
“We have not seen the broad capitulation of valuation adjustments across many asset classes,” BNY Mellon senior global market strategist Marvin Loh wrote in a note Wednesday. “In fact, it has only been an equity adjustment at the moment, although many of the thematic catalysts have broader economic undertones.”
He pointed to U.S. high-yield debt volatility versus that of stocks, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX.
“The volatility in U.S. and euro high yield has actually continued to widen even as stock volatility has fallen,” Loh wrote. “Whether this proves to be a harbinger of additional volatility or a delayed reaction to the better tone from equity markets remains to be seen.
“A case can be made that there should be greater co-movements, as most asset classes were considered rich at the start of the year,” the report said. The Japanese yen is also an asset to watch because its strength shows repatriation during periods of volatility, Loh said.
Still, Loh doesn’t see the current situation as too dangerous yet. A breakout “in overly troubling fashion” would need to see inflation-adjusted yields move through 1 percent and the 10-year Treasury yield to move above 3.25 percent, he said. The 10-year yield is currently about 2.92 percent.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",What inflation fears? Asia bond markets bet on regional rates staying low,"By Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia's relatively stable bonds and money markets seem immune to the inflation fears that convulsed global equities recently, as investors bet the continent's major economies will keep interest rates low as price pressures remain benign. 
The stock market rout began at the end of January, when U.S. wages posted their fastest growth in more than eight years, fuelling expectations that the Federal Reserve's decade-long struggle to bring inflation back was finally bearing fruit.
That goal moved a step closer as data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January.
Central banks in the euro zone, Britain and Canada were also more upbeat on the inflation outlook, contributing to a fall of over 10 percent in the MSCI's 47-country world stocks index in about a week - a move which has since retraced slightly.
While Asian stock markets were taken hostage by the sell-off on fears faster rate hikes could hit global growth, short-term interest rates held steady or even dipped as investors saw an opportunity to trade the divergence in rates.
""When you buy the Kospi (stock index) in Korea, you're not buying because Samsung (KS:005930) is going to sell their products to Koreans, you're buying because Samsung is going to sell to the rest of the world, predominantly in the U.S.,"" one rates trader said.
""Interest rates apply much more broadly. In Asia, central banks are not signaling anything major and there's no inflationary pressures whatsoever.""
Indeed, the latest inflation figures from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand lagged market expectations and central bankers in Asia are signaling they are in no hurry to raise interest rates. In contrast to the other side of the Pacific, Japan's wages fell at their fastest pace in five months in December. 
In fact, the Bank of Japan has been at pains to reiterate that its ultra-easy policies will remain in place until it gets stubbornly low inflation towards its 2 percent target. 
The overnight index swaps (OIS) curve, derived from forward interbank lending rates and used as a gauge of policy rate expectations, has dropped 1-5 basis points since the start of the year in Australia, New Zealand and India and held steady in Japan.
In the U.S., the curve rose by up to 25 bps on tenors up to two years, meaning markets are pricing in one extra hike in the current cycle on top of what they expected at the end of 2017.
For this year alone, economists now expect three to four Fed hikes, while money markets, which have consistently been more conservative than forecasters, expect two to three increases.
""VERY GRADUAL""
Elsewhere in Asia, OIS curves are not as liquid, but the next best gauge, short-term government bond yields, have barely moved this year in contrast with a rise of almost 50 basis points in U.S. two-year Treasury yields.
The spillover from the sell-off in the stock markets may further support the rates divergence trade, some analysts say.
""Equity markets in Asia are spooked by the prospects of tighter monetary policy by the Fed. That fear, if shared by local central banks, may result in slower policy tightening,"" said Mirza Baig, head of FX and interest rates strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
But there is still one big risk to the subdued Asian rates outlook. If the sell-off in stock markets leads to major capital outflows that threaten confidence in the currencies, some central banks may eventually have to respond with higher rates to keep foreign investors interested.
Indonesia, India and Philippines, which have the weakest current account positions, are more exposed.
Mahamoud Islam, senior APAC economist at Euler Hermes, also cautions that high household debt in some countries, including Malaysia and South Korea, worries policymakers, who may see ""very gradual"" hikes as a way to discourage risky lending.

""Financing conditions could be less supportive sooner rather than later,"" Islam said.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",Japanese trading houses on the prowl as record earnings boost appetite,"By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's trading houses are scouting for assets as they enjoy their best profit outlook in six years, driven by higher prices for commodities from metals and coking coal to oil and natural gas.
Equipped with a nearly $50 billion war chest, trading houses are looking to bolster their global commodity supply chain networks, eyeing gas fields in Australia, oil in Iraq and coal and copper assets.
But - still smarting from huge writedowns in the last investment cycle - big debt-fueled acquisitions look to be off the agenda, with the focus on greenlighting undeveloped assets, taking bigger stakes in existing projects, and trading up to better quality operations.
""Now we have a lot of money that we can invest. We didn't invest so much in recent years,"" said a senior executive from a major trading house on condition of anonymity, declining to be named.
""We want to be in the driving seat in investments. We are searching for good projects,"" he said.
Known as shosha in Japanese, trading houses led by Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co fulfill a quasi-national role by importing everything from oil to corn to sustain the country's resource-poor economy. 
Together with Itochu Corp, Sumitomo Corp and Marubeni Corp, the five major trading houses reported record April-December net profits this month, with many upping their full-year forecasts.
Combined, they expect annual net income for the year to end-March, 2018 of 1.88 trillion yen ($17.4 billion), the most since 2011/12 financial year.
ASSETS IN SIGHT
Mitsui this month won a bidding war for Australia's AWE Ltd with a $470 million offer that will give make it operator and 50 percent owner of the promising Waitsia gas project.
Analysts described it as a low-risk investment, while Mitsui said becoming operator of a gas field for the first time would bolster its credentials to bid on other Australian gas assets.
Mitsui has been expected to step up its spending in energy and metals, where it is the strongest of the top five trading houses, said Nomura Securities' senior analyst Yasuhiro Narita.
Itochu - the least exposed to natural resources of the five - is set to buy a stake in Iraq's West Qurma 1 oilfield from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa).
It is also eyeing coal assets to replace declining output from its current operations, Chief Financial Officer Tsuyoshi Hachimura said earlier this month.
Mitsubishi CFO Kazuyuki Masu said this month the company was looking to invest in copper mines - one of its three focused assets along with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coking coal - to meet expected rising demand for electric cars. 
This could include the bolstering its stake in mines in which it already has a share, such as Peru's Quellaveco project, where it has invested with majority shareholder  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), and which is awaiting for a final investment decision.
The five trading houses combined had about $48 billion in cash and short-term investments as of end-March 2017, according to data in Thomson Reuters Eikon.
Still, it was just two years ago that Mitsubishi and Mitsui posted their first ever annual losses, while in that same year to March 2016 the five houses combined wrote-off about 1 trillion yen after the commodities downturn of 2014-2015.
They have since staged a recovery, also visible in the stock market where since 2015, seen as the lowpoint of the overall commodities downturn, they have outperformed even  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) , a western listed commodity trading peer.
Despite this, analysts say the Japanese traders remain cautious.
""Trading houses are not spending like in early 2010s when they were making huge loans to buy assets with big price-tag,"" said Masako Kuwahara, senior analyst at corporate finance group in Moody's Japan K.K.
""They have learned lessons from the commodities slump and they are making only selective investments, with the focus to maintain a positive cash flow,"" she said, predicting that spending will have limited impact on their leverage.

China is trying to gain access to sensitive U.S. technologies and intellectual properties through telecommunications companies, academia and joint business ventures, U.S. senators and spy chiefs warned on Tuesday.
Republican Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was concerned about the ties to the Chinese government of Chinese telecoms companies like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE.
""ZTE is proud of the innovation and security of our products in the U.S. market,"" Xinhua cited a ZTE spokesman as saying.
The company takes cybersecurity and privacy seriously, has always adhered to laws and remains a trusted partner of U.S. suppliers and customers, the company added.
""As a publicly traded company, we are committed to adhering to all applicable laws and regulations of the United States, work with carriers to pass strict testing protocols, and adhere to the highest business standards,"" it said.
Last week, Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced legislation that would block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecoms equipment from Huawei or ZTE, citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.
In 2012, Huawei and ZTE were the subject of a U.S. investigation into whether their equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - something they have consistently denied.
Allegations of hacking and internet spying have long strained relations between China and the United States. In 2014 then FBI Director James Comey said Chinese hacking likely cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars every year.

China has strongly denied all U.S. accusations of hacking attacks.

""I've tried a lot of wines from different countries, and after that I thought: 'Australian wine is very good,'"" said Wang, whose purchase at the vineyard, some 250km (155 miles) north of Sydney, sought to add more wine to a collection already full of Burgundy and Bordeaux. 
His association with Peterson illustrates how Australian winemakers are cultivating connections in China, the world's fastest-growing wine market, that are bearing valuable fruit even as entrenched European exporters are hitting headwinds.
Policy changes have helped too: Australian wine sales to China have more than doubled since a free trade agreement between the countries took effect in December 2015, cutting tariffs from as high as 20 percent to about 3 percent.
EXPANSION, UNCORKED
France is by far the dominant wine seller to China, holding about 40 percent of the imported wine sales market. Australia has been in second place for a decade, according to figures from International Wine and Spirit Research and Wine Australia.
But where French sales growth has been steady, Australia's has skyrocketed.
""In the first-tier cities here, in Shanghai or Beijing, we see more and more wines coming from Australia, Spain, Chile because consumers are more open minded to new origins and styles,"" said Guillaume Deglise, chief executive officer of Vinexpo, which organizes wine and spirits trade fairs.
""At the same time in the second- or third-tier cities, the same consumers, especially the younger consumers, are also interested in these countries because they offer a more competitive option than France,"" he added. 
Over the past decade, Australia's exports to China by value have expanded roughly twice as much as volume, as sales of higher-end wines such as Penfolds Grange have grown most of all - leading to record profits for its producer, Treasury Wine Estates.
A FLOOD OF INVESTMENT
At the same time, Chinese investment has flowed through the wine supply chain, with a flurry of relatively small purchases of Australian wine assets.
Last May, Chinese wine distributor YesMyWine made one of the largest investments with its purchase of a 15 percent stake, and a board seat along with it, in Australian Vintage Ltd, Australia's fifth-largest winemaker. The A$16.5 million deal came through its investment vehicle Vintage China Fund LP.
In January, Yantai Changyu Pioneer Wine Co Ltd bought a majority stake in South Australian vineyard Kilikanoon for $15.5 million, on the heels of several smaller deals in recent years.
Cain Beckett, director of Hunter Valley realty agency Jurds, said he sells a few vineyards a month to Chinese buyers.
Australia's tax office, the only official tracker of foreign agricultural land purchases, said privacy concerns prevented it from disclosing how many vineyards were Chinese-owned.
Stephen Strachan, director of Adelaide-based wine consultant Gaetjens Langley, said about half of foreign interest in vineyard purchases across Australia comes from China. 
Beckett estimates 50 out of 250 vineyards in the Hunter Valley region are Hong Kong or Chinese-owned. 
Among them is Iron Gate Estate, with Semillon, Verdelho and Shiraz vines, bought several weeks ago by the Hong Kong-based Kuo family, which owns an electric parts manufacturing plant in Shenzhen. 
""We're looking to increase (production), but Asia for us is a place where we are still finding our way,"" said Gavin Kuo, 38, who moved from Sydney to manage the vineyard.
""But we have to be careful because we are a boutique winery and we can't actually change certain flavors just for an Asian market,"" he said.
MAKING TASTE
Since China replaced the U.S. as Australia's largest export market by value in 2016, winemakers have redoubled efforts to adjust, hiring Mandarin-speaking staff, turning out Chinese-language labels and laying out chopsticks with meals at their restaurants.
Australian producers who had mostly switched to sealing bottles with screw caps have returned to corks to meet Chinese expectations; French wines, which typically use corks, are considered more traditional and prestigious. 
A few Australian vintners have experimented with changing the way their wines taste. 
""It's the one question I would say that we grapple with most in terms of export,"" winemaker Bill Sneddon told Reuters at Allandale Winery in the Hunter Valley.
""Do we make wines that we think will fit the market, or do we make the best wines we can and try and fit the market to the wine? I don't think we've got an answer to that, honestly; we've tried both,"" he said.
In the end, he added, his winery just wants ""to make the best wines we can, stylistically, from the fruit we've got.""
Other winemakers fret that Chinese enthusiasm could vanish, or that producers could be buffeted by the kind of import-rule changes that hit Australian milk powder and vitamin makers with high tariffs.
""Everyone is making hay, but like everything there are risks, and these sort of growth levels can't continue. We all know that,"" said Tony Battaglene, chief executive at the Winemakers Federation of Australia.
For winemakers like Sneddon and Peterson, it means selling most of their wine domestically. 
That was part of the reason why, after dinner, Peterson declined Wang's offer to buy up his pride Chardonnay, offering a single bottle as a Lunar New Year gift instead.
""We normally don't open it ourselves, unless we're with friends or someone else is there,"" he said.

The increase will bring Amazon's total number of permanent French staff to 7,500 in 2018 and reflects confidence in the economy of a country where the Seattle-based retailer invested over 2 billion euros since 2010, the company said in a statement.
Earlier this month Amazon settled a long-running dispute with French tax authorities, who had been seeking nearly 200 million euros from the online retailer.
Amazon has been expanding steadily in France where it has run its Amazon Prime Now express delivery service in Paris since 2016 and it already has five logistics centers nationwide and plans to open a 142,000-square-foot delivery warehouse in 2018. 
Frederic Duval, General Manager for France, told Reuters he would ""love it"" if Amazon would expand Prime Now to other French cities though he did not say if there were plans to do so.
Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods in the United States last year has prompted speculation that the tech company could be targeting the European food and supermarket sector next. 

Europe's top retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) has notably announced plans to cut 2,400 jobs in France, boost ecommerce investment and seek a partnership in China with Tencent in the face of competition from Amazon.

MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An independent U.S. trade body on Wednesday said it rejected hefty U.S. duties on Bombardier's CSeries jets partly because Boeing lost no sales or revenue when Delta Air Lines ordered the aircraft in 2016 from the Canadian planemaker.
The International Trade Commission published its reasoning three weeks after announcing the decision.
The ITC said the 110-seat CSeries jets ordered by Delta (N:DAL) and Boeing Co's (N:BA) smallest 737 MAX 7 plane do not compete. It also said Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries sale to Delta did not come at Boeing's expense as the planemaker did not offer any new aircraft to the No. 2 U.S. carrier.
""Boeing lost no sales or revenues,"" the ITC said in its 194-page ruling.
""The higher standard seating capacity of the 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 limits competition between those models and the CS100 for some purchasers,"" it said.
It was not yet clear whether Boeing will seek to appeal the ITC's decision, a move that could generate uncertainty at a time when the U.S. planemaker's European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) plans to take a majority stake in the CSeries program. 
The ITC determined on Jan. 26 in a 4-0 vote that the CSeries did not harm Boeing and discarded a U.S. Commerce Department recommendation to slap a near 300 percent duty on sales of Bombardier 110-to-130-seat CSeries jets for five years.
Spokesmen for both Boeing and Bombardier said the companies are studying the ITC's decision and did not have an immediate comment.
Former ITC chairman Dan  Pearson  (LON:PSON) said the cost to appeal the decision would be marginal compared with what Boeing has already spent. 
“Boeing has put a whole lot of money into law firms for this case. They’ve got millions of dollars invested,” Pearson said by phone.
Boeing has the option of appealing the decision at the Court of International Trade in New York, or a trade dispute settlement panel under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
However, in negotiations to modernize NAFTA, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has pushed to scrap NAFTA's process to settle trade disputes, which he says is biased against the United States. 
Pearson said he believed the commission’s decision will likely improve U.S.-Canadian trade relations, which have been complicated by disputes over tariffs on Canadian lumber and U.S. milk and President Donald Trump’s desire to renegotiate or even abandon NAFTA. 
“It does help the bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States, and I hope both sides see it this way.”
In its complaint, Boeing had alleged it was forced to discount its 737 narrow-bodies to compete with Bombardier, which it said used government subsidies to dump the CSeries during the 2016 sale.

But the ITC said the CSeries is not likely to depress prices of U.S.-made jets and that Bombardier is unlikely to offer other prospective buyers the same discounts provided to Delta.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A large group of Puerto Rico's creditors united on Wednesday in condemning the U.S. commonwealth's revised fiscal plan, calling it a step backwards in rebuilding from years of mismanagement and the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Unveiled by Governor Ricardo Rossello on Tuesday, the plan highlighted the use of $18 billion in additional money from the U.S. federal budget to turn a deficit into a surplus of $3.4 billion within six years.
""The Plan fails to provide a credible basis on which to restructure the island's debt, while completely lacking a foundation for revitalizing the local economy and restoring access to the capital markets,"" the creditors said in a joint news release.
Before the storms, the recovery plan had projected a nearly $4 billion surplus through 2021. But after the hurricanes, the government forecast a $3.4 billion gap for the same period that would not allow any repayment of the island's debt.
Puerto Rico was already in crisis when Maria smashed into it. The bankrupt U.S. territory, whose finances the U.S. Congress placed under federal oversight, owed $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt. It had near-insolvent public health and retirement systems, and was suffering from a shrinking population.
The creditors say the new plan remains opaque on issues such defining essential services versus what the government wants to pay; not fully accounting for cash held in accounts that might be available to meet fiscal plan needs; not sharing 2015 audited financial statements; using an outdated migration forecast; and using healthcare cost and plan participation assumptions that contradict the government's own outmigration forecast.
Puerto Rico's financial oversight board is expected to evaluate Rossello's revised plan in the coming weeks and, after a public hearing, determine whether to certify it. 
The benchmark GO bond, trading in default without a yield, traded just under 60 U.S. cents on the dollar before Maria hit. On Wednesday it traded at 29.25 cents, up from an all-time low of 21.1820 cents on Dec. 14 <74514LE86=MSRB>, according to Thomson Reuters. COFINA senior bonds last traded at 50.90 cents <74529JAR6=MSRB> from 59.11 cents the day before Maria hit.

This group of debt holders, some of whom are fighting one another over who should be paid first out of any available debt servicing funds, are: bond insurers Ambac, Assured Guaranty, National Public Finance Guarantee Corp; holders of so-called COFINA senior debt which is backed by sales tax receipts; a group of mutual fund creditors that includes Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds; Syncora; The Puerto Rico Funds; and individual investors.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Hedge funds Steadfast and Suvretta jump onto CSX in fourth quarter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Wall Street investors were so convinced that Hunter Harrison could turn around railroad CSX Corp (O:CSX) that the company lost $4 billion in market value when the former CEO took a medical leave in December and died only a few days later.
But rather than run for the door, a number of prominent hedge fund managers either established new positions or added to what they already owned, certain that someone else would execute on the plans the railroader had put in place only months before.
Steadfast Capital Management, run by Robert Pitts, and Suvretta Capital Management, run by Aaron Cowen, made new bets on CSX during the last three months of 2017 while Citadel Advisors more than doubled its bet, according to regulatory filings released on Wednesday and data from Symmetric.IO.
Steadfast owned 4.5 million CSX shares on Dec. 31, marking the biggest increase in ownership from the previous quarter, the data show. Suvretta, which ended 2017 with a 24.6 percent gain, owned 2.5 million shares and Citadel, whose multistrategy fund gained roughly 13 percent last year, owned 3.3 million shares after having bought an additional 2.4 million shares during the quarter.
Chilton Investment Co added a new position to own 1.5 million shares at the end of the quarter and Sirios Capital Management bulked up its holding by 264 percent to own 1.8 million at the end of the quarter. 
While it is not clear exactly when during the quarter the funds made their bets, several hedge fund managers said the price became more attractive after Harrison's death, prompting some to buy then. 
The hedge funds are relatively smaller investors, trailing powerhouses Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors, and activist investor Paul Hilal. Hilal, whose Mantle Ridge owns 42.7 million shares, was instrumental in bringing Harrison to CSX from rival Canadian Pacific last March.
But the fact they are there at all suggests confidence that CSX can benefit from the growing economy as well as the new tax plan, analysts and investors said. And it underscores that they are willing to give Harrison's replacement, Jim Foote, who long worked with Harrison and was most recently CSX's chief operating officer, a chance, they added.
After Harrison's death the share price climbed roughly 12 percent in around three weeks, rewarding the newcomers.
Since then the shares have retreated as investors demand more information on how Foote will handle the turnaround plan that includes deep job cuts and rail yard closures and has triggered persistent service disruptions, customer complaints and federal scrutiny.
There were, of course, some funds that exited during the last quarter. Brahman Capital sold 4.8 million shares while OZ Management sold 3.8 million to exit their positions.

Spokespeople for the funds declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York-based Paulson & Co, led by longtime gold bull John Paulson, kept its stake in gold investments during the fourth quarter of 2017, while other heavyweights including Soros Fund Management LLC, Jana Partners LLC and Caxton Corp all remained unexposed to the metal.
The timing for Paulson appeared prescient given that during the last three months of the year, gold prices climbed on the back of a weak U.S. dollar, geopolitical tension and mixed expectations of the path of U.S. interest rate increases.
Paulson & Co kept its stake in SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD) at 4.36 million shares during the fourth quarter of 2017, though the value rose to $539.1 million, up from $530 million in the third quarter, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed on Wednesday.
SPDR Gold Trust is the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund.
Paulson also left stakes unchanged in mining company AngloGold Ashanti Ltd though the value increased versus the end of the third quarter.
Stakes in IAMGOLD Corp, RandGold Resources Ltd and NovaGold Resources Inc were also unchanged, but their value dropped.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, spot gold prices rose to a three-month high of $1,307.60 per ounce in late December. 
Bullion had jumped toward its biggest one-year rise in seven years because of the weakening dollar. Sliding toward its worst year since 2003, the greenback, in which gold is priced, was hurt by tensions over North Korea, the Russian scandal surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign, and persistently low U.S. inflation. 
Concerns had begun to recede over the impact of U.S. interest rate hikes and fed into its rally. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, because higher rates make it less attractive since it does not draw interest.
Meanwhile, CI Investments Inc sharply increased its holdings in SPDR Gold Trust to nearly 3.9 million shares worth $482.1 million during the fourth quarter, up nearly three times from its 1.45 million shares worth $176.2 million during the third quarter.
It doubled its stake in Barrick Gold Corp to 312,762 shares worth $4.53 million, and increased its call options to 183,396 shares worth $6.78 million. This compares with 166,396 calls worth $6.8 million in the third quarter.
CI Investments increased its holdings in  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd to 132,810 shares at a value of $13.13 million during the fourth quarter, up sharply from the third quarter's 22,210 shares at a value of $2.17 million.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",UK watchdog slow to stop 'vulture' advisers ripping off steelworkers: lawmakers,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog was too slow to prevent ""vulture"" financial advisers from ripping off steelworkers faced with critical decisions over their 14 billion pound ($19.4 billion) pension pot, lawmakers said in a report on Thursday.
Advice on transferring pension pots and the punitive fees charged were another major mis-selling scandal, parliament's work and pensions committee said in the critical 39-page report.
Following the closure of the current  Tata Steel  UK (NS:TISC) pension scheme - to pave the way for a merger with the European steel operations of Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) - steelworkers were forced to choose by December 2017 between moving to a new company scheme or joining a lifeboat known as the Pension Protection Fund (PPF).
The report said members would have typically been better off moving to the new company scheme. 
The old pension scheme is a legacy from previous owner British Steel and some 25,000 of its 124,000 members failed to respond to the December deadline, meaning they will end up in the PPF by default because they were too overwhelmed to make an informed choice, the report said.
Under Britain's new ""pension freedoms"" reforms, workers could also put the cash into other investments, but many of those who took this option were advised to sign up to risky, unsuitable investments that came with hefty fees.
Steelworkers were shamelessly bamboozled by dubious financial advisers in tandem with unregulated, parasitical introducers who wooed clients with sausage and chips lunches in return for a share in the fee, the report said.
Transfer values averaged 400,000 pounds and reputable advisers were overwhelmed, creating the perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage, it said.
Lawmakers singled out contingent charging, where advisers are only rewarded for recommending a particular course of action. The practice should be banned for defined benefit pension transfer advice, they said.
""To propose, as the Financial Conduct Authority did in July last year, abandoning the advisor presumption against transferring out of a gold-plated, stable, indexed pension scheme: it really makes you wonder whose side they're on,"" committee chair Frank Field said in a statement.
A surge in interest in the steelworker pensions began in April last year but the FCA, which regulates advisers, did not begin acting until November, just ahead of the deadline, the report said.
The FCA said it has taken ""detailed, extensive and robust action"" to help the steelworkers.
""We are also reviewing the rules that apply to firms advising on pension transfers, and will consider this report as part of this,"" the watchdog said.
PENSION REGULATOR CRITICIZED 
Lawmakers also criticized the Pensions Regulator, which oversees schemes, saying it should have seen this ""rip-off coming"" and should review the information given to people faced with pension decisions.
The Pensions Regulator said it helped to tackle unscrupulous advisers and fulfilled its primary role in evaluating and approving the complex restructuring of the British Steel pension scheme to prevent the company becoming insolvent.
""We believe this was the best possible outcome for everyone involved in what was a very challenging situation, bringing greater certainty for thousands of scheme members,"" it said.
The report calls on the government to change pension rules so that pots are transferred to a new company scheme by default if it offers better benefits than a pensions lifeboat.
The committee said it will also produce a separate report on broader pension freedom and choice issues raised by the steelworkers' case.
Some 50 billion pounds has been transferred from direct benefit pension schemes between the start of the pension freedom reform in April 2015 and May 2017.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Wednesday disclosed a new stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA) and said it bought more shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL), which surpassed  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) as its largest common stock investment.
Berkshire also nearly completed its yearlong exit from International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM), selling more than 94 percent of what was left from an investment Buffett has admitted was not among his best.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Dec. 31, Berkshire reported owning about 18.9 million Teva American depositary receipts, worth about $358 million.
Teva shares rose more than 10 percent after market hours, reflecting what investors perceive as Berkshire's seal of approval for the Israeli drugmaker.
Last month, Berkshire said it would work with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to create their own healthcare company. Other healthcare stocks fell on that news.
""The intimidation, bullying and misery facing the healthcare industry has created bargains,"" said Bill Smead, who oversees $2.3 billion, including $130 million in Berkshire stock, at Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle.
Teva and Berkshire declined to comment.
Wednesday's filing details investments made by Buffett and his investment deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, though it does not say who bought what. Combs and Weschler are generally responsible for Berkshire's smaller investments.
Berkshire's Apple stake grew by about 23 percent since the end of September to roughly 165.3 million shares worth $28 billion. That was just above the reported $27.8 billion stake in Wells Fargo.
Berkshire may have funded the Apple purchases by selling roughly $5 billion of  IBM  stock, reducing that stake to just 2.05 million shares worth about $314 million.
Buffett began selling IBM in the first quarter of 2017, and has admitted he did not value the company as highly as when he began buying six years earlier.
Berkshire at one time owned roughly 81 million IBM shares, for which it paid about $13.8 billion. Berkshire was close to break-even on IBM when the selling began.
Berkshire on Wednesday also reported higher stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK),  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) and US Bancorp (N:USB), and lower stakes in  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), General Motors Co (N:GM), France's Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) and Wells Fargo.
On Tuesday, Berkshire agreed to sell more than 43 percent of another big holding, Phillips 66 (N:PSX), back to the oil refiner for $3.3 billion. It plans to remain a long-term shareholder.

Buffett will provide more detail about Berkshire's investments and its more than 90 operating businesses in his annual shareholders letter, slated for release on Feb. 24.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","U.S. bank stocks rally, analysts see more upside","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Bank shares soared on Wednesday as investors bet rising inflation would push up interest rates and boost bank profits, and analysts forecast yet more gains from strong economic growth and a volatility-fueled boost in trading revenue.
The S&P 500 bank subsector was last up 2.5 percent at its highest level since Feb. 5. 
In last week's broad market pullback, it fell as much as 11.3 percent from a more than 10-year intraday high hit on Jan. 29. The S&P 500 fell as much as 11.8 percent below its Jan. 26 record. 
Investors had fled the broad market on worries that inflation would cause the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest rate hikes. Banks were dragged along even as strategists said they remained bullish on the sector, citing a boost to profits from rising rates and solid economic growth. 
""There was a disconnect,"" said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. ""Banks should actually benefit from the factors causing the market selloff.""
And banks likely benefited financially from the selloff itself, with a volume spike expected to boost trading revenue which has languished in recent years due to low volatility.
""We think the shares can continue to outperform with continuing economic growth, rising interest rates and more recently a pick up in (trading) volatility,"" said Jason Goldberg, analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
To be sure, if long-muted inflation were to suddenly surge and cause the Fed to react aggressively, that would hurt banks along with the rest of the economy, said Kleinhanzl. But investors are not expecting that scenario any time soon.
""One thing you don't want is for inflation to become violent. I don't think we're there at all,"" said Michael Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management who is bullish on banks. 
""The fundamentals are set to accelerate from here. I'm expecting interest margin expansion. Loan growth seems poised to accelerate given tax reform,"" said Mattioli. ""Companies have more cash. They may be paying down more debt but also reinvesting more into their business. Confidence is high in the economy.""
Financials were one of the biggest boosts for the S&P 500 with a 2.3 percent rise, helping lead a broad rally despite data showing U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) was the biggest boost for the sector with a 2.3 percent gain. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co added around 2.6 percent while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) rose 2 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - One bank has expressed its regrets for the unraveling volatility trade.
But in general Wall Street is offering up apologia - rather than an apology - for the dramatic windup last week of investment products that had profited from calm stock markets.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Nomura Co Ltd have said they would kill two exchange-traded notes that effectively bet on little movement in stock prices and lost most of their value last week when the opposite happened.
Nomura initially said ""we sincerely apologize to the notes' owners for causing significant troubles.""
Despite the mea culpa, which is common in Japanese culture, the company has not announced plans to withdraw other volatility products it offers, including a note tied to moves in the Japanese stock market, though it did tell Reuters ""we have no plans to produce any similar product at this stage.""
A week later, there are few signs that the repercussions go beyond two products.
The chief executive of Credit Suisse on Wednesday defended the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN - which has as its ticker symbol VIX backwards - his bank issued and stops trading next week following its losses.
""It's a legitimate market instrument that serves a purpose that is very useful for market participants to manage their risk,"" Tidjane Thiam told CNBC.
""And, yes, it has had a lot of attention because this kind of short vol, long S&P trade was run by a lot of people, at their own risk, and it worked well for a long time until it didn't - which is generally what happens.""
The bank has not announced any plans to change its note lineup besides withdrawing XIV, even as some investors expressed outrage over declines in after-hours trading and the market action drew attention from regulators.
Credit Suisse discloses the notes' intended audience and use in the prospectus, a spokeswoman for the bank said. Richard Weil, co-chief executive of Janus Henderson Group plc, which owns the VelocityShares brand and markets the product, said last week they are ""performing as advertised.""
Other firms stood behind their products. ProShare Advisors LLC, run by the manager of a competing product not being pulled off the market, said that fund's performance ""was consistent with its objective and reflected the changes in the level of its underlying index"" and that they ""intend to continue to manage the fund as usual.""
Thiam said XIV contributes approximately 10 million Swiss francs ($10.7 million) in revenue to the bank, a drop in the bucket for a bank that pulled in 20.9 billion francs in 2017.
""It's not material, and yet Credit Suisse looked like they blew the world up because they happen to have their name as the ETN issuer,"" said Jack Fonss, a fund structuring consultant who previously worked at Credit Suisse and later created a volatility product that competed with XIV.
""The thing worked for so long and it attracted so many assets and it was free money.""
So far, investors are validating banks' and asset managers' decisions to stay in the volatility business.
Even in a period that U.S.-based inverse-volatility notes sank by as much as 96 percent, a group of those products tracked by Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit attracted nearly $257 million in new cash from investors during the most recent week. Some investors burned by the steep drop in such products told Reuters they would use them again.
UBS Group AG launched two volatility products last year in the United States that are tied to the European equity market. They declined to comment.
Just last month,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) plc rolled out two volatility-tracking notes that effectively replace existing products that were already due to end their lives next year. Unlike XIV, those Barclays' iPath products are meant to profit when VIX futures increase in value.

The company is also de-listing or redeeming its relatively small U.S.-listed inverse VIX products in April, a decision that was made before XIV ran into issues. Barclays declined to comment.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 04:34PM ET</span>",What inflation? Apple and Facebook drive Wall Street rally,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Wednesday as investors shrugged off stronger-than-expected inflation data and snapped up shares of Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple.
The fourth straight day of gains in the S&P 500 saw a return to the ""fear of missing out"" mentality that accompanied Wall Street's rally in recent months ahead of a slump last week into correction territory.
Facebook (O:FB) jumped 3.7 percent while Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Apple (O:AAPL) both rose more than 1.8 percent. All three fueled the S&P 500 more than any other shares, leaving the index up 1.34 percent for the session. They, along with Netflix (O:NFLX) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) - collectively called the FAANG stocks - were major contributors to last year's market rally, and all but Alphabet have weathered the recent selloff better than the broader market.
""FAANG is still working. And people feel that because they held up during the downturn, you can come back to them and not get hammered if things turn down again,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. 
""There is still a fear of missing out.""
Since Thursday, the S&P 500 has surged 4.56 percent, its strongest four-session performance since mid-2016. The index remains down about 6 percent from its record high on Jan. 26.
The Labor Department's core Consumer Price Index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.3 percent in January, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent. However, the year-on-year rise was unchanged at 1.8 percent.
The data raised the specter of rising inflation and rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve could be forced to be more aggressive with interest rate increases.
But those inflation concerns were tempered by data showing U.S. retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month, the biggest decline in nearly a year and in sharp contrast to economists' estimates for a 0.2 percent increase.
""The CPI shows there is some inflation, but it was not through the roof,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Nashville. ""People got too pessimistic.""
Underpinning confidence among many investors is the belief that the U.S. economy remains strong and that tax cuts enacted this year will spur corporate earnings and lead consumers to spend more.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) jumped 1.03 percent to end at 24,893.49 while the S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.34 percent to finish at 2,698.63.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) surged 1.86 percent to 7,143.62.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields (US10YT=RR) hit a four-year high, but a key measure of near-term volatility fell, in contrast to its reaction to strong U.S. jobs and wages data earlier in the month.
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX) fell below 20 for the first time since Feb. 5.
The VIX slipping below 20 is ""a very good sign"", said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management. ""It shows the volatility is getting priced out of the market."" 
Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with financials (SPSY) rising 2.32 percent and information technology (SPLRCT) up 1.95 percent.
Fossil (O:FOSL) surged 87.7 percent after the watchmaker's strong holiday-quarter sales and a rush among short-sellers to cover their positions.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) jumped 15.4 percent after it hired Brian Niccol from Taco Bell as its next chief executive, which analysts said sparked hopes of a quicker turnaround.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.94-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

About 7.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 8.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

623,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Wholesale Inflation, Manufacturing, Labor Data 
Thursday ushers in a deluge of economic reports which could either add to the narrative of a strengthening US economy or dent investor expectations for solid first quarter economic growth.
Inflation at the wholesale level as measured by the producer price index is expected to have rebounded 0.4% in January following an unexpected 0.1% fall in December. The wholesale data will likely attract added investor attention as they are expected to parse the report for signs of further price pressures after Wednesday’s consumer inflation report topped economists’ forecasts.
An uptick in medical services prices was one of the main components that contributed to the rise in consumer prices. Amherst said traders should monitor the PPI report closely to establish whether the rise in medical services prices was transitory.
The Labor department releases its weekly count of the  number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Feb 10. Economist forecast initial jobless claims rose by 9,000 to 230,000.
Economists forecast the Philly Fed manufacturing index for February to show a reading of 21.1, slightly below the 22.2 reading in the previous month. While the New York Fed’s Empire State manufacturing index – a gauge of New York-area manufacturing – is expected to show a decline in February compared to the previous month.
The report comes as sentiment on US equities appears to have turned positive, following the recent selloff, as S&P 500 closed in positive territory for the year on Wednesday as financials and tech soared.
2. Bitcoin Eyes $10,000 Test as Inflows Into Crypto-Market Continue
Bitcoin rose 6.40% to $9,227 on Wednesday, continuing its recovery after falling to $6,000 last week. The popular digital currency has rallied 50% from last week’s slump as inflows into the industry remained steady.
The total cryptocurrency market cap rose more than 7% to $450 billion, at the time of writing, from roughly $420 billion Tuesday, suggesting demand for cryptocurrencies has renewed as fears of regulation begin to fade.
Bitcoin, however, is not the only crypto benefitting from new inflows into the market as Ripple’s XRP rose 12.87% to $1.12746.
3. Cisco To Rally on Open?
Shares of Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) rallied in aftermarket hours after the company posted fiscal second quarter earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Cisco reported second quarter revenue of $11.9 billion, up 3% year-over-year, beating analyst consensus of $11.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.63 per share, up from $0.57 per share a year ago and ahead of expectations of $0.59 per share.
The company hiked its quarterly dividend 14% to $0.33 per share and approved a $25 billion increase to its stock repurchase program.
Cisco said it expects third-quarter revenue to grow 3% to 5% year-over-year, with non-GAAP earnings at $0.64 to $0.66 per share.
That was ahead of the Wall Street estimates of $12.13 billion in revenue and earnings of $0.63 per share.
Cisco rose 5.23% to $44.20 in after-market hours after closing at $42.09 on Wednesday."

626,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 04:19PM ET</span>","Charlie Munger urges regulators to ease off Wells Fargo, blasts bitcoin","By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of fellow billionaire Warren Buffett, said on Wednesday it is time for regulators to ""let up"" on  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), which will end up ""better off"" as it corrects a series of mistakes in how it treated banking customers.
Munger spoke at the annual meeting of  Daily Journal Corp  (O:DJCO), the Los Angeles-based newspaper publisher he chairs, where he also denigrated bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) as ""noxious poison"" and urged reforms in the healthcare system.
He spoke less than two weeks after the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of curbing the San Francisco-based bank's asset growth until it fixes its shortcomings.
Daily Journal typically draws little attention from investors, but CNBC broadcast the meeting on its website.
That is because the company's star attraction is Munger, 94, who has for four decades also been vice chairman at Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), which is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder.
""Of course, Wells Fargo had incentive systems that were too strong in the wrong direction, and of course they were too slow in reacting properly to bad news,"" but ""practically everyone"" makes those kinds of mistakes, Munger said.
""Wells Fargo will end up better off for having made those mistakes,"" he added. ""I think it's time for regulators to let up on Wells Fargo. They've learned.""
The San Francisco-based bank has been beset by scandals for deceiving customers, such as by opening unauthorized accounts and forcing them to take out auto insurance they did not need.
Wells Fargo shares gained 2.7 percent to $59.55 on Wednesday.
Though Wells Fargo may be learning its lessons, Munger said the banking industry remains a ""dangerous"" place to invest because of the temptation for chief executives to take unwise long-term risks to boost short-term results.
Buffett has credited Munger with broadening his investment horizon, and to seek out great companies at fair prices rather than emphasizing fair companies that can be bought cheaply.
BITCOIN IS 'TOTALLY ASININE'
For Munger, that leaves no room for bitcoin, saying the recent ""craze"" in the cryptocurrency is ""totally asinine"" and a means for people to make a quick buck. He urged the government to help wring out its excesses.
""Bitcoin is noxious poison,"" Munger said. ""The more popular it got the more I hated it.""
Munger also endorsed the plan announced by Berkshire, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to set up a healthcare company for their employees to combat spiraling costs that Buffett has called a ""tapeworm"" on the economy.
The current system ""runs out of control on the cost side,"" causing behavior that is ""regrettable"" and ""evil,"" Munger said.
""It's not right to bleed so much money out of our dying people,"" Munger said. ""I'm all for somebody trying to figure it out.""
Munger also expressed concern about rising U.S. government debt levels, calling it ""new territory for us,"" though he expressed no alarm about the current economy.
He said higher inflation may follow, and that long-term U.S. Treasuries, whose prices can fall quickly as yields rise, remain a losing bet over the long haul.
Munger fielded questions for two hours. He and Buffett, 87, are expected to field shareholder questions for an even longer period, five hours, at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 5.
Given their ages, that meeting is likely to be among their last, and Berkshire is preparing for their succession.
Last month, it promoted executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen, overseeing non-insurance and insurance businesses, respectively. They are widely considered the frontrunners to succeed Buffett as chief executive officer.

Alluding to his age, Munger on Wednesday said he was ""very surprised to be here,"" and drew laughter by referring to a woman who said on her own 94th birthday: ""I'm very pleased to be here. In fact I'm very pleased to be anywhere.""

628,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Bridgewater makes $22 billion bet against European firms,"By John O'Donnell, Maiya Keidan and Lawrence Delevingne
LONDON/FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bridgewater has shown its hand in Europe with a $22 billion bet against some of the continent's biggest companies, filings reviewed by Reuters show, part of a bigger shift by the world's largest hedge fund manager.
Although data was not available to show whether Bridgewater holds more European stocks than it ""shorts"" overall, an investor in the hedge fund firm's Pure Alpha Major Markets strategy said that its position was slightly net ""long"" on Feb. 6.
But Bridgewater had reduced that long exposure significantly this year, the investor added.
Bridgewater, which declined to comment on its trading, bets on macro-economic events and has $160 billion under management.
Unlike the United States, where hedge funds are not required to disclose short positions, European rules brought in as a result of the financial crisis require publication once they go above a certain threshold.
Short selling is a mainstay of hedge fund investing and is driven by expectations that shares will fall, which means they can later be repurchased at a lower price to make a profit.
Although the filings do not say when Bridgewater first took out its European short positions, many of its above-threshold disclosures are recent, with some in Germany, Italy and France in the past two weeks.
Bridgewater's billionaire founder Ray Dalio spoke last month of the end of a buoyant global investment market.
""It just takes a little change in interest rates to have a bear market,"" he told CNBC at the World Economic Forum, adding the late part of the cycle may still have quite a way to run.
But in a post on Linkedin this week, he wrote: ""Recent spurts in stimulations, growth, and wage numbers signaled that the cycle is a bit ahead of where I thought it was.""
CHEAP HEDGE?
The European filings show Bridgewater has bet against firms ranging from Anglo-Dutch consumer giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) to French oil group  Total  (PA:TOTF), and from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and German industrial group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) to Italian bank Intesa (MI:ISP).
The group's short positions have emerged piecemeal in a series of filings that were made public throughout January and February, although Bridgewater will likely have built up its trades in advance of those announcements.
Bridgewater is not known for picking individual stocks and James Helliwell, chief investment strategist and director of the Lex van Dam Trading Academy, said he thought the manager's position was the result of a view on the wider economy.
""Whilst the extent to which it may be an outright short bet is uncertain, I suspect that it was seen as a relatively cheap hedge against existing global equity exposure.""
A London-based equity sales trader at a large U.S. bank said the shorts could just be a bet on fund outflows as volatility increases – which could explain why there are fewer Bridgewater shorts on the UK market – as UK stocks are very under-owned.
Bridgewater's short positions amount to more than $4.5 billion in France and top $7.3 billion in Germany, while in Spain its shorts in four groups amount to almost 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) and in Italy include Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Enel (MI:ENEL).
Stock markets, after years of steady increases, wobbled last week amid concern that central banks, which have printed money and cut interest rates to bolster economic activity following the financial crisis, will pare back their support.
Bridgewater's portfolio is fluid and it has been adjusting its trades, cutting back on shorts in the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland, while increasing them in Germany and Italy, the data reviewed by Reuters shows.
Bridgewater is not alone in its cautious stance, with BG Master Fund, based in Dublin, last week disclosing a 0.4 percent short position against German lender Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), while London-based Marshall Wace has made similar bets across Europe.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",More banks joining $14 billion debt for Blackstone's TR unit buy,"By Claire Ruckin and Andrew Berlin
LONDON (Reuters) - More banks are poised to join a $14 billion financing backing U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group’s (N:BX) acquisition of a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI), banking sources said on Wednesday. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JP Morgan are leading the financing and are talking to other banks including  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC and RBC about joining the deal shortly, the sources said.
“Every man and his dog is pitching to get in on the action,” a loan syndicate head said.
The large deal is attracting interest from banks vying for roles on the lucrative underwritten leveraged loan and high yield bond financing. 
New lenders are being offered fees to underwrite 28 percent of the transaction, which will reduce the risk of the three arranging banks, the sources said. Appointments will be partly based on how much business the banks do with Thomson Reuters, they added. 
Once the bank group is complete, the highly anticipated US$14bn financing is expected to launch for wider syndication to institutional investors in March, the sources said.
Blackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment. 
TIMING CONSIDERATIONS 
Recent market volatility has had a destabilising effect on the debt markets, which could be exacerbated by Wednesday's US inflation figures. 
The financing was underwritten before stock markets slumped on February 2, and the three lead banks may wait until market conditions are more stable to launch the deal. 
“US inflation figures will be a catalyst ... I would expect they (the lead banks) will want to see how the next few days play out, then they’ll either rush it out or hold out and hope things improve,” a senior investor said. 
Prolonged volatility could encourage banks joining the deal to negotiate for better fees and titles to compensate for increased market risk, the investor said. 
The jumbo deal is being run from New York and will require participation from nearly all Transatlantic loan and bond investors in order to play markets off against each other and achieve best execution for the borrower.
Secondary prices are a key indicator of volatility and sentiment and could also dictate timing as falling bids often encourage investors to seek more compensation. 
Banks and investors are confident that the financing will be well received as cash-rich funds are eager to put fresh capital to work in size, the sources said.
DEAL STRUCTURE
The financing is expected to be structured with 60 percent loans and 40 percent bonds, which will give an $8 billion-equivalent loan financing, and a potential split of $3 billion-equivalent secured bonds and $3 billion-equivalent of unsecured bonds, the sources said.
The debt will be mainly denominated in dollars and bankers are currently assessing how much will be denominated in euros. Even a small euro tranche could mean €1 billion-€2 billion of debt being syndicated in Europe, the sources said.
A $14 billion financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on last 12 months Ebitda of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of $8 billion-$9 billion, and junior debt of $4 billion-$5 billion, sources said.
Another source familiar with the matter said previously that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times.
Blackstone will acquire a 55 percent stake in the F&R business and Thomson Reuters will retain a 45 percent holding.

Loan Pricing Corp is a unit of Thomson Reuters.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Stock market shrugs off CPI rise but inflation obsession may linger,"By Lewis Krauskopf and April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - So, were the stock market's fears about inflation ... inflated?
U.S. stocks gained on Wednesday, shrugging off an initial sharp dip in premarket trading immediately after the release of U.S. government data that showed consumer prices rose more than expected in January. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent last month. That was higher than estimates for a 0.3 percent increase and the 0.2 percent in December. The year-on-year increase in the CPI was unchanged at 2.1 percent. 
At first blush, the move higher in stocks seemed counterintuitive. Investors had braced for Wednesday's Consumer Price Index data since concerns about firming inflation were blamed in part for the 10-percent pullback in the stock market from its Jan. 26 record high.
But investors pointed to several reasons why stocks were higher, with the S&P 500 up 0.8 percent in early afternoon trading.
For one, despite the higher-than-expected reading, annual inflation did not cause particular alarm. The ""core"" CPI, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3 percent, the largest increase since January 2017. Still, the year-on-year rise in the core CPI was unchanged at 1.8 percent in January.
In addition, while bond yields rose after the inflation data, the rates did not spike to levels that would be more worrisome for equities.
“Of itself, inflation, particularly driven by higher demand, is not necessarily negative for equities,"" said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Rather, Meckler said, the concern is if bond rates adjust substantially higher in response to inflation data. Such increases in bond rates would provide more investment competition to stocks, after years of low yields made equities comparatively more desirable.
On Wednesday, while yields climbed, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had not yet risen significantly above 2.90 in yield, a level that was closely watched.
""Maybe if we saw the yield continue to rise, if it went up past 2.90, it might hit stocks,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director for institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""That it’s stabilized has helped.""
The Federal Reserve, whose mandate includes price stability, has a 2-percent inflation target. But the U.S. Central Bank tracks the different personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price indexes, which has consistently undershot the Fed's target.
“Inflation has to be put into context,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis in New York. ""The year-over-year rate on the core is still below 2 percent. The core PCE, which the Fed thinks is better, is even lower, well below 2 percent."" 
Even as the stock market shrugged off Wednesday's data, the focus on inflation may linger. Equity investors will look to the monthly CPI data much in the same way they have done for the U.S. employment report, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.

""I fully anticipate that when this time rolls around next month, (investors) will obsess about it at that time,"" Todd said.

FRANKFURT/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A U.S. investigation into whether  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) hired referrals from government agencies in Asia in exchange for business poses another reputational hurdle for CEO Tidjane Thiam as the Swiss bank enters the final stretch of a three-year turnaround plan.
Credit Suisse said on Wednesday that it was in contact with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about its hiring in Asia because of potential violation of U.S. foreign corruption law.
The revelation comes just a week after Credit Suisse terminated a publicly traded product betting on future stock index swings after its value plunged during a market rout.
On Wednesday, as the bank announced its third consecutive annual loss, its chief executive played down the fallout from that product's collapse. [L8N1Q411O]
""It worked well for a long time until it didn't. Which is generally what happens in markets,"" Thiam said, noting the prospectus made clear the product was not for amateurs and warned about the risk of substantial losses. 
He conceded, however, that he could not predict whether law suits would result. 
""It is not in my gift to predict whether there'll be a litigation against us or not ... the prospectus is extremely clear, I have had to read it myself,"" he told analysts on a conference call.
""We believe that the disclosures made and the kind of role we played, which is really to be manufacturers, we mostly interacted with market makers and were not involved in the distribution (of the product), leaves us in a reasonable position,"" he said. 
The events of the past week, combined with activist investor pressure, have put the bank's image in focus.
""This is the year when they have to prove that it is working,"" said Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontonbel, commenting on Thiam's efforts to make the bank profitable.
Credit Suisse did not identify which country or countries the Asia hiring probe is focused on. Asia became a focal point for Thiam shortly after he joined in the middle of 2015. 
Several of Credit Suisse's rivals have in recent years faced scrutiny over their hiring, in particular of the children of important Chinese officials, known as ""princelings"".
It was a practice that became common over the past two decades as banks scrambled to build ""guanxi"" – connections, or mutual obligations - with important Chinese officials. 
Helman Sitohang, Credit Suisse's CEO for Asia Pacific, said: ""We have decided to put up the disclosure, but ... the only thing I can say (is) ... that we are cooperating with the authorities on that.""
In 2016, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) paid $264 million to U.S. authorities to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials to win banking deals.
While personal connections have long been a way of doing business in much of Asia, the scrutiny from U.S. regulators ensured the issue became increasingly sensitive in recent years.

644,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Seattle ICE lawyer charged with stealing immigrants' identities,"(Reuters) - The chief counsel for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Seattle will appear in federal court on Thursday to face charges that he stole the identities of immigrants to defraud banks.
Raphael A. Sanchez is accused of devising a scheme to obtain money and property by using the identities of ""seven aliens in various stages of immigration proceedings"" with ICE over a period of four years to defraud  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Corp, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and others, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle.
Sanchez, who is due to make an initial court appearance Thursday morning, is charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, court documents show.
He has resigned from the agency, his lawyer, Cassandra Stamm, said on Wednesday.
The offenses allegedly took place between October 2013 and October 2017, and included an instance of forwarding a copy of part of a Chinese passport and other information from his government email address, according to court documents.
The investigation involved ICE’s internal affairs division, according to an ICE official, who referred questions to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The Justice Department, whose Public Integrity Section brought the charges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
As chief counsel, Sanchez was involved in a $2.25 million government settlement in 2015 with Broetje Orchards, a Washington state company that admitted to employing unauthorized workers after being told by ICE they did not have permission to work in the United States.

Even, 49, was CEO of the helicopter engines business at  Safran  (PA:SAF), and succeeds Guillaume Faury, who is moving to become president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.
Airbus Helicopters has suffered from a slowdown in orders in recent years due to a downturn in the oil and gas sector, one of its main customers, and expects deliveries in 2018 to be roughly on a par with last year.
Even will also have to redefine the X6 heavy helicopter, which has suffered technological challenges and which Faury said last month would likely turn out differently than originally envisaged.

663,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Fannie Needs First Bailout Aid Since 2012 After Tax-Cut Loss,"(Bloomberg) --  Fannie Mae  (OTC:FNMA) will request an infusion of taxpayer money for the first time since 2012 because of an unintended but anticipated side effect of the corporate tax cut signed into law in December.
The mortgage-finance company, which reported fourth-quarter and full-year financial results on Wednesday, said it will need to draw $3.7 billion from the U.S. Treasury in March to keep its net worth from going negative.
The deficit was driven by a $6.5 billion loss in the fourth quarter, which came as a result of a drop in the value of assets Fannie can use to offset taxes. The assets became less valuable when Congress cut the corporate tax rate, resulting in a $9.9 billion hit.
Fannie Chief Executive Officer Timothy J. Mayopoulos said in a statement that the company’s underlying business was strong.
The loss and bailout is not so much a black eye for Fannie as it is for Congress and policy makers who for more than nine years have failed to determine the futures of Fannie and Freddie Mac.
Federal regulators took over the two companies during the 2008 financial crisis, eventually injecting them with $187.5 billion in bailout money. Some members of Congress and other policy makers have said the companies should be replaced with a system that doesn’t leave taxpayers on the hook for losses, but no plan has gained enough traction to be implemented.
Capital Buffers
In the meantime, Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability. Since 2008, the companies have paid $278.8 billion to the U.S. Treasury. They currently send nearly all of their profits to the government and aren’t required to pay anything when they have losses. In December, the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which controls the companies, agreed to allow Fannie and Freddie to hold capital buffers of $3 billion a piece.
Fannie and Freddie don’t make loans themselves. They buy them from lenders, wrap them into securities and make guarantees to make investors whole if the loans default.
For the full year 2017, Fannie said it earned $2.5 billion, compared with $12.3 billion in 2016. Its net interest income in the fourth quarter, which includes fees to guarantee mortgages, was $5.1 billion compared with $5.8 billion in the year before.
In an interview, Mayopoulos said he believed investors in the company’s mortgage bonds won’t be spooked by the need for taxpayer money.
Relatively Stable
“Anybody who’s been paying attention to the situation has been entirely aware that this draw was likely,” Mayopoulos said.
Apart from the tax-cut issue, Fannie’s business was relatively stable.
The percentage of mortgages that it backs that were at least 90 days delinquent increased to 1.24 percent as of Dec. 31, up from 1.01 percent on Sept. 30. The company said the increase was a result of the recent hurricanes.
Fannie said that despite the quarterly loss, FHFA Director Mel Watt directed the company and Freddie Mac to continue making payments to trust funds they finance for affordable housing. Some Republicans have said those payments should stop when Fannie and Freddie draw from taxpayer funds. In its annual report, Fannie said Watt would continue them “in light of FHFA’s determination that this draw is triggered by a one-time charge.”
In letters to Fannie and Freddie Mac this month, Watt wrote he didn’t consider the tax-cut losses “to relate to any financial instability” in the companies “either now or in the future.”
Spokeswomen for the Treasury Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Freddie Mac is scheduled to report fourth quarter and full-year earnings on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New engines made by Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) for the latest Airbus (PA:AIR) single-aisle jetliner, the A320neo, pose a potential shutdown risk, the U.S. aviation regulator said on Wednesday. 
The Federal Aviation Administration's formal warning follows a similar action by European regulators on Feb. 9, and cites a ""knife edge seal fracture"" in the engine that could lead to an engine stall ""and consequent inflight shutdown and rejected takeoffs,"" the FAA said in an airworthiness directive.
The warnings mark the latest in a string of issues that have clouded the rollout of Pratt's new engines, which compete with market-leader CFM International, a joint venture of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and  Safran  SA (PA:SAF) of France. 
A total of 98 engines could be affected, with 43 confirmed to have the problem and the rest possibly affected, Pratt said. The company declined to comment further.
Pratt has not halted production or delivery of the engines, and the Connecticut-based company plans to submit a proposal to European regulators on Friday detailing how to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with the situation. 
It wasn't clear how quickly the European Aviation Safety Agency could approve the plan.
The problem affects only PW-1100 series engines, not similar Pratt engines for Bombardier, Embraer or Mitsubishi jets, the source said. 

Airbus halted delivery of A320neos after delivering 113 of them. It was not immediately clear which airlines had the largest fleet. Industry sources said 20 Airbus A320neos had been grounded by airlines because of the problem.

671,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>",The 10-year nears its highest level since January 2014 after CPI tops estimates," US Treasury yields are spiking after Wednesday's consumer price index report showed inflation rose quicker than expected in January.
The report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed consumer prices jumped 2.1% year-on-year in January. Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose 1.8%. Wall Street economists were expecting respective prints of 1.9% and 1.7%.
Post-data selling has Treasury yields up almost 5 basis points in the belly of the curve. Here's a look at the scoreboard as of 8:35 a.m. ET:
The more than 4-bp rise in the 10-year yield has near its highest levels since January 2014. The benchmark yield nearly hit 2.9% on Monday as traders have been selling Treasurys in droves amid fears rising inflation will cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates quicker than anticipated.
At its February meeting, the central bank said it expected to raise rates three times in 2018. However, many market participants now think there could be a fourth hike this year.
Wednesday's selloff has had little impact on the yield curve as the 2-10-year spread trades little changed near 73 bps."

674,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 10:53AM ET</span>",Wall Street needs to brace for an even bigger inflation scare," Wall Street is worried about inflation.
The anticipated January  consumer-price index report, released Wednesday, didn't help calm those concerns. It showed the basket of consumer goods increased 2.1% year-on-year, more than economists had forecast.
Inflation concerns intensified after the January jobs report showed the largest increase in average hourly earnings since 2008. This helped drive the stock market into a correction, as investors realized the era of low interest rates — a key catalyst for the bull market — could be fading away for good.
But an even bigger shock could emerge in April and May, when the reports for the preceding months are released. In April, year-over-year inflation would face what economists describe as an adverse base effect: because last year was unusually low, the rate of change could be larger than normal.
""I currently spend significant amounts of time on the phone, emails, and in meetings explaining this coming jump in the March and April inflation data, and I have come to the conclusion that this is not priced in to rates at all,"" said Torsten Sløk, the chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), in a note on Monday.
Inflation could rise even more in the coming months mainly because of two components that cheapened significantly a year ago: cellphone plans and medical services.
Inflation started to fall early in 2017, defying many economists' expectations it would instead move closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This was puzzling, since the textbook said prices should have been rising in a tight labor market and low unemployment environment.
The cost of cellphone plans and medical services were eventually blamed.
Spearheaded by  T-Mobile, the telecoms giants were engaged in a years-long price war that eventually forced all of them to offer customers cheap,  unlimited data plans.
And so, the drop in wireless service costs dragged the monthly change in the core personal consumption expenditures index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs and is the Fed's preferred way to measure inflation.
Last March, core PCE fell on an annual basis for the first time in seven years. It was mainly dragged down by cellphone-plan prices, which dropped 7% that month.
The Fed dismissed the inflation slowdown as being driven by ""idiosyncratic"" factors including cheaper cellphone services. The cost of service has since stabilized, and data from as recently as Wednesday shows that inflation is picking up.
The cost of physicians' services was another drag on inflation last year that could add to the base effect in a few months.
Omair Sharif, a senior US economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), points out the Bureau of Labor Statistics saw ""large cash price decreases for office visits"" to doctors last April; that month, the physicians' services index fell 1.2% seasonally adjusted, its largest such drop.
Sharif explained that as consumers faced ever-rising deductibles on health insurance, more of them chose to pay for some services out-of-pocket, with cash. ""Importantly, providers charge lower fees for services when they are being paid cash, as it cuts out costly back-office paperwork needed to deal with reimbursements from health insurers and the government,"" he said.
""Thus, the prospect of saving money by paying cash for services, which could lead to a smaller out-of-pocket payment than maxing out ever-increasing deductibles, seems to be partly behind the rise in cash payments.""
Besides these two quirks, inflation is likely headed higher, not lower, according to Nomura economists. That's because the US economy is being injected with fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and the economy is close to full employment.
""It almost goes without saying that against that backdrop, the risks to our inflation and interest rate forecasts are skewed to the upside,"" Lewis Alexander, the chief US economist, said in a note."

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's En+ Group (L:ENPLq) has invited international banks to pitch for the sale of $1 billion(721.60 million pounds) of shares in the company that manages the aluminum and hydropower businesses of Russian businessmen Oleg Deripaska, three sources said.
The inclusion of Deripaska on a U.S. list of Russian oligarchs published on Jan. 29, however, is making some U.S. banks who worked with En+ on its initial public offering (IPO) in November wary about participating this time, one of the sources said.
The source, whose institution has been asked to pitch for the new business, said while there was no suggestion advising on the share sale would attract U.S. fines, compliance departments were concerned about any risk of reputational damage.
""Banks don't want headlines. Client selection is a massive issue,"" said the banking source.
The U.S. Treasury has said the report, which also includes lists of senior political figures and the heads of state-run companies, was not a sanctions list. 
A spokesman for En+  declined to comment on the planned share sale or whether U.S. banks might be reluctant to work with the company because of the U.S. list.
A spokeswoman for Deripaska said: ""We do not comment on market rumors.""
Deripaska and family members own 76.6 percent of En+, which has assets in metals and energy, including a 48 percent controlling stake in Hong Kong-listed Russian aluminum producer Rusal (HK:0486).
When En+ listed in London, U.S. institutions Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC), Citi (N:C) and JP Morgan (N:JPM), along with Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and Russian banks Sberbank (MM:SBER) and VTB Capital (MM:VTBR) led the float.
The $1.5 billion IPO was the first major listing in London by a Russian company since 2014, when Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula triggered Western sanctions against Moscow. 
U.S. LISTS
Since the IPO, Deripaska and another 95 Russians worth more than $1 billion were named in a report the U.S. Treasury Department was required by Congress to compile as part of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
""The inclusion of individuals or entities in this report, its appendices, or its classified annex does not, in and of itself, imply, give rise to, or create any restrictions, prohibitions, or limitations on dealings with such persons by either U.S. or foreign persons,"" the U.S. Treasury said on its website.
However, several businessmen on the list said Russian companies may start having problems in their dealings with international banks because of the report.
Deripaska was ranked by Forbes magazine on Wednesday as Russia's 20th richest man, with a net worth of $6.7 billion. 
The industrial assets that form the core of his wealth were acquired during the chaotic sell-off of Russian state assets in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Along with En+, Deripaska also controls Russian light vehicle maker GAZ (MM:GAZA) and has agriculture, airport and other businesses.
One of the sources said the planned share sale by En+ was expected to happen after Russia's presidential election in March, which incumbent Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win.
It was not immediately clear why En+ wanted to sell shares or whether the offering would be of new or existing shares.
Before the November listing of shares in London and Moscow, the company's net debt was $13.1 billion. It reduced that by repaying a $943 million loan to VTB, Russia's second-largest lender, following the listing.

In December, En+ said its third-quarter net profit rose 43 percent to $350 million helped by higher aluminum prices.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 10:34AM ET</span>","Higher wages, fuel prices turn up cost pressure on airlines","By Victoria Bryan
BERLIN (Reuters) - With inflation paramount in investors' minds at a time of rising wages and oil prices, the line separating winners and losers in the global airline industry this year looks likely to be drawn on how well they manage costs, especially on the labor side.
Industry body IATA in December flagged higher spending on labor and fuel - which make up about half of airlines' operating expenses - as their members' biggest challenge in 2018, especially after several years of record profits.
Labor costs surpassed fuel as global airlines' biggest single expense in 2016, at 22 percent of costs against just under 21 percent for fuel. That is expected to jump this year to 30.9 percent versus 20.5 percent for fuel.
Back in 2013, when oil prices were much higher than now, fuel was 33 percent of expenses against 18 percent for labor.
Staff costs are typically higher in North America and Europe than in Asia, where fuel remains the biggest expense. 
The crux of the issue is that amid signs of a global shortage of workers generally, in some regions there's also a scarcity of qualified pilots at a time of expanding fleets.
""As airlines have been making profit, the workforce has got market power, so that is pushing up the cost of labor,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said in an interview. 
Overall, unit costs - the measure of how much it costs an airline to operate each kilometer and seat flown - will rise 4.3 percent this year versus 1.7 percent in 2017, IATA forecasts.
In the highest profile example of the pressures, budget carrier Ryanair (I:RYA) was compelled last year by pilot shortages to cancel thousands of flights, and in December recognized trade unions for the first time.
The battle that forced Ryanair's hand could put wage pressures on other European budget carriers such as Wizz (L:WIZZ), industry experts say. 
The bigger carriers feel it too.
At Air France (PA:AIRF), 10 unions representing pilots, cabin and ground staff have called for a strike on Feb. 22 to push a demand for a 6 percent pay rise.
""After three years of strong profitability improvements in the sector, we believe personnel and suppliers are asking for wage/price increases and thus keeping non-fuel costs under control will remain a challenge for the sector,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Ruxandra Haradau-Doser wrote.
The wage issue has even extended to the United Arab Emirates, the Middle East trade and financial hub where labor disputes are rare and unions and industrial action are banned.
The region's largest airline, Dubai-based Emirates, is facing calls from cabin crew to improve conditions and benefits. Employees say management is considering their requests.
Last week, brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux cut its rating on German flagship carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) - already on its lists of stocks to avoid and least preferred in the sector - to ""reduce"" from ""hold"".
In the United States, investors are worried that the three largest carriers - American (O:AAL), Delta (N:DAL) and United (N:UAL) - are heading for a price war just as higher costs from pay increases agreed last year start to bite.
CONSOLIDATION 
Lufthansa, British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) and Air France-KLM are all expected to report improved 2017 profits when they publish results over the next few weeks.
All airlines will need to look at areas where they can save, however.
""The most successful airline managements are the ones that have been very cost-focused every day - not just on staff costs but on aircraft costs, airport charges, distribution costs and so on,"" said aviation consultant John Strickland.
The success of Ryanair, which boasts of having the lowest costs in Europe, is partly down to hard negotiating with manufacturers and airports to get good deals on orders and fees, those in the industry say. 
Strickland said that while pilot costs would rise, Ryanair was unique in having much lower overall costs than rivals.
""If they can continue to keep other items such as airport and aircraft costs down, then they will still be in a very strong position."" 
Lufthansa has been taking a tougher stance lately both with staff and airports.
Unlike in previous negotiations for its main brand in Germany, Lufthansa stayed firm during a series of pilot strikes from 2014 to 2016 and has now struck a deal to cut its cockpit staff costs by 15 percent, while an increase in ground staff's wages will be partly linked to company profits.
Last year, it also put pressure on Frankfurt Airport operator  Fraport  (DE:FRAG) by moving planes to Munich. It predicts unit costs will fall by 1-2 percent this year.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) say while such measures should help Lufthansa, the rate of improvement is not sustainable and progress still needs to be made at budget unit Eurowings, which earns less than half the margin of its nearest peer.
""There is a significant amount more work for the company to do on its cost base,"" they wrote in a note. 
Along with strong travel demand thanks to robust economies and low oil prices last year, European airlines have also benefited from some consolidation following the insolvencies of Air Berlin and Monarch, which helped lead to higher ticket prices.
In addition, many European carriers hedged on jet fuel - unlike their U.S. counterparts who got burned making the wrong bets when the oil price starting tumbling in mid-2014 - meaning the impact of higher fuel prices will come through for European airlines later than U.S. ones. 
EasyJet's  revenue per seat rose 6.6 percent at constant currencies in the quarter to end-December, the no-frills airline said, citing the struggles of rivals including Air Berlin, Monarch, Ryanair and Alitalia. It forecast a rise of 5-9 percent for the six months to March.

""Airlines need to be careful they don't lock themselves into cost structures that are too high for weaker economic conditions,"" IATA'S Pearce warned. ""At the moment, they're not doing that but it's always a risk.""

According to strategists at firms including Amundi and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbing up into the 3 percent to 3.5 percent range would reach the “pain threshold” for equities, turning them less attractive than fixed-income assets. The yield surged on Wednesday, spurring fresh declines in equity markets, after data showed January consumer prices rose more than forecast in the U.S. SocGen says a level of 3 percent could send the S&P 500 Index below 2,500, which implies a 6.1 percent slide from Tuesday’s close.
Stock markets around the world tumbled in the past two weeks, with the initial selloff prompted by bond moves after data showed signs of wage growth in the U.S. Since September’s low of 2 percent, the Treasury yield has jumped to a four-year high of nearly 2.9 percent this week. The equity recovery this week has been shaky as investors remain wary of buying the dip.
Many market participants see a further yield rise above 3 percent as a potential game changer, putting pressure on equity valuations while also making it more expensive for companies to borrow money. Here are some views from strategists and fund managers on the theme that has gripped markets this month.

In a potential new hurdle for the proposed $15.7 billion takeover of Sky, Avaaz said that a High Court judge had allowed the challenge to broadcast regulator Ofcom's ruling last June that a Fox-controlled Sky would be a 'fit and proper' owner of broadcast licenses in Britain.
Avaaz said the case would be heard before the end of June, potentially complicating an agreement to sell Sky to Fox and then on to  Disney  (N:DIS) if a separate sale of tycoon Rupert Murdoch's TV and film assets receives the green light.
The regulator said allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News in the U.S. were extremely serious and disturbing, but had found no clear evidence to suggest senior executives at Fox were aware of the misconduct.
""We will defend our 'fit and proper' assessment, which was independent, expert and based on the evidence,"" an Ofcom spokesman said in a statement. 

The deal already faces other obstacles. Last month Britain's competition regulator said that it should be blocked unless a way is found to prevent Murdoch, who owns the Times and the Sun newspapers, from influencing Sky's news output.

(Reuters) - Fossil Group Inc's (O:FOSL) shares soared 79 percent in early trading on Wednesday as short sellers rushed to cover their positions, a day after the watchmaker posted a better-than-expected increase in sales in the holiday quarter.
Fossil, struggling with declining sales in Europe and several other operational problems, is heavily shorted - an indication that market players bet that it would report disappointing results.
Nearly 40 percent of its outstanding shares were shorted as of Jan. 31, according to Thomson Reuters data, making it currently the third-most shorted stock on the S&P 600 consumer discretionary sector (SPSMCD).
""The better than expected fourth quarter earnings performance can improve confidence in the company's financial outlook,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey said in a note.
""However, we continue to see visibility to ultimate topline and profitability potential as difficult,"" Telsey said, adding that she expected a significant shortcovering fueled rally on Wednesday.
She more than doubled her price target on the stock to $15.
Fossil Group shares rose to $16.18 and on track to move to their highest since May 9, 2017. The stock has lost 61 percent over the past year, excluding gains on Wednesday.
If gains hold, Fossil Group is on track to gain over $350 million market capitalization.
While there were bright spots in the quarter - tighter cost control and a 31 percent surge in e-commerce sales - nothing had fundamentally changed for the company, analysts said.
""The company is seeing no stabilization of the traditional watch category,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Ike Boruchow said. ""This simply isn't a fundamentally sound business right now."" 
Boruchow, however, raised his price target by $4 to $8, citing a two percent gain in same-store sales, helped by higher demand in the Americas and Europe - the company's biggest contributors to sales.
The company said on Tuesday that it had introduced a number of new models before the holiday quarter, which fueled a double-digit increase in Armani watch sales. 
But Fossil, which also sells watches for brands such as DKNY and Skagen, discounted slow-moving items in the December quarter, a sign that it was struggling to compete with a certain section of the wearables market dominated by Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) and  Garmin Ltd  (O:GRMN).
Five out of 10 brokerages covering the stock rate it a ""hold"", while only one rates it a ""buy"". The remaining rate the stock a ""sell"" or lower.

Power","(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) cars won in six of the 19 categories in an annual auto industry reliability survey published on Wednesday, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) trailed in the bottom three of the report's main rankings.
Consultancy J.D. Power's closely-watched 2018 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study, put Toyota ninth overall and its Lexus luxury vehicle division first in the survey of owners of three-year old cars.
Overall the study showed a 9 percent improvement in vehicle dependability from 2017, the first time the industry-wide score has improved since 2013.
""Strong dependability scores not only improve demand for used vehicles, but also are a contributor to higher residual values,"" Jonathan Banks, Vice President of Vehicle Analysis and Analytics at J.D. Power said.
""Improving dependability ultimately supports new vehicle sales and provides a better perception of the brand.""
Lexus topped the rankings for a seventh consecutive year with a score of 99 problems per hundred cars, compared to 127 for Toyota overall.
Porsche was a close second with 100 problems per hundred and Buick third with 116 — the strongest performance for dependability among mass-market brands.
The study measures the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles during the past 12 months by original owners of 2015 model-year vehicles, with a lower score reflecting higher quality.
The survey also said that, while FCA was the third worst rated overall with 192 problems per hundred, Fiat was also the most improved.
""All FCA US brands improved their scores year-over-year in J.D. Power's 2018 Vehicle Dependability Study, with the exception of the Chrysler Brand,"" FCA U.S said in a statement.
""The Chrysler Brand's ranking is primarily attributed to a launch year of the Chrysler 200, which is no longer in production.""
The study is based on responses from 36,896 original owners.

""From the time of Fox's offer, we recognized that Sky was worth far more than offered,"" Nicolas Dautigny, a senior portfolio manager at Polygon, said in a statement to Reuters. ""Yesterday's news reinforces our view.""
Following the auction of domestic Premier League rights for 2019-22, Sky said it would be spending 16 percent less per game than under its present three-year deal.
Shares in Sky rose 3.5 percent to a two-year high of 10.98 pounds earlier on Wednesday, exceeding the 10.75 pounds per share that Fox agreed to pay for the group in December 2016.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The chief executive of online food ordering firm Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) expects competition from the likes of Amazon (O:AMZN) and Uber to make it harder to make money although the German company is still targeting breakeven this year.
Niklas Ostberg, a Swedish former management consultant who founded the company in 2011, said Delivery Hero has the critical mass to fend off the U.S. giants, but admits their move into food delivery could dampen profits.
""It will be difficult for all the market players to survive. Everybody is fighting for size, because only then you have a chance. It will be hard to make any money as long as competition is as it is right now,"" Ostberg told Reuters.
As most people only download and use one food delivery app, start-ups spend heavily on marketing to win control of markets. Ostberg said Uber and Amazon can promote food delivery to existing customers and cross-subsidise the business.
The German firm is the world's biggest food delivery platform, covering more than 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, and partnering with more than 150,000 restaurants.
It says it is market leader in 35 of those countries, although it is battling with Takeaway.com (AS:TKWY) for control of its home market, prompting the chief executive of its Dutch rival to raise the idea of a merger last month.
Ostberg rejected suggestions that any deal was imminent with Takeaway.com, saying acquisitions were less important now the company has reached scale, although it would still consider ""interesting"" targets.
""We have the size that is necessary to sustain competition,"" said Ostberg, who was a top cross country skier for Sweden in his youth.
Delivery Hero, in which South African e-commerce giant Naspers (J:NPNJn) and Germany's  Rocket Internet  (DE:RKET) are major investors, is well placed for more acquisitions after it made a placement of new shares to raise funds.
Delivery Hero, Takeaway.com and Britain's  Just Eat  (L:JE) have built their businesses by creating booking platforms that advertise local restaurants, which handle their own deliveries.
The entry of Uber and Amazon into the sector has made them put a bigger focus on managing logistics, although Ostberg does not expect the business of delivering their own orders to expand much beyond 15 percent of sales.
""Economics may get tougher ... we may compete more and more on the delivery fees. The winner will be the one who is efficient enough to afford it,"" Ostberg said.
Ostberg reiterated a goal to break even in terms of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2018 and make a profit on that basis in 2019.
UberEats has signed up more than 80,000 restaurants in nearly 200 cities around the world, while Amazon currently has a food delivery service open to members of its Prime shopping club in cities across the United States and in London.
Ostberg said the German market was smaller than one might expect, with order volumes similar to those it sees in Kuwait, with just a fraction of the population.
""Germans are probably a bit conservative to adopt new things. It might take 20 or 40 years until they order food like the most advanced nations,"" he said.
Last week, Delivery Hero reported 2017 sales rose 60 percent to 544 million euros (484.69 million pounds) on a like-for-like basis, with growth particularly strong in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia.

(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) shares jumped more than 11 percent premarket on Wednesday, as analysts called its recruitment of Taco Bell chief executive Brian Niccol a potentially ""transformational moment"" after two years of brand-crushing food-safety scandals.
However, they cautioned that Niccol - the man behind ""Doritos Locos Tacos"" and a savvy marketer who could transform Chipotle's menu - would need at least a year to make an impact as chief executive.
Some underlined the stark differences in Taco Bell and Chipotle's business models and the scale of the burrito chain's problems in two years that saw its stock sink nearly 50 percent.
Of 37 analysts who cover the stock there were no changes in ratings on the news.
But after another round of results last week that offered few major new ideas on how to turn around Chipotle's battered public reputation, they said Niccol's appointment was at least a step in the right direction. 
Niccol checks all the boxes for the skill set Chipotle needs, including operational expertise, turnaround experience, brand management knowledge and credibility with investors, several analysts said. 
""We're hard-pressed to find a better fit for Chipotle's CEO position than Brian Niccol,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said in a note. 
At Taco Bell, Niccol has largely been credited for mastering mobile ordering and introducing food options such as Doritos tacos and Nacho Fries, which were a big hit among customers. 
BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said he expected the new CEO would lean on his past success driving sales at Taco Bell by introducing breakfast, limited-time-offers and compelling marketing to help improve trends at the company.
But Saleh stuck to his neutral rating for the company. 
""Niccol was critical to Taco Bell's turnaround, but we note CMG is starting in a position of far greater weakness,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.

""Further, we note Mr. Niccol has less experience with cost management, given Taco Bell is a primarily franchised brand compared to Chipotle's 100 percent company-operated model,"" Charles said.

736,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 07:55AM ET</span>","For India's banks, the worst of their bad-loan woes may be yet to come","By Devidutta Tripathy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Just when many Indian banks thought the worst of their bad debt woes were behind them, new central bank rules are stoking fears that the worst of the soured-loans buildup is yet to come.
The central bank surprised the financial sector this week by halting all of its existing loan-restructuring mechanisms with immediate effect, and rolling out new rules that will push more debt defaulters into bankruptcy courts.
To force its point home, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set strict timelines for lenders to take action against defaulters, threatening penalties if banks failed to act in a timely manner.
Soured loans, which include non-performing, restructured or rolled-over loans, reached a record high of 9.5 trillion rupees ($148 billion) in the middle of last year before dipping slightly and prompting some relief among bankers that the worst was over. State-run lenders account for the bulk of these loans.
India's bad loans have nearly doubled in the past four years following an economic slow down and years of profligate lending - the combination has choked new lending and dragged on the economy.
Analysts say the actual level of bad loans is higher than the official figures suggest, pointing to central bank audits of banks, including  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), that showed non-performing loans were higher than reported for the financial year ended March 2017. Banks have also been blamed for perpetually renewing loans on soured assets. 
Most of the loan-restructuring schemes that the central bank is withdrawing have seen little success. Analysts say banks will soon have to declare the loans in those schemes as non-performing loans, which will trigger the timeline for banks to take debtors to court.
That means the banking sector will have to recognize the new status of the loans and make provisions for them, said Rajkiran Rai, chief executive at state-run  Union Bank of India  (NS:UNBK).
""When you look at the short term, yes, we will have issues with the existing accounts,"" Rai said.
Longer term, the RBI's measure will benefit banks, he said.
Indeed, the new rules would bring discipline to the banking sector, although provisioning costs will shoot up as more borrowers are taken to court, said R. Subramaniakumar, chief executive at  Indian Overseas Bank  (NS:IOBK), a state-run lender with the second-highest bad loan ratio among all banks.
""Of course it's going to put pressure on bank's balance sheets,"" he said, adding capital injections announced by the government will help cushion the impact. 
The RBI's decision to force more struggling borrowers into bankruptcy proceedings was its latest move to try to clean up India's bad loans mess.
Last year, it ordered about 40 of the country's largest debt defaulters into bankruptcy courts, demanding creditors put aside at least 50 percent of loan amounts in provisioning.
Under the new process, the RBI requires banks to figure out plans to resolve debts of defaulters with 20 billion rupees ($311 million) or more in outstanding debt by Sept. 1, or take them to bankruptcy court. 
Since 50 percent provisioning will be required for these bankruptcy cases as well, the total funds that banks will have to set aside will shoot up, pressuring profits, analysts said.
Moody's Indian affiliate ICRA estimates the criteria would net 50 defaulting companies with combined outstanding debt of 2.46 trillion rupees ($38 billion), so banks' credit provisions will spike.
India Ratings and Research, the local affiliate of Fitch, said banks' non-performing loans and provisions will shoot up in coming months, said analyst Udit Kariwala.
Rajeev Kumar, the top government bureaucrat overseeing the banking sector, said the new rules will impact 2-3 percent of banks' loan books, while provisions could rise a ""little"", financial news service NewsRise reported.
Bank shares slid on Wednesday, with the sector index (NSEBANK) falling 1.4 percent compared with a 0.4 percent fall in the broader market.

(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co will pay Nektar Therapeutics $1.85 billion in cash and share purchase for a global development and commercialization deal on a promising Nektar cancer drug, the companies announced on Wednesday.
In one of the largest single-drug collaboration deals ever, Nektar will receive $1 billion in cash upfront and Bristol-Myers will purchase about 8.28 million Nektar shares at $102.60 per share, or an equity stake of just under 5 percent of the company. Nektar shares closed at $75.66 on Nasdaq on Tuesday.
The partnership is built around the Nektar drug, NKTR-214, which will be tested in combination with Bristol's immuno-oncology (IO) drugs Opdivo and Opdivo and Yervoy in 20 cancer indications across nine different tumor types, including melanoma, kidney and lung cancers, following ""very encouraging"" early data from clinical trials.
""We've been in a clinical collaboration with Nektar since 2016. This partnership was a natural next step,"" Paul Biondi, head of business development for Bristol-Myers, said in a telephone interview.
The combination therapies could become ""potentially a new backbone in the IO space,"" he added.
Early immunotherapy leader Bristol-Myers has been viewed by investors as having fallen behind Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co in the burgeoning field, especially in the most lucrative lung cancer space.
NKTR-214, an interleukin-2 (IL-2) agonist, is designed to increase the number and activation state of cancer-fighting T cells in the tumor microenvironment, while limiting IL-2 toxicity, with the hope of improving and lengthening patient responses.
Under the deal terms, Nektar is also eligible to receive an additional $1.78 billion in milestone payments, of which $1.43 billion are development and regulatory milestones and the remainder are sales milestones.
Following approvals, Nektar will book revenue for worldwide sales of NKTR-214 and the companies will split the global profits, with Nektar receiving 65 percent and Bristol-Myers 35 percent, they said. Bristol-Myers will retain 100 percent of product revenues for its own medicines.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, the companies said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a 15-month low against the yen on Wednesday, while world stock markets found firmer ground ahead of U.S. inflation numbers that could soothe, or inflame, fears of faster interest-rate hikes globally.
European stock markets (STOXX) were broadly higher thanks to strong earnings results and data confirmed the fastest euro zone economic growth for more than 10 years in 2017.
Blue-chip indexes in London (FTSE), Paris (FCHI) and Frankfurt (GDAXI) were up around 0.7 percent each, while higher U.S. stock futures (ESc1) (1YMc1) pointed to a positive start for Wall Street shares which climbed on Tuesday for a third straight day. 
The VIX stocks volatility index meanwhile dipped to a one-week low at 22.81 (VIX), a sign that a degree of calm had returned to markets after last week's ructions.
Still, Asian shares were mixed and Japan's benchmark Nikkei closed down 0.4 percent (N225) as the yen rose and with investor sentiment generally strained ahead of the U.S. January inflation report at 1330 GMT.
That data has taken on particular significance after recent strong wage growth data prompted investors to ratchet up expectations for U.S. rate hikes this year and sparked a rout in world stock markets.
""Markets have suddenly woken up to the fact that central banks are tightening rates and economists have been saying for a year now that inflation is being artificially suppressed by non-market forces,"" said UBS global chief economist Paul Donovan.
""As a result, today's data has the potential to get investors really excited if it comes in higher than expected.""
Headline consumer price inflation is forecast to slow to an annual 1.9 percent and core inflation to 1.7 percent, an outcome that could help calm nerves. 
Unease about the looming inflation data was perhaps greatest in currency markets, where the dollar slid to a 15-month low against the Japanese currency at around 106.82 yen . 
It recovered to 107.37 yen in London but was still down 0.4 percent on the day. 
Measured against a basket of currencies (DXY), the dollar was steady at 89.74, having dipped to a one-week low. The euro was flat at around $1.2348 (EUR=).
The dollar index has now given up two-thirds of the gains it notched up this month when investors rushed into the greenback as equity markets suffered a violent sell-off.
""My read is the dollar has not benefited in line with previous corrections of this magnitude. The dollar move also reflects the fact this has not yet become a correction where markets and investors are worried about the macro backdrop,"" said Kamakshya Trivedi co-head of global FX and EM strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). ""(Today's) CPI will be key to see if the correction extends further or if we are near the end of it.""
ALL ABOUT THE DATA 
In Europe, strong economic data reinforced the brighter outlook for the world economy, supporting sentiment towards risk assets such as southern European bonds (IT10YT=RR).
Euro zone industrial production jumped more than expected in December, while the euro zone statistics office confirmed its a preliminary estimate of gross domestic product growth in the last three months of 2017 at 2.7 percent against the same period of 2016. Overall in 2017, euro zone GDP rose 2.5 percent, the fastest growth rate since 2007.
That followed news earlier on Wednesday that Japan's economy posted its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s boom as fourth quarter growth was boosted by consumer spending.
The drop in the dollar meanwhile gave a fillip to commodities, with copper firm after jumping 2.7 percent overnight .
Spot gold  edged up 0.1 percent to $1,331.08 per ounce, leaving behind last week's one-month low of $1,306.81.
Oil prices dipped, squeezed by lingering oversupply including rising U.S. inventories and ample physical flows, though the prospect of Saudi output dropping in March, economic growth hopes and a weaker dollar all combined to cap losses.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) eased 0.7 percent to $58.79 a barrel, while Brent futures (LCOc1) slipped 0.3 percent to $62.50. [O/R]

Elsewhere, South Africa's rand rose to its strongest level against the dollar in about 2-1/2 years  as investors awaited the latest twist in the saga surrounding the departure of President Jacob Zuma, who has been ordered by the ruling ANC to quit as head of state.

The factory had already been running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years even before the U.S. carmaker announced the closure.
""Gunsan city worked really hard to rescue GM, buying GM cars produced from the factory. The whole town is now in panic,"" Park Chung-hi, chairwoman of the Gunsan city council, told Reuters. 
Park who also has a GM car said one out of five in Gunsan, including family members of workers at GM's part suppliers, relies on the U.S. carmaker's operation there.
GM's South Korean unit launched a voluntary redundancy scheme for its 16,000 workers in the Asian nation after announcing on Tuesday it will shutter the plant in Gunsan by May and decide within weeks on the fate of the remaining three plants in the country.
Unionised workers at the Gunsan plant wore red headbands saying ""Solidarity, Fight"" and held leaflets demanding the withdrawal of the closure plan. Some had shaved their heads.
""Let's protect our right to live on our own,"" Kim Jae-hong, the leader of the workers' union at the Gunsan branch, said amid tears.
GM's planned revamp of its loss-making South Korea operations is the latest in a series of steps by the automaker to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015 GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.
It is offering South Korean workers three times their annual base salary, money for college tuition and more than $9,000 toward a new car as part of a redundancy package.
A spokesman of GM Korea, the local unit, said the company would continue discussions with the union and seek their understanding over the closure plan.
But workers were far from placated. The union will establish a detailed plan in protest against the shutdown that may include a strike and holding of a sit-in rally at the headquarters of GM Korea, according to the union's Gunsan branch.
""We can't accept this. The company informed us about the closure plan, not asking for our opinion. It was already the end of the discussions,"" Dang Sung-geun, a senior official at the union of GM Korea, told Reuters by telephone.
""This is like a death sentence notice before the Lunar New Year holidays."" 
Dang said about 1,200 unionized workers from GM Korea joined the protest at the Gunsan factory, a day before the Asian country begins Lunar New Year holidays. Gunsan is located in the southwest of the country.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday used GM's decision to close the plant to launch fresh criticism of the U.S.-South Korea trade agreement. 
Trump recently approved tariffs on South Korean washing machines, while South Korea has vowed to take countermeasures through the World Trade Organization (WTO).
South Korea's trade ministry said it will take a dispute against the United States to the WTO, involving the imposition of high anti-dumping duties on South Korean steel and transformers.
WAGES, PRODUCTIVITY IN FOCUS
GM executives have complained about South Korea's relatively high wages and its strike-prone labor union. But Dang of GM Korea's union blamed the company for reducing output, saying lower wages were not acceptable.
The automaker's restructuring plan places South Korean President Moon Jae-in in an uncomfortable spot, as he has pledged more new jobs and job security.
South Korea's strong labor unions have weighed on the country's automobile industry, which Moon's administration views as a challenge, a trade ministry official said.
""The South Korean auto industry's high cost and low productivity has been a deep-rooted issue, which can't be fixed overnight, but we will try to resolve this issue by building trust with the unions and the companies,"" said the official who asked not to identified.
Locals in Gunsan, the small city with population of about 270,000, say the closure will hit the economy hard, putting many out of business.

""The economy of the neighborhood is all dying,"" said Kim Heung-sik, a taxi driver whose cousin worked for GM Korea's subcontractor.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 05:14AM ET</span>","In Trump’s first year, U.S. agency doubles solar investments abroad","By Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The United States government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas last year under a climate-friendly investment policy written in the last days of the Obama administration, according to a Reuters review of government documents.
The growing U.S. support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past U.S. solar loans abroad. It also deepens confusion about President Donald Trump’s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes fossil-fuel development.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the government’s international finance institution, loaned more than $630 million to foreign energy projects in 2017, 90 percent of which were solar, wind, or other low-carbon ventures, according to investment documents. 
That compares to $797 million in total OPIC energy financing in 2016, 61 percent of which went to clean energy.
The agency’s lending to solar projects doubled to more than $250 million in 2017, supporting ventures in India, Africa and Latin America, according to the records.
(For a graphic detailing OPIC energy investments over time, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2F0op2H )
White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to requests for comment.
OPIC is a self-funded government agency whose website says it aims to advance “U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities” by investing in ventures abroad. For 40 years, it has operated at no net cost to U.S. tax payers.
The agency formalized its preference for climate-friendly energy in an environmental and social policy statement adopted days before Trump's inauguration. The document says the agency aims to support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote low- and no-carbon fuels and technologies, efficiency and conservation.
That dovetails with former President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration’s energy priorities. 
Since taking office, Trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms; signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions; and announced the withdrawal of the United States from an international pact to combat global warming.
That might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar - a leading climate-friendly competitor to fossil fuels - but the administration has never made that clear. 
Trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy, which were preserved by a Republican-controlled Congress in December tax legislation. But Trump has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both ""very, very expensive.""
In January, Trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports, saying the move would help domestic manufacturers. But what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on lower-cost imported panels, often from China.
OPIC spokeswoman Andrea Orr said the agency adheres to the Obama-enacted low-carbon policy and that its portfolio is ""demand driven"" – reflecting the shift globally toward lower carbon energy sources.
But policy ""does not prohibit OPIC from considering the full spectrum of energy projects,"" she said, including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option. OPIC’s financing last year, for example, included $50 million for a power plant in the West African nation of Guinea that will run on fuel oil. 
Last year, Trump sought to eliminate OPIC as part of his 2018 budget proposal “to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market” - but Congress rejected the idea. 
Trump has since appointed Texas businessman Ray Washburne to lead the agency. Washburne has said he would focus OPIC on two goals: empowering women in the developing world, and serving U.S. strategic national security interests. 
Washburne was not available for an interview, Orr said.
“NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE”
Renewable energy projects that received OPIC funding last year include a Honduras geothermal plant sponsored by Ormat Technologies, a solar array in Zambia backed by  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR) and solar facilities in Jordan and El Salvador by power plant owner AES Corp.
Orb Energy, an Indian solar company backed by U.S. venture capital fund Acumen Fund Inc, secured $10 million in OPIC financing last year for commercial rooftop projects. Such funding would not be available from India's conservative banking sector, the company said.
""Donald Trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables, so we were concerned,"" Orb Chief Executive Damian Miller said in an interview. 
But he was told there was ""no fundamental change"" in its priorities for selecting projects, he said.
Since 2011, more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received OPIC funding were for solar, wind or other non-hydroelectric forms of renewable power. 
That approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers, but has not always gone well for OPIC: the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly $1 billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in Chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted.
At issue is whether OPIC properly stress-tested the projects adequately before offering loans. The agency’s losses on the deals could exceed $160 million, sources told Reuters last year. OPIC has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades.
AES – which received up to $89.5 million for its projects in Jordan and El Salvador in 2017 - said it has tapped OPIC financing for more than a decade. The shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at AES, which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal.

""That's the angle that the company has taken,"" AES Treasurer Daniel Stadelmann said in an interview, referring to the company's shift toward cleaner energy sources. ""So it matches.""

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.8 percent by 0915 GMT with most bourses and sectors in positive territory as a strong set of corporate results lifted shares. 
The U.S. inflation data due later in the day could soothe, or inflame, the fears of faster U.S. rate hikes that triggered a sharp correction in equity markets earlier this month.
""Even a slightly higher number could set the cat among the pigeons given the late-cycle stimulus the Trump Administration is pumping into the U.S. economy,"" Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader, said.
Meanwhile, shares in French electrical parts distributor Rexel led the market higher, rising 8.2 percent and on track for their best day in two years after a well-received trading update.
Second was silicon wafer group Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), up 6.6 after a positive note from  Credit Suisse . 
Shares in food packaging group  Huhtamaki  (HE:HUH1V) rose 6.4 percent after it released fourth quarter results, and Dutch food supplement maker (AS:DSMN) DSM jumped 4 percent after giving an upbeat outlook for 2018. 
In the banking sector, Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) was a clear leader, up 3.1 percent, after it posted a third straight annual loss which was smaller than expected.
Investment bank  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) rose 0.2 percent after reporting an unexpected rise in quarterly net profit.. Its French peer  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) was down 1.9 percent after results.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp appointed a former banker experienced in dealing with distressed companies as CEO, and forecast its first annual profit in four years, helped by a buoyant chip business that it has agreed to sell.
Incoming CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani, 60, will be tasked with ensuring the smooth sale of the $18 billion chip unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND memory chips and the source of most of its earnings - to a Bain-led consortium despite opposition from some activist shareholders.
The sale, which will see Toshiba retake 40 percent of the unit, is aimed at putting the conglomerate back on a firmer footing after a year of crisis stemming from huge losses at its U.S. nuclear unit, and Kurumatani declared his first priority was bolstering the conglomerate's finances.
""Firstly, the issue is capital, to help capital recover quickly and return to global competition,"" he told a news conference.
Regarded as well-connected with politicians and bureaucrats, Kurumatani currently heads the Japanese arm of private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and before that was an executive at one of Toshiba's main lenders, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG).
While at the bank, he was involved in arranging a government-led bailout plan for Tokyo Electric Power after the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami disaster.
""His appointment is designed to deal with the activist shareholders because there is no one at Toshiba with the experience to tackle this,"" said a financial source familiar with matter, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media.
Current CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa, who will become chief operating officer and be in charge of day-to-day operations, reiterated that the struggling conglomerate still intended to sell the unit.
Hong Kong-based activist investor, Argyle Street Management Ltd, a hedge fund with $1.2 billion under management, has opposed the sale, arguing that injections of fresh capital meant it was no longer necessary and that the board should consider an IPO instead. It says it has other investors on its side.
The appointment of Kurumatani, effective from April, comes as Toshiba seeks to recover from the worst year of its 142-year history.
Also helped by the sale of claims against now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse Electric Co LLC to a group of hedge funds, Toshiba predicted record net profit of 520 billion yen ($4.9 billion) for the financial year ending March.
That is up from a prior forecast of a 110 billion yen loss and much higher than a consensus estimate of a 188 billion yen profit.
The return to profit, combined with an additional 600 billion yen gained from the issue of new shares to overseas funds, will help Toshiba avoid falling into negative net worth for a second consecutive year, allowing it to remain a listed company.
The share issue has helped ease pressure to complete the sale of the chip unit by the end of March - a deadline it is widely viewed as unlikely to meet due to regulatory reviews in China.
If it doesn't complete the deal by then, it has the option of walking away, sources have said.
The chip unit, the subject of a long and hotly contested auction before the Bain-led consortium was finally chosen, has seen earnings surge on booming demand for semiconductors.
The unit is expected to book an annual operating profit of around 450 billion yen. By contrast, without earnings from the chip unit, Toshiba is expected to post zero operating profit.

S&P 500 Drop Among Smallest in Postwar Era,"(Bloomberg) -- If the semblance of calm that’s returned to markets sticks, then this will have been a remarkably small correction in U.S. stocks -- despite it having erased $2 trillion at one point.
The sell-off on the S&P 500 Index from the late January peak to last Thursday’s nadir counts as the shortest on record since 1945, and is joint second-lowest in terms of the magnitude, according to an analysis from Bespoke Investment Group. The median postwar decline for corrections from record highs -- drops of more than 10 percent -- is 14.8 percent, the research shows.
Whether Thursday does indeed prove to mark the bottom of the sell-off is under debate on Wall Street. Brokerages from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have been telling clients to buy back into the equity market, though Nobel laureate Robert Shiller says it’s an open question whether the correction is done. Dennis Gartman says it’s the start of a bear market.
Read more on investors’ opinions for where and when this market rout will end.
Corrections have lasted a median 153 days, Bespoke’s research showed. There were 19 prior corrections and over the last 30 years they have gotten shorter, according to the analysis, which measured slides of 10 percent or more from all-time highs.
The calm seemed set to continue Wednesday, with futures on the S&P 500 up 0.4 percent as of 8:30 a.m. London time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Display Inc reported a fourth straight quarter of loss and said its search for a global partnership was taking more time than expected, showing its growing struggles as customers shift to a newer display technology.
The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker, money-losing for the past three years, has been making half its revenue selling LCDs to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). But Japan Display was slow to adopt organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, which Apple opted to use for its high-end iPhone X, buying components from Samsung Electronics (KS:005930). 
Japan Display posted a net loss of 32.6 billion yen ($304 million) for the October-December quarter, versus a net profit of 7.3 billion yen in the same quarter a year ago.
That compared with an average 30.32 billion yen loss forecast by four analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Japan Display has been considering tapping new investors for capital to catch up in OLED, which it plans to start mass-producing for smartphones only in 2019. 
Japan Display in December dismissed as speculative reports that it was seeking funds from clients such as Apple and Huawei Technologies, but said it was seeking to partner with global companies. 
It has not disclosed who any potential partners might be. It said on Wednesday that partnership talks, previously expected to conclude by end-March, were taking more time than expected. 
""Negotiations are ongoing, so in the process of discussing details the talks have been pushed back,"" Chief Financial Officer Takanobu Oshima told reporters. 
Aiming to counter declining sales with cost cuts, Japan Display plans to streamline production lines and reduce 30 percent of its workforce, resulting in a special loss of nearly 170 billion yen for the current year.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 02:46AM ET</span>",Walmart goes to the cloud to close gap with Amazon,"By Nandita Bose
SAN BRUNO/SUNNYVALE, Calif. (Reuters) - One of Walmart Inc's best chances at taking on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in e-commerce lies with six giant server farms, each larger than ten football fields. 
These facilities, which cost Walmart millions of dollars and took nearly five years to build, are starting to pay off. The retailer's online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels.
Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house. 
Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart's decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon's use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales. 
The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing the company to target shoppers with more customized offers and improved services, two top executives told Reuters in interviews at Walmart's San Bruno and Sunnyvale campuses in California.
""It has made a big difference to how fast we can grow our e-commerce business,"" said Tim Kimmet, head of cloud operations for Walmart.
He said Walmart, for example, is using cloud data to stock items frequently ordered by customers via voice shopping devices such as Google Home. 
The network is helping the retailer improve its in-store operations as well. Using data gleaned from millions of transactions, the company sped up the process by which customers can return online purchases to their local stores by 60 percent. And Walmart can adjust prices at its physical locations almost instantly across entire regions.
""We are now able to execute change faster,"" Jeremy King, Walmart's chief technology officer, told Reuters. He added that Walmart can now make over 170,000 monthly changes to software that supports its website, compared to less than 100 changes previously. 
To be sure, Walmart, the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, holds just a 3.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market compared to Amazon's 43.5 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer.
Still, Walmart's cloud effort is significant at a time when U.S. retail is undergoing immense disruption, and data-based decision making has become more important than ever to understand how shoppers make purchases.
Walmart's online revenue climbed 50 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, helping it post its strongest-ever quarterly growth since 2009.
""The battle between Walmart and Amazon has been playing out on all fronts and the cloud is the latest frontier,"" said Kerry Liu, chief executive of Rubikloud Technologies, which offers artificial intelligence technology services to retailers.
EXCESS CAPACITY
The cloud initiative is but one of several steps Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is taking to boost its e-commerce business. The company has expanded its online selection and acquired smaller e-commerce retailers. Walmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and it recently asked vendors to supply it with merchandise priced at $10 and up to help it turn a profit online. 
Walmart has stored information in smaller internal data centers for years. And it uses public cloud storage for non-critical data. Most retailers rent server capacity offered by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM). 
(For a graphic on big players in the cloud market, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2EYe9Ii)
But Walmart's decision to build a network that is not reliant on a single third-party cloud technology provider has transformed its ability to understand shoppers, who now move between store, desktop, mobile and app to make purchases. About 80 percent of Walmart's cloud network is now in-house.
Walmart's Kimmet said security was another big factor behind the effort, enabling the retailer to better protect customer data. That secrecy extends to the locations of its six ""mega clouds"" or giant server farms, and 75 ""micro clouds"" whose locations the company declined to disclose publicly.
Walmart shareholders so far appear supportive of its cloud strategy. The company's shares have risen 49 percent in the last 12 months, defying the broader retail sector downturn and outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which has risen 14 percent over the same period.
Still, some investors have expressed concerns that Walmart's approach will make it harder for the retailer to downsize if market conditions change significantly. A few of them told Reuters they would like to see Walmart commercialize its excess capacity, much as its rival Amazon has done.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $18.34 billion in revenue in 2017 and has garnered 26 percent of the cloud market, according to estimates from Jefferies Group LLC. 
""Walmart is very good at following Amazon's innovations. Now they must find a way to monetize the cloud business they are building the way AWS did,"" said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.

Walmart's Kimmet said the retailer has no immediate plans to provide cloud services for other companies. But he did not rule it out as a future revenue driver.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>",Jewelry companies vie for China's independent women in marketing blitz,"By Donny Kwok and Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A woman dressed elegantly in a black pants suit, hands tucked in her pockets, poses with confidence as she displays a collection of glistening silver medals gleaming from her tailored jacket. 
""A memento to reward your own success,"" reads the slogan alongside a diamond encrusted pendant in an advertisement from Chow Tai Fook, a Hong Kong-based jewelry company that has a big presence across China. 
Facing slowing global demand for diamond jewelry, diamond companies from around the world are reshaping marketing campaigns to tap a growing pool of independent female spenders in China, the world's second largest economy.
Chinese and international players such as Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF), Debeers and the Diamond Producers Association are increasing their marketing budgets by as much as 50 percent globally, according to the companies. 
The aim is to promote diamonds as a way for women to express themselves rather than tie the gems to traditional marketing notions of marriage. In China, which is the fastest growing market, this is a particular focus, executives said. 
Debeers in September said 26 percent of all diamond jewelry in China was bought by women in 2016, with growth of about 12 percent annually for the country.
That rapidly growing market is being seen as a key prize for jewelry companies due to low penetration rates and rising spending power among an increasingly wealthy female population. 
The challenge for diamond companies is to stay relevant at a time when spending on experiences and activities - like travel -is gaining favor and many younger consumers are shunning traditional notions of marriage, jewelry executives say.
""Divorce rates are soaring, they see dating apps, cheating, that is very much of the environment they live in today,"" Jean-Marc Lieberherr, head of the Diamond Producers Association, said in an interview, referring to young people in China. ""They are very suspicious of the idea of marriage in the sense as something as a fairy tale."" 
The DPA, which represents miners such as  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and Alrosa, has more than quadrupled its global marketing budget over the past two years and is planning to spend $70 million in 2018, up nearly six-fold from $12 million in 2016. 
It is focusing on China in 2018 and is planning to spend $10 million launching its ""Real is Rare"" campaign in the country later this year. It has already rolled out the campaign, aimed at millennials, in India and the United States. 
Lieberherr said a key focus was to get consumers to move away from the notion of diamonds just as gifts for special occasions.
Alan Chan, deputy general manager at Chow Tai Fook in Hong Kong said that over the past five years women had started buying diamonds themselves far more frequently in line with fashion trends.
""We see a growing trend of the self-use market by women,"" he said. ""There are more working ladies who are financially independent and have their own income. Instead of buying one every few years, now it can be a few times in a year.""
The expansion of campaigns in Hong Kong and China, also undertaken by smaller players like Chow Sang Sang and Luk Fook Holdings, marks a shift from the 2000s, when diamond companies globally spent less than 1 percent of total sales on marketing, the consultancy Bain said in its Global Diamond report in December. It said that led to industry growth that lagged most other luxury products.
""Increasing demand for diamonds is a high-stakes game for the entire diamond value chain,"" said Bain partner Olya Linde.
Softening demand could have significant economic implications for countries that depend on the industry as one of their sole sources of revenue, she said.
For Cordelia, an office worker shopping for jewelry in Hong Kong's bustling Causeway Bay district who would only provide her first name, buying for herself made total sense.

""You don't have to wait for someone to give it to you as a gift,"" she said. ""You never know if they will choose something you like. Whatever you like, you can choose.""

773,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 02:02AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse posts third straight annual loss on U.S. tax writedown,"ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Wednesday posted a smaller-than-expected 2017 loss of 983 million Swiss francs ($1.05 billion) as a 2.3 billion franc writedown triggered by U.S. tax reform kept the bank from its first year in the black since CEO Tidjane Thiam launched a turnaround plan in 2015.
Analysts had expected Switzerland's second-biggest bank to post a 1.1 billion Swiss franc loss because of the writedown. Pretax profit of 1.793 billion francs matched expectations for 1.803 billion francs in the poll.
Net new assets at its Wealth Management business rose more than a quarter last year to 37.2 billion Swiss francs, while assets under management rose 13 percent to a record 772 billion.
""In 2018, we will remain focused on disciplined execution and on delivering value for our clients and shareholders for the final year of our restructuring plan,"" Thiam said.
The group said it would propose a reduced dividend of 0.25 francs per share, compared to 0.70 francs in 2016 and average expectations for 0.28 francs amongst eight analysts polled.
Thiam, who took the helm nearly three years ago, has focused on scaling back Credit Suisse's investment banking business to concentrate on less capital-intensive private banking.
But the meltdown of one of the bank's volatility products last week and two recent U.S. lawsuits over activities before and just after Thiam took charge have raised questions about how far his risk-off strategy has taken hold.
The troubles, combined with activist pressure, have put the bank in the spotlight after years working towards an image of stability as a premier bank for the world's ultra-wealthy.
The bank said market volatility -- which was also behind the meltdown of its exchange-traded notes used to bet on stock market swings -- was a double-edged sword.
""In the first six weeks of 2018, we have seen a significant pick-up in market volatility, which on the one hand had a positive impact on our secondary activities, and on the other hand, negatively impacted our primary calendar as clients wait for calmer markets in order to transact,"" it said.
""We are adopting a cautious short-term outlook in this period of heightened volatility."" 
In recent weeks, the bank has faced regulatory scrutiny over the popular product betting on calm markets in the United States which the group terminated after its value plunged following a sudden surge in global market volatility.
The bank said it faced no material impact from the fall in the exchange-traded note (ETN).

774,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 01:44AM ET</span>",Rising U.S. bond yields offer relief to corporate America's pension plans,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The swift rise in U.S. bond yields in February may be whipsawing some stock market portfolios but it may bring relief to corporate America's largest pension plans. 
For pension funds, rising interest rates can generate more investment income to cover their obligations to pay pensioners. 
The prolonged low-rate, low-volatility environment since the 2008 financial crisis posed a challenge for pension fund managers. Not only were returns on bonds low, but the market value of their liabilities was rising, reducing the so-called funding ratio of pension funds.
Rising bond yields can be good for pension plans because it can lower the required annual cash infusions while still meeting their liabilities, said Michael Schlachter, a partner at pension fund advisor Mercer Investment Consulting in Boulder, Colorado. 
The estimated aggregate funding status of pension plans sponsored by S&P 1500 index companies increased by 3 percent in January to 87 percent at the end of the month, as a result of both an increase in discount rates on liabilities, tied to bond yields, and a rise in equity markets to a new record, according to Mercer.
Last week's volatile stock markets worldwide were accompanied by surging bond yields though which worked in favor of pension funds.
Across America's largest 1,000 companies, 491 offer defined-benefit plans which pay a fixed pension, and these plans have most of their assets in fixed income, followed by equities, then other assets like private equity and cash, according to Willis Towers Watson.
As annual reports are published throughout February, the average funded status of the plans, or the gap between what corporations owe for their pension plans versus what they have set aside for the obligation, will likely show the first year-over-year increase in four years. 
""Continued rises in interest rates, equity values, and contributions could further augment funded ratios in 2018,"" said Michael Moran, chief pension strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management in New York. 
HELPING PENSIONERS
Rising bond yields will free up companies to contribute less to pension plans, which are helped most by the rise in yields of U.S. Treasury debt with a long maturity. Last year's ""flattening"" in the yield curve, in which long-dated yields fell faster than short-term yields, had hurt some pension plans. 
Last week, U.S. defense company  Lockheed Martin  Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported that its pension fund for employees nearly tripled its return on assets in 2017 from the year prior, but the plan's funded status decreased over that same period from 69.7 percent to 68 percent. Also last week, $62.7 billion snack conglomerate Mondelez International reported that its pension plan, which was overfunded in 2016 at 100.4 percent, was in 2017 down to 97.4 percent. Greif Inc, an industrial packaging firm, said the funded status for its U.S. pensions declined from 70.7 percent to 69.3 percent.
All told, it's not just the swift rise in bond yields that is projected to help corporate pension funds. 
Spurred by President Donald Trump’s tax overhaul, corporate pension plan sponsors across the United States upped their contributions hoping to take advantage of the old 35 percent tax rate, which is deductible from a tax bill, before they are forced to use the 21 percent rate in September. 
 United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) increased its pension contribution by $7.3 billion in 2017 over an expected $2.3 billion at the start of the year. General Motors (NYSE:GM), which manages the largest corporate pension plan in the United States contributed $3 billion last year. 

In 2017, Boeing (NYSE:BA) added $3.5 billion, Delta added $3.2 billion, and Verizon added $3.4 billion in addition to the $600 million it had already pledged. Lockheed Martin plans to add $5 billion in 2018.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","In Trump’s first year, U.S. agency doubles solar investments abroad","By Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The United States government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas last year under a climate-friendly investment policy written in the last days of the Obama administration, according to a Reuters review of government documents.
The growing U.S. support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past U.S. solar loans abroad. It also deepens confusion about President Donald Trump’s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes fossil-fuel development.
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the government’s international finance institution, loaned more than $630 million to foreign energy projects in 2017, 90 percent of which were solar, wind, or other low-carbon ventures, according to investment documents.
That compares to $797 million in total OPIC energy financing in 2016, 61 percent of which went to clean energy.
The agency’s lending to solar projects doubled to more than $250 million in 2017, supporting ventures in India, Africa and Latin America, according to the records.
(For a graphic detailing OPIC energy investments over time, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2F0op2H )
White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to requests for comment.
OPIC is a self-funded government agency whose website says it aims to advance “U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities” by investing in ventures abroad. For 40 years, it has operated at no net cost to U.S. tax payers.
The agency formalized its preference for climate-friendly energy in an environmental and social policy statement adopted days before Trump's inauguration. The document says the agency aims to support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote low- and no-carbon fuels and technologies, efficiency and conservation.
That dovetails with former President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration’s energy priorities.
Since taking office, Trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms; signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions; and announced the withdrawal of the United States from an international pact to combat global warming.
That might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar - a leading climate-friendly competitor to fossil fuels - but the administration has never made that clear.
Trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy, which were preserved by a Republican-controlled Congress in December tax legislation. But Trump has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both ""very, very expensive.""
In January, Trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports, saying the move would help domestic manufacturers. But what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on lower-cost imported panels, often from China.
OPIC spokeswoman Andrea Orr said the agency adheres to the Obama-enacted low-carbon policy and that its portfolio is ""demand driven"" – reflecting the shift globally toward lower carbon energy sources.
But policy ""does not prohibit OPIC from considering the full spectrum of energy projects,"" she said, including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option. OPIC’s financing last year, for example, included $50 million for a power plant in the West African nation of Guinea that will run on fuel oil.
Last year, Trump sought to eliminate OPIC as part of his 2018 budget proposal “to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market” - but Congress rejected the idea.
Trump has since appointed Texas businessman Ray Washburne to lead the agency. Washburne has said he would focus OPIC on two goals: empowering women in the developing world, and serving U.S. strategic national security interests.
Washburne was not available for an interview, Orr said.
“NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE”
Renewable energy projects that received OPIC funding last year include a Honduras geothermal plant sponsored by Ormat Technologies, a solar array in Zambia backed by  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR) and solar facilities in Jordan and El Salvador by power plant owner AES Corp.
Orb Energy, an Indian solar company backed by U.S. venture capital fund Acumen Fund Inc, secured $10 million in OPIC financing last year for commercial rooftop projects. Such funding would not be available from India's conservative banking sector, the company said.
""Donald Trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables, so we were concerned,"" Orb Chief Executive Damian Miller said in an interview.
But he was told there was ""no fundamental change"" in its priorities for selecting projects, he said.
Since 2011, more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received OPIC funding were for solar, wind or other non-hydroelectric forms of renewable power.
That approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers, but has not always gone well for OPIC: the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly $1 billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in Chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted.
At issue is whether OPIC properly stress-tested the projects adequately before offering loans. The agency’s losses on the deals could exceed $160 million, sources told Reuters last year. OPIC has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades.
AES – which received up to $89.5 million for its projects in Jordan and El Salvador in 2017 - said it has tapped OPIC financing for more than a decade. The shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at AES, which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal.

""That's the angle that the company has taken,"" AES Treasurer Daniel Stadelmann said in an interview, referring to the company's shift toward cleaner energy sources. ""So it matches.""

778,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",Anxious Chinese investors cut equities risk ahead of holiday,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Unnerved by a slump in their stock market in the past two weeks, Chinese investors are playing it safe as they head into week-long Lunar New Year holidays by reducing their equity holdings.
China's stock market will be closed from Thursday through next Wednesday for the holiday. In preparation, money is flowing into less risky assets, such as bonds, while traders are also scooping up derivatives to hedge against market risks.
""Given current global market conditions, holding stocks throughout the holiday would be really disturbing. So why don't you enjoy the holiday trouble-free?"" said Wen Xunneng, a Shanghai-based investor.
Wen said he took advantage of this week's market rebound to empty his stock account and put cash into safer assets such as fixed income and banks' wealth management products.
Chinese stock markets were among the worst hit in the broad selloff in global stock markets this month, triggered by worries about interest rate hikes in developed economies and rising bond yields. The main Shanghai stock index lost 11 percent of its value over two weeks. 
Even within fixed income markets, investors appeared to be looking for safer ways to ride out the holiday by seeking shorter-tenor, high-rated bonds and eschewing leverage. 
Yun Xiong, a partner at Leiton Capital in Shanghai, said he has taken a defensive stance with about one-third of his fixed-income position, moving into short-duration Chinese government bonds.
""We don't like uncertainty,"" he said. 
Wu Jie, a Shanghai-based hedge fund manager, cut his stock holdings down to a third to avoid being caught out by any negative developments in global markets while China is on holiday. 
The market rout has challenged the conviction many Chinese investors held in buying and holding blue-chip stocks. That strategy had paid off in 2017 as index heavyweights rallied, driven in part by growing interest from foreign investors. 
The blue-chip index CSI300 registered its biggest weekly loss in more than two years last week with a 10 percent tumble, wiping out gains accumulated during the previous five months. The SSE50, dubbed China's Nifty Fifty Index, slumped 11 percent last week. 
Traders said domestic concerns over margin calls and Beijing's stepped-up campaign to reduce risks in the financial system had exacerbated the decline in Chinese stocks.
They also agreed that the era of low volatility for China's main stock indexes is over, thus spurring a slow exit from equities. The iVX index, dubbed China's fear gauge, surged to 33.06 last Friday, the highest level in a year.
The ChinaAMC 50 ETF, Shanghai's biggest exchange-traded fund and a vehicle to bet on Chinese big-cap firms, saw its size shrink by 6.8 billion yuan ($1.07 billion) over the past week alone. 
Investors who are loath to scale back their positions ahead of the holidays are hedging their portfolios via index futures and options. 
The CSI300 index futures, which can be used by traders to short-sell the blue-chip index, saw its trading volume surge 50 percent last week. 
The trading volume of options on 50ETF totaled 28.4 million contracts in January, more than double the 13.5 million last September. 
""We like fluctuations,"" said Huang Can, head of investment at Shenzhen City Sheng Guan Da Asset Investment, a hedge fund house whose quant strategy is built around high volatility.
Still, he said his fund would reduce its equity exposure due to great uncertainty during the holiday.
But David Dai, general manager of Shanghai Wisdom Investment Co Ltd, said he has no plans to cut his losses now. 

""Maybe after the holiday, prices will come back,"" said Dai, who had been buying blue chips and was caught unprepared by last week's share tumble.

The company last month shut 63 stores, or about 1/10th of its total, and laid off nearly 10,000 workers after a review of profitability. The layoffs were the largest since the first Sam's Club opened in 1983.
The moves are a part of a strategic shift by Sam's new chief executive, John Furner, as he attempts to turn around a business that has underperformed its parent Walmart and rivals like Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST).
""We are creating a new Sam's Club for our members,"" Furner said on a media conference call.
""We are adding more value to our membership, we're making strategic choices and changing how we work to drive visible growth,"" he said.
Sam's Club will now offer two membership options, down from three earlier. They will be offered as Sam's Club for $45 a year and Sam's Plus for $100 a year.
The company will offer free shipping on 95 percent of the items it sells online, with no minimum order size for Sam's Plus members, Jamie Iannone, chief executive of SamsClub.com, said on the conference call.
The retailer, which currently relies on Walmart's supply chain network to make online order deliveries, recently said it will open its own first e-commerce fulfillment center in Memphis, Tennessee, and expects to ship its first package in the spring.
It is also considering other regions, like Texas, Central Florida, Southern California, the Chicago area, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, for new e-commerce warehouses.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it will take firm action against illegal and unfair acts in cryptocurrency trading after a 280,000 signature petition was sent to the presidential Blue House.
""The government's basic rule is to prevent any illegal acts or uncertainties regarding cryptocurrency trade, while eagerly nurturing blockchain technology,"" Hong Nam-ki, minister of the office for government policy co-ordination said in a statement.
The petition was made after the justice minister said in January that the government may shut down cryptocurrency exchanges. It demanded that the government never impose unreasonable regulation on virtual currency trading. 
The government has to produce an official response within a month for a petition that gathers more than 200,000 signatures.
South Korea, which has become a cryptocurrency trading hub after a market frenzy that attracted even housewives and students, has already imposed some regulations on cryptocurrency trading. 
It banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for virtual coin trading as of January 30, but said it does not intend to go as far as shutting down domestic exchanges. 
""But, the government is still divided with many opinions ranging from an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading to bringing the institutions that handle the currency into the system,"" Hong said, adding that the government will thoroughly review the industry within global norms. 

South Korea will also develop ways to tax virtual currencies, led by the finance ministry, and should announce measures within the first half of the year to develop the blockchain industry, Hong added.

786,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 08:32PM ET</span>",Chipotle turns to Taco Bell's 'Doritos Locos' chief as new CEO,"By Lisa Baertlein and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) -  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG) has hired Brian Niccol, known for bringing ""Doritos Locos Tacos"" and mobile ordering to Taco Bell, as its next chief executive to turnaround the once red-hot burrito chain that has been battered by food safety lapses.
Shares of Denver, Colorado-based Chipotle were up 11.8 percent at $281.03 in extended trading, still less than half their $742 high set in 2015, before sales-crushing E.coli, Salmonella and norovirus outbreaks sickened hundreds of U.S. customers.
Niccol, 43 and head of Yum Brand's Taco Bell since 2015, on March 5 will replace Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who built the chain on the idea that food could be both healthy and fast but failed to nail the operational prowess needed to guide it through several health scares.
While Chipotle excelled by promoting organic produce and antibiotic-free meat to distance itself from fast food, Niccol used feisty marketing and unusual food creations, such as the Doritos tacos and Nacho Fries, to excite customers. He also took aim at Chipotle's customers, starting a higher-end Cantina chain and launching a healthier Cantina menu at Taco Bell.
Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said Niccol's operational discipline and creativity would be good for Chipotle, but not a guarantee of success.
""Chipotle still hasn’t recovered from its health scares and has a lot of work to do to rebuild confidence. The menu and concept are tired and customers are less enthusiastic about the brand than they once were. On top of all of this, there is a lot more value-focused competition in the market,"" he said.
Taco Bell's turnaround began under the leadership of Greg Creed, who is now CEO of the fast-food chain's parent company, Yum Brands, and continued under Niccol, who joined the chain in 2011 as chief marketing and innovation officer, was president from 2013 to 2014 and became its CEO in 2015. 
In 18 of the past 20 quarters, Taco Bell has reported growing sales at established U.S. restaurants - better than many of its rivals, including McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Chipotle, said Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson. It also outpaced Yum chains Pizza Hut and KFC in same-store sales for 2016 and 2017.
Part of the success is attributed to mastering mobile ordering and launching breakfast, and Niccol in a statement referred to using menu innovations and digital communications at Chipotle.
Still, Chipotle cannot simply repeat the Taco Bell formula with better ingredients. Its assembly line food preparation style prevents it from doing a mix of high- and low-priced offerings that appeal to a broad range of diners, Mizuho restaurant analyst Jeremy Scott said.
It likely could add nachos and new beverages, including margaritas, with minimal disruption, but breakfast would be a heavier lift since workers use the morning hours to prepare food for the day ahead, said Scott, who expects more executive changes at Chipotle and restaurant franchising over time.
Ells said in November he would step aside after failing for two years to rescue the burrito chain's sales and reputation, and he told investors recently he would not get in the way of a new CEO.
""His expertise in digital technologies, restaurant operations and branding make him a perfect fit for Chipotle,"" Ells said in a statement announcing Niccol's appointment. 
Chipotle shares through Tuesday's close had fallen 13 percent in 2018, adding to a 23.4 percent drop last year. That compares with a 22.8 percent gain in the S&P 500 Restaurants sub index <.SPLRCREST > in 2017. 
Despite its problems, Chipotle shares traded recently at a premium to peers: 28.8 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, versus 21.3, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Ells became sole CEO after co-CEO Monty Moran departed in December 2016, under pressure from hedge fund manager William Ackman, whose Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP is Chipotle's largest investor with a 10 percent stake.
On Tuesday afternoon, Ackman's team cheered the move, describing Niccol as their first choice.
“He is the right leader to reinvigorate the company and help it achieve its enormous potential,” said Francis McGill, a Pershing Square spokesman.
Ackman has been telling his own investors that Chipotle has enormous potential by innovating its menu and improving customers’ digital experience.

Last year Chipotle ranked among Ackman’s biggest losers and his Pershing Square Holdings fund lost 4 percent, the third straight year of declines.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Mega buyout funds reshaping private equity industry,"By Max Bower
London (Reuters) - The relationship between private equity managers and investors is changing rapidly after the number of $5 billion buyout ‘megafunds’ jumped in 2017, according to McKinsey’s annual private markets report. 
Investors are seeking to invest more capital with fewer top private equity firms as cash continues to flow into the previously low-profile asset class. 
Limited Partners (LPs) that invest with private equity managers, which are institutional investors, such as pension funds, are now considering mandates of more than $10 billion. 
“An elite scale that once topped out at gold now has platinum and diamond tiers,” the report said. 
LPs are now also increasingly prioritizing lower but more stable returns over “top-quartile” fund performance which is difficult to replicate. The chances of a high flyer falling to the bottom quartile has quadrupled since the 1990s, according to the report.
“LPs want consistency at scale and are not as focused on top quartile returns,” Aly Jeddy, a senior partner at McKinsey said. 
Jumbo investments are now being made in 'strategic partnerships' with private equity firms as the influx of money accelerates in the previously bespoke industry, which is struggling to adapt to investment on this scale. 
“Private equity is an artisanal asset class; every buyout is a hand-woven carpet, and that’s difficult to scale,"" Jeddy said.
Large allocations are driving expansion into more scalable assets like real estate, credit and infrastructure and now have tailored fees and terms that allow total return on ownership to be calculated, Jeddy said.
BEST PRACTICE 
The changes sweeping through the private equity industry and are illustrated in the breakdown of global private asset managers fundraising efforts in 2017.
Fundraising for US buyout megafunds of $5 billion and over grew 93 percent in 2017 from the previous year to a total of $173.7 billion, including Apollo’s $23.5 billion Investment Fund IX, the largest individual fund ever raised.
In the last five years, most of the top publicly-listed private equity funds have expanded their fee-earning assets under management more quickly than the private markets in general. 
This suggests that LP allocations are already consolidating in the hands of fewer top managers, according to the report, as managers and LPs revise working practise.
Jeddy expects idiosyncratic private equity firms to standardize process and operations in order to tackle the problem of scale as the emphasis on founders diminishes. 
“These firms were designed to allow their founders to flourish. That can’t continue,” Jeddy said. 
Many managers are turning to more pro-active and systematic investment methods that fit broader macro-economic themes when considering where to take exposure.
“They’re no longer just waiting for banks to place opportunities on their desk, and LPs like that as it ties into the desire for consistency. When you’re investing $5 billion you want to be sure you’re going to get back $6 billion,” Jeddy said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising U.S. government spending on the Pentagon is fueling a spree of deal making among defense companies.
The U.S. Republican party's willingness to boost the Pentagon's budget to nearly $700 billion last year, helped by December's corporate tax cuts, is also pushing up valuations for even lesser known companies in the sector and making sellers more willing to entertain overtures.
On Monday, the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump presented his second annual federal budget proposal, weapons maker General Dynamics Corp. (N:GD) said it was buying  CSRA Inc  (N:CSRA) to expand its government services business. 
""We have an increasing budget going forward, that gives us cause for optimism that the services market is going to come back to pre-2011 characteristics,"" General Dynamics executive vice president of Information Systems & Technology Daniel Johnson told Wall Street analysts after the $6.8 billion deal was announced.
The cut in the U.S. corporate tax rate approved in late 2017, from 35 percent to 21 percent, has also made buyers more willing to spend a little extra. 
""Executives see the budgets coming out of the Pentagon and see that it's not a short-term fix,"" said Bill Farmer, head of aerospace and defense investment banking at Teneo Capital, adding ""you've also got the tax cut creating a lot of money.""
The net effect is a hot merger market where a broader group of weapons makers and government service providers are seen as attractive. 
Companies involved in deals include U.S. military security services business Constellis, formerly known as Blackwater when it was founded in 1997 by former U.S. Navy SEAL officer Erik Prince. The company changed its name to Xe Services LLC in 2009 after a deadly 2007 shootout in Iraq tarnished its brand.
Apollo Global Management LLC, the New York-based private equity firm, purchased Constellis for about $1 billion in August 2016, but underscoring the strength of the current market, the sale of Constellis could fetch around $2.5 billion after less than two years. 
The sale process for Constellis attracted industry participants such as Garda World Security Corp, Allied Universal Security Services, and G4S PLC (L:GFS) as well as private equity firms, people familiar with the deal said on condition of anonymity.
Constellis took initial bids last week, one of the people said, without elaborating on which companies ultimately bid. Apollo declined to comment.
Another example of a company with niche products attracting more robust values involved the recent sale of EaglePicher Technologies, LLC which makes the batteries used to power precision guided munitions like Paveway missiles and JDAM guidance kits that convert ""dumb bombs"" into ""smart"" munitions. 
EaglePicher was sold to private equity firm GTCR for about $930 million or more than 11.5 times its estimated annual earnings of about $80 million, a strong valuation for such a niche player. 
Part of the rich valuation comes from demand for precision guided munitions in several conflicts. Trump's 2019 budget request seeks more than $10 billion in funding for tactical missiles. Saudi Arabia recently agreed to buy about $7 billion worth of precision guided munitions from U.S. weapons makers.
While some companies and private equity firms are looking to gain exposure to the defense spending trend, others are using the active acquisition market to unload their less profitable businesses. 

L3 Technologies Inc (N:LLL) said in December it would sell Vertex, its aerospace and defense logistics support services unit. L3, under recently installed CEO Chris Kubasik, would rather focus on building its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and communication systems businesses which it believes will be more profitable in the future.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A group of 13 automakers will contribute as much as $130 million to compensate those injured by faulty  Takata Corp  (PK:TKTDQ) air bag inflators as part of a deal to resolve the Japanese company's bankruptcy, a U.S. plaintiffs' attorney told Reuters.
The agreement clears the way for the sale of Takata's non-inflator business to Key Safety Systems, a unit of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp (SS:600699), for $1.6 billion, helping to ensure a steady supply of car parts for the world's biggest automakers. 
Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, filed for bankruptcy last year in the wake of the world's largest automotive safety recall, triggered by air bag inflators that can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks.
Attorney Joe Rice of Motley Rice, who represents dozens of personal injury plaintiffs in the bankruptcy, said the deal, which was disclosed in court papers on Saturday, was aimed at keeping Takata operations afloat so it could make replacement inflator kits.
Tens of millions of air bags with the inflators have been recalled but not yet replaced.
In an interview late on Monday, Rice said the group of 13 automakers would contribute about $80 million to $130 million to Takata's bankruptcy estate to help compensate those injured by the Takata inflators.
In return for the automakers' contribution, a committee of injured drivers dropped their objection to TK Holdings' proposed bankruptcy exit plan. The plan will be presented to a U.S. judge on Friday for approval.
Victims of the faulty inflators will also be able to collect from a separate $125 million compensation fund created as part of a plea deal Takata entered with the U.S. Department of Justice early last year. As part of that plea, automakers will receive their share of an $850 million restitution fund.
Rice said funds from the Justice Department settlement and the bankruptcy are likely to fall short of full compensation for injured drivers, but they will still be able to sue the car manufacturers.
The one exception is Honda Motor Co (T:7267), which agreed to create a trust to ensure injuries linked to its vehicles will be compensated in full, according to Rice. He said Honda also will not contest fault for the injuries.
At least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators.
Honda has faced the greatest number of air bag-related claims of the automakers, and 20 of the deaths have occurred in Honda vehicles, most of which were in the United States. In return for funding the trust, Honda will be shielded from further lawsuits. That also means it will not face the risk of punitive damages.
Last year, plaintiffs said an internal Honda email showed Honda was long aware of the risks of Takata air bags, the type of allegation that could have opened the way to punitive damages.
Honda has said it was a victim of deception by Takata, and noted in a statement Tuesday that the $850 million fund created as part of the plea deal was meant to compensate automakers for Takata's scheme.
Honda said it is committed to swiftly and fully compensating those injured caused by defective inflators in its vehicles, according to the statement, and said claimants could still opt into the court system.
The 12 other carmakers that were involved in the settlement, including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Toyota Motor Co (T:7203), General Motors Co (N:GM) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), have 18 months to opt into the trust, if they agree to compensate drivers in full. 
Until then, they will continue to defend personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits. They will be able to offset any judgments with payments made to claimants from the Justice Department fund and the bankruptcy.

The automakers trust being funded by Honda is similar to arrangements used by manufacturers driven into bankruptcy over asbestos-tainted products. While the asbestos trusts have often been underfunded, the automakers trust will be a pay-as-you-go system, helping to ensure it remains solvent.

792,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 07:03PM ET</span>",Whistleblower alleges manipulation of Cboe volatility index,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's most widely followed gauge of future stock market volatility is being manipulated, a law firm representing an ""anonymous whistleblower"" alleged in a letter to U.S. regulators seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
The accusations prompted Cboe Global Markets, the financial exchange operator that is home to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), to ask Wall Street's self-funded regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), to look into the matter, two sources familiar with the situation said.
""Cboe has a dedicated regulatory department that works with FINRA to monitor certain trading activity for our securities markets, including trading activity that could impact the VIX settlement,” Greg Hoogasian, Cboe’s chief regulatory officer, told Reuters in a statement.
The letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from Zuckerman Law, a Washington-based firm, said it had been written on behalf of a person, not identified, who had held senior roles in the investment sector.
In addition to the letter, the law firm said it had filed a formal complaint with regulators on behalf of the unidentified client. It was not clear from the letter and a redacted copy of the complaint seen by Reuters what evidence the person might have provided to support claims of manipulation. 
The complaint says regulators should look at trading data for proof of alleged manipulation.
The letter, dated Monday, alleged that trading firms had taken advantage of the way the VIX is calculated in order to manipulate the index, costing investors nearly $2 billion a year. 
Financial products that seek to track the VIX are at the center of recent stock market turbulence.
The VIX estimates the expected near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 (SPX) index option prices. The CBOE calculates an official settlement monthly that determines whether large blocks of VIX futures expire worthless or turn a profit.
The whistleblower's letter alleges a flaw in the calculation of the VIX that allows trading firms to manipulate the VIX index by posting quotes for S&P 500 options, without actually trading.
Cboe spokeswoman Suzanne Cosgrove said in a statement, ""This letter is replete with inaccurate statements, misconceptions and factual errors, including a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the VIX Index, VIX futures and volatility exchange traded products, among other things."" 
The SEC and CFTC declined to comment.
William Speth, vice president and head of research at Cboe, said, ""There are structural safeguards built into the process of the calculation of the VIX settlement value that would hinder the type of manipulation the letter alleges.""
""Our regulatory group actively surveils for potential VIX settlement manipulation,"" he said.
CLAIMS NOT NEW
Last year John Griffin and Amin Shams of the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin wrote a paper noting significant spikes in trading volume in S&P 500 index options at the exact time of the monthly VIX settlement.
The complaint alleging manipulation referenced the paper. ""It's exactly what we talked about in our paper,"" Griffin told Reuters. ""I would think the Cboe would want to redesign the settlement process to make it fairer and more transparent."" Cboe disagreed with the paper's conclusions when it was posted on a website for research and said the jump in activity around settlement was due to investors adjusting their positions around contract expirations. Cboe's Speth said that traders posting quotes on SPX options have to keep them open for 10 minutes and could be forced to complete the trade.  ""And in a world were microseconds count, that's an eternity,"" he said. Stuart John Barton, portfolio manager at Invest In Vol, a volatility-focused registered investment advisor in Stamford, Connecticut, said, ""There has been a longstanding understanding that there is a potential for the manipulation of the index level.""  Barton said that losses to investors from such manipulations are probably much smaller than the nearly $2 billion annually alleged in the letter. The letter alleged that manipulation of the volatility index also played a role in last week's market turmoil where VIX-related exchange traded products (ETP) experienced big price swings. Both Barton and Griffon cautioned that it was unlikely the type of manipulation alleged in the letter could have caused such a large spike in VIX futures. 
""It would be scaremongering to say that it had a big impact on the reason why these products blew up,"" Barton said.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 05:29PM ET</span>","Global stocks gain for third day, yields slip ahead of U.S. inflation data","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets rose for a third day in a row on Tuesday while bond yields slipped ahead of a widely anticipated U.S. inflation report that has investors on edge as it may increase the pace of future U.S. interest rate rises.
After tumbling about 12 percent in the past two weeks from record highs, benchmark U.S. stock indexes were helped on Tuesday by gains in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), while advances by Asian heavyweights Tencent,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Taiwan Semiconductor supported world markets. 
Economic growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia has stoked inflation fears in recent weeks, pushing up bond yields and undermining stock prices, so Wednesday's U.S. inflation data may help determine whether the correction in equities markets is over. 
Economists expect the U.S. consumer price index for January to have risen month over month by 0.3 percent with underlying inflation of 0.2 percent when the Labor Department reports on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll. But the year-on-year increase in the CPI is seen slowing to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent in December.
""After years of pronouncing inflation 'dead,' the market is now suddenly focused on and dreading inflation, which of course was at the cornerstone of this most recent period of market volatility,"" said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund.
The prospect of higher inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to increase the pace of interest rates rises, and the threat of a widening U.S. federal budget deficit in the wake of December's tax cuts leading to more borrowing by the U.S. Treasury, could lead to a significant repricing of all fixed-income assets, analysts said. 
""It doesn't mean it's going to conflate right now but it certainly is why the sentiment in the market has begun to shift in this direction and why tomorrow's report has the attention it's garnering,"" said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Management in Zurich.
Too high a reading for U.S. inflation would be negative for both bonds and stocks but an especially unexpected low reading of zero to 0.1 percent would ignite a rally in both assets, he said. 
MSCI's gauge of stock markets in 47 countries (MIWD00000PUS) closed up 0.32 percent and its emerging markets index (MSCIEF) rose 0.96 percent on Tuesday.
In Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) closed down 0.63 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 39.18 points, or 0.16 percent, to 24,640.45. The S&P 500 (SPX) gained 6.94 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,662.94 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 31.55 points, or 0.45 percent, to 7,013.51.
The S&P 500 index has recovered 3.2 percent over the past three session but remains down 7.3 percent from a record peak in January.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voting member in the U.S. central bank's rate-setting committee this year, said inflation should pick up this year but not at a rate that requires a faster Fed reaction.
The market sell-off this month will not damage the U.S. economy's overall strong prospects, Mester told the chamber of commerce in Dayton, Ohio.
U.S. long-dated Treasury yields edged lower in generally quiet trading ahead of Wednesday's U.S. economic data reports which also include U.S. retail sales for January. 
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.8349 percent.
German government bonds were in demand as recent multi-year highs on yields on either side of the Atlantic proved attractive for some investors. 
Germany's 10-year bund, the benchmark for the euro bloc, was down 1.5 basis points at 0.74 percent, off 2-1/2 year highs of 0.81 percent hit last week. (DE10YT=RR) 
The Japanese yen rose to a five-month high on the back of broad-based U.S. dollar selling and speculation the Bank of Japan could be about to dial back record levels of monetary stimulus.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell 0.55 percent, with the euro (EUR=) up 0.5 percent to $1.2353. The Japanese yen  strengthened 0.78 percent versus the greenback at 107.80 per dollar.
Oil prices ended largely unchanged as a weaker dollar spurred a rebound from an early slide after the International Energy Agency forecast supply could outstrip demand.
Brent futures (LCOc1) hit a two-month low early, but the
benchmark settled up 13 cents at $62.72 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) fell 10 cents to settle at $59.19 a barrel.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 05:26PM ET</span>",Wall St. advances; investors lock on inflation data,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street climbed on Tuesday for a third straight session, buoyed by Amazon.com and Apple, while investors focused on inflation data on Wednesday that could upset the market's fragile recovery - or clear the way for additional gains.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) rose 2 percent while Apple (O:AAPL) added 1 percent, both helping the S&P 500 shake off a negative open to the session and climb 0.26 percent by the close.
Investors said data on U.S. consumer prices and retail sales due out on Wednesday will be key to where stocks move in the short term. Inflation and interest-rate fears sparked a stock market rout after U.S. jobs data was released on Feb. 2.
Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the market's recovery from a negative start earlier in the session was a good sign, but that it remained too soon to predict the market's return to stability.
""We think we're going to be volatile for a few more trading days at least, as the market sorts out what’s really been going on,"" Haworth said. 
Among the biggest movers was sportswear retailer  Under Armour  (N:UAA), up more than 17.36 percent on strong quarterly sales, and AmerisourceBergen (N:ABC), up 9.30 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Walgreens (O:WBA) was seeking to buy out the drug distributor. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voting member in the central bank's rate-setting committee this year, said the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy's overall strong prospects.
Following a slump into correction territory last week, the S&P 500 has recovered 3.2 percent in the past three session. It remains down 7.3 percent from a record high on Jan 26 and is currently priced at levels first reached in early December. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.16 percent to end at 24,640.45 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 6.94 points to close at 2,662.94.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.45 percent to 7,013.51.
Nine of the 11 major S&P indexes rose, led by real estate <.SPLRCR>, up 0.54 percent.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) dipped to 2.842 percent, shy of a four-year peak of 2.9020 percent hit on Monday.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a widely-followed measure of short-term stock volatility and seen as a contributing factor itself to the sell-off, was last at 25.3 points, half the 50-point mark it touched last week.
Following Wall Street's recent swings, the S&P 500 is down 0.4 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 1.6 percent in 2018.
On a day of heavy trading in healthcare companies,  Henry Schein  (O:HSIC) and Patterson Companies (O:PDCO) fell 6.64 percent and 5.19 percent, respectively, after news of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint against the dental supply firms.
Investors in those and other healthcare distributors are weighing the possible ramifications of the AmerisourceBergen deal and a report of Amazon's (O:AMZN) push into the sector.
Of the 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, nearly 78 percent of them topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is above the 72 percent average beat-rate in the past four quarters.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Friday, below the 8.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 05:16PM ET</span>",Shareholder Deason sues Xerox in U.S. to block Fujifilm deal,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Xerox Corp  (N:XRX) shareholder Darwin Deason asked a court on Tuesday to block the company's merger with Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901), claiming the U.S. photocopier maker's board failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company. 
The lawsuit is the latest in Deason and fellow shareholder Carl Icahn's fight to stop Fujifilm from taking over Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal. The two investors, who control 15 percent of Xerox, aruge the transaction dramatically undervalues Xerox and ""disproportionately"" favors Fuji. 
The Fujifilm deal, ""must be stopped dead in its tracks,"" said Deason's lawsuit filed in state court in New York. 
Xerox has countered the claims saying that the merger seemed to be the best path for the company after a year of exhaustive examination of a number of alternatives.
""Mr. Deason’s allegations are without merit and the company will vigorously defend itself,"" Xerox said in a statement.
Under the deal announced last month, Fujifilm plans to combine the U.S. company into their existing joint venture, to gain scale and cut costs as demand for office printing declines. 
The joint venture has existed in various forms since 1962 and the current structure dates to 2001. The merger deal is expected to close in July or August.
The joint venture agreements have a previously undisclosed ""crown jewel"" lock-up right that gives Fuji control over Xerox's intellectual property and manufacturing rights in the Asia-Pacific market if Xerox sells a 30 percent stake to another suitor, according to the lawsuit.
A ""crown jewel"" agreement is an offer to sell the stock or assets of a company to an investor most desirable to management - to prevent hostile takeovers.
Xerox said that Icahn had been privy to the details of the agreement through his representative, Jonathan Christodoro, on the Xerox Board, while Deason had been aware of the agreement when he sold his company, ACS, to Xerox in 2009.
""These documents have since been publicly disclosed. For any of them to assert that these agreements were 'shrouded in mystery' is disingenuous, at best,"" the company said in a statement early on Tuesday, before the lawsuit was made public.
Deason also included former Xerox Chief Executive Ursula M. Burns in the lawsuit, saying she was chairman of Xerox between May 2010 and May 2017 and had full knowledge of the Fuji-Xerox joint venture agreements.
In a letter to shareholders, who still have to approve the deal, Xerox said that walking away from the joint venture would require it to completely rebuild its supply chain, which would be extremely expensive and take years to implement.
On Monday, Icahn and Deason, who own a combined 15.2 percent in Xerox, called upon shareholders to free ""the company from the shackles of the Fuji Xerox joint venture.""
Some analysts have said that Xerox and Fujifilm management seem locked into the deal and have limited options in terms of addressing Icahn's and Deason's opposition.

Shares of Xerox closed down 2.6 percent at $29.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Sky (L:SKYB) will pay 3.58 billion pounds to show 128 Premier League matches for three seasons from 2019/20 in a deal that brings to an end rampant inflation in the value of the domestic rights for English top-flight soccer.
Rival BT (L:BT) will show 32 games a season, after its 885 million pound ($1.23 billion) bid secured one package. 
The total raised for five of seven packages points toward a fall in the value of the rights after jumps of about 70 percent in the previous two auctions.
In 2015, Sky and BT smashed forecasts by paying a record 5.14 billion pounds to show matches featuring the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, as they battled for pay-TV and broadband subscribers.
That enabled the league to go on a shopping spree, with players such as Paul Pogba (bought by Manchester United) and Virgil van Dijk (signed by Liverpool) joining clubs for more than 75 million pounds each.
But the two companies will pay a reduced 4.46 billion pounds for 160 games a season in the latest three-year rights packages.
Sky, which saw its operating profit slide 14 percent in Britain in the year to end-June after it paid its Premier League bill, said its disciplined approach had paid off.
It is spending 16 percent less per game than in its current package to retain a firm grip on the league that underpins its sports offer, and allows it to spend more on other content.
""Not only do we remain the home of Premier League football but also the home of top quality drama, entertainment, comedy and other sports,"" said its UK CEO Stephen van Rooyen.
BT, which will show Saturday lunchtime fixtures from August 2019, said the league remained a big part of its sports line-up. 
The two agreed in December to carry each others sports channels from early 2019 in a deal that analysts said reduced the pressure to bid ever higher sums for rights.
GOOD FOR FANS
Analyst Paolo Pescatore at CCS Insight said the auction result would come as a huge sigh of relief for both companies, and was great news for consumers.
""Despite more games being available, the Premier League has failed to maximize its prized asset,"" he said. 
""This suggests that there is clearly a ceiling that consumers are willing to pay for watching Premier League games and subsequently what providers are willing to bid for.""
The Premier League, however, said it was ""extremely pleased"" that BT and Sky continued to view its matches as an important part of their offering.
""To have achieved this investment with two packages of live rights remaining to sell is an outcome that is testament to the excellent football competition delivered by the clubs,"" said Executive Chairman Richard Scudamore.
There was speculation that a U.S. internet giant such as Amazon (O:AMZN), Facebook (O:FB) or Netflix (O:NFLX) would enter the fray.
The two packages remaining to be sold, which feature simultaneous matches, could be particularly suited to an internet-streaming provider.
However they had probably not sold because they had not achieved a reserve, said IHS Markit analyst Tim Westcott.
""(Sky and BT) have seen off the prospect of a challenge from a newcomer like Amazon or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - even though this prospect was more a case of hype than expectation,"" he said.
The Premier League said it still had interest in the last two packages from multiple bidders.

Market participants look ahead to the release of a duo of reports on retail sales and inflation with the latter expected to garner added investor attention as bond yields jumped in recent sessions amid expectations for a faster pace of inflation, which, in turn, led to a selloff in equities.
Investor expectations for a faster pace of inflation grew recently following bullish CPI data in January and an uptick in wage growth reflected in the nonfarm payrolls report. A softer CPI report on Wednesday, however, could lead many to question whether investor expectations for a faster pace of price increases were premature.
Analysts expect inflation cooled to a 1.7% year-on-year rise in January, compared to 1.8% in the previous month.
Retail sales growth is expected to show an unchanged reading of 0.5% in the wake of faster wage growth and higher household spending.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 24640.45. The S&P 500 closed 0.26% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7013.51, up 0.45%.
Investors cheered better-than-estimated earnings from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Under Armour, with the latter, in particular, revealing a surprisingly positive quarterly performance.
Under Armour Inc C (NYSE:UA) reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, up 5% from the prior year period, and ahead of the $1.3 billion analysts had forecast.
Financials, mostly banks, also lifted the broader market, as traders awaited a crucial consumer price index update, which could either justify or dent the recent move in US bond yields, potentially triggering an aggressive move in equity markets as was witnessed last week.
Investor expectations for a faster pace of inflation has grown in recent weeks amid bullish CPI data in January and an uptick in wage growth reflected in the nonfarm payrolls report. A softer CPI report on Wednesday, however, could lead many to question whether investor expectations for a faster pace of price increases were premature.
On the corporate earnings front, investors look ahead to an earnings report from, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU),  HubSpot Inc  (NYSE:HUBS) Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO), among others after US markets close.
The Dow Jones posted its first three-day winning streak in more than month as the explosive turn in volatility which characterised last week massive selloff faded somewhat as the so-called fear index VIX continued to trickle lower, well below last week’s 50.3 level.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>","Delta interested in new mid-size Boeing jet, despite trade spat","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said on Tuesday that Boeing Co's (N:BA) anticipated new mid-market jet is an ""interesting concept,"" in an early indication the carrier is not harboring ill will over a recent trade row with the planemaker. 
Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the No. 2 U.S. airline wants to be one of the first customers for the developing Boeing jet, citing a posting from Chief Executive Ed Bastian on Delta's internal website.
Delta declined to comment on the Bloomberg report, but expressed interest in the proposed new plane series. 
""Delta finds it to be an interesting concept and could be a long-term replacement for some 757s and 767s,"" spokesman Morgan Durrant said. ""Delta is actively engaged with Boeing on this and we will continue a healthy dialogue with them as the program matures.""
The future of Boeing and Delta's relationship seemed unsure in recent months after Boeing rallied the federal government to impose stiff duties on a Delta order of Canadian-made  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) narrowbody jets. 
A U.S. international trade body ruled against Boeing in the complaint earlier this year, sparing the sale from a nearly 300 percent tariff.

Analysts had speculated the acrimonious dispute, which highlighted growing trade tensions between the United States and Canada, could permanently sour the relationship between Delta and Boeing and push the airline to favor European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) on future jet orders.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is scrutinizing whether traders placed bets on S&P 500 options in order to influence prices for VIX futures, according to the Journal.
The Cboe Volatility Index is a widely followed gauge of future stock market volatility on Wall Street.
A law firm representing an ""anonymous whistleblower"" on Monday alleged in a letter to U.S. financial regulators that the VIX is being manipulated, causing billions of dollars in losses a year to unwary investors.
Claims in the letter outline how trading firms have taken advantage of the way the VIX is being calculated in order to manipulate the index.
FINRA was not immediately available for comment.

""Cboe has a dedicated regulatory department that works with FINRA to monitor certain trading activity for our securities markets, including trading activity that could impact the VIX settlement,"" Cboe's Chief Regulatory Officer Greg Hoogasian said in a statement and declined to comment further.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the world's second-largest spirits maker, has not yet seen any impact from the legalization of cannabis in some parts of North America but is monitoring the situation closely, its chief executive said.
Alexandre Ricard told reporters the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell cognac was looking for any impact the legalization of cannabis has on its brands but had seen none so far.
""What are we going to do about it? It's a little bit early right now to have a clear view as to the real impact cannabis may or may not have,"" Ricard told a news conference on Tuesday held to discuss last week's first-half results.
Eight U.S. states, including California and Nevada, have legalized marijuana, already widely approved for medicinal use, for recreational use and some studies show consumers would buy the drug instead of alcohol if it was freely available. 
Rival Constellation Brands (N:STZ) in October bought a near 10 percent stake in Canadian cannabis maker Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED) to take advantage of any boom as legalization proliferates.
Analysts at Bryan, Garnier & Co say the global legal cannabis market is set to grow more than 1,000 percent to reach $140 billion by 2027. 
Ricard referred to reports that suggested low-end beer sales may be impacted, but added: ""Have we noticed so far, at our level, on our brands, a clear impact? No. But we're monitoring. It's still very early.""

Regarding Pernod's stance on mergers and acquisitions, Ricard said the company will carry on doing bolt-on deals, like its recent purchase of a stake in mezcal brand Del Maguey, and divesting non-core assets, like its Mexican brandy business.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 02:07PM ET</span>","Trying to calm investors, Wells Fargo CEO stresses on stability","(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Tim Sloan tried to deliver a message of consistency and stability at an investor event on Tuesday, less than two weeks after it disclosed a regulatory sanction related to a long-running sales scandal.
Asked whether an asset cap imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve would have any impact on Wells Fargo's expenses, growth, core businesses, customer retention, employee turnover or capital return plans, Sloan said repeatedly that nothing much had changed.
""We're absolutely open for business,"" Sloan said at a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) industry conference. He has returned to that catch-phrase repeatedly to dampen concerns about fallout from the scandal.
Wells Fargo's problems took root more than a decade ago, when the bank started pushing employees to sell as many products as possible to customers. 
That culture became a serious problem for the bank in September 2016, when it reached a settlement with regulators over employees opening fake accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit aggressive sales targets.
Since then, Wells Fargo has discovered other issues with auto loans, mortgages, frozen funds and improperly closed accounts and has faced a number of other regulatory probes and litigation.
On Feb. 2, the Fed announced a consent order requiring Wells Fargo to prove that it is making appropriate changes to corporate governance and risk management. Until the requirements are met, Wells cannot grow its balance sheet beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at year end.
Management immediately detailed plans to comply with the order, and said it would not hit profits significantly. Still, the severity of the Fed's action so many months after the scandal erupted, underlined questions about how long it will take for the bank to get past its sales practices woes.
At the event on Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Katzke pressed Sloan on whether the Fed’s action, and broader reputational issues, are affecting business on the ground, or management’s outlook for growth and shareholder returns.
Sloan reiterated statements he has made about business being stable, employees being happy to work at the bank, and Wells Fargo management being focused on generating better results. Asked to share metrics to back up some of his comments, Sloan jokingly changed topics and began talking about the Olympics.
""There's a lot of different metrics that you look at, but they're all pointing to a slow but steady recovery,"" he eventually said, without offering any specific numbers. ""It's never as fast as I would like, but it's absolutely occurring.""
Sloan also said the bank intends to get capital levels down to about 10 percent over the next two to three years. The bank ended 2017 with common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9 percent.

Wells Fargo shares were up 2.1 percent at $57.69 in afternoon trading. Through Monday's close, the stock had lost nearly 14 percent since the Fed placed restrictions on it on Feb 2.

""It's hard to find a more compelling opportunity than Time Warner,"" said Samantha Greenberg, chief investment officer at New York-based hedge fund Margate Capital at a Reuters event on Tuesday. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, struck more than 15 months ago, on the grounds it would raise prices for consumers and rivals. A trial to decide the matter begins in March. 
Time Warner shares are a good investment regardless of the outcome, Greenberg told attendees of Reuters Breakingviews' ""No Safe Spaces for Big Media"" panel.
""They have been in deal hell and their stock has massively underperformed the S&P 500,"" Greenberg said. Time Warner trades at about 11.5 times earnings projected for this year, she said, a touch over the sector average.
Even if AT&T does not win its case against the Justice Department, other buyers will likely emerge, including Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Greenberg said. 
CORD CUT 
The panel focused on consolidation in the media sector as programmers and distributors try to prevent viewers cancelling their cable and satellite subscriptions to watch shows on online services provided by Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which are spending billions of dollars on content. 
""Linear TV is in trouble,"" said James Murray, a partner at PJT partners, a New York-based investment bank.
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) announced a $52.4 billion deal to buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox's (O:FOXA)'s assets. But Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which had also bid for the Fox assets, is considering making a new bid for them, sources have told Reuters. 
Just this month, Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) and CBS Corp (N:CBS) announced they were exploring a merger.
Panelists said they expect technology companies such as Apple and Amazon to acquire movie or TV studios this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Blue Apron Holdings Inc  (N:APRN) said on Tuesday it could break even on a key measure of profitability earlier than Wall Street analysts had expected, fueling a brief surge in the meal-kit maker's shares. 
Chief Executive Brad Dickerson said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization could turn positive as soon as the fourth quarter, as Blue Apron boosts revenue while cutting capital spending and administrative costs. 
That would be a major milestone for the company which has not turned an annual profit by any measure since being founded in 2012 and has not moved closer since its high-profile initial public offering in June last year. 
Blue Apron pioneered the meal-kit market, selling subscriptions for pre-portioned ingredients paired with recipes for restaurant-style meals like tilapia piccata and miso-glazed barramundi, but has faced a rash of new competitors including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Blue Apron has spent heavily on moving one of three distribution hubs to a bigger, more automated facility, but that came at the cost of marketing efforts, meaning it focused on squeezing more revenue from its user base rather than attracting new customers.
With the distribution switchover completed, Blue Apron now plans to ramp up marketing again to battle for new meal-kit customers in the hope of boosting revenue.
""That breakeven EBITDA in '19 assumes that we would continue to improve margins going forward,"" Dickerson said on a conference call with analysts. ""The second thing it does assume is that we do return to some kind of full-year growth in revenue top line year-over-year.""
Blue Apron shares surged as much as 25 percent in morning trading to $4.20, but fell back to $3.46, a 3.4 percent gain. They are well below their June 2017 IPO price of $10. 
Analysts on average expected the company to post negative quarterly EBITDA through at least the end of 2018, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Still, Blue Apron forecast first-quarter revenue of $190 million to $200 million, below analysts' average estimate of $220 million, although the company has in the past been conservative with its revenue estimates. 
REVENUE PER CUSTOMER UP
For the fourth quarter, Blue Apron reported a smaller drop in sales than expected and a tick up in average revenue per customer, which it attributed to a more varied menu and meals with shorter prep times. Total orders and customers fell. 
Average revenue per customer rose to $248 from $245 in the third quarter and $246 a year earlier. Revenue was $187.7 million, down 13 percent but exceeding analyst estimates for $185.1 million.
Blue Apron had a net loss of 20 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate for a wider net loss of 27 cents per share.
Costs as a percentage of revenue improved from the third quarter, thanks to better recipe planning at its new hub in Linden, New Jersey, and seasonal benefits like cheaper packaging and fewer seasonal food items. 
Blue Apron said it was launching a new national brand campaign in the final week of December, which it credited to the improvements at Linden. 
It was the company's first earnings report under Dickerson, who became CEO after co-founder Matt Salzberg stepped down in November. Dickerson joined as chief financial officer in February 2016 from apparel maker  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA). 
Amazon unveiled a deal to buy Whole Foods just as Blue Apron was preparing to go public, gaining what many saw as a food distribution network in the grocery chain.

Amazon has also been selling its own kits, with its website listing meals like tacos al pastor for two, but customers need to pay for an AmazonFresh add-on to Prime membership that is only available in select cities to order.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook downplayed a suggestion that the company might issue a special dividend to shareholders with some of the $285 billion in cash that the company is now able to bring back from overseas.
At an annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question on whether the company might double its dividend in the wake of changes to United States tax laws that allowed corporations to bring back overseas cash at lower tax rates than before.
""Special dividends, I'm not really a fan of,"" Cook responded. ""But in terms of annual increases in the dividend, it is something that this board and management are committed to doing.""
Cook said the company would provide an update on its capital return program during its April earnings call with investors, as it has done for the past several years.
At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.
The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple's stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.
Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.
Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.
Shareholders approved four measures put forth by the company, including a required ""say on pay"" vote to approve pay for executives and a measure on re-electing the current directors.

Shares of Apple were up 0.1 percent at $162.84.

842,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Powell Suggests Fed to Go Ahead With Rate Hikes After Share Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the U.S. central bank would push ahead with gradual interest-rate increases even as it remains on the lookout for threats to the financial system in the wake of the recent stock market rout.
“We are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance sheet,” he said Tuesday in the text of his ceremonial swearing-in speech in Washington, adding, “We will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability.”
They were Powell’s first public comments since financial markets last week suffered their most severe bout of volatility in years, partly on concern that rising wages might spur inflation and prod the Fed into faster rate hikes.
While the new Fed chairman didn’t specifically mention the steep fall in share prices, other central bank officials have played down its impact on the economy and the financial system.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley last week called the share shakeout “small potatoes,” while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Tuesday that the turmoil hadn’t affected her economic outlook or her support for further interest-rate hikes.
“If economic conditions evolve as expected, we’ll need to make some further increases in interest rates this year and next year, at a pace similar to last year’s” when the Fed raised rates three times, she said in a speech in Dayton, Ohio.
In their last quarterly projection in December, Fed officials penciled in three rate hikes for this year, according to the median forecast in their so-called dot plot. They tacitly reiterated that view at their Jan. 30-31 meeting, when they said they expected “further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”
Powell’s comments on Tuesday “were consistent with the message” in January, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). in New York. They’re “in a process of raising rates and not close to the finish line.”
Investors see a quarter percentage point hike at the central bank’s next policy-making meeting on March 20-21 as a virtual certainty, according to pricing in federal funds futures.
Powell said the Fed had made “great progress in moving much closer” to its goals of full employment and stable prices since he joined the central bank as a governor in 2012.
Unemployment is down to 4.1 percent, from 8.2 percent back then. Inflation though remains below the Fed’s 2 percent target, standing at 1.7 percent in December.
“Today, the global economy is recovering strongly for the first time in a decade,” Powell said.
He said the Fed was moving to normalize monetary policy “with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives.”
The 8-1/2-year-plus upswing is already the third longest on record, although it has also been the slowest in more than 65 years, averaging annual growth of just 2.2 percent.
Powell pledged to preserve the essential improvements made in financial regulation since the 2007-09 crisis while seeking to make sure the Fed’s approach is as efficient as possible
“The financial system is incomparably stronger and safer, with much higher capital and liquidity, better risk management, and other improvements,” he said.
He also promised to “continue to pursue ways to improve transparency both in monetary policy and in regulation.”
Once revered for its policy-making prowess, the central bank has come in for increasing congressional criticism since the financial crisis, with some Republican lawmakers calling for stepped-up oversight of its monetary policy actions.
“We listen to feedback and give serious consideration to the possibility that we might be getting something wrong,” Powell said. “There is great value in having thoughtful, well-informed critics.”

852,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Norway wealth fund CEO to firms: allow independent directors on your boards,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund plans to be a vocal shareholder during the upcoming AGM season, pushing firms to disclose more non-financial data such as carbon emissions, and allow investors to nominate their own directors.
Greater disclosure on sustainability by the 9,100 companies it invests in will enable the fund to more accurately assess the risk of its investments, its CEO, Yngve Slyngstad, said. 
""This is probably, for us, the issue ... where we would like to see the most concrete results in the spring of 2018,"" Slyngstad told Reuters. 
""It is not only climate-related disclosure but also disclosure of what we call non-financial data in general, sustainability data.
""CO2 is very important ... Water-related disclosure (and) the broader spectrum of U.N. Sustainability (Development) Goals is important,"" Slyngstad said on the sidelines of a news conference. 
The fund, which invests the proceeds of Norway's oil and gas production but cannot invest in Norwegian companies, is one of the world's biggest shareholders, with stakes in 1.4 percent of listed companies globally.
In recent years it has become a more active shareholder, trying to use its size to influence companies' attitudes.
Enabling investors to nominate their own directors, is one of its most pressing issues. 
As the eighth-largest shareholder in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with a stake worth $7.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, it voted against a company resolution on proxy access at Apple last year.
""Quite a few of the larger companies have changed their regulations on that, so we expect even the biggest ones, like Apple, to do that as well. It may take some time ... but we will continue,"" Slyngstad said.
EXERCISING INFLUENCE
In its annual report on responsible investment, released on Tuesday, the fund said that it opposed 6,760 resolutions put forward by companies at annual general meetings last year.
Just over half of them concerned the election of directors, and included opposing combining the roles of CEO and chairman at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Verizon.
It also voted against directors that it felt had too many commitments at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Allianz (DE:ALVG) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
In a separate document published on Tuesday, the fund set out its view that firms should establish anti-corruption policies to prevent and address corruption, and create channels for whistleblowers to be able to warn of problems anonymously.
""We find that a document is actually necessary for us to have that dialogue ... because otherwise it is going to scratch the surface and not go into any concrete issue,"" Slyngstad said.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 12:25PM ET</span>",Brands in Hong Kong expand again as retail sales recover,"By Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Retailers in Hong Kong such as Chow Tai Fook, the world's No. 2 jeweler after Tiffany's by market capitalization, are expanding again in a sign of confidence for a sector critical to the economy.
A pick-up in visitor arrivals from mainland China and strong local demand buoyed by robust stock and property markets have boosted consumer confidence, which translated into retail sales rising 2.2 percent in 2017, the first increase in three years.
Consultant PwC expects retail sales growth to quicken to 4-6 percent this year and to remain firm for several years after that. The volume of retail sales last year rose 1.9 percent after two straight years of decline.
Retail sales are critical for the economy http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/HONGKONG-ECONOMY-RETAIL/010060SJ1GM/hk-retail.jpg. When 2017 GDP figures are published, analysts expect them to show that retail sales produced 17 percent of the economy's growth and about a tenth of its jobs.
Like many other brands, Hong Kong-listed Chow Tai Fook had closed stores in recent years. It said it opened three new shops in Hong Kong between October and December 2017 and plans further openings, including in neighboring Macau. Including mainland China, the brand increased its stores to 2,565 in 2017 from 2,377 in 2016.
""The outlook for the jeweler sector in Hong Kong this year is positive against the backdrop of a recovering economy in mainland China ... and the booming stock and property markets that create a positive wealth effect,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
Other stores will follow Chow Tai Fook's suit, figures from real estate services company Colliers International suggest. It predicts that 1.38 million sq ft of new retail space will come onto the market in the core shopping districts of Hong Kong in 2018, a sharp increase from 327,000 sq ft in 2017.
Chow Tai Fook's smaller rival Luk Fook Holdings added two stores in Hong Kong in the final quarter of 2017 and jeweler Chow Sang Sang said it might open more shops in Hong Kong.
Skin care and cosmetics brand L'Occitane International increased its stores in Hong Kong to 36 in 2017 from 34 in 2016 and rival Sa Sa International added four to take its total to 119 in 2017.
REBOUND IN TOURISM
Visitors to Hong Kong from the Chinese mainland are rising again, which has helped boost retail sales. Their numbers increased 3.9 percent in 2017 after falling 6.7 percent in 2016. Total visitors also increased in 2017 after declining in 2015 and 2016.
One attraction for Chinese mainland visitors to Hong Kong is that imported goods are often cheaper than in China due to lower tariffs.
A Hong Kong jobless rate of less than 3 percent - the lowest in nearly 20 years - is also boosting confidence and analysts said there is little pressure on retailers to pay higher rents, allowing them to keep costs under control.
""There are still many empty shops on the streets, absolutely it is not a time for raising rents,"" said Joe Lin, executive director, advisory and transaction services, retail at property services group CBRE in Hong Kong.
""I don't believe we will see a significant rebound in retail rent in the next 12 months,"" he said.
Colliers said favorable rents on first-tier high streets were driving demand for shops in prime locations although brands, including Major League Baseball (MLB), Swedish watch brand Daniel Wellington and Swiss luxury watch maker Carl F. Bucherer, were opting for smaller stores of around 1,000-5,000 square feet rather than bigger ones.

""International mid-market fashion and lifestyle brands are thriving, new F&B (food and beverage) concepts continue expansion, luxury watches and jeweler demand continue a slow recovery,"" it said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) said on Tuesday that Jonathan Gray, who turned the buyout firm into the world's biggest real estate investor as head of its property business, will take over from Tony James as president, setting him up as successor to Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman.
Gray, who was already widely recognized internally as heir apparent to Schwarzman, will become president and chief operating officer and James will stay on as executive vice chairman. Both will report to Schwarzman, Blackstone's co-founder. 
""The appointment of Jon as President and COO lays the foundation for the next generation of senior management and positions the firm well for future leadership,"" Schwarzman said in a statement. 
Blackstone also said Ken Caplan and Kathleen McCarthy will be global co-heads of real estate, succeeding Gray.
The appointment also underscores the importance of Blackstone's real estate business, which manages $115 billion in assets and provided almost half the firm's revenues in 2017. 
Private equity firms - which typically buy companies with the aim of selling them at a profit, usually after three to five years - rose to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s and several have now laid out plans for the next generation of managers. 
Rivals such as  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG), KKR & Co LP (N:KKR) and  Ares Management LP  (N:ARES) announced succession plans last year. 

Last month, Blackstone agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of  Thomson Reuters  Corp (N:TRI) (TO:TRI), the parent of Reuters News. Reuters News will remain part of Thomson Reuters.

The firm’s equities strategist David Kostin sees the S&P 500 Index reaching 2,850 by the end of 2018, below the average estimate of 2,940 among strategists tracked by Bloomberg. Cohen urged caution if the gauge trades that high.
“You need to have valuation support to be at sustained high levels” in the stock market, Cohen said in a Bloomberg Radio interview Tuesday with Tom Keene and Jonathan Ferro. With the S&P 500 at around 2,850, “several years of ongoing profit growth and no recession” are priced in, she said.
The S&P 500 reached a record of almost 2,873 on Jan. 26. But it’s fallen back over the past couple of weeks as volatility rocked markets and is now at around 2,650.
Cohen also said that Goldman strategists “remain concerned about fixed-income.” Bonds “will be rising in yield,” she said, “not just in the U.S. but around the world.” The recent drop in bond prices “should not have been a surprise to anyone,” she continued.
Cohen, who’s president of Goldman’s Global Markets Institute, also said that “government policy coming out of Washington, to my eyes, is not supportive of sustainable intermediate and long-term economic growth.”
She cited changes in tax policy, budget proposals, infrastructure plans and trade policy as factors that don’t help longer-term growth.

LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Being offered cash at the gate to take a later flight because of overbooking may become a rarity if technology being examined by major airlines such as British Airways (L:ICAG), JetBlue (O:JBLU) and Qantas (AX:QAN) catches on. 
The forceful removal of a passenger from an overbooked United Airlines flight last year sparked an online backlash last year and U.S. carriers pledged to revise their policies. 
Many airlines still routinely overbook flights because a small number of passengers do not show up. If planes are overloaded, they seek volunteers to change flights before boarding, usually in exchange for cash. 
A platform developed by Atlanta-based travel technology company Volantio will identify passengers most likely to be flexible about their flights and enable airlines to contact them in the days before they are due to depart.
The carrier can then offer an alternative seat plus incentives such as an upgrade or travel vouchers. 
Volantio CEO Azim Barodawala said anyone who opts in to its system can be contacted. Machine learning algorithms will use data such as information available on the flight list to help determine which types of passengers might be ready to change.
""There are huge privacy concerns over who can be contacted. The partners with whom we've worked so far typically have a setting in their marketing permissions that permit us to reach out to them,"" he told Reuters. 
Barodawala gave a hypothetical example that someone flying from Frankfurt to Paris and back in a day is likely to be on business and need to stick to those flight times.
The technology also means airlines can also potentially shift passengers from high demand flights and free up tickets for last-minute travelers prepared to pay a premium. 
""It gives airlines the ability to generate some extra revenue while making two other parties better off - the flexible traveler and also the last-minute traveler who might not have been able to get a seat because the flight was sold out,"" Barodawala said.
It could also help airlines if they need to free up seats to rebook passengers following disruptions such as those related to bad weather. 
Volantio said this week it had raised $2.6 million in a funding round, led by Ingleside Investors, representing the interests of the New York-based Israel family, but also involving BA-owner International Airlines Group, JetBlue, and Qantas. 
IAG, whose stable of airlines also includes Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus, declined to say how much it would be putting into start-up Volantio. It has established a multimillion-pound fund to help to expand its digital abilities.

JetBlue invested through its Technology Ventures arm and Qantas through Qantas Ventures.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial spreadbetters targeting retail customers should be licensed to stop them exploiting gaps in cross-border rules and preying on inexperienced investors, global regulators proposed on Tuesday.
The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) proposed a coordinated crackdown on sales of rolling-spot forex contracts, contracts-for-difference (CFDs) and binary options.
Such products can be used to bet on moves in currencies, interest rates and other market prices, and are usually sold through online trading platforms without advice, and with most retain investors losing money, IOSCO said.
""An increasing number of IOSCO members have reported that intermediaries active in these products are targeting the mass retail market,"" IOSCO said in a statement.
""A significant proportion of firms offer services on a cross-border basis, often without a physical presence in many of the jurisdictions where the end-consumers reside. This presents specific challenges to regulators regarding the supervision of these firms.""
IOSCO groups national market watchdogs such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Germany's BaFin and the Financial Services Agency in Japan.
Other members like Britain and Israel have already taken a tougher approach to binary options. Shares in spreadbetters such as IG Group (L:IGG), CMC Markets (L:CMCX) and Plus 500 (L:PLUSP) sank in December when the European Union's markets watchdog said it would curb a core part of their market.
IOSCO said firms were using misleading marketing messages to target a high volume of inexperienced retail customers as they are likely to lose money.
Firms were also offering leverage of up to 2000 to 1 in rolling spot forex or CFDs, a large bet on the back of a tiny initial outlay.
There has been an increase in the number of unlicensed firms selling the products illegally, IOSCO said.
It proposed tools for members to replace their patchwork of regulation with a more joined-up approach, including a licensing requirement for all firms that sell the products at home or abroad, and limits on leverage.
""Licensing provides a critical safeguard that firms are appropriately managed, and that certain conduct and prudential standards are observed when undertaking business,"" IOSCO said.
It proposed measures to tackle the risk of investors losing more than their initial investment, and improve disclosure of risks.
A public consultation on the proposals ends next month and IOSCO will then publish a final report. Applying agreed regulatory approaches is part of IOSCO membership.

The third-largest U.S. bank anticipates an increase in loans made to consumers to finance homes and other purchases even as an order from the government’s top banking regulator prohibits it from growing.
“My expectation is that we’ll have higher consumer loan balances a year from now than we do today,” Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview Monday at the bank’s San Francisco headquarters. He said as long as the economic environment stays broadly the same and risks don’t dramatically change, “there’s no bogey on loan growth.”
Any loan increase would happen despite reputation damage the bank suffered since a fake-accounts scandal erupted in late 2016. Last year, its consumer loans fell 1.7 percent to $453 billion, even as rivals increased lending activities.
After acknowledging the fake accounts, the bank revealed that auto-loan clients were forced to pay for unwanted car insurance and that mortgage customers were improperly charged fees. The Fed acted, ordering that Wells Fargo can’t boost assets until it proves it can fix shortcomings including internal oversight. The firm can take deposits and lend to consumers but not balloon past $1.95 trillion in total assets.

Shrewsberry’s boss, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan, said at investor conference Tuesday that the bank’s customers are seeing few effects from the Fed order.
“The customer impact has been really nonexistent,” Sloan said at a conference sponsored by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG in Florida. “But it’s really it’s been bankers, relationship managers -- including me by the way -- out there reinforcing to customers that we’re open for business and we’ll be able to work through it.”
Consumer Business
Wells Fargo doesn’t need to adjust strategies to achieve growth in consumer or institutional businesses, Sloan said in a separate interview Monday at the bank’s headquarters.
“If something works, that’s fine,” Sloan said. “We don’t feel like we have to do anything new, other than to make sure our customers understand we’re out there.”
The auto-lending business is expected to return to growth one or two quarters after the firm completes a consolidation of its regional car-loan centers in March or April, Shrewsberry said. He also said that the bank is “pursuing vigorously” credit-card customers who will spend more and those that will keep balances longer than a month.
“In terms of fundamentally changing how we’re going about doing our business, we don’t need to do that,” Sloan said.

(Reuters) - Walgreens' potential move to buy a drug distributor in which it already has a 26 percent stake has some analysts questioning the logic and wondering if it would be enough to compete in an evolving U.S. healthcare sector.
Analysts said any deal would not be a surprise, but might cost Walgreens opportunities down the line as the company tries to keep pace with rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), which is set to buy health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET), and an impending threat from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, the largest U.S. drugstore operator, has made a takeover approach to AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, but said the talks were in early stages.
AmerisourceBergen shares were up 12 percent in early trading, while Walgreens shares were up 1.4 percent. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH) were lower. 
""This purported deal wouldn't be shocking ... but we're currently struggling to see the strategic allure of the combination for Walgreens,"" Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a note. 
The two companies are already closely allied, having struck a 10-year deal in 2013 for AmerisourceBergen to buy drugs for Walgreens, which subsequently acquired 26 percent of the distributor.
The rationale for such a deal is a bit of a head-scratcher as Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen already have a joint venture that affords both the strategic value that combining would provide, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said.
The news comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act escalating drug prices and Amazon's possible entry.
Walgreens has highlighted that it tends to prefer partnerships, which analysts say could eventually turn into acquisitions.
A deal, however, would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.

""As the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital/physician's office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,"" Tanquilut said.

894,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 10:03AM ET</span>",Fed Rate Hikes Squeezing Even the Hottest Automaker in the U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes are making it costlier for even the hottest automaker in the U.S. to sell cars.
Subaru Corp (T:7270)., the only carmaker to boost U.S. sales every year in the last decade, is continuing to offer cheap financing on models including the Outback crossover and Legacy sedan even as rates rise. While those deals look about the same to customers, they’re becoming more expensive for the company, pinching margins in a plateauing U.S. market.
“Our basic incentive programs haven’t really changed -- what’s changed is the fact that interest rates have increased so much,” Tom Doll, president of Subaru of America, said in an interview last week at the Chicago Auto Show.
With the Fed hiking rates three times last year and forecasting three more in 2018, carmakers are coming under pressure. So far, they’ve been wary about backing away from cheap financing offers, which could cost them market share as U.S. auto sales stop growing. At some point, the cost of dangling those deals to consumers will sacrifice too much profit, according to Doll.
“Somebody’s going to have to blink,” he said. “Somebody’s going to have to be willing to say ‘No mas -- we’re not going to do zero-percent financing anymore for 60 months or 72 months.’”
Subaru spent about $1,047 per vehicle on incentives last year, up about $214 from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. The Japanese carmaker still spent the least on marketing promotions among all manufacturers tracked by the researcher. The industry’s average incentive spending -- including rebates, discounted financing and dealer promotions -- rose almost 10 percent to $3,672 per vehicle.
U.S. auto sales shrank 1.8 percent last year to 17.2 million, the first annual decline for the industry since 2009. Subaru’s Doll said he expects carmakers will sell more than 17 million vehicles again this year, though other companies have been less bullish: Toyota Motor Corp. has predicted industry deliveries will be in the high-16 million range.
Still, there will be opportunities for automakers to at least partially offset the impact of rising interest rates, said Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive officer of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s U.S. unit.
“There were former times where interest rates were higher and the industry also did well,” Woebcken said at the Chicago show. “It’s a matter of adjusting.”

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates faces calls from its cabin crew to improve conditions and benefits as airline workers show increasing confidence in demanding more from the booming global industry.
In the latest sign of cost pressures that could temper a rebound in airline profits, Emirates cabin crew raised the issues at meetings last week with the Middle East's largest airline, four employees aware of the talks told Reuters.
Major airlines are having to adapt to changes, with Ryanair (I:RYA), Europe's biggest budget airline, reluctantly recognizing unions last year to avert a strike, after a shortage of standby pilots forced it to cancel 20,000 flights.
Labor disputes are rare in Dubai, the Middle East financial and tourist hub where Emirates is based, and unions and industrial action, common elsewhere in the industry, are banned.
But in an indication of the strength of feeling among its staff, management at Emirates, whose Chief Operations Officer Adel al-Redha led the talks, have asked for time to consider the requests, employees said. Another meeting is planned for Feb. 19, a company email seen by Reuters shows.
""As no different to previous forums, feedback or matters raised by our staff are reviewed and when changes are made, they are communicated through the respective line managers,"" an Emirates spokeswoman said, confirming the talks which took place on Feb. 5.
""In any organization there will always be differing views and opinions. At Emirates, we value staff feedback and try to incorporate it where applicable to make the company a better place to work,"" she told Reuters on Tuesday.
Emirates, which employed nearly 25,000 cabin crew, mostly foreigners, in its last financial year, offers staff perks that most other carriers do not, such as free housing and transport to and from work. 
Despite these benefits, employees, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said cabin crew were pursuing changes including to rest periods on long flights and rosters.
""If they're smart, they're going to see that these things do have to change, otherwise more people are going to keep leaving,"" one of the Emirates staff told Reuters.
Emirates was the world’s largest airline in terms of international revenue passenger kilometers flown in 2016, according to data from industry group IATA, whose 2017 rankings have not yet been published. U.S. airlines are bigger by the same industry measure if their domestic traffic is included.
PREGNANCY GUARANTEE
Around 3,000 employees left Emirates and associated group companies in the first half of its current financial year. The airline has not said which departments those staff were from.
Among the demands, cabin crew want Emirates to fully cover the cost of medical insurance policies, as well as the guarantee of ground jobs during pregnancy and not only if a role is available.
Cabin crew across the world may not work on board airplanes while pregnant due to health concerns, although some countries allow for up to three months into pregnancy.
Most airlines then find their staff work on the ground or place them on maternity leave. In Europe, pregnant women are protected from being fired or made redundant.
Emirates employees said ground jobs for pregnant cabin crew were becoming increasingly rare, largely leaving them without an income or benefits during their pregnancy.
There was a higher than expected turnout for the initial Feb. 5 meeting, requiring a second, unplanned meeting to be arranged for the same day, two employees said.
The Emirates spokeswoman said ""it was no surprise that it was well-attended"" given the presence of senior management.
Emirates, like other Middle East airlines, saw its margins come under pressure in recent years as low oil prices dented premium travel demand.
In late 2016 the airline largely froze a policy that gave its cabin crew thousands of dollars a year in allowances if they lived outside company accommodation.

However, profit surged in the first-half of Emirate's current financial year and cabin crew now want the allowance to be fully reinstated.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors cut equity holdings by the most in two-years in February, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey showed on Tuesday, as world shares had their worst week since early 2016.
The BAML survey of 196 participants with a total of $575 billion under management was conducted between Feb. 2 and Feb. 8, when world equity markets fell by more than 5 percent.
The sharp sell off followed higher than expected U.S. wage growth data which raised fears the U.S. Federal Reserve would have to tighten faster than previously anticipated.
In the poll, just 5 percent of fund managers said global interest rates would be lower in the next 12 months, with 80 percent expecting them to rise.
""The February fund manager survey allocation is positioned for higher rates and a weak U.S. dollar but is now less equivocally pro-cyclical and risk-on,"" the bank said.
Higher bond yields tend to hurt equities because they increase borrowing costs for companies and ultimately consumers. They also present an alternative to investors who may reallocate some cash from equities.
Wall Street suffered a particularly turbulent week, with all its main indices in correction territory, meaning cumulative falls of more than 10 percent from their peak.
Perhaps not surprisingly, investors' allocation to equities fell to a net 43 percent overweight from a net 55 percent overweight, the largest one-month decline since February 2016.
BAML said this 12 percentage point drop was short of the 16 percentage point monthly fall required to signal that a risk asset rout was complete, according to historical survey data.
But it also noted a record 20 percentage point jump in the number of investors taking out protection against a sharp fall in equity markets in the next three months, to a net minus 30 percent in February.
In another sign of caution, cash levels rose to 4.7 percent from 4.4 percent. But Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BAML, said the cash and equity shifts did not move the needle enough to give the all clear to buy the dip.
The top tail risk identified by investors for 2018 was an inflation-induced bond crash, chosen by 45 percent. A policy mistake by the Fed or the European Central Bank was next, cited by 18 percent.
In another pessimistic signal, 70 percent of investors surveyed now believe the global economy is in a ""late cycle"" phase, the highest level since January 2008.
In a rare bright spot, the allocation to emerging market equities held at a net 41 percent overweight, but UK stocks remained out of favor with a net 36 percent underweight, back to near post-global financial crisis lows.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 09:41AM ET</span>",Daimler warns of supply chain risk from switch to electric cars,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand, warned that a fall in demand for diesel cars and a switch to electric vehicles could force it to prop up its supplier base.
Carmakers face increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over pollution levels produced by their diesel-engined vehicles after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015 admitted to cheating emission tests using engine management software. 
To avoid a total ban on their diesel vehicles, Daimler and other carmakers have stepped up development of electric cars and agreed to update their engine management software to cut down pollution levels.
Daimler's suppliers are being forced to invest to help electrify the entire Mercedes-Benz range by 2022, prompting the carmaker to use unusually frank language to warn about the impact of the shift to electrified cars in its report. 
""Due to the planned electrification of new model series and a shift in customer demand from diesel to gasoline engines, the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment in particular is faced with the risk that Daimler will require changed volumes of components from suppliers,"" the carmaker said in its annual report. 
""This could result in over- or under-utilization of production capacities for certain suppliers. If suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,"" Daimler said.
""Necessary capacity expansion at suppliers' plants could also require cost-effective participation,"" Daimler added.
Daimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing Daimler to step in. 
Daimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles.
In its annual report, Daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices.
""Generally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,"" the annual report said.
Daimler's report, published on Tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier.
The Stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings.
Daimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States in a class-action suit which alleges the German carmaker used software to reduce emissions.
Daimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed.
Among the legal risks faced by Daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. Daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities.
Daimler also said in its report that Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche's total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier.

Broadcom's move comes a day ahead of planned talks between the semiconductor companies to discuss the potential $121 billion deal, which will be their first such discussion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
Broadcom said it would withdraw its offer if it was not accepted by Qualcomm's executives or unless its six nominees were elected at the shareholder meeting.
Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment.
Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week to $82 per share from $70, and made other concessions, including offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal.
Qualcomm rejected the revised offer, as it did the first bid, saying the proposal undervalued the company and fell well short of commitments on regulatory issues.
Broadcom had nominated a slate of 11 directors to replace Qualcomm's board, after it rejected the first bid, worth $103 billion.
Broadcom's six nominees are Samih Elhage, David Golden, Veronica Hagen, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You.
Moelis and Co, Citi,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities were Broadcom's financial advisers.

Qualcomm's shares were up marginally premarket at $65.69, while Broadcom's stock dipped 0.5 percent to $243.18.

(Reuters) - The only thing abnormal that the head of Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) Inc's asset management unit sees in the recent burst of stock market volatility is that it had not happened sooner. PGIM Chief Executive Officer David Hunt, whose unit manages $1.2 trillion, spoke with Reuters about the opportunity it triggers and more.
Q: What do you make of the market correction?
A: It's not at all unexpected and a bit overdue.
Obviously, we look at that as long-term investors and for us, this means that we can get in at a better entry point.
Q: Is there an opportunity?
A: If you take the 10-year view, a large portion of the growth from worldwide economies will come from emerging markets. Over the last 18 months, it's been hard to get into that at a reasonable price. Now the numbers are looking more positive.
Q: Which emerging markets are appealing?
A: Looking at the world in terms of countries is not the way to do it. Industry trends now are more powerful. Trends around cities and urbanization are more powerful.
We think the internet has the opportunity to grow disproportionately in emerging markets than in developed markets. We've been big investors in China, India and others in the internet, payment platforms and other technologies that we think will leapfrog a lot of existing technologies in the developed world.
Q: What is PGIM's best-performing investment?
A: In 2017...good balanced portfolio did really well across the portfolio. Real estate investments were very strong.
We had a record performance in our private asset classes. Private credit performed extremely well. The most important thing was that more than 90 percent of our assets performed better than their benchmarks.
Q: Are there troublesome pockets of real estate?
A: We were well ahead of the trend of the difficulties in retail....That's now been a bit overdone, so we are now stepping back into malls where we think they have been sold off badly or where we think we can create a really interesting experience.
On the other side, the internet is creating really different uses for real estate....Every major U.S. city needs to have four or five big complexes not too far from the city center...to set up and create the last line of delivery to the home...And my favorite one: self-storage. There is no more powerful human emotion than the desire to hold on to stuff. And it's not a big returner, but it's a good returner - about a 7-9 percent return.. and very low risk.
Q: Where do you see PGIM fitting in as passive managers take over more of the marketplace?
A: My general thesis on the passive piece is that it's both overblown and misunderstood.
If you look at the classes we manage, there is really no passive management of real estate. You can't own this building here and lease it in a passive way. There is no passive approach to commercial mortgages, to private debt. There is so far very little passive in the public fixed income markets.
The misunderstood part of it is that the rise of passive...has been a healthy competition for active management....You can't just hug a benchmark and charge to do that. You need to have high active shares, you need to be taking risks, and you need to be performing.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Investors await Goldman's $5 billion answers as trading picks up,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last year,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) executives met with some skepticism after unveiling an ambitious plan to grow revenue by $5 billion, whether or not markets remained subdued. Now that trading has picked up, Wall Street is hoping the bank can do even better.
On Tuesday, Goldman's chief executive officer, Lloyd Blankfein, is scheduled to speak at an industry conference in Miami Beach, where he intends to provide more information about the revenue-boosting effort.
It will be the first time Blankfein himself tries to persuade investors with a formal, public presentation about the lofty goals Goldman has set. Since his deputies first laid out the revenue-growth strategy in September, analysts have peppered executives with questions about the underlying assumptions and cited concerns raised by investors.
For instance, Instinet analyst Steven Chubak told Goldman's finance chief in October that many of his clients wanted to know why Goldman thinks it can boost investment management revenue by $1 billion, given the challenges money managers are facing more broadly.
In a recent report, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said shareholders remain ""skeptical"" about other components of Goldman's revenue growth plan, like consumer lending, despite assurances from senior executives.
""Mr. Blankfein will be providing an update on our business to investors (Tuesday), and we are in the early stages of delivering on the growth plan we outlined last fall,"" a Goldman spokeswoman said in an email.
Wall Street is hesitant to forecast that Goldman will be able to generate any of the promised $5 billion,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo said in an interview.
""This is the environment that Goldman has been waiting for all decade,"" said Mayo, who expects the bank to achieve $3 billion of its $5 billion target helped by volatility returning to stock and bond markets globally. ""If Goldman doesn't get it right in 2018, then management has some serious questions to ask.""
Trading had been a profit engine for Goldman Sachs for the decade leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but lethargic markets, new regulations and tougher competition have since upended the business.
In 2009, Goldman boasted 19 percent market share in bond trading, which generated $121 billion in revenue across Wall Street, according to the bank's September presentation. But Goldman since lost nearly half that share as the revenue pool has declined by nearly half. Last year the bank reported its worst bond trading results since 2008, with revenue dropping 30 percent.
As a result, Goldman is trying to grow businesses like investment management, while trying to generate more trading revenue from existing customers as well as new ones. It is also diving into Main Street banking, an area where it never previously had significant operations.
Goldman launched its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, primarily targeting credit-card borrowers who want to refinance into cheaper loans. By the end of last year, Marcus had originated $2.3 billion in loans, and management expects to grow that figure by $13 billion through 2020.
The growth rate has caused concern among some investors and analysts, given recent signs across the industry that consumer credit risk is on the rise, particularly in cards.
Analysts are hoping Blankfein will talk about bond trading on Tuesday and also provide more details on the revenue growth initiative. Some said the presentation itself is a step in the right direction for a bank that historically disclosed little about its strategy and declined to issue financial targets the way rivals like  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) routinely do.

""Over the last many years, Goldman has been very shy about what it's going to do, so you never had a full score card to measure against,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg. ""This is a very different Goldman Sachs today than it was 20-30 years ago.""

The company reported a loss of $87.9 million, or 20 cents per Class C share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $103.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.
The reported quarter included a one-time charge of $39 million due to changes in the U.S. tax code. 
The sportswear maker, that competes with  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGn), said it would incur additional restructuring charges between $110 million and $130 million this year, related to closing of facilities and termination of leases.
Net revenue rose 4.6 percent to $1.37 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $1.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

MILWAUKEE, Wis. (Reuters) - To Harley-Davidson Inc's (N:HOG) investors, its chief executive has a simple message - be patient with his strategy to turn around the slump in demand for its iconic motorcycles.
In an interview with Reuters, Matt Levatich said the company is not exploring a merger with a rival or a private equity buyout, as some investors have speculated.
Instead, Harley is spending millions of dollars on product development and marketing efforts, including promoting its learn-to-ride academies at showrooms, where Harley-Davidson certified coaches provide riding and safety lessons. 
Levatich said the ridership program would transform the motorcycle-maker into a ""customer-creator."" But he does not have an answer when it will return Harley to sales growth in the United States, its biggest market.
""Mindset shifts are not something that happen overnight,"" he said in the interview in his office at the company's headquarter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""But that's very much core to the 10-year strategy for the company."" 
However, nearly three years into Levatich's tenure as Harley CEO, investors are getting restless. Harley's stock has fallen over 23 percent since mid-March last year. 
Since Levatich came to the helm, the shares are down 14 percent, and Harley is losing share in a declining market for motorcycles in the United States. 
Harley investors and executives have worried for years about what would happen in the future when the company's devoted Baby Boomer got too old to ride. 
Now, Harley has reached that demographic cliff. The company last month projected shipments to dealers could plunge to their lowest level in eight years in 2018 after sales fell in every region last year.
GO IT ALONE
Falling sales have made Wall Street speculate whether the company, which symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s, would seek refuge in a buyout or turn private to rework its product lines and branding without the pressure from shareholders to shield its profit margins.
Levatich, however, sees no alternative to the current ownership structure.
""The moment, however, we feel that the ownership structure of the company...is starting to dictate our strategy, that's the moment to consider whether that ownership model is the right model,"" he said. ""So, it is not the case. We are very clear in our strategy.""
In 2017, the ridership program added 32,000 new riders in the United States. Levatich sees it as a ""positive"" trend and wants to build on it. 
More riders, however, do not necessarily mean higher sales.
Bill Koester, a general manager at a Harley dealership in Illinois, says only 35 percent to 40 percent of the riders trained at his dealership last year bought a new or pre-owned bike.
To woo the next generation of riders, last month Levatich unveiled his big bet on the small but growing market for electric bikes. 
Yet, the new technology is still very expensive and not as profitable as automakers may have to sacrifice margins to succeed in selling battery vehicles. 
""There are some practical problems with EV that still most auto companies are also struggling with,"" said Levatich. ""It is very expensive.""
HEADWINDS
Harley is still the dominant player in the heavyweight motorcycle market in the United States, but its market share has steadily fallen to 50.8 percent from 58 percent in 2013. 
In the last quarter alone, its market share shrunk by 2.6 percentage points, forcing it to announce the closure of one of its four U.S. factories and 800 job cuts.
Harley's challenges are in part related to demographic shifts bigger than its strategy or products. Overall, new motorcycles retail sales in the United States have more than halved since 2006 as younger people shun big motorcycles, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. 
Harley has also stuck to a strategy of protecting profit margins and limiting discount offers, even as rivals such as  Polaris Industries  Inc (N:PII) are undercutting Harley prices to move bikes out of their showrooms.
Polaris enjoyed a 30 percent on year jump in North American retail sales in the last quarter, whereas Harley's sales dived 10 percent.
Levatich attributed the divergent performance to ""math.""
""Growth percentages of a small base are easy to achieve. When you have a high base like ours, a little bit of decline shows up very quickly,"" he said. ""We are not going to discount to increase our market share.""
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Harley's weak performances in the past have dented its credibility. 

""We won't sugar-coat it. HOG has a tough road ahead of them,"" RBC Capital Markets said.

PepsiCo on Tuesday also announced a stock buyback of up to $15 billion and a 15 percent increase in its dividend payout.
The maker of Tropicana juices and Mountain Dew said organic sales at its Frito-Lay division rose 5 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 30, buoyed by demand for salty snacks including Cheetos and Lay's. Organic sales exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures.
Organic sales at PepsiCo's North American beverages business that includes Mountain Dew and Gatorade fell 3 percent as U.S. consumers continued to move away from sugary drinks.
Total revenue rose slightly to $19.53 billion, topping analysts' average expectation of $19.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
PepsiCo recorded a net loss of $710 million, compared to a year-earlier profit of $1.40 billion, reflecting a $2.5 billion one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.31 per share, edging past analysts' estimates of $1.30.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Lotte chief and ex-president's friend jailed in South Korea scandal,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - The friend of former South Korean leader Park Geun-hye who was at the center of an influence-peddling scandal that rocked the country's business and political elite has been sentenced to 20 years in jail, a Seoul court said on Tuesday.
The court also sentenced the chairman of the Lotte Group, the country's fifth-largest conglomerate, to two years and six months in prison in the same case.
Choi Soon-sil, a confidante of Park, was convicted of receiving bribes from South Korean conglomerates including Samsung (KS:005930), the world's biggest maker of smartphones and semiconductors, and the Lotte Group.
Park was dismissed from the presidency last March after being impeached and standing trial separately on charges of bribery, abuse of power and coercion. She denies any wrongdoing.
Lotte's chairman, Shin Dong-bin, was in court at the time of the verdict and was taken into custody.
""His act crushed the hopes and faith of the community and the people... Giving bribes hurts the fairness of society,"" said Kim Se-yun, the presiding judge.
Shin's arrest creates a leadership vacuum at Lotte, a retail-to-chemicals giant with 110.8 trillion won ($102 billion) worth of assets, as it navigates mounting losses at its China operations.
The verdict comes at a time when Lotte, a sponsor of the Winter Olympics currently on in South Korea, had stepped up marketing in a bid to promote its brand and boost sales. Shin, who is also president of the Korea Ski Association, was staying in Pyeongchang, the venue of the Games, before coming to Seoul for the court verdict.
After the court ruling, Lotte said the chairman's jail sentence was ""unexpected"", noting that it could affect the retail giant's current plans such as an initial public offering of key unit Hotel Lotte.
""The situation was unexpected and we are in despair. We respect the court's decision, but the result is very regrettable."" Lotte said in a statement.
Last year, Lotte was shunned in China after providing land to South Korea's government so that a U.S. anti-missile system could be installed in the country.
The conglomerate has also suffered because of infighting in 2015 between Shin and his brother.
SAMSUNG SCION FREED EARLIER
Prosecutors had sought a four-year jail term for Shin, accusing Lotte of giving a foundation backed by Park and Choi 7 billion won ($6.46 million) for favours such as a duty free store license.
Shin and Lotte had denied the charge.
The jail term for Shin follows a December ruling in which the court found him guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement in a different case but suspended sentencing, leaving him free to run the group.
Kim, the judge, said Park ""abandoned constitutionally-given responsibility and gave position and power to others"" and that Choi used her position ""to monopolize state business and seek personal gain"".
Prosecutors had demanded a 25-year jail term for Choi on charges including coercion, bribery, influence-peddling and abuse of authority.
Choi's lawyer Lee Kyung-jae said he was concerned that his client's ""severely heavy sentence"" came from ""the judges forming their impressions straight from the prosecution's arguments,"" adding that he would appeal against the verdict.
Tuesday's verdict follows an appeals court ruling last week that freed the scion of the family that controls Samsung, Jay Y. Lee, after a year in detention.
Lee had been charged with giving some of the bribes that Choi was accused of receiving. However, last week's ruling said Lee's bribe-giving was a ""passive compliance to political power,"" appearing to put the weight of the blame on Park and Choi.
Park, who is in jail, is currently being defended by state attorneys after her defense team resigned en masse last October in protest at the extension of her detention period until April this year.
A verdict in her trial is expected before her detention period ends in April.

That’s the message from Nader Naeimi of AMP Capital Investors Ltd. who’s still hanging on to the bulk of his cash reserves for another possible selloff by March.
After an initial sharp selloff, equity markets typically have a brief recovery before another bout of sustained selling, said Naeimi, AMP’s head of dynamic markets who helps oversee about $120 billion at the firm. After moving some 30 percent of his assets to cash last year, Naeimi is waiting for that second round to occur before jumping back in.
“The plan is to buy in the second leg down, usually it’s best to wait for the markets to build a base before committing heavily back into the buy side,” Naeimi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “As we go to the Fed meeting March 9, I think there will be more potential volatility weakness.”
Still, Naeimi is dipping his toes back into the stock market and has started returning to some cyclical positions including energy, financials and Japanese equities. He is also impressed by the resilience of emerging market stocks and currencies during the rout and rising volatility.
“That’s a great sign,” he said. “So this weakness, we’re using that weakness to buy into emerging market equities as well.”

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission called Credit Suisse last Tuesday, the day after the market rout that prompted the bank to announce liquidation of its VelocityShares (P:XIV) product, the paper said.
The agency questioned the bank about the product, the Journal wrote, citing two unidentified sources. Regulatory officials asked how the investment's performance was calculated and whether retail investors were involved, it quoted one of the sources as saying.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report.
Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority said last week that it was in contact with Credit Suisse regarding the product launched in 2010.
Credit Suisse has said it would shut down its VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note (ETN) -- the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the S&P 500 -- on Feb. 21.
Last week's global market turmoil has shone a light on U.S. and European-listed complex trading instruments, which some investors blame for the scale of the disruption.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares faltered on Tuesday morning in contrast with Wall Street which bounced back for a second day overnight, and as a flurry of corporate results failed to lift indexes. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was just slightly negative, down 0.02 percent at 0920 GMT with bourses and sectors trading sideways in the absence of a clear upward or downward trend. 
""Wall Street is looking to build on a big two-day rally but there is as yet no real conviction behind this, as evidenced by the softer performance in European indices this morning,"" commented Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. 
""We are yet to build consensus around this rally and it could run into trouble if conviction is lacking"", he added.
A flurry of corporate results yielded both positive and negative reactions on European trading floors. 
The telecoms sector suffered after Telenet reported 2017 results. The Belgian operator fell over 7 percent, the worst performer on the STOXX. 
Shares in Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) slid 2.6 percent despite the luxury group reporting stronger-than-expected Q4 sales growth. 
Rival LVMH lost 1.2 percent. 
Smelter Aurubis fell about 4 percent after its results fell short of the average forecast in a Reuters poll. 
On the other hand, shares in French video game producer Ubisoft rose 5.1 percent after a trading update which took it to the top of the STOXX 600. 
Randstad, the world's second-largest staffing company and a bellwether for the economy, saw fourth-quarter core profit rise 15 percent, buoyed by a strong recovery in the European job markets. Its shares gained 0.9 percent. 
European travel group TUI was the best performer of the FTSE and rose 4.6 percent after reporting that summer bookings for Turkey were recovering, echoing comments by rival Thomas Cook and adding to hopes that pressure on profit margins for tour operators may ease.

The travel and leisure sector was among the few to trade firmly in positive territory, up 0.9 percent, with Lufthansa and Easyjet up 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 03:37AM ET</span>","GM to shut one South Korea plant, decide on fate of others within weeks","By Joseph White and Ju-min Park
DETROIT/SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it will close one of its four plants in South Korea and incur an $850 million impairment charge as part of a restructuring of its money-losing business in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.
The U.S. automaker said it would decide the future of its remaining South Korean operations within weeks, and is in talks with the government and labor unions on how to cut costs and make the business profitable.
""Time is short and everyone must move with urgency,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters. 
The move is the latest in a series of steps the U.S. automaker has taken to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015 GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.
GM's plan places South Korean President Moon Jae-in in an uncomfortable spot as he has pledged to create more jobs and provide job security as his top economic policy. Opposition lawmakers criticized Moon's administration on Tuesday for the potential job losses from GM's strategy for the country.
The South Korean government said in a statement it regretted GM's ""unilateral"" decision to close the plant. It said it wanted to conduct an audit of the automaker's local arm, GM Korea, as it weighed options to help with the restructuring plan. 
GM said in a statement it would take the $850 million charge to reflect the restructuring costs, including $375 million in cash related to employee expenses. Most of the financial writedowns would be recorded by the end of the second quarter. 
South Korea had for years been a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak. But sharp rises in labor costs, weakening demand for sedans, which GM Korea mainly produces, and big investments in neighboring China hurt the South Korean business's competitiveness.
The plant shutdown is part of its broader Asia business restructuring. Excluding profits from China, GM said its Asian operations lost money in 2016. GM Korea posted a total of 1.9 trillion won ($1.8 billion) in net losses between 2014 and 2016. 
In recent years, GM ceased manufacturing in Australia and Indonesia, and significantly restructured its Thai operations. It said in May it is winding down efforts to sell cars in India and is turning its manufacturing facilities there into an export hub.
The automaker's decisions to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe. Declining sales of small cars in the United States have also hurt demand for Korean-made Chevrolets.
HIGH LABOR COSTS, LOW OUTPUT
The first step in the South Korean restructuring plan is the closure of GM's plant in Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, which employs 2,000 out of GM's 16,000-strong South Korean workforce. 
The factory was running at about 20 percent of its full production capacity last year, GM said. The automaker's three other assembly plants in South Korea built 485,403 vehicles in 2017. 
GM sells Chevrolet and Cadillac brand vehicles in Korea, and more than half the vehicles built by GM's Korean plants are exported.
A GM Korea official said the company planned to start a voluntary retirement program for all its workers, not just those at Gunsan, from Tuesday. The official declined to be named as the decision had not been made public.
Ammann said a decision on investments in new models for the remaining South Korean plants to build depended on the government's willingness to offer funding or other incentives, and on whether unions would agree to cut labor costs. 
""If we are successful in working with our stakeholders to restructure and get to a viable cost structure, we would see an opportunity to invest"" in new vehicles, Ammann said.
South Korea's state-run development bank owns a 17 percent stake in GM Korea. The Detroit automaker owns 77 percent of the operations while GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, controls 6.0 percent.

MGM Cotai, which will more than triple the number of MGM's hotel rooms in the former Portuguese colony to 1,972, marks a major expansion in non-gaming attractions amid uncertainty over the renewal process of its casino license that expires in two years.
The new resort, MGM's second and the biggest investment in Macau, boasts a 2,000-seat theater and artwork including 28 carpets from the Qing dynasty as well as a four-storey atrium garden space that features digital art. It also increases MGM's overall gaming table count in the hub by 29 percent to 552.
The opening comes at a time of surging casino revenues. Macau's January numbers stormed past expectations with a 36 percent year-on-year jump, the 18th gain in a row, on demand from big whale gamblers and mom-and-pop mass punters.
The Chinese new year holiday which starts on Friday is expected to be very strong, Grant Bowie, chief executive of MGM China, the company's Macau unit, told a news conference.
""Based on the numbers we are seeing, the reservations we have got, it was very important for us to open before.""
MGM is one of six licensed casino operators in the special administrative region located on the heel of China's southern coast - the only place in the country where citizens are allowed to gamble legally.
But MGM's license is due to expire in 2020 along with SJM Holdings, while licenses for Sands China, Wynn Macau, Galaxy Entertainment and Melco Resorts are set to expire in 2022.
Macau authorities have provided little information about whether, and how, the licenses will be renewed.
Bowie said the opening was vital for the concession renewal process.
""Concession renewals will be determined on diversifying Macau into more than just a gaming town,"" he told a news conference.
Ahead of the expirations, operators including MGM have tried to diversify into non-gaming offerings to pacify Beijing which has been increasingly wary of Macau's acute reliance on gambling, which accounts for more than 80 percent of its revenues.
MGM Cotai will open with around 177 mass gaming tables, according to analysts, with VIP gaming mostly handled by middlemen junkets set to launch by the end of the second quarter along with the resort's luxury mansion villas.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Banks in the United Arab Emirates are hopeful of recovering some funds in 2018 from the multibillion-dollar collapse of Saudi Arabia's Saad Group and Ahmad Hamad al-Gosaibi & Bros Co (AHAB) nearly a decade ago, a senior banking official told Reuters.
The two conglomerates defaulted in 2009 in Saudi Arabia's biggest financial meltdown, leaving international and regional banks and other creditors owed about $22 billion.
After years of legal disputes and only gradual progress, efforts to resolve matters have gathered pace since the establishment of a tribunal in 2016 to deal with financial claims against AHAB and Saad Group.
“We are optimistic that we will get a resolution on this,” Abdulaziz al-Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation and chief executive of Dubai-based lender Mashreq, said in an interview.
“We have waited too long. Now there is a young leadership in Saudi Arabia and they want to finish this chapter.”
Most UAE banks owed money had received a final judgment on their claims from UAE courts, which they had submitted for approval by the three-judge tribunal based in Khobar within Saudi's Eastern Province, he said.
Mashreq, Emirates NBD and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank are the UAE banks with the largest claims against AHAB, according to sources familiar with the process, ranging from 1.25 billion riyals ($333.3 million) for Mashreq to 653.8 million riyals for Abu Dhabi Commercial.
Emirates Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD's Islamic arm, has a 76 million dirham claim against Saad Group, the sources said.
The banks declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
All the banks had fully provisioned against the debt and any money clawed back will contribute towards bank balance sheets, al-Ghurair said.
Profit growth for the UAE banking sector in 2018 will be about the same as last year's 6.5 percent, al-Ghurair said.
One potential cloud on the horizon is that problem loans for banks in the region are expected to edge higher in 2018 after sluggish economic activity in 2017, according to forecasts by Moody's.

The expense, which will be treated as an exceptional item, consists mainly of a non-cash charge on deferred taxes of $898 million and another charge on foreign tax credits of $834 million. 
However, the miner said that the lower corporate tax rate will benefit its U.S. attributable profit in the longer term. Its first-half results are due on Feb. 20.
In its second-quarter production report last month, BHP had hinted at a probable charge arising from the lowering of U.S. corporate taxes.
The U.S. House of Representatives in December approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.

Soon after, fellow Australian companies with U.S. exposure such as engineering firm WorleyParsons and education provider Navitas also flagged one-off charges in relation to the U.S. tax reform.

The Nikkei 225 rose 0.45% at the break following a long weekend. In Japan, producer prices showed a 0.3% gain on month, beating the 0.2% rise seen and a 2.7% rise on year as expected. Toyota slipped 0.63%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.62% after National Australia Bank said business conditions index rose in January at plus-19 index points for the month, above the long-run average of +5 index points.
In Greater China, the Shanghai Composite gained a strong 1.80% and the Hang Seng index edged up 2.18%. HSBC gained 0.5% and China Construction Bank rose 2.2%.
Overnight, Wall Street made a strong recovery as investors appeared to take advantage of cheaper stocks following last week’s slump.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 24,600.58. The S&P 500 closed 1.39% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6981, up 1.56%.
Financials rose sharply, lifting the broader indexes higher, amid expectations for tighter monetary policy and ongoing recovery in inflation.
Also supporting sentiment on US equities was a fall in volatility as measured by the so-called fear index VIX, which last week rose to its highest level since 2015 amid a surge in US bonds yields to four-year highs.
The rise in US bond yields was said by many to be one of the catalysts for the recent selloff, as higher bond yields are expected to go head-to-head with equities, competing for a larger chunk of investors’ portfolios.
UBS suggested, however, that equities have not yet peaked as bull markets typically end 3 to 12 months before the start of a recession, with the Federal funds rates at or near cycle peaks and the yield curve flat or inverted.
On the political front, investors cheered Monday’s release of the Budget and Infrastructure Plan from the White House. The infrastructure plan is widely expected to provide a fiscal lift to the US economy.
The infrastructure plan aims to spur $1.5 trillion in new investment by upgrading roads, airports and other public works. The plan also called for $50 billion to be invested in broadband, roads, power, and water projects.
The plan, however, is expected to meet resistance from both sides of the Congressional aisle as Republicans are wary of another big spending measure– after a $300 billion budget deal was signed last week – while Democrats claim the plan falls short of expectations concerning Federal funding.
The budget plan, meanwhile, forecasts the deficit for fiscal year 2019 to be $984 billion, an increase from the previously projected $526 billion.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 10:28PM ET</span>",Opioid makers paid millions to advocacy groups: U.S. Senate report,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Five opioid manufacturers including OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP have paid more than $10 million to advocacy groups and doctors tied to them, many of whom amplified industry messages supporting the use of the painkillers, a U.S. Senate report said on Monday.
The report, released by Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, said groups who received the donations aligned themselves with industry goals and may have played a role in an epidemic that in 2016 led to 42,000 opioid overdose deaths.
The report released by McCaskill, the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's ranking Democrat, said the groups issued guidance promoting opioids for chronic pain and lobbied against laws to curb their use.
""These financial relationships were insidious, lacked transparency, and are one of many factors that have resulted in arguably the most deadly drug epidemic in American history,"" McCaskill, of Missouri, said in a statement.
Purdue Pharma, which on Saturday announced it would stop promoting opioids to doctors, was the biggest donor, giving $4.15 million to 12 groups from 2012 to 2017, the report said.
The groups include patient advocacy organizations and medical professional societies.
One recipient was the Academy of Integrative Pain Management (AIPM), which partnered with another group to lobby state legislatures on opioid-related issues and fight efforts to restrict opioid prescribing, the report said.
Purdue said in a statement that it supported organizations interested in helping patients receive appropriate care. AIPM Executive Director Bob Twillman said that financial contributions had not influenced its positions.
The report said Insys Therapeutics Inc, which markets the fentanyl-based cancer pain drug Subsys, gave $3.15 million to U.S. Pain Foundation and others, ranking No. 2 in donations to the 14 groups examined.
Federal prosecutors have accused several former Insys executives and employees, including billionaire Insys founder John Kapoor, of engaging in a scheme to pay kickbacks to doctors to prescribe Subsys. Kapoor has pleaded not guilty.
U.S. Pain Foundation said the $2.5 million Insys donated in 2017 was for a fund to help cancer patients pay for pain drugs, and that the money did not influence its values. Insys said it strives to follow regulations.
The report said the groups also received $1.07 million from Depomed Inc, $465,142 from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and $20,250 from Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV.
Doctors affiliated with the organizations received $1.6 million, the report said.

Depomed said its contributions amounted to on average just about $20,000 a year for nine groups and said it believed it acted responsibly in marketing its drugs. J&J said it co-operated with McCaskill. Mylan emphasized its small opioid marketshare.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Drug company Innoviva settles with activist hedge fund Sarissa: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - U.S. respiratory drug company Innoviva Inc has reached a settlement with activist hedge fund Sarissa Capital Management LP to replace its board of directors and remove the threat of a new proxy contest, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The settlement comes just two months after a Delaware judge handed Sarissa a legal victory by installing two of the fund's nominees to Innoviva's board of directors. Sarissa had sued Innoviva, accusing it of backing out last April of a settlement that Sarissa agreed to end its previous proxy contest.
As part of the new settlement with Sarissa, Innoviva will accept three new independent directors to its board and dismiss five of its current directors at its next annual general meeting later this year, the three sources said. The resulting board will have five members, two of which will be Sarissa representatives, the sources added.
The new board members will include Sarissa's general counsel Mark DiPaolo, media consultant Jules Haimovitz and immunologist Sarah Schlesinger, the sources said. 
Innoviva will retain the board members added by Sarissa last year, namely investment banker George Bickerstaff and Sarissa Capital senior analyst Odysseas Kostas, they added. 
The sources asked not to be identified ahead of any official announcement. Sarissa declined to comment, while Innoviva, which has a market capitalization of about $1.6 billion, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sarissa, which owns an approximately 3 percent stake in Innoviva, has accused the company of spending too much money on executive pay and board compensation, given that its only function is to manage the asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease drug royalties it receives from GlaxoSmithKline Plc. GlaxoSmithKline is Innoviva's largest shareholder, with a 29.6 percent stake in the company.
Sarissa now plans to push for changes on how Innoviva spends money and consider moves such as share buybacks and dividend hikes, according to the sources. 
Sarissa has a track record of shaking up boards in the pharmaceutical industry. Its past targets have included Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc and Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc, a manufacturer of cancer drugs which sold itself to Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd last year for $5.2 billion. 
In its first brush with Sarissa, Innoviva told the fund last April it agreed to settle a challenge to its board just hours before a shareholder vote, only to back out after it found out that BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), one of its top investors that was supportive of Sarissa, switched sides and sided with the company, according to court documents. 
Delaware judge Joseph Slights ruled in December that Innoviva's ""opportunistic maneuvers"" to get out of the agreement with Sarissa offended ""basic notions of equity.""

The special committee of independent directors will also conduct a review of Wynn Resorts' internal policies and procedures on employee safety and workplace practices, it said.
The committee has retained Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP as outside counsel.
Steve Wynn resigned last week as CEO of Wynn Resorts following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances.

The board of Wynn Resorts has been sued by shareholders, claiming the board knew for years that Steve Wynn, founder and chief executive of the casino operator, had been accused of sexual misconduct and failed to investigate.

Shares advanced from Tokyo to Sydney and S&P 500 Index futures were little changed after the gauge posted its biggest two-day advance in 18 months. The 10-year Treasury yield was steady after falling back from touching 2.89 percent, and the dollar remained under pressure. South Africa’s rand dropped as President Jacob Zuma was said to refuse calls to step down. West Texas Intermediate oil remained under $60 a barrel.
The Cboe Volatility Index fell, but traders were still on edge following the tumultuous moves last week that wiped $2 trillion from U.S. stocks.
Still, some investors are waiting for another dip in the markets before stepping back in. AMP Capital Investors’ Nader Naeimi -- who in September had about 30 percent of holdings in cash -- said this is a short-term recovery and there will be another leg down in equities going into the Federal Reserve’s March policy meeting.
“The plan is to buy on the second leg down,” Naeimi, Head of Dynamic Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg TV. “Usually it’s best to wait for the market to build a base before committing heavily back into buying.”
The S&P 500 retook its 100-day moving average, a technical indicator that it crashed through last week.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson reversed his week-old cautious call, joining peers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). who have told clients to buy the dip.
With investors questioning the outlook for monetary policy, billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio said the risks of a recession in the next 18 to 24 months are rising and that bonds are past their peak. Dalio said the U.S. is further along in the business cycle than he thought and that it’s difficult to make a call on equities.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 09:07PM ET</span>",HNA unit to sell two Hong Kong sites to Henderson Land for $2 billion,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A unit of China's HNA Group [HNAIR.UL], the cash-starved aviation-to-financial services conglomerate, said on Tuesday it was selling two Hong Kong sites to Henderson Land Development Co Ltd (HK:0012) for HK$16 billion ($2 billion). 
Completion of the deal for the land at Kai Tak, near the territory's former airport, was expected to be completed on Feb. 14, Hong Kong International Construction Investment Management Group Co Ltd (HKICIM) (HK:0687) said in a statement to the stock exchange.
The sale would be conducted by two Cayman Island funds holding the rights to the sites, HKICIM said, in what is the latest in a series of measures taken by the Chinese conglomerate to address a liquidity crunch. 
It gave no further details.
HNA Holding Group, through its subsidiaries, had won tenders for the land in Kai Tak for about HK$14.2 billion in late 2016, a figure above market price. The sites were zoned for residential development. 
The Asian financial hub has one of the most expensive housing markets in the world, with private home prices shattering historic records for 13 months in a row and rising almost 200 percent since 2008.
The sale comes as HNA faces financing strains following a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years, which has sparked scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.
HNA has over the past few months focused on scaling back its offshore real estate investments, which Beijing has targeted with capital controls. 
Group CEO Adam Tan has said the company would not invest in areas that were not backed by the central government.

Late last month, HNA said it had reached a deal to sell a building in Sydney for A$205 million ($166 million).

961,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 08:32PM ET</span>","HNA Sells Hong Kong Land for $2 Billion, Disposals Speed Up","(Bloomberg) -- HNA Group Co. agreed to sell two plots of land in Hong Kong to the city’s second-richest man for HK$16 billion ($2 billion) as the cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate accelerates asset disposals to repay its mounting debt.
The sites, purchased just over a year ago, were sold to billionaire Lee Shau Kee’s Henderson Land Development Co., according to a statement Tuesday. HNA had spent about HK$14.2 billion on the two sites, according to records from Hong Kong’s land registry.
The disposal may help ease the financial strain HNA has been under after spending tens of billions of dollars on debt-fueled acquisitions to snap up assets including big stakes in  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. The group has told creditors it could have a liquidity shortfall of at least 15 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in the first quarter and that HNA is targeting about 100 billion yuan in asset sales during the first half, people familiar with the situation have said.
HNA bought four plots at the former Kai Tak airport for a total HK$27.2 billion between November 2016 and March last year, outbidding local developers for sites that were among the most hotly contested during that period. The sale to Henderson is expected to close Feb. 14, according to the statement.
Other Sales
Separately, HNA has held preliminary talks with investors including Brookfield Asset Management Inc. about selling a pair of office buildings in London’s Canary Wharf district, according to people with knowledge of the matter. In the U.S., the Chinese conglomerate is selling properties valued at about $4 billion -- including the 245 Park Ave. skyscraper it bought less than a year ago for one of the highest prices ever paid for a building in New York -- according to a marketing document seen by Bloomberg. In late January, HNA agreed to sell a Sydney office building to Blackstone (NYSE:BX) for A$205 million ($161 million).

Still, HNA, which doesn’t earn enough profits to cover its interest payments, has been facing increasing skepticism from bond investors whether asset sales and lender lifelines will be enough to help the conglomerate roll over borrowings.
The yield on HNA’s yuan-denominated bond due in 2019 has almost doubled this year to 14.2 percent, according to exchange data. That’s about three times higher than the average yield on other notes with similar AAA local ratings, and twice that on securities with credit scores considered junk in China.
“With investor risk appetites more subdued in the wake of rising rates and widening credit spreads, it is difficult to envision HNA and its subsidiaries being able to tap either the onshore or offshore bond markets over the near future,” said Todd Schubert, head of fixed-income research at Bank of Singapore Ltd.
HNA, one of the most prolific Chinese buyers of foreign assets until the government started frowning on capital outflows, isn’t alone in feeling the heat. Blackstone Group LP has held initial discussions about bidding for Anbang Insurance Group Co. assets -- including New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel -- in a sale overseen by the Chinese government, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
Elsewhere, billionaire Wang Jianlin, whose group controls AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and was once China’s richest man, is retreating from previous ambitions to build an entertainment empire that could challenge Walt Disney Co.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A female executive at billionaire Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management LP on Monday filed a lawsuit accusing the firm of operating as a ""boys' club"" that subjects women to a openly hostile working environment and pays them less than men.
Lauren Bonner, an associate director, said a ""structural sexism"" pervades Point72, where women are denigrated by even high-level employees, including a top executive who declares ""no girls allowed"" in advance of some meetings.
Cohen was not accused of inappropriate behavior.
Bonner is seeking a variety of damages and an injunction against further discrimination in her lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan against Point72, Cohen and the firm's president, Douglas Haynes.
""The firm emphatically denies these allegations and will defend itself in a more appropriate venue than the media,"" Point72, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a statement.
""We stand by our record of hiring and developing women,"" Point72 added. ""In an industry where women are historically under-represented, the hundreds of women at Point72 are vital members of every part of our organization.""
Cohen has been trying to rebuild his reputation and attract money from investors after his former hedge fund firm, SAC Capital Advisors LP, pleaded guilty in an unrelated insider trading case in 2014. 
Cohen was not charged by authorities in that case, but accepted a two-year ban from managing public money that expired six weeks ago. Point72 managed his personal fortune during the ban.
Bonner is represented by the Wigdor law firm, which also represents plaintiffs in several sexual harassment and employment-related lawsuits against Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) and Fox News.
According to the complaint by Bonner, a New York resident who joined Point72 in August 2016, only one of the firm's 125 portfolio managers and one of its roughly 30 managing directors is a woman, while its hiring committee is exclusively male.
She also said that while she could earn up to $525,000 in salary and bonus this year, men often earn two or three times as much as their female counterparts.
Bonner also objected to Point72's alleged ""sexist and misogynist treatment"" of women, citing as an example a whiteboard in Haynes' office that contained the word ""pussy"" for several weeks.
""Female employees were humiliated and ashamed as they were forced to work and participate in meetings held in Haynes's office, including with other male executives, as the Pussy Board drifted above them, taunting them with repulsive references to their own bodies,"" she said.

The case is Bonner v Point72 Asset Management LP et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01233.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Ex-Nomura trader must face SEC charges over bond price lies: judge,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may pursue its civil lawsuit accusing a former senior trader at Nomura Holdings Inc of lying to customers about bond prices in order to boost profit and his bonus, a federal judge ruled on Monday.
U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan refused to dismiss SEC claims that James Im tried to overcharge customers on bonds, by using such tactics as inflating the prices Nomura paid, understating Nomura's profit on trades and making up conversations in order to close sales.
Oetken rejected the idea that Im, who was co-head of Nomura's commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) desk before leaving the bank in December 2014, was, as the judge put it, ""just a salesman haggling for a good deal.""
Matthew Ingber, a lawyer for Im, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Im is one of at least 11 individuals, including six from Nomura, to face civil or criminal charges in a more than five-year federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading practices.
Another former co-head of Nomura's CMBS trading desk, Kee Chan, settled with the SEC in May.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Benjamin Solomon, a former head trader on that bank's CMBS desk, settled separate SEC charges over bond prices on Monday.
Oetken said Im had made a ""fairly strong"" argument that the fact he told a counterparty about his alleged misstatements showed that his practice was commonplace and not fraudulent.
But the judge said the SEC offered ""strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness,"" pointing to an alleged electronic conversation that Im had, after lying to a customer about prices, with a trader who had sold him the bonds.
Im: he paid 78-24
Seller: per (f)ect
Im: i told him i [bought] at 78-8 actually
Im: sshhhhh
Im: :-)
Seller: ha
Seller: nice one.
The case is SEC v Im, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-03613.

LONDON (Reuters) - KPMG and other leading accountancy firms face serious questions over their work with failed construction firm  Carillion  (L:CLLN) after making millions of pounds out of their relationships with the company, British lawmakers said on Tuesday.
Lawmakers from two parliamentary committees examining the collapse of Carillion said that KPMG had earned 29.4 million pounds ($41 million) from auditing the contractor's accounts since the company was founded in 1999. 
The firm signed off on Carillion's 2016 accounts, shortly before the construction and outsourcing company announced a string of profit warnings. Carillion collapsed last month with debts of over 2 billion pounds.
""KPMG has serious questions to answer about the collapse of Carillion. Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgment was clouded by its cozy relationship with the company and the multi-million pound fees it received,"" said Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee.
""KPMG should, as a bare minimum, review its processes and explain what went wrong.""
KPMG said it would assist the inquiry into the failure of Carillion, and will be questioned by the lawmakers on Feb. 22. 
""We are committed to building public trust in audit. We take the questions that have been asked of our profession in recent weeks very seriously and we welcome the opportunity to appear before the joint committee,"" KPMG said in a statement.
Lawmakers published responses from the ""Big Four"" accountancy firms to inquiries on their involvement with Carillion on Tuesday, saying that PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY had earned 71 million pounds since 2008 on work related to the firm.
Labour lawmaker Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee, said it was ""telling"" that PwC was appointed to liquidate the firm, as the other three firms would have had immediate conflicts of interest.
""All of them did extensive – and expensive – work for Carillion,"" he said. ""The image of these companies feasting on what was soon to become a carcass will not be lost on decent citizens.""

That is the read of stock market strategists and other market watchers looking at past pullbacks of at least 10 percent on the S&P 500 (SPX) and whether the benchmark index is likely to extend its decline to 20 percent, or bear market territory.
The S&P confirmed it had entered correction territory last Thursday, when it closed down 10.2 percent from its Jan. 26 high. Stocks have rebounded sharply in the two sessions since then, posting their biggest two-day percentage gain since June 2016 and cutting the decline to 7.6 percent as of Monday close. 
While not discounting the possibility that stocks could renew their slide, market strategists said the shaky economic conditions that tend to presage a bear market were absent.
""We just don't see a bear market starting with the economy as strong as it is,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""You rarely see bear markets during a non-recessionary environment.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) tallied 11 pullbacks of at least 10 percent since 1976 that did not occur around a recession. Only one of those, in 1987, turned into a bear market.
A bear market would mean the S&P 500 falls below 2,300, from its current level of around 2,660, ""which history suggests is unlikely to occur without a recession,"" Goldman Sachs equity strategists said in a research note.
While a recession - a period of significant decline in economic activity - is not determined until after it occurs, market watchers cite indicators that the economy is still doing well.
For example, S&P 500 profits are expected to rise 18.8 percent in 2018, a bigger increase than the 12 percent projected at the start of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""You never know, but just the fact that earnings are expanding as strong as they are, (indicates) in our opinion very little chance of a recession over the next 12 months,"" Detrick said.
Another key recession indicator, the Treasury yield curve, is also not flashing a warning sign, said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Boston. The longer-term 10-year Treasury note is 128 basis points above the short-term 3-month bill, wider than the 102 basis points at the close of 2017.
Investors see such a steepening yield curve as a sign of economic strength, while flat or inverted is seen as a harbinger of recession. 
Indeed, the speed of the latest selloff - which only took 13 calendar days from peak to a 10 percent decline - could indicate a quicker than usual rebound. 
CFRA Research looked at 21 corrections that did not result in bear markets in the past 70 years. Using their median timelines, those corrections took 98 days generally to reach bottoms, and 84 days to recover to their prior peaks. 
The faster corrections, which took 38 days to reach bottom generally, recovered in 71 days.
""Corrections that develop over a very short time frame tend to bottom more quickly and recover more rapidly than your garden variety correction,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
In the 11 non-recession corrections since 1976, the S&P 500 typically declined by 15 percent, according to Goldman Sachs. But, Goldman said, an investor who bought the S&P 500 10 percent below its peak without waiting for a bottom ""would have experienced median 3-, 6-, and 12-month returns of 6 percent, 12 percent, and 18 percent.""
Comparing this correction to past ones may hold limited insight. The year leading up to the selloff was unusually tranquil in the markets, with 2017 holding the fewest 1 percent daily swings since 1965, according to LPL.
In 1987, the Black Monday stock market crash was attributed in part to the unintended consequences of programmed trading and market hedges. Similarly, in the latest selloff some investors have voiced concerns about the market being caught off guard by the sudden unwinding of bets against market volatility, and that the ramifications of that may still be playing out.
""Where we could be wrong is if it is something like 1987 where this is a complete disconnect from the fundamentals and is something technical and an imbalance within the market itself,"" Kleintop said. 

""It doesn't look like that's the case, but it's hard to know where all the bodies are buried when it comes to this short volatility trade.""

The FTC said that Benco Dental Supply,  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC) and Patterson Companies (O:PDCO) had conspired to refuse to serve or give discounts to dental buying groups.
The three companies sell more than 85 percent of the $10 billion in gloves, cements, chairs and other products that U.S. dentists purchase each year, the FTC said.
Buying groups representing small dental practices had asked the big dental product suppliers to aggregate sales to them and to negotiate prices, the FTC said.
Benco and Henry Schein initially entered into an agreement to refuse to compete for the buying groups' business, and Patterson joined later. Benco invited a fourth group, Burkhart Dental Supply, to join but was rebuffed, the FTC said.
""The complaint details communications between executives of the two companies evidencing the agreement, as well as attempts to monitor and ensure compliance with the agreement,"" the FTC said in a statement. 
A complaint was filed with an FTC internal court, with a trial set to begin on Oct. 12.
Attempts to reach spokespeople for the three companies were not immediately successful.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 06:03PM ET</span>",Weinstein Co deal should include more funds for victims: New York AG,"By Karen Freifeld and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's attorney general said on Monday a deal for the Weinstein Company should include a bigger compensation fund for victims of ex-chairman Harvey Weinstein, speaking a day after the state's lawsuit scuttled a deal. 
The film and TV studio was close to inking a deal on Sunday to sell itself for more than $500 million to an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, a former official in President Barack Obama's administration, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a civil rights lawsuit against the company. People familiar with the matter said the lawsuit put sale negotiations on hold.
Schneiderman said he wants the ""facts of our complaint factored into whatever deal is structured going forward."" The lawsuit does not block the sale but creates liabilities that make it difficult to finalize. A sale to Contreras-Sweet is now unlikely to advance, sources told Reuters.
The Weinstein Company did not immediately return a request for comment. A representative for Contreras-Sweet declined to comment.
The Weinstein Company has been seeking a deal that would spare it from bankruptcy after more than 70 women accused Harvey Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.
Schneiderman said at a press conference on Monday that he wanted to ensure a dedicated victim's compensation fund that would not be gobbled up by legal fees and other expenses. Contreras-Sweet had proposed about $30 million for victims in her initial bid made late last year, Reuters reported. (http://reut.rs/2iAmw2O)
A sale should also not reward executives including Chief Operating Officer David Glasser, who supervised the human resources department and was in charge of handling dozens of complaints, Schneiderman said. Contreras-Sweet's offer called for Glasser to be the CEO of the new company, Schneiderman said.
The company never launched an investigation into any of the complaints, he said. The lawsuit says that the Weinstein Company's board and executives failed to take action after receiving complaints about harassment and discrimination from employees.
""The Weinstein Company repeatedly broke the law,"" Schneiderman said on Monday. ""It is clear to us that the company’s management was complicit. Not only did they fail to stop it, they enabled it and covered it up.""
Other bidders for The Weinstein Company have included  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp  (N:LGFa) and production company Killer Content Inc. Killer Content said in January that bankruptcy may be the best option for The Weinstein Company.
The New York Times first reported in October on multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

Since then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement has emerged of victims using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 05:56PM ET</span>",Share buybacks could add fuel to Wall Street rebound,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Companies snapping up their own shares might provide additional fuel for the U.S. stock market to rebound in coming weeks following a wave of strong quarterly earnings reports and tax cuts that have left more cash on balance sheets.
Wall Street's slump last week, which confirmed it was in correction territory from record highs in late January, came as many companies temporarily scaled back their share buyback programs before reporting their quarterly results, a factor that may have exacerbated the drop, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent research note. 
The S&P 500 on Monday jumped 1.39 percent, up for a second straight session and giving Wall Street a boost of confidence following it worst week in two years.
With most U.S. corporations now having provided their reports, and with overall earnings for the fourth quarter beatings analysts' expectations, companies resuming or increasing their share purchases might give the market more stability.
Modern IR, which provides data analytics to help companies manage their share buybacks, in recent days has seen many of its clients step up repurchases of their shares. 
""There are big names that we support who have been active with buybacks post results,"" said Modern IR President Tim Quast. ""With the market having dropped sharply, it's a pretty good use of cash.""
To reward shareholders, companies often buy back shares through long-term plans. 
CSX Corp's (O:CSX) stock jumped 4.5 percent on Monday after the U.S. railroad hiked its dividend and increased its share buyback plan for the next year to $5 billion.
Some companies also buy back shares tactically, with chief financial officers weighing in on changes in share prices. Companies typically suspend those kinds of buybacks ahead of quarterly reports in order to avoid illegal insider trading.
""What we saw last week was a lack of a bid in the market, and maybe part of the problem was a lack of buybacks,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""If you're seeing buybacks in the market, that tends to be bullish."" 
Following deep corporate tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump in December, U.S. companies in recent weeks have boosted their earnings forecasts, and many have said they would increase investments and give more money back to shareholders.
Two thirds of the way through reporting season, S&P 500 companies' fourth-quarter earnings have jumped 14.8 percent compared to the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Still, in recent weeks, companies that typically buy back a lot of their shares have not outperformed the market. The S&P 500 Buyback index <.SPBUYUP> which tracks stocks with the highest buyback ratios, fell 8.8 percent from Jan. 26 through last Friday, the same as the broader S&P 500 (SPX).

""What we know is that available cash is higher. What we believe is that it's going to be used for a combination of things: share repurchases, dividend increases, some capex and M&A, and all of those are positive,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.

Tibor Klein, 44, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Joan Azrack in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, according to federal prosecutors. He had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud last July.
""While Mr. Klein's conduct was indeed serious, in light of a number of related factors, we are disappointed by the sentence of incarceration,"" his lawyer Christopher Bruno said in an email.
Klein, the founder of Valley Stream-based Klein Financial Services, was also sentenced to six months of house arrest and 250 hours of community service, and ordered to forfeit $37,225 and pay a $20,000 fine, according to prosecutors.
The government said Klein was tipped about New York-based Pfizer's Oct. 2010 takeover of King by Robert Schulman, then a partner at the Hunton & Williams law firm in Washington, D.C., who had represented King in patent litigation since 2009.
Klein then bought King securities for himself, Schulman and clients, and passed the tip to his friend Michael Shechtman, a Florida stockbroker, resulting in more than $400,000 of overall illegal profit, prosecutors said.
Schulman, of McLean, Virginia, was convicted of insider trading last March by a Brooklyn federal jury. He had been a partner at the Arent Fox law firm in Washington, D.C. at the time of his arrest, and was later put on leave.
Shechtman, a former Ameriprise Financial Inc (N:AMP) stockbroker, pleaded guilty in Brooklyn in November 2014 to conspiracy, and has cooperated with prosecutors. He has not been sentenced.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against Klein and Shechtman in September 2013. That case was put on hold until the criminal case was resolved.
Although the SEC did not sue Schulman, it alleged that he had become intoxicated on several glasses of wine while dining at home with his wife and Klein in August 2010, and blurted out: ""It would be nice to be King for a day.""

Klein took the hint and bought 60,600 King shares, including 800 for himself and 3,000 for Schulman, on the next trading day, the SEC said.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 05:26PM ET</span>",Antidote to financial infidelity is honesty,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you think infidelity only occurs between the sheets, think again.
It can also occur via secret purchases, hidden accounts, and surreptitiously withdrawn savings. Experts call it ""financial infidelity,"" and it basically covers any monetary activity that partners hide from each other.
Among couples who have combined finances, more than two in five people admit to hiding cash or bills or purchases, or outright lying about earnings and debt, according to new survey data from the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE).
Virtually the same number of respondents, 40 percent, say their partner has done the same to them - that they know of.
The problem appears to be getting worse. “We have been doing this poll for 10 years, and the numbers have increased as long as we have been tracking it,” said Paul Golden, spokesman for Denver-based NEFE. “When we started, the percentage of partners doing this was in the low 30s, and now it is over 40.”
It even happens to financial experts. “Assets were hidden, things were offshore, accounts were in other people’s names. To this day, I still don’t know where half the money was,” said Cary Carbonaro, managing director of New York-based United Capital, of her relationship with her ex-husband. 
And lest you think financial infidelity is a relatively harmless indiscretion: In Carbonaro’s case, it led to divorce, and four years of messy wrangling in the courts.
Whether you are dealing with a little white lie about a pair of shoes or a huge whopper like a hidden account in the Cayman Islands, you need to confront it head-on. Here are some ways to get started: 
* Have the talk. 
There is no getting around the fact that honesty is really the only way forward. It will be awkward at first, but come clean to your partner, talk honestly about the emotions that drove the behavior – like shame or embarrassment, which happen to all of us – and work together on solutions.
If a one-on-one talk is not ideal – perhaps because of issues of intimidation or control in the relationship – then consider having a third party mediate the topic, such as a marital therapist or a financial planner.
* Set guidelines. 
Very often, the reason for financial secrecy is that people just are not quite sure what their partner will think of a purchase. So instead of bringing it up, they just stay quiet. And then little lies turn into bigger ones.
A helpful fix is to mutually set a particular dollar amount – say, $100 – below which you do not have to clear anything with your partner. Above that (or whatever amount you agree on), you have to talk about it, to ensure the family budget is not unilaterally being busted.
Without guideposts in place, overspending could easily run wild. “We had a friend who lived very high on the hog, enjoying all manner of luxuries - even considering a heliport at his second home to get there sooner,” says Leon LaBrecque, a financial planner in Troy, Michigan. “He died prematurely, and left a colossal pile of debt and tax bills.”
* Take it seriously. 
When confronted with financial infidelity, the partner at fault might just try to brush it off. Wrong approach.
In the NEFE survey, 75 percent of people said financial infidelity impacted the relationship – leading to arguments, eroding trust, even sparking separation or divorce.
On the plus side, some respondents said that grappling with financial infidelity actually made their relationship better in the long run. As the saying goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant. So aim for that.
“That’s the silver living of all this,” says NEFE's Golden. “If it occurs, then at least you can start having these important conversations.”

987,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 05:26PM ET</span>","Rattled by U.S. fiscal, monetary tug-of-war, investors start looking abroad","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The worst week in the U.S. stock market in two years and benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hitting four-year highs are prompting fund managers to rethink their allocation plans.
Among their new plays: international bonds, emerging market stocks, and cash. All look poised to gain as investors assess the consequences of more U.S. fiscal stimulus just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.
""This is unchartered territory,"" said Kirk Hartman, global chief investment officer at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management.
The turmoil stems from a tug-of-war between monetary and fiscal policies: The Federal Reserve, which is mandated to keep inflation low and stable, and U.S. fiscal policy, which is adding stimulus with a $1.5 trillion Republican-led tax cut and an extra $300 billion over two years in federal spending as the central bank unloads bonds from its balance sheets.
New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said on Thursday that the central bank may raise interest rates more than three times this year if the U.S. economy continues to expand thanks to ""a very large tax cut that's going to provide additional stimulus."" 
Underlying the push outside of U.S. assets is a fear of rising inflation, after years of ultra-loose monetary policy. 
Wages rose in January at an annual pace of 2.9 percent, the largest increase since 2009, prompting investors to begin to price in the chance that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates at least three times this year. 
That could push the benchmark 10-year Treasury rate, which sets borrowing costs for loans ranging from autos to mortgages, up to near 4 percent, a level that economists say would dampen economic growth. ""We are very conservative today on both stocks and bonds and waiting for better opportunities,"" said Matt Watson, a portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund who has been increasing his cash position.
Overall, U.S. fund investors sold $23.9 billion out of the stock market during the week that ended on Wednesday, the largest withdrawal on record, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
U.S.-based inflation-protected bond funds attracted $859 million in the same week, the largest inflows since November 2016, while emerging market stocks brought in $291 million, continuing a streak of positive weekly inflows since the start of the year. 
""The risk now is that inflation will rise more sharply, as a result of even looser fiscal policy,"" said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics. 
LOOKING FOR PLACES TO HIDE
Few fund managers expect the U.S. stock market to fall into a bear market and the sharp falls are not expected to have any immediate impact on the economy, although they pose a ""modest risk to global growth,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said. 
The benchmark S&P 500 rose about 1.8 percent in afternoon trading on Monday, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury nudged higher to 2.86 percent. 
""Our view is that the Fed may be on a path to raising interest rates four times in 2019, which means a 10-year Treasury with a yield north of 4 percent becomes a reality and you get a negative feedback loop into equity valuations,"" said Chris Dillon, a fixed-income portfolio specialist at T. Rowe Price. 
As a result, Dillon has been moving out of U.S. bonds overall and into unhedged international bonds, he said. 
""We feel like the diversification of monetary policy cycles is something to bake into our portfolios now” after years of coordinated central bank stimulus following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, he said. 
Other fund managers are holding more cash due to rising rates. 
With the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England all expected to reduce monetary stimulus this year, there will be less demand for fixed income, potentially pushing yields higher, said Gene Tannuzzo, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle. 
""Higher inflation, larger deficits and fewer net buyers is an ugly combination,"" he said. 
He has been reducing his holdings of investment-grade U.S. bonds and holding that in cash. ""I think at the end of the day cash is not the worst place to be when it's not clear you are getting huge pickup by going into significantly riskier investments,"" he said.
U.S. market volatility has bled into other markets, leaving most world equity markets down for the year to date, apart from a few emerging markets. Benchmark indices in Brazil, Russia and Thailand are up 2.5 percent or more, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P 500 is down around 1.5 percent over the same time.

Catherine LeGraw from GMO's Asset Allocation team said her firm forecasts emerging market value stocks will gain about 6 percent annualized after inflation over the next seven years, a gain that ""no other asset class comes close to matching.""

988,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 04:49PM ET</span>",Wall Street bounces back after tumultuous week,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes rebounded on Monday with broad-based gains as investors regained some confidence after U.S. equities' biggest weekly drop in two years, but strategists stopped short of calling an end to the market pullback.
The announcement of President Donald Trump's budget, including an infrastructure spending plan, helped sectors such as S&P materials and industrials.
But the bigger factor was likely the S&P's test and rebound from a key technical level on Friday when it briefly fell 11.8 percent from its Jan. 26 record and below its 200-day moving average during that session, according to strategists.
""Investors probably were mulling things over the weekend and concluded that the economy is fairly strong, earnings are holding up, so there’s no particular reason to panic or sell. So some money probably came back into the market,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 410.37 points, or 1.7 percent, to 24,601.27, the S&P 500 gained 36.45 points, or 1.39 percent, to 2,656 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.47 points, or 1.56 percent, to 6,981.96.
Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York, said Monday's move showed ""big, fast, money saying, 'Wait a second, buy this dip.'""
""You test the key support level and go back and test it again, which is what we did on Friday,"" he said. 
But while last week's panic selling appeared to be done, strategists were not calling an end to the pullback. The S&P still closed 7.6 percent below its Jan. 26 record closing high. It confirmed a correction on Thursday, when it dropped 10 percent below the record. 
Jeff Schulze, investment strategist, at Clearbridge Investments, in New York is expecting more volatility ""as the tug-of-war from short-term negative price momentum is put up against the long-term fundamentals."" 
He said ""the long-term fundamentals will win out, but I think volatility will also be part of that equation.”
All the S&P 500's major 11 sectors rose, though bond-proxy sectors real estate, utilities and telecommunications services underperformed as investors monitored rising interest rates after U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit a new four-year high of 2.902 earlier in the day.
The S&P materials sector was the biggest percentage gainer with a 2.1 percent rise followed by a 1.8 percent gain in information technology
Stocks were helped a little by Trump's budget proposal for fiscal 2019, which includes $200 billion for infrastructure spending, more than $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, as well as $716 billion for military programs, including the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, ended down 3.45 points at 25.61, its lowest close since Feb. 2.
The market took fright after strong wage-growth data on Feb. 2 raised the specter of rising inflation and fears of accelerated interest rate hikes, which ignited a rally in bond yields and a sell-off in stocks.
The S&P's biggest boosts from single stocks came from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which rose 4 percent, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which ended up 3.5 percent. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 43 new lows. 

About 8.13 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 8.5 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

UK Consumer, Wholesale Inflation 
GBP/USD could be the ‘one to watch’ in Tuesday’s session as the consumer price index is expected to have slowed to 2.9% while the producer price index is expected to show input costs rose 0.7%, faster than 0.1% increase reported in the previous month.
The pair of inflation reports comes as the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged last week but signalled it may need to raise rates earlier than expected to curb the rapid pace of inflation.
Bank of England's Vlieghe said Monday a stronger world economy and labour market tightness points to further rate increases.
API Invenotry Report, IEA Monthly Report
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 1.05 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 9.
The International Energy Agency’s monthly report is also expected to be closely watched for clues on global oil demand growth and supply estimates.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Monday in the wake their 9% drop last week which followed concerns over rising US output.
PepsiCo Reports Q4 Earnings 
PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) is expected to release fourth quarter earnings before US markets open Tuesday. Analysts expect the company to report a similar performance as reported in the third quarter, when falling revenues from carbonated drinks in the US – which account for 31% of total revenues – was offset by solid revenue gains in snacks and emerging markets.
PepsiCo’s weakness in carbonated drinks comes amid the ‘health and wellness’ trend which has led consumers away from carbonated drinks toward healthier alternatives.
Analysts expect PepsiCo to deliver earnings per share and revenue of $1.30 and $19.41 billion, respectively."

1022,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Dow Jones Bags 400 Points as Volatility Cools,"Investing.com – Wall Street made a strong recovery as investors appeared to take advantage of cheaper stocks following last week’s slump. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 24,600.58. The S&P 500 closed 1.39% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6981, up 1.56%.
Financials rose sharply, lifting the broader indexes higher, amid expectations for tighter monetary policy and ongoing recovery in inflation.
Also supporting sentiment on US equities was a fall in volatility as measured by the so-called fear index VIX, which last week rose to its highest level since 2015 amid a surge in  US bonds yields to four-year highs. 
The rise in US bond yields was said by many to be one of the catalysts for the recent selloff, as higher bond yields are expected to go head-to-head with equities, competing for a larger chunk of investors’ portfolios.
UBS suggested, however, that equities have not yet peaked as bull markets typically end 3 to 12 months before the start of a recession, with the Federal funds rates at or near cycle peaks and the yield curve flat or inverted. 
On the political front, investors cheered Monday’s release of the Budget and Infrastructure Plan from the White House. The infrastructure plan is widely expected to provide a fiscal lift to the US economy. 
The infrastructure plan aims to spur $1.5 trillion in new investment by upgrading roads, airports and other public works. The plan also called for $50 billion to be invested in broadband, roads, power, and water projects. 
The plan, however, is expected to meet resistance from both sides of the Congressional aisle as Republicans are wary of another big spending measure– after a $300 billion budget deal was signed last week – while Democrats claim the plan falls short of expectations concerning Federal funding. 
The budget plan, meanwhile, forecasts the deficit for fiscal year 2019 to be $984 billion, an increase from the previously projected $526 billion.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Volkswagen Chairman sees no reason to question CEO position,"LINZ, Austria (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said on Monday there is no reason to question the position of the carmaker's top executive.
Sources close to the top management of Europe's largest automaker have told Reuters that Chief Executive Matthias Mueller was growing frustrated by a lack of support for his reform efforts and by the company's inability to draw a line under its emissions scandal.
But Poetsch sought to stifle any speculation about Mueller potentially growing weary of office. The contract of the 64-year-old Mueller, who took the reins at Volkswagen (VW) a week after the ""dieselgate"" scandal was revealed, will expire in 2020.
""Now is not the right occasion to say something about this,"" Poetsch told reporters late on Monday at a business event in Linz, Austria. ""I believe there is also no background to this.""
VW has struggled to rebuild its reputation after admitting in 2015 that it had cheated exhaust emissions tests, a task that was made harder by revelations earlier this year about how the carmaker exposed monkeys to toxic exhaust fumes. 
Nearly two-and-a-half years after the ""dieselgate"" scandal, VW is grappling with investigations and lawsuits around the world and about $30 billion in fines and costs for the fraud just as it pushes a multi-billion strategic shift to electric and self-driving cars.
Despite the challenges, VW seems to be succeeding in putting the scandal behind it as far as the consumer market is concerned.
Sales of the core VW brand set a new record at 6.23 million cars last year and VW said earlier on Monday that its deliveries jumped 7.1 percent in January.
""It has become clear meanwhile that the company is on a very successful path operationally,"" said Poetsch, VW's former long-time finance chief. VW is expected to release core 2017 financial results later this month.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Lessons from the U.S. stock rout: options hedging pays,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Months of subdued U.S. stock market gyrations seemed to relegate options hedging into a futile and expensive trade, but last week's huge spike in equity market turbulence quickly reminded investors of the virtues of defensive options.
Last week, forward-looking measures of volatility soared as the S&P 500 Index (SPX) tumbled over 5 percent.
The spike in volatility meant that a mysterious U.S. equity option trader, dubbed ""50 cent,"" who spent millions on a recurring Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) options hedge over the last year, saw the position finally pay up.
VIX options are primarily used to protect against a stock market pullback.
""The persistent buyer of VIX call options that we have been tracking finally made money – and how!,"" Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors in New York, said in a note. 
The spike in volatility meant that ""50 cent,"" so called because of a tendency to pay a fixed price of 50 cents for blocks of VIX call options, made about $400 million mark-to-market this month, according Chintawongvanich.
Chintawongvanich estimated that the trader, who had been employing this rolling hedge since at least January 2017, made a total profit of about $183 million on the options position, as of Friday.
The trader likely took significant losses elsewhere, since the VIX options position was probably a hedge against potential losses in a much larger portfolio, rather than a naked bet on higher volatility.
It was not immediately clear whether ""50 cent"" had closed the options position to monetize the gains.
Another anonymous trader whose position was large enough to earn the nicknames the ""VIX elephant"" and the ""VIX whale,"" closed out a recurring position of more than a million VIX options.
Taking into account the rolling position initiated in July, the trader is up roughly $40 million on the VIX options position, Chintawongvanich estimates.
Still, traders were not rushing to load up on options hedges.
Open positions on the options on popular hedging vehicles SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY) and S&P 500 Index (SPX), on Monday, show traders' preference for protective puts at multi-month lows, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data.

""There are many signs of complacency amidst this shock,"" Jim Strugger, derivatives strategist at MKM Partners in New York, said in a note.

1025,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>","Treasury Yields Will Climb to 3.5% on Fed, Goldman Asset Says","(Bloomberg) -- Treasury 10-year yields will rise as high as 3.5 percent in the next six months as the market prices in a steeper pace of Federal Reserve tightening, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management.
The U.S. central bank will probably raise interest rates four times this year, defying the consensus for around three, said Philip Moffitt, Asia-Pacific head of fixed income in Sydney at the firm, which oversees more than $1 trillion. Yields will also increase as the Fed trims the holdings of Treasuries it purchased through quantitative easing, he said.
“As QE gets tapered through this year and into next year, we’ve got a big swing in the supply duration coming,” Moffitt said in an interview. “It’s going to put upward pressure on yields. I would think that 3.5 percent is not a very brave forecast.”
The U.S. 10-year yield jumped to a four-year high of 2.88 percent last week on signs inflation is quickening and amid uncertainty about the path of Fed tightening under new Chairman Jerome Powell. The surge in yields contributed to a selloff in global equities last week as investors reassessed the value of stocks.
Traders are pricing in between two and three hikes in 2018, according to interest-rate swaps, while the median projection from central bank officials is for three. Four hikes are possible if the economic outlook keeps improving, New York Fed President William Dudley said last week.
The 10-year yield will rise to 2.95 percent by the end of September, according to the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The yield will only reach 3.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020, the surveys show.
Turning Point
Monetary policies in the major developed economies are at a turning point after years of record accommodation that aimed to boost growth and inflation in the wake of the global financial crisis. The process of unwinding is seen increasing uncertainty in financial markets after years of shrinking volatility.
While pension funds are likely to seek longer-maturity bonds to boost duration, yields will still rise as the Fed trims its debt holdings, Moffitt said.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury Note Volatility Index, known as TYVIX, jumped to the highest since April last week. Average hourly earnings rose at the fastest pace since 2009 in January, fueling concern the Fed will be more aggressive in combating inflation, a Feb. 2 report showed.
Yields will probably rise to 3 percent to 3.50 percent in the next two quarters, Moffitt said. “Our portfolios are positioned for that so we’d short Treasuries to try to take advantage of rising yields,” he said.
Aberdeen’s View
U.S. 10-year yields are set to be anchored around 2.75 percent to 2.80 percent in the very short term on concern further Fed rate increases will harm the economy, according to Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Yields will only break and stay above 3 percent toward the end of 2018 as the Fed tightens policy further, said Adam McCabe, head of Asian fixed income in Singapore.
“The volatility that we’re experiencing in the market place at the moment is this tug-of-war between those who fear that tighter monetary policy will derail the economic activity, and those who say that tighter monetary policy’s playing catching up to stronger economic activity,” he said. If the Fed gets to four hikes this year, “it’s hard to see U.S. Treasuries without a 3 percent handle,” he said."

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 02:36PM ET</span>","Ford expands 'Do Not Drive' warning to 33,000 more pickup trucks","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Monday warned an additional 33,000 owners of older pickup trucks in North America to stop driving them until potentially defective Takata Corp air bag inflators can be repaired.
In January, Ford told 2,900 owners of model year 2006 Ford Ranger trucks to stop driving immediately after a second death was linked to inflators built on the same day.
The expanded warning was prompted by additional testing, Ford, the second largest U.S. automaker, said in a statement, and now covers a broader time frame of production.
Mazda Motor Corp said it was issuing a similar expansion for about 1,800 2006 Mazda B-Series trucks that were built by Ford after it had issued a warning for 160 trucks in January.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the vehicles pose ""an immediate risk to safety"" and urged owners to immediately schedule a free repair.
Ford and Mazda have replacement air bag inflators available now and will tow vehicles to a dealership for repairs as well as provide loaner vehicles free of charge, the companies and NHTSA said. About 90 percent of the vehicles subject to the ""Do Not Drive"" warning are in the United States.
Two U.S. senators in January questioned why Ford’s warning only applied to a small number of the 391,000 2004-2006 Ranger trucks recalled because of Takata air bags in 2016 in the United States.
Ford said last month the death in a July 2017 crash in West Virginia in a 2006 Ford Ranger was caused by a defective Takata inflator after a similar 2015 death in South Carolina.
At least 22 deaths worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments into the driver’s body. 
The faulty inflators have led to the largest automotive recall in history. The other 20 deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co vehicles, most of which were in the United States.
About a quarter of the 2,900 vehicles have been repaired since Ford issued the warning last month, the company said on Monday.
Takata said in June it has recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States. About 19 automakers worldwide are affected.

Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks and have injured more than 200 people. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.

Benjamin Solomon, 42, of Brooklyn, New York, who was global head of securitized products prior to being terminated in August 2015, will pay a $165,000 fine and accepted a 12-month suspension from the securities industry, the SEC said.
Neither the bank nor Solomon admitted or denied wrongdoing. The fines reflected their substantial cooperation in the probe.
Deutsche Bank said it has taken ""appropriate disciplinary action, including termination in some instances."" A lawyer for Solomon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The charges extend a more than five-year federal crackdown into deceptive bond trading practices overseen mainly by the U.S. Attorney's office in Connecticut.
U.S. authorities have charged at least 11 people, including six from Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604), and eight have been criminally charged.
According to the SEC, Deutsche Bank and Solomon, who had also been head trader on the CMBS desk, failed to stop traders and salespeople from overcharging customers, including by misleading them about prices the bank had paid.
The SEC outlined several instances of alleged deception, including where a trader once sold a bond for 58.75 after telling a customer that Deutsche Bank had paid 58.50, when in fact Solomon had paid just 58.
Aware this occurred, Solomon allegedly called a salesperson.
""Not that you would, but, uh, [the buyer] thinks we're just working for a quarter point on those bonds, ok?"" Solomon said.
""I would never.... We need to make money,"" the salesperson replied. ""You deserve to make money, and I deserve to get paid.""
Deutsche Bank made $187,500 on that trade, including $125,000 from the trader's misstatement, the SEC said.

Banks must ""communicate accurate pricing information when transacting with customers in opaque markets,"" Daniel Michael, chief of the SEC enforcement division's complex financial instruments unit, said in a statement.

1029,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Broadcom Lines Up Biggest Debt Financing Ever for Qualcomm,"(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd. has lined up as much as $106 billion of debt financing to back its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc., winning what would be the biggest corporate loan on record at a precarious time for credit markets.
As much as $100 billion of the funding would be provided by a group of 12 lenders including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., Broadcom said in a statement Monday, a record loan financing. The banks provided a firm commitment to fund the deal, a step up from their previous agreement that allowed them to back out if markets were seizing up. 
Now banks appear to be on the hook for the funding if the deal goes through, just as credit markets are showing early signs of strain. The U.S. junk bond markets just had their worst week in two years, and investment-grade corporate debt has been weakening all year, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes. Broadcom is rated one step above speculative grade. 
“These big blowout kind of financings usually signal we’re at the end of something, perhaps a big cycle for M&A debt in this case,” said Noel Hebert, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The transaction comes as the Federal Reserve is tightening the money supply, which often makes investors less willing to take risk.
Broadcom would have to work hard to make sure it remains investment grade, because with junk ratings, “it’d get ugly quick,” Hebert said.
Broadcom first made an offer to buy Qualcomm for $105 billion in November that was rejected swiftly by the target company. That deal was backed by a financing package that hinged on a “highly confident” letter, where lenders have leeway to to back out if markets seize up.
At the time, Moody’s Investors Service said the offer was a negative for Qualcomm’s credit quality, which at A1 is solidly investment-grade. The proposed terms for the acquisition and the additional debt required to complete the deal would likely result in the target’s rating being cut by “multiple notches,” the bond grader said.
Debt investors feared the same, dumping bonds of both companies. A spokesman for Moody’s said the funding commitment does not change its view on Qualcomm’s credit.
‘Best, Final’
Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said the new $121 billion bid is the company’s “best and final.” Buying Qualcomm would make Broadcom the leader in smartphone chips, and the third-biggest chipmaker globally. Qualcomm is dominant in chips connecting handsets to wireless networks, while Broadcom has expertise in chips linking devices to Wi-Fi networks.
Qualcomm shareholders will vote on the future of the takeover bid next month when they decide whether to replace the company’s board with Broadcom’s nominees. On Thursday, San Diego-based Qualcomm said the new offer “materially undervalues” the company.
The acquisition would make good strategic sense for Broadcom, which means bond investors might be willing to finance it, said Todd Schomberg, an investment grade portfolio manager at Invesco Ltd. in Atlanta. This deal is not like the mega-leveraged-buyouts of the mid-2000’s, he said. 
“These deals seem to be different -- there’s a larger equity component and a telegraphed desire to remain investment-grade rated,” Schomberg said.
Convertible Financing
The financing package includes $100 billion of bank loans, including a $5 billion revolving credit facility. The other banks providing the debt commitment are:  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., affiliates of  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, and Royal Bank of Canada and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
A group of investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake, KKR & Co. and CVC Capital Partners, agreed to include $6 billion of convertible note financing, Broadcom said in its statement.
The previous record for a loan was set by Anheuser-Busch InBev NV in 2015 when it raised $75 billion to back its acquisition of SABMiller (LON:SAB) Plc. That loan was then repaid via further debt raisings, largely in the bond market.
Latham & Watkins, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz are legal advisers to the company. Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP is counsel to the banks.

1033,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 01:02PM ET</span>",Hedge Funds' Biggest Short in Bonds Faces Make-or-Break Moment,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds and other large speculators are more convinced than ever that the 2018 bond-market rout will resume in the days ahead.
The group, known for trading on momentum, boosted short bets in 10-year Treasury futures to a record 939,351 contracts, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data through Feb. 6. That means the violent market moves on Feb. 5, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered an unprecedented drop and 10-year yields fell almost 14 basis points, weren’t enough to dissuade wagers that rates are headed higher. The next gut-check comes Wednesday, with the latest read on consumer prices.
Speculators’ positioning matters because it can push momentum to extremes, and can serve as a contrarian indicator since these traders are among the quickest to switch directions when prices turn against them. By contrast, longer-term holders like asset managers are seen as more likely to stay the course. Their net long in 10-year futures is the highest since October 2015.
The question facing Treasuries traders throughout the 2018 selloff is whether something is truly different this time that will push yields ever higher. After all, asset managers have been adding to long positions for months, and 10-year yields just keep setting multi-year highs. At the very least, investors may be recalibrating to a higher yield range.
The speculators’ stance “signals people think the 10-year has more value at 3-plus percent than at 2.85 percent,” said Ben Emons, head of credit portfolio management at Intellectus Partners LLC. “Anecdotal evidence suggests more pent-up demand for duration at 3 percent, especially by long-only players.”
Monitoring 3%
Traders and strategists have been watching for a clean break of recent highs as a signal that 10-year yields are headed to 3 percent. That’s more than just a round number -- it approximates the peaks set in late 2013 and early 2014, before the bond bull market drove yields to record lows.
While it’s easy to point to momentum traders as the reason for the losses in Treasuries, there’s plenty of rationale for the leap in yields. The Federal Reserve is showing few signs of deviating from its rate-hike path and continues to trim its balance sheet; the Treasury is issuing more debt to cover widening deficits; and wage growth is finally showing signs of accelerating, meaning inflation could be on the rise.
The speculators’ wagers may face some headwinds. After 10-year yields touched 2.893 percent Monday, the highest level in four years, they fell to 2.86 percent as of about noon in New York. There’s a risk that the January consumer price index data on Wednesday could trigger a bond-market reversal, with the core reading expected to fall on an annual basis.
Pain Rotation
For now, the buildup in short positions is understandable, given 10-year Treasuries are bearing the brunt of the action surrounding the prospect of higher yields, said George Goncalves, head of Americas fixed-income strategy at Nomura Securities. Two- and five-year yields had already been rising last year as the Fed raised rates, while the 30-year yield remains stubbornly below its 2017 high.
With the 10-year note ending little changed last week, relative-strength index analysis signals it’s not as oversold as it was earlier this month. That gives speculators some breathing room to gain on their short wager. 
At some point, the buildup in bets against Treasuries could prove unsustainable. But, as bond investors have learned time and again this year, going against momentum can be costly."

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>",Murdoch pledges independent Sky News to smooth path for Fox deal,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox pledged to keep Sky News independent and continue funding the loss-making channel for five years, in an attempt to overcome regulatory concerns over its $15.7 billion takeover of pay-TV firm Sky. 
Fox said it would establish a fully independent board for the news channel to ensure the 86-year-old media mogul and his family could not influence its output.
Britain's competition regulator said last month that Fox's deal to buy the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own should be blocked unless a way was found to reduce the influence Murdoch could wield through owning the Sun and the Times newspapers, as well as TV, radio and online news outlets. 
Some lawyers, investors and analysts have said that a stronger mechanism to guarantee the independence of Sky News should be enough to gain approval.
Looming over the Fox-Sky takeover is a $52.4 billion deal that would result in Walt Disney Co buying Fox's TV and film studios, its cable TV assets and international TV businesses including Sky - leaving the Murdochs with Fox's U.S news and sports channels, as well as their News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) newspaper and publishing assets.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had already said the Disney deal should be taken into consideration when any remedies are assessed.
Fox, which disputes the CMA's finding on the media power it would have if it owned Sky, said any concerns about the Murdoch influence would fall away after a Disney takeover.
The regulator had said the output of Murdoch's companies would be watched, read or heard by nearly a third of the British population, giving him too much sway over public opinion.
THREE SOLUTIONS 
In January it put forward three broad possible solutions: insulating Sky News from Fox's influence, spinning off or divesting Sky News, or blocking the deal outright.
Sky, however, warned the regulator that if it blocked the deal, it could close the loss-making channel completely, killing the main British competitor to the BBC in 24-hour TV news.
Fox said the regulator's assessment was based on a number of legal and factual errors, but nonetheless promised to fund Sky News for at least five years and said it would put a ""firewall"" around the channel as remedies.
""The combined effect of the Proposed Firewall Remedies is that there could be no circumstances in which, post-transaction, the MFT (Murdoch family trust) or members of the Murdoch family could influence, whether directly or indirectly, the editorial line or policy of Sky News,"" the company said.
It said it would establish a fully independent board to oversee Sky News, including the appointment of the head of the channel, who will have sole responsibility for editorial strategy and staffing.
The proposal builds on a previous Fox pledge to create a Sky News board with a majority of independent directors. 
But the CMA noted opponents of the deal had said previous offers by Murdoch to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times newspapers in Britain and the Dow Jones company had proved ineffective.
Former opposition Labour leader Ed Milliband and ex-Conservative finance minister Kenneth Clarke were among four lawmakers who said the deal should be blocked, arguing if the independence of Sky News was lost, it would be difficult or impossible to restore, and that the CMA could reconsider the deal if Disney buys Fox.
Fox's proposals were released by the CMA on Monday. It is due to present media secretary Matt Hancock with a final report by May 1 and he has said he will rule on the deal by June 14.

Shares in Sky were trading up 0.36 percent at 10.53 pounds at 1216 GMT. Fox has offered 10.75 pounds a share.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 11:36AM ET</span>",British watchdog tells algorithmic traders to tighten controls,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Some firms using computers to trade at ultra-fast speeds are not applying safeguards required to avert market meltdowns, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Monday.
Algorithmic or high-frequency trading uses computers to automatically place an order in financial markets, without human intervention, and represents sizeable volume on stock markets.
The FCA reviewed algorithmic trading, which some critics have blamed for sharp price moves, at about a dozen firms and found some were failing to properly apply mandatory safeguards.
Sterling's ""flash crash"" in Asian trading in October 2016 for instance was blamed by some on algorithmic trading, but a central bank report later concluded there was no single perpetrator.
""Firms should consider and act on (the review's) content in the context of good practice for their business,"" Megan Butler, the FCA's director of wholesale supervision, said.
Some firms were unable to show that their systems are tested and operating properly, a requirement since January under the European Union's MiFID II securities law.
""Additionally, firms need to do more work to identify and reduce potential conduct risks created by their algorithmic trading strategies,"" the FCA said in a report.
The FCA did not propose new rules but will ""proactively"" supervise and monitor algorithmic trading, adding that firms need to consider the combined impact multiple strategies may have on the fair and effective operation of financial markets.
The FIA European Principal Traders Association (EPTA) said the FCA review was done before MiFID II came into force, adding that as members trade their own money, they have a strong focus on risk management.
The FCA said last year it would not take enforcement action straight away as long as firms were making efforts to comply with MiFID. Neil Robson, a lawyer at Katten Muchin Rosenman, said Monday's statement suggested regulatory forbearance may be short lived.
In a related move on Monday, the Bank of England published a consultation paper on what it expects from firms it authorizes regarding the management of risks from algorithmic trading.
""It applies to all algorithmic trading activities of a firm, including in respect of unregulated financial instruments such as spot foreign exchange,"" the BoE's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority said in a statement.
FIA EPTA Secretary General Piebe Teeboom said it was important that all players in algorithmic trading are subject to the same requirements and high levels of market conduct.
All firms should name a senior person who is responsible for algorithmic trading, and branches of foreign banks in Britain will have to show they are properly managing risks.

The PRA guidance will come into effect in June and the regulator will publish a discussion paper on operational resilience in algorithmic trading later this year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to fine Nippon Yusen KK (NYK) and several other Japanese shippers as well as Norwegian Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics ASA (WWL) in the coming weeks for rigging bids for shipping cars, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The EU sanctions follow a near six-year investigation which started with dawn raids by the European Commission in September 2012 in coordination with Japanese and U.S. antitrust authorities.
Competition regulators around the world have penalized a number of shippers in recent years for fixing prices and dividing the markets for shipping cars and other products on various routes. 
Norwegian shipping company Wilh. Wilhelmsen ASA confirmed at the time the raids at its 50 percent-owned Wallenius Wilhelmsen unit and EUKOR, in which it has a 40 percent stake.
Other shippers involved in the case include K Line (Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd) and Mitsui O.S.K Lines, the people said.
The Commission, which can penalize companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU antitrust rules, said at the time that the services under investigation included shipping cars, construction materials and agricultural machinery. It did not name the companies.
Japan No. 1 container shipper NYK, K Line and Mitsui in their 2017 annual reports said they were being investigated by competition authorities in Europe. 
The EU competition authority and WWL declined to comment. European subsidiaries of the Japanese shippers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Their parent companies were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.
WWL took a $200 million provision for all its antitrust cases in the third quarter of 2015, of which $98.5 million was for a U.S. fine, $34 million for a Japanese sanction and $7 million for a Chinese penalty. EUKOR was fined $44 million in the Chinese case.
Australia fined and convicted NYK last year for operating a cartel over vehicle transport to the country.

The Japan Fair Trade Commission in March 2014 handed down fines to NYK, K Line, WWL and Nissan Motor Car Carrier for fixing prices of auto shipments from Japan to North America, Europe and the Middle East while Mitsui escaped a sanction.

SINGAPORE/BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's new troop transporter may never go into battle with all the promised military capabilities after buyers of the A400M agreed to let Airbus (PA:AIR) negotiate an opt-out for features deemed too difficult to build.
A document signed last week between Airbus and seven NATO nations, and seen by Reuters, allows the planemaker to negotiate deals with the individual buyers so that some of the complex add-on features can be removed from the official specifications.
The new ""declaration of intent"" appears to mark the first time the buyers have recognized that not all the features designed to outdo competing U.S. aircraft will be available.
The agreement also recognizes that Airbus needs more time to deliver the plane than originally planned and paves the way for negotiations over a new delivery schedule.
In return for these concessions, the planemaker has pledged to provide ""all necessary support and resources to the A400M program"" after chronic delays and glitches with Europe's largest defense project, which have pushed it well beyond the original budget of 20 billion euros ($24.5 billion).
The agency representing buyers Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey did not respond to a request for comment. 
Airbus said it could not comment on confidential negotiations.
It was unclear what complex add-on features - known as ""permanent non-compliance"" items - could be removed from the plane's specifications as they were not listed in the document.
A source briefed on the agreement, who asked not to be identified because of the confidential nature of the matter, said countries had reasoned that it was better in some cases to accept partial progress towards a specific capability than to press for 100-percent achievement. 
""This means there will be compromises. Certain capabilities will not be delivered,"" the person said. 
ADVANCED SYSTEMS
The A400M was commissioned in 2003 to give Europe an independent airlift capacity to support military or humanitarian missions, rather than relying on the  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) C-130 or the now out-of-production Boeing (N:BA) C-17. 
A 3.5-billion-euro bailout from buyer nations in 2010 rescued the program from cancellation, but problems remained with some of the plane's classified defensive systems, as well as some types of paratrooper drop and helicopter refueling. 
Industry officials privately blame some of the project's problems on an over-ambitious wish list from buyer nations, designed in some cases to support local jobs. But the largest buyer Germany has criticized Airbus for failing to do what it promised.
Despite being a transporter plane, designers say the A400M's advanced systems such as ground-hugging technology make it one of the most complex military aircraft ever built in Europe. France has praised its performance on operations in Africa.
Under last week's deal, Airbus has re-committed to bringing new deliveries up to the final operational standard, known as ""SOC3,"" which includes flights at low level. It must also retrofit earlier planes in two stages by April 2027.
Airbus must meanwhile pay or give credit notes for all damages for delays due as of last week, when the agreement was signed: a move that underscores likely fourth-quarter charges.
Airbus warned last week it may post new provisions for losses on the A400M in its Feb. 15 annual results. It has already written off almost 7 billion euros on the project.

The agreement calls, however, for an easing of key cash-retention clauses which had allowed buyers to freeze payments to Airbus because of equipment problems. Instead, these will be modified to introduce ""suitable incentivization mechanisms"".

1063,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>","Remembering Bear Markets, From Bad to Worse","Investing.com - The recent selloffs on Wall Street have a few analysts predicting the onset of a bear market in stocks. Though the generally accepted definition of a bear market is a 20% price decline lasting at least two months, bear markets of the past can be divided into two categories: bad and worse.That may sound overly simplistic, but the duration and depth of the dozen-plus bear markets in history varies widely.Unfortunately for current investors, two of the three worst happened in the past twenty years. The most recent coincided with the financial crisis, or Great Recession. It ran from October 2007 to March 2009, during which time the S&P 500 fell more than 56%.The other occurred between March 2000 and October 2002, marked by the bursting of the dot com bubble. The S&P 500 lost 49% of its value.The epic one, of course,  accompanied the Great Depression, running from September 1929 to June 1932. It lasted almost three years and knocked 86% off of the S&P 500.Some bear markets since WW II have been mercifully brief; one lasted three months, another six months. In two cases, the decline maxed out at 28%.One thing is generally true of all bear markets. They are usually associated with a momentous event, such as a market crash, a recession or spike in inflation. "

The weekly commitment of traders report shows non-commercial positioning in VIX futures contracts spiked to a record net long of 85,818 contracts as of Feb. 6.
VIX futures contracts are tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, which tracks the one-month implied fluctuations in the S&P 500 Index derived from options prices. This so-called fear gauge hit 50 on Tuesday morning for the first time since August 2015, when China’s surprise devaluation of the yuan sparked turmoil in financial markets.
Exchange-traded products that allowed investors to wager on enduring calm in U.S. equities played a role in exacerbating this recent bout of risk aversion. Monday’s sharp plunge in U.S. stocks and rise in implied volatility forced these funds to buy significant amounts of VIX futures to pare their short exposure.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) announced the redemption of its VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note, ticker XIV, on Tuesday; more than a dozen similar products were halted for trading after suffering extreme losses.
What an about-face: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data marks not only the biggest outright speculative long position in VIX futures on record but also the largest one-week swing. This swing was driven primarily by a reduction in shorts rather than a fresh buildup of long contracts. Non-commercial short contracts plunged by more than 40 percent to 172,440; long contracts increased by a much more mild 10 percent to 258,258.
The net long speculative positioning as a share of open interest in VIX futures jumped to 14 percent, its highest level since December 2009.

The S&P 500 was up 24 points or 0.92% to 2,643.66 as of 9:54 AM ET (14:54 GMT) while the Dow composite increased 264 points or 1.09% to 24,455.49, and tech heavy NASDAQ Composite was up 64 points or 0.94% to 6,939.32.
The Dow bounced back on Friday, closing up over 300 points after the stock markets worst week in nearly two years. Concern lingers however, as the Dow and S&P ended the week down 5.2% amid rising inflation concerns.
Investors are looking ahead to Wednesday, when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation. Worry about the rise of inflation sparked last week’s sell off of equities, as investors moved their stock to the bond market.
Technology stocks were among the biggest movers after the morning bell rang, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rising 1.76% and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) increasing 1.73% after Reuters reported that the online retailer bough home security camera maker Blink for its energy-efficient chips and not for its products, as originally thought. Meanwhile Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) jumped 3.34% after Nomura/Instinet upgraded its stocks to buy, while Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) rose 2.39% after news that the chipmaker will meet with rival Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to discuss Broadcom’s $121 billion takeover bid.

1080,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 09:43AM ET</span>",Snap is rallying after a report reveals it may be 'siphoning away' more younger users from Facebook," Snap shares were gaining ground after a report found that  Facebook was losing younger users at a faster clip to Snapchat than previously expected.
Snap's stock was up 2.23% on Monday morning at $19.22 a share.
""While the social media platform was able to count on Instagram to retain that younger audience in the past, Snapchat may now be siphoning away more users,"" according to the eMarketer study.
Social media companies have closely monitored millennials, particularly teenagers, because they represent a large base of sustainable growth.
Yet Facebook is still popular among older age groups, adding monthly users overall. The New York-based marketing firm eMarketer believes Facebook will add around 1% more users in 2018, compared to the previous year.
However, the study found that Facebook will lose 9.3% of US Facebook users between ages 11 and younger. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook users ages 12 to 17 will decline by 5.6% and users aged 18 to 24 will fall by 5.8% in 2018. Facebook would lose up to 2 million users under the age of 24 this year, according to the eMarketer study.
Facebook's stock was up 0.82% at $177.55 per share ahead of Monday's opening bell.
“Snapchat could eventually experience more growth in older age groups, since  it’s redesigning its platform to be easier to use,” eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson stated in a release. “The question will be whether younger users will still find Snapchat cool if more of their parents and grandparents are on it. That’s the predicament Facebook is in.”
Snapchat may see its user base grow by 9.3% to 86.5 million this year, eMarketer added.
Shares of Snap have been trading higher after the company reported blockbuster fourth-quarter earnings last week. Snap's stock was up 25.79% for the year.

1082,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 09:43AM ET</span>",Inside JPMorgan's big contrarian bet on brick-and-mortar bank branches," Across the country, banks are closing branches at a heightened pace.
The 1,700 branches shuttered in the 12 months ending in June 2017 is the largest decline on record, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.
This news stands in stark contrast to the announcement by  JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) in January that it would be expanding its network with 400 new branches in 15 to 20 new markets over the next five years — an investment spurred in part by the savings from the recently passed tax law.
JPMorgan has, of course, culled some branches over the years, but far fewer than its peers — just 484, or 8.6%, since 2012, compared with more than 30% cut by competitors  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Capital One over the same period. 
The aspiration for branch expansion isn't entirely new, either. It's been on CEO Jamie Dimon's wish list for more than a decade, but, like so many other well-laid plans, the financial crisis derailed that. 
Back before the crisis he had made it clear that he wanted to be in some new markets,"" said Nancy Bush, an independent bank analyst who's been covering the sector since the 1980s. ""That kind of all got put aside as we recovered from the crisis.""
The bank has long zigged when others have zagged under Dimon's leadership, but the firm nonetheless expects the investment in branches to help its bottom line — a belief seemingly divergent from conventional wisdom in the banking industry, which is largely preoccupied with handling the customer migration to digital and mobile platforms, especially by millennials. 
""He's always an opportunist. That's just the way he's been. When everybody is retreating, he's going to be expanding,"" Bush said. 
But though he holds the final word, Dimon won't be the one captaining the new initiative on the day-to-day basis.
JPMorgan has tapped their millennial-whisperer for the task of managing branches, including the expansion. Pam Codispoti was named the head of branches at JPMorgan back in October, departing from her post as the president of Chase Branded Cards. 
Codispoti, who spent nearly 12 years in credit cards at  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) before joining JPMorgan in 2014, made a splash by masterminding the  now-legendary Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card and, in the process,  dispelling the myth that millennials weren't interested in premium cards that carried a fee. 
According to Bush, Codispoti faces an elemental challenge in overhauling the bank feature that used to be ground-zero for selling product: How do you make these things work?
""You're trying to establish this middle ground between digital and human,"" Bush said. ""How do you establish that middle ground where you do things in a branch and make it profitable?""
Codispoti is game for the challenge: ""There is a myth out there that branch banking is dead, that branches are going away. I just don't believe that to be true,"" she  recently told Business Insider.
She'll be pulling moves from her Sapphire Reserve playbook to prove the naysayers wrong once again. One of the most important things she learned from that experience was the value of getting in front of your target customers early and designing a product with their input from the get-go.
""We took some calculated risks to do things differently than we'd ever done before. We launched Sapphire Reserve without any initial marketing. And we allowed our design target — which were savvy millennial travelers who rely on social — we kind of brought our product to them and allowed them to market our product,"" Codispoti said. ""Those principles of design-led thinking, customer first, getting into the homes of people, doing ethnographic research approach, and that agile methodology are things we will use as we try new things in our banking environment.""
Making branches appealing to that Sapphire Reserve demographic — savvy millennials — will be crucial to JPMorgan's branch success.
As Bush notes, young earners in their 20s and 30s just don't need a physical branch for most of their routine banking anymore — mobile and digital options and ATMs suffice for moving money around, paying bills, and opening accounts. 
""The generation of mine and the generation before me, we still have a need for branches,"" Bush said. ""Our kids and grandkids do not.""
Codispoti allows that millennials want something different out of branches than their forebears, but she doesn't think they want out of the proposition altogether, noting that the demographic still visits a Chase branch three times a quarter.
""They really would like to come to the branch for experiences and advice moreso than everyday transactions, which I think they feel very comfortable doing on their own from mobile or digital tools,"" Codispoti said. She continued: ""We have a long pipeline of innovations that are targeted to millennials, millennial-minded customers who really want to bank on their terms, wherever, whenever, and however they choose.""
One of those innovations, the Everyday Express branch, launches in limited release next week. The locations are smaller than a typical branch and feature more digital tools, including the company's eATMs.
They'll also offer advice services in the style of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Genius Bars to help bridge that human-digital divide that Bush referenced.
The first six Everyday Express locations open February 12 in Culver City, California, and in Queens, New York. "

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>","Ford revs up large SUV production to boost margins, challenge GM","By Nick Carey
LOUISVILLE (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it will boost production targets for two large sport utility vehicles by 25 percent this year to challenge rival General Motors Co's hegemony in a highly profitable U.S. market segment and boost its own anemic profit margins.
""We can sell every single vehicle we can produce here,"" Ford global operations president Joe Hinrichs said ahead of the announcement during a tour of the company's Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky where the new generation of Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs went into production last fall. ""These are high-margin vehicles, so that is very meaningful.""
The Expedition and Navigator are two of the highest-priced vehicles Ford sells, and the production increase at the Kentucky Truck factory comes as investors are growing restless as Ford's automotive profit margins have shrunk to 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 5.7 percent a year earlier. The company's margins have fallen behind rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
Even before recent market volatility, Ford's shares were slumping. Year to date they are down 14.7 percent while shares in No. 1 U.S. automaker GM, which is seen by analysts as having a clearer vision and better operational focus, are up 1.2 percent.
The average price for a Navigator in January 2018 versus January 2017 jumped 38 percent, or $21,300, to $77,400 while the price for an Expedition rose nearly $8,000 to $57,700. Both are well higher than the industry average vehicle selling price of $33,100, according to data cited by Ford.
GM is outperforming Ford financially in part because it dominates the U.S. large SUV segment with models such as the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban. Ford sold a little shy of 3,500 Expeditions and 1,300 Navigators in January. GM sold more than 19,000 of its large SUVs during the month.
""There is a big dog in the segment,"" Hinrichs said. ""We aim to get out there and challenge them with vehicles with better fuel efficiency and driving dynamics.""
Ford said it will add $25 million in investments at the plant to support the production target hike, bringing its total investment there to $925 million. Upgrades at the plant, which also produces the company's popular Super Duty pickup truck, have included 400 robots, a centralized data analytics center and a 3D printer to save time and a lot of money on parts and tools.
Ford is playing catchup to GM in the large SUV market in part because of past decisions to focus investment on smaller vehicles at a time when high oil prices and stiffening federal fuel economy rules threatened big trucks like the Navigator. This is the first complete makeover for the Expedition and Navigator since the late 1990s.
Stable, relatively low oil prices have since encouraged Americans to shun passenger cars in favor of higher-margin SUVs and pickup trucks. In 2017, passenger car sales in the United States fell to 36.8 percent of total light vehicle sales.
To improve mileage, the new Expedition and Navigator models have aluminum bodies, as do the Ford F-series pickup models with which they share many components.
That change required ""the greatest technological transformation"" at the Louisville plant - one of two Ford has in the city - since the 1980s, said electrician Chuck Billingsley, a 33-year veteran worker at the automaker.
However, Ford has warned investors that its overall vehicle profit margins are threatened this year by rising prices for commodities such as steel and aluminum prices, even as most other automakers say those increases are manageable.

Ford says steel is its biggest problem, but analysts say its decision to switch to aluminum bodies for pickup trucks to reduce weight and boost fuel economy has cost it as aluminum prices spiked.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 07:32AM ET</span>",World shares attempt bounce after worst week in two years,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares climbed half a percent on Monday, attempting to brush off fresh rises in global bond yields while equity futures also pointed to a firmer session on Wall Street which suffered its worst week in two years.
A higher Friday close for New York stocks following a week of ""vol"" induced selling, lifted markets in Asia and Europe, helping MSCI's all-country index rise off four-month lows, while European shares firmed 1.4 percent after touching six-month troughs last week. 
Wall Street's equity volatility gauge, the VIX - the spike in which had kicked off the ructions - was at 26.5 percent, easing off Friday's 29 percent close.
While the index had rocketed to 50 at the height of last week's turmoil, current levels are well above the long-term average around 11 percent, in a sign that investors' nerves are still jangling.
The continued move-up in bond yields is reinforcing the fear of more volatility ahead. Ten-year Treasury yields hit new four-year highs around 2.90 percent, while German yields, the benchmark for Europe, hovered just below 0.8 percent, the 2-1/2-year high touched last week.
""People are nervous after the shock of the past week but it doesn't feel like there is a crisis around the corner. But never say never,"" said Grant Lewis, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London.
Given solid world economic growth, Lewis said the falls were more likely a wobble than a full-blown correction to the nine-year long equity bull market as bond investors priced in an improved economic outlook.
""Even at 2.90 percent, 10-year Treasury yields are still low,"" he added.
U.S. equity futures rose 1 percent.
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed equity funds had cut long positions in S&P 500 futures, reducing exposure to a market which has fallen about 8 percent from Jan. 26 record highs. 
INFLATION, DOLLAR
While equity markets attempt to recover, the question is whether they can withstand another sharp move up in bond yields - something will be put to the test by economic data this week.
In China, banks extended a record amount of new yuan loans in January, blowing past expectations, which is likely to support growth not only in China but underpin liquidity globally.
Analysts forecast U.S. consumer price inflation, to be released on Wednesday, to have slowed to 1.9 percent in January from a year earlier, while the core measure is seen ticking down to 1.7 percent.
Given it was fears of faster inflation - and more aggressive rate rises - that triggered the global rout in the first place, an above-forecast figure could well spark a fresh selloff in stocks and bonds.
Central bankers have not exhibited much concern over the equity rout, indicating they intend to push on with plans to tighten monetary policy this year.
On currency markets, traders had cut net short positions in the dollar last week, CFTC data showed, but speculators returned on Monday to short the dollar, pushing it 0.2 percent lower versus a basket of currencies.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said the risk bounce was being countered by the steeper U.S. bond curve but the soft dollar showed the former currently had the upper hand.
The gap between short- and long-dated U.S. yields is at the widest in more than three months - the so-called curve steepening which indicates higher inflation expectations and economic activity.
""If a better risk mood just encourages 10-year Treasuries to spike up through 2.9 percent, it seems unlikely that we will see equities bounce too far and by the same token, it's too early to sell dollars,"" Societe Generale warned clients.
The euro rose around 0.2 percent, after losing 1.8 percent last week, while the yen eased off five-month highs hit last week amid the flight to safe-havens.
Sterling meanwhile inched higher, off last week's three-week lows but Britain's shaky economy and rocky Brexit process kept it fragile.

Monday's more cheerful market mood also lifted commodities, with Brent crude futures rising two percent after last week's 9 percent fall, copper bouncing off two-month lows and gold up 0.2 percent, well off five-week troughs.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Japan's Honda to recall 350,000 cars in China over engine issue","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) will recall roughly 350,000 vehicles in China to resolve a cold-climate engine issue and quell a barrage of customer complaints that has hit the automaker over the past month.
The recall involves the CR-V sport utility vehicle and the Civic car equipped with a 1.5-litre turbo engine, Honda's joint venture with  Dongfeng Motor Group  Co Ltd (HK:0489) said in a statement on Monday. 
The company is calling back those cars to resolve a problem caused by an unusual amount of un-combusted petrol collecting in the engine's lubricant oil pan.
The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car's check-engine light came on. Honda and Dongfeng plan to resolve the issue by updating the engine's gasoline injection control software.
Honda officials said there had been no reports of accidents. They said the engine oil issue doesn't affect the engine or the car's performance.
The measure comes after CR-V and Civic owners turned to the Weibo microblog - China's Twitter equivalent - and other means to air their complaints since mid January.
The recall points to an emerging pattern in China where customer complaints spiral out of control as they are aired out on Weibo, forcing an automaker to respond. 
Years ago the kind of recall Honda announced on Monday could have been dealt through a so-called customer service action, industry officials and experts say. That refers to what the auto industry calls a ""quiet recall"", which is less damaging financially and image-wise, where an automaker fixes a non-safety issue, often free of charge, whenever the customer comes to the dealership.
“Without Weibo, it would have gone on for years,” said James Chao, chief automotive analyst for IHS Markit in the Asia-Pacific region. ""That's the way it was for the industry in the pre-Weibo, pre-Twitter era."" 
Honda did not say the scale of the move in its statement, but a Beijing-based spokesman and other company officials said Honda and its joint venture partner are likely to call back roughly 350,000 vehicles. “We’re still trying to determine the precise number of cars affected,” the spokesman said. 
Normally un-combusted petrol ends up accumulated in the lubricant oil pan but evaporates under heat from the engine. Such evaporated petrol is by design put back into the engine combustion chamber as fuel.
The issue involving the CR-V and the Civic has occurred in northern China where temperatures can dip well below the freezing point and when drivers of the affected vehicles drive short distances frequently.

On short runs, Honda engineers believe the engine doesn't warm up enough to help un-combusted petrol accumulated in the lubricant oil pan to evaporate.

In an interview published in the Financial Times, Prince, co-chief investment officer at Bridgewater warned that markets are entering a new era of volatility and said last week’s market turbulence was set to continue.
“There had been a lot of complacency built up in markets over a long time, so we don’t think this shakeout will be over in a matter of days,” he said. “We’ll probably have a much bigger shakeout coming.”
A rout in financial markets last week saw $4tn wiped off the value of global shares and the U.S. market entered into a correction after falling more than 10% from January’s record highs.
Wall Street staged a late rally on Friday but U.S. markets still recorded their worst week in two years as fears of faster inflation and thus more aggressive interest rate increases sparked a wave of selling.
“Last year equity markets had a free run. But this year we are going from central banks contemplating tightening policy to actually doing it,” Prince said. “We will have more volatility as we are entering a new macroeconomic environment.”
Prince also said that he expects global growth to remain on track despite the shift in central bank policy and heightened volatility in markets.
“The real economy will outperform financial economy this year, the opposite of what we've seen in recent years,” he said."

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Italy’s SACE plans to back $1.6 billion in debt to Saudi Arabia - CEO,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Italy’s export credit agency SACE plans to back $1.6 billion in loans to Saudi Arabia over the next 12 to 18 months, the agency’s chief told Reuters, potentially boosting the country's search for outside investment at a time of weak oil prices.
Export credit agencies (ECAs) offer loan guarantees, and sometimes direct financing to overseas buyers, to facilitate the export and supply of domestic goods or contractors.
ECA-backed debt financing has become increasingly relevant in the Gulf region as a drop in oil prices and tighter liquidity in local banks have prompted governments to seek alternative funding sources for long-term infrastructure projects.
Saudi Arabia last month sent requests for proposals to banks for the refinancing of a $10 billion syndicated loan, new bond issuance, and for ECA-backed funding.
“ECA structures can be in a lot of circumstances the structures that give access to long tenors and favorable conditions, besides having the advantage of not having the typical volatility which is in the nature of capital markets,” SACE Chief Executive Alessandro Decio said.
“This awareness is consolidating in this region. It’s not surprising in this context, for instance, that an important country like Saudi Arabia is seeking to put together a plan for ECA funding.”
Saudi Arabia’s national oil giant, Aramco, has also been tapping this form of financing. The company is looking to raise billions of dollars in ECA-backed loans involving agencies across the globe ahead of its planned stock market listing, sources told Reuters last month.
SACE, which is meeting prospective clients in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia this week, is evaluating projects in the Middle East and North Africa worth about $15 billion, $5 billion of which in the United Arab Emirates.
In the UAE, SACE plans to offer more than $1 billion in credit support to projects awarded to Italian companies for the construction of Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport and the Expo Dubai 2020 site.
SACE, fully owned by the CDP Group in Italy, opened its Dubai office in 2016 as a hub for the Middle East and North Africa region. Since then, the agency’s exposure to the region has increased to 12 billion euros from 4.4 billion.
“The fact we’re here these days is because we believe there’s the possibility to do even more,” said Decio. “Growth has been stronger so far in Kuwait and UAE, while we haven’t done much yet in Saudi Arabia.
""One of the objectives of this mission in the region is to spend some time with our prospective clients in Riyadh, and see if we can accelerate our operations there.”
SACE’s current portfolio in Saudi Arabia amounts to around $640 million.

The call represents the clearest signal yet from the Chinese government to lend support to a market rocked by recent global volatility, China's deleveraging campaign and fears of margin calls. It also stirs memories of government intervention during China's 2015 stock market crash, when companies were also urged to buy shares and state-backed funds were pumped into the market.
China Securities Investor Services Center, directly managed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said in an emailed statement that share purchases by major shareholders could help stabilize the market and shows big shareholders stick with retail investors ""through thick and thin"". 
Such a practice would ""bring confidence to small investors, and have a positive impact"" on the market, the center said, encouraging major shareholders and senior executives of listed companies to increase shares if they have not yet done so.
Chinese stocks fell nearly 10 percent last week, the worst weekly performance in two years as investors dumped shares across the board.
In the past week alone, major shareholders or senior executives of more than 100 listed companies already increased holdings, while 75 companies announced plans to do so, said the center, whose shareholders include China's stock exchanges.
It was not clear if last week's share purchases were the result of government intervention, but the center said on Monday it ""recognizes, encourages and supports such a behavior.""
""Investor protection is not only the responsibility of securities regulators, but also an important task for listed companies,"" the center said in the statement.
The move would help stem the stock market slide, and prevent irrational behaviors by small shareholders, it said.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rebounded from six-month lows on Monday as jitters over a sudden spike in volatility that wiped off $1 trillion in market capitalization last week appeared to ease.
Broad-based gains helped the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index rise 1.5 percent by 0943 GMT, after ending on Friday at its lowest level since August. The UK's FTSE (FTSE) and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rose 1.3 and 1.8 percent respectively.
The euro zone volatility index (V2TX) fell back from peaks hit last week when a spike in inflation expectations boosted bond yields and fueled worries over central bank tightening.
""We see this as a short-term correction rather than an end of cycle event,"" UBS strategists led by Nick Nelson said. 
""What could change that would be a significant move up in bond yields, well above current levels, combined with major inflation fears,"" they wrote, noting however that fundamentals for European equities remained supportive.
The STOXX is down 3.9 percent in the year to date.

Miners  Glencore  (L:GLEN),  Rio Tinto  (L:RIO) and BHP (L:BLT) all rose between 2.9 and 3.6 percent as copper prices rose from its lowest in nearly two months as the dollar dropped.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 04:57AM ET</span>",UK's SFO extends Qatari loan charge to Barclays operating arm,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays' (L:BARC) legal problems deepened on Monday when Britain's Serious Fraud Office charged its operating subsidiary with providing unlawful financial assistance to Qatari investors during the banking crisis a decade ago.
The same charge was made against the bank's holding company last June, but it is the operating unit that is licensed for banking operations, meaning any conviction could also prompt sanctions from regulators.
The regulators are already separately weighing up how to respond to attempts by  Barclays  Chief Executive Jes Staley to unmask a whistleblower's identity.
Barclays said that Barclays PLC and its operating arm Barclays Bank PLC intend to defend the respective charges brought against them.
""Barclays does not expect there to be an impact on its ability to serve its customers and clients as a consequence of the charge having been brought,"" the bank said in a statement.
A loan to Qatar in November 2008 could have broken the law if the SFO can show it was connected with the Qatari payments to Barclays. Public companies are normally prohibited in the UK from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, a process known as financial assistance.
The Qatari investment helped to prevent Barclays from having to turn to the British government for a bailout during the financial crisis.
""The charges relate to financial assistance Barclays Bank Plc gave to Qatar Holding LLC between 1 October and 30 November 2008, which was in the form of a $3 billion loan for the purpose of directly or indirectly acquiring shares in Barclays Plc,"" the SFO said in a statement.
""This follows charges brought against the holding company, Barclays Plc, and four individuals in June 2017.""
The SFO, which opened its investigation into Barclays in 2012, said a date for the first court appearance will be set in due course. 
Barclays shares shrugged off the news, rising 1 percent to 194.9 pence by 0930 GMT, helped by a broader market rebound from last week's losses, and UBS raising its price target for the stock to 225 pence from 220 pence.
Two former top executives also face a charge of unlawful financial assistance. 
The trial of Barclays PLC and four former top executives on a separate charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation when they negotiated a capital injection for the bank from Qatar, is due to start next January. That separate charge has not been made against the operating arm 
Qatar, which is a major UK investor, has not been accused of wrongdoing.
Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said that while it was unhelpful for Barclays that the SFO has added charges, it should not change the dynamics of the case materially.

""However, it is negative that the group hasn't been able to settle a number of outstanding litigation issues, with outstanding litigation representing an unhelpful distraction to the management of the core franchise,"" the financial services firm said in a note to clients.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 04:27AM ET</span>",Bank lending in spotlight as Australian inquiry begins,"By Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A government-backed inquiry into Australia's finance sector on Monday said it will start its year-long investigation by scrutinizing the selling tactics of banks' most lucrative products - mortgages.
The Royal Commission inquiry heard on its opening day that almost half of the over 385 public submissions it had received were about banks, reflecting the erosion of public trust in a sector that has been rocked by scandals including interest rate rigging and alleged money laundering.
The commission's focus on banks will expose some of Australia's biggest and most profitable companies to unprecedented scrutiny, with top executives likely to be grilled in public and compelled to disclose confidential documents.
Its final recommendations could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation, just as the banks are dealing with a revenue crunch following years of record profits.
Mortgages are Australian banks' most lucrative money-spinners. The four major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, National Australia Bank, and Westpac Banking Corp - hold about 80 percent of the country's A$1.7 trillion mortgage market.
""The commission will hear evidence of events involving certain financial services entities in the context of home lending that suggest that consumers have not always enjoyed the right to be treated honestly and fairly when it comes to home loans,"" Rowena Orr, a barrister who is assisting the commission, said at the start of the inquiry in Melbourne.
""Some of these events may have involved breaches of the law while others may have involved departures from community standards and expectations.""
A Royal Commission has the power to compel witnesses, recommend criminal charges and propose legislative changes. While Australia's finance sector has been subjected to numerous probes in the past, it is the first time the whole industry has faced such scrutiny. 
After years of refusing to order such a far-reaching inquiry, the center-right federal government relented to public pressure late last year in the wake of money-laundering allegations against CBA. 
The banks also gave up on campaigns to avoid an inquiry and published a joint letter in November saying that it was now in the national interest to have one. 
The commission also will examine the scandal-hit wealth management and financial advice industries.
NOWHERE TO HIDE
Australia's big banks are among the most profitable in the world, earning net profit margins of 36.4 percent in the June quarter of 2017, according to a paper published by the commission on Feb. 9. 
But they are under mounting regulatory pressure to boost capital and rein in lending to speculative investors amid fears of a downturn in the Sydney and Melbourne property markets.
CBA last week posted a surprise drop in first-half cash profit, weighed down by A$575 million ($454 million) in provisions related to the money laundering allegations. Outgoing Chief Executive Ian Narev warned that the industry would be affected for some time by regulatory charges ""in one shape or form"".
""The banks are really in the spotlight now,"" said Matthew Ryland, portfolio manager at Greencape Capital, which holds bank shares. 
""They would be less aggressive while all this is going on, so there will be an impact (to revenues),"" Ryland said, adding that it was too early to quantify the impact.
Commissioner Kenneth Hayne, in charge of the inquiry, said he would demand to see confidential settlements brokered by the finance industry if they shed light on wrong-doing. 
Any attempt to prevent information being made public, including dispute settlements with customers, would ""incite the closest attention"", he said.
A Westpac spokesman said the bank would not enforce ""any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should a person want to make a submission"". 
NAB's Chief Legal and Commercial Counsel Sharon Cook said the bank was committed to co-operating with the inquiry and that it would waive the confidentiality obligations of any customers that made a submission to the inquiry.
Representatives of CBA and ANZ did not immediately return emails seeking comment. 

The next public hearing will be held in about a month.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 04:19AM ET</span>","Qualcomm, Broadcom plan to meet on February 14: sources","By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd plan to meet on Wednesday to talk about the latter's $121 billion acquisition offer, the first time the semiconductor companies will discuss the potential deal, people familiar with the matter said.
The meeting comes after Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week from $70 to $82 per share, and made other concessions, including offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal. 
Qualcomm said last Thursday that Broadcom's new offer still undervalues it and falls well short of the firm commitments on regulatory issues it expected. However, it offered to meet Broadcom to see if it can address what it called ""serious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal.""
As part of its bid to take over Qualcomm, Broadcom has also launched a campaign with Qualcomm shareholders to replace Qualcomm's board. Both companies are due to meet proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis before their Feb. 14 meeting to argue why Qualcomm shareholders should back them in a vote scheduled for March 6.
Broadcom had requested last week to meet over the weekend, but has now agreed to meet on Wednesday instead, the sources said on Sunday, asking not to be identified because the meeting's details are not public.
Qualcomm and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices.
Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.
Broadcom’s antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones.
Qualcomm responded on Thursday that unless Broadcom will agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure the deal closes, a commitment to divestitures without restrictions often referred to as ""hell or high water"", it would have to be extremely clear and specific about what actions it would refuse to take.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told Reuters in an interview last week that Broadcom decided not to offer hell-or-high-water provisions to Qualcomm because it does not view them as a very well defined legal standard.

The new rules are the latest in a series of tough measures taken by Beijing to reduce systemic risks in the world's second-largest economy.
Bond issues must publicly state that debt raised does not add to local government debt and that they are not serving any government financing functions, said the notice from the National Development and Reform Commission.
Chinese authorities are working to separate local governments from financing activities of often closely associated but technically independent companies.
Beijing says the government is not responsible for debt raised by these firms but it is still widely assumed that the government would step in to provide support in the event these firms faced repayment issues.
China's outstanding local government debt rose 7.5 percent to 16.47 trillion yuan ($2.56 trillion) at the end of 2017 from the previous year, according to Reuters calculations, but remained within the government's target.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Standard Life Aberdeen takes on Mexican airport developer in rare move,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Simon Jessop
MEXICO CITY/LONDON (Reuters) - A subsidiary of  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen Plc, one of the world's largest asset managers, is pressuring a Mexican airport developer to change its shareholder structure, three years after unsuccessfully trying the same strategy in a similar investment.
It is a rare move in a region where activist-style investments are notoriously difficult, and where Aberdeen Standard Investments itself has a mixed track record, having previously taken on two of Mexico's largest companies.
Fiona Manning, a senior investment manager at the $646 billion asset manager, said the shareholder structure of Mexican airport operator Aeroportuario del Sureste (Asur) was no longer adequate and that her team was pressing for an extraordinary general meeting to allow shareholders to vote.
Asur's control structure comes with two share classes and a technical assistance fee - 5 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - that it pays to the controlling shareholder.
Inversiones y Técnicas Aeroportuarias, a strategic partner of Asur, is the controlling shareholder and is owned by Mexican tycoon Fernando Chico Pardo and Mexican bus transportation company ADO.
This type of control structure was first introduced in the country more than two decades ago when the Mexican government privatized airports and needed the expertise of foreign investors.
""These businesses no longer require the same level of expertise coming from outside of the businesses,"" said Manning, adding that the fee should be scrapped altogether. ""We feel that now it is an appropriate time to challenge the structure of these businesses.""
Asur, ADO and representatives for Chico Prado did not respond to requests for comment.
The Ministry of Communication and Transport of Mexico lists 76 airports in its directory, nine of which are operated by Asur, including the one in the popular Mexican beach resort of Cancun.
The investment team tried the same strategy three years ago with Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte (OMA), which operates 13 Mexican airports, including in Monterrey, the capital of the wealthy border state of Nuevo Leon. But Manning said its resolution did not win the required votes of at least 50 percent plus one shareholders from the non-control group.
However, she added there was a realization within the controlling shareholders and OMA that some of its points were valid, and the technical assistance fee was subsequently reduced to 4 percent and then 3 percent.
Technical assistance contracts are not unique to Mexico or the aviation industry, but Manning said it was unusual to keep them in place for such a long time.
She said Corporacion America Airports, which operates airports in Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Ecuador, Italy, Peru and Uruguay, had such a structure but decided it was not needed any longer.
While shareholders get no direct benefit from the cancellation of the fee, it amounts to a hidden tariff for passengers and airlines that use the airports, which Manning said could hinder overall growth and ultimately earnings.
Activist Insight, which tracks demands publicly presented by investors, has recorded just three campaigns across all of Latin America during 2016.
Asset managers often say they prefer to engage privately with companies over contentious issues to maintain relations with the board. They only escalate to a more public forum if talks prove unsuccessful.
Manning said Aberdeen Standard Investments has pursued between six and ten activist-style investments across its entire emerging market portfolio.
In Mexico, it took on Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa), the world's largest franchise bottler of Coca Cola products, as well as the country's largest local bank Grupo Financiero Banorte.
However, Manning said both of its proposals were unsuccessful.
Femsa shareholders rejected the idea of a change in the share structure, voting to keep the preferential dividend that the current structure offers.
Meanwhile, shareholders of Banorte voted in favor of the proposed acquisition of Grupo Financero Interacciones, which Standard Life sought to prevent.
The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Asur and Grupo Aeropuerto del Pacifico, another large airport developer, outperformed the Mexican market year to date through Feb. 9 while OMA slightly underperformed, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""We don't see ourselves as activist investors. There is a subtle difference in that we buy what we think are good quality companies,"" Manning said.
""So, for us, a company has to meet a minimum threshold before it is investable. Then, we would be looking on how we can improve it.""

1124,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 11:31PM ET</span>","Don't Blame Complex Volatility Products, $127 Billion Fund Says","(Bloomberg) -- The biggest pension fund in Denmark says it’s misguided to blame last week’s sudden selloff on complex financial instruments that are tied to volatility.
Christian Hyldahl, the chief executive officer of ATP, a $127 billion fund based north of Copenhagen, says what we witnessed in the first week of February was just a taste of things to come as monetary stimulus is unwound and inflation returns.
How Two Tiny Volatility Products Helped Fuel Sudden Stock Slump
Map to the Underworld: $2 Trillion of Volatility Trades Here
“So we will see this volatility,” Hyldahl said in an interview in the Danish capital. “But I think the core of this wasn’t toxic instruments that did something bad. The core of this is the uncertainty of how fast the Fed will raise rates.”
An Inventor of the VIX: ‘I Don’t Know Why These Products Exist’
Derivatives that are essentially bets on price volatility had become so complex that few really understood their implications, and that fed a market panic, the argument goes. Funds that target volatility using such instruments were quickly identified as potential culprits behind the turmoil.
Volatility Inc.: Inside Wall Street’s $8 Billion Time Bomb
But Hyldahl suggests that’s a narrow analysis.
“I think no matter what, even if you just have simple linear instruments, the complexity in unwinding the experiment of central banks in a way that you manage expectations in the market...that is a complex task that will generate a lot of volatility,” he said.
Danes are required by law to contribute a portion of their incomes to ATP. The fund holds most of its assets in a hedged portfolio, with a smaller allocation going into a higher-risk basket. ATP returned 29.5 percent, before tax and costs, on its investment portfolio last year. It’s delivered an average of just over 8 percent over the past two decades. Investments in inflation-related instruments were among the best performing in the portfolio last year.
Lessons Learned
The main takeaway from last week’s sudden surge in volatility after an unnaturally long period of calm is that we’re on the way toward more normal times, Hyldahl said.
“I see this as part of the normalization of interest rates, and that will be a very volatile path,” he said.
“That said, things can go wrong and it’s still an experiment and we still need to get out of it.” But last week was “not an event that somehow indicates that it is not going the way it should. This is part of normality in unwinding the experiment.”
The upshot is that investors need to get used to a new reality, he said.
“I don’t think we can generate the same type of returns in 2018,” as in recent years, “despite economies going well,” Hyldahl said. “I think we’ll have a lot more volatility and we will not make money on the interest-rate part of the portfolio.

“Futures can move around quite a bit, but what I will be watching for is a stable ‘green’ in the futures coming into tomorrow,” said Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, a Birmingham, Alabama-based senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management, who helps oversee about $17 billion. “This will show that the S&P didn’t hold on to its 200-day moving average by accident, and this confidence is going to pull more buyers into the market.”
March contracts on the S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent at 11 a.m. in Hong Kong, following a weekly decline that at its worst point was the largest since the financial crisis. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq 100 Index was up 0.4 percent.
While two tranquil years have been shattered, few strategists or fund managers said clients were panicking. Instead, people are calling who -- while alarmed by the speed of the correction, among the fastest since 1950 -- wonder if the selloff is another chance to buy.
“I didn’t have to necessarily talk anyone off the ledge, like ‘Oh my god, should I sell everything?’"" Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said Friday. “Some of the younger people who I work with who are not on the investment side, like my assistant for example, and the colleagues that she talks to, they’re like ‘Oh, what should we be doing with our 401k? Should we be worried?’ So that hits home pretty hard.”
Shares jumped in the final hours Friday, bouncing from a much-watched technical level, the 200-day moving average on the S&P 500. Before that, snowballing losses left investors frazzled and the equity benchmark down more than 10 percent from its record high on Jan. 26, wiping out January gains and depositing stocks roughly where they were at Thanksgiving.
“I didn’t have a lot of people saying ‘Oh my god, this is crazy,’ so I’m assuming they felt the same way I did, which was: ‘wow,’"" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of the Independent Advisor Alliance based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said Friday. “I’ll be 100 percent honest, I expected a drop of this magnitude in terms of percent drop, but I expected it to take place over a couple weeks.”
“The suddenness of the drop -- that’s pretty big,” he said.
Everyone agreed -- it’s been jarring, but not without precedent. Peter Jankovskis, the co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments, drew parallels with 1998, a sharp but relatively short break that coincided with souring derivative bets at the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management. Back then, his firm was rolling out new products, mutual funds that ended up doing just fine.
“We did great,” Jankovskis, who’s based in Lisle, Illinois, said Friday. “At that point, the overall market was sound and in good shape. There was one particular investment company that had a problem. It was a great time to buy into the market. This is more like 1998.”
Not everyone was willing to stick it out. According to EPFR Global data cited in a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) note, U.S. equities saw record redemption of $33 billion during the week through Feb. 7. Stocks entered a correction the next day, loosely defined as a drop from 10 percent from a past high.
Even with last week’s selloff, the market is no worse off than it was three months ago: up 40 percent over two years and almost four times its level at the bottom of the financial crisis. While last week’s sights and sounds shook bulls who before then hadn’t endured a 3 percent drop in the S&P 500 in more than a year, drawing parallels with past disasters struck most as premature.
“Someone said, ‘Hey, this looks like 2008!”’ said Zaccarelli. “And I was like, that’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. It’s nothing like 2008.”

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is considering a new offer for Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox assets, despite an agreement in December to sell them to Walt Disney Co for $52.4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
Comcast's deliberations indicate that it believes it still has a chance to clinch a deal with Fox, even though it previous bid last year for more than $60 billion was rejected over concerns that regulators worried about media consolidation could thwart it, the sources said.
Comcast may decide not to make any new offer, the sources said. Its decision will be informed by how Fox justifies the deal with Disney in a regulatory filing to its shareholders sometime before they are asked to vote on the deal this summer, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Comcast, Disney and Fox gave no immediate comment.
Comcast might be prepared to offer protections to Fox such as agreeing to remove certain assets from the deal that prove controversial in Washington, D.C., including regional sports channels, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on Comcast's deliberations.
It was is possible that instead of re-engaging in pursuit of all of Fox assets, Comcast could zero in on something in particular, such as European pay TV giant Sky, the Wall Street Journal report said, citing anonymous sources.
The Murdoch family, which controls Fox, preferred a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in Disney than Comcast stock, and expects a potential deal with Disney to be cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators more easily, sources told Reuters in December.

Disney struck a deal with Fox to buy film, television and international businesses. The deal is set to bring to a close more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world’s most important global news and film conglomerates. The new, slimmed down Fox will focus on TV news and sport.

The dollar declined against most major peers.
Equity benchmarks rose in Hong Kong, China and South Korea after the S&P 500 Index jumped on Friday and the futures extended gains in Asia at the start of the week. Australian banks dragged the benchmark there down at the start of a sweeping inquiry into the nation’s financial system. Japan is closed for a holiday. Oil maintained losses.
Even as U.S. stocks ended the week on a high note fears of interest-rate hikes that pushed markets into a correction persist. U.S. stocks ended their worst week in two years with the S&P 500 tumbling 5.2 percent. The Cboe Volatility Index ended almost three times higher than its level on Jan. 26. Ten-year Treasury yields finished the week at 2.85 percent, near where they started and after pushing as high as 2.88 percent.
Traders will be awaiting U.S. consumer-price data out on Wednesday with some trepidation. Pressure on equities has been emanating from the Treasury market, where yields spiked to a four-year high amid concern the Federal Reserve may accelerate its rate-hike schedule.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his sister to invite South Korea’s president for talks in Pyongyang as the Winter Olympic Games got underway, a move seen as an attempt at thawing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The won was the best-performing currency in Asia.

Investors would be awaiting U.S CPI data out later this week to find out if another bout of volatility is in store.
Hong Kong and China were in focus as Nikkei was closed for National Foundation Day holiday, but volatility is expected to be low ahead of the Chinese New Year Holiday. Hang Seng Index opened 0.2% higher while Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component also gained 0.2% and 0.1% respectively.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Takata, injured drivers reach deal to end U.S. bankruptcy","By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Takata Corp's U.S. unit reached a settlement with its creditors, lawyers for those injured by its deadly air bags and automakers that smoothes the way to end its Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sell its viable operations, according to court papers.
The Japanese company's air bags can explode with too much force and have been linked to at least 21 deaths and hundreds of injuries, prompting the largest recall in automotive history and forcing Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, into bankruptcy.
The U.S. unit was gearing up for a court fight starting on Tuesday to get approval for its plan to exit bankruptcy over the opposition of a committee for injured drivers and a separate committee of unsecured creditors.
But those two committees, automakers and Key Safety Systems, which is acquiring the viable business lines of Takata, reached a deal that resolves the biggest objections to the plan, according to court documents filed on Saturday.
Under the agreement, a trust will be established to pay compensation for those injured or killed by the air bags, which will be funded in part by automakers surrendering some of their claims against Takata. 
The 13 automakers which joined the agreement include General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Toyota Motor Corp, and the U.S. affiliates of Honda Motor Co Ltd and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
An amended plan of reorganization will be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court soon, according to Takata's U.S. unit.
Tuesday's court hearing had been adjourned to Thursday at the earliest, Takata's U.S. unit said in court papers filed on Sunday.
A spokesman for the U.S. unit and lawyers for the committee of injured drivers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The trust will pay compensation based on the injury, ranging from $10,000 for bruising to $5 million for death or loss of eyesight, according to court documents.
If the agreement is approved by the Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, injured drivers will be prevented from suing the automakers that joined the agreement.
A lawyer appointed to represent future injured drivers also joined the settlement, as did Key Safety Systems, a unit of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp.

Key Safety Systems plans to acquire Takata's viable operations for $1.6 billion. The proceeds will fund restitution claims for automakers and help pay injury claims as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>","Citigroup to invest in London, hire staff despite Brexit: FT","(Reuters) - Wall Street bank  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) will set up an innovation center in London in one of the first investments by a big U.S. bank since Brexit, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Citi will initially hire 60 technologists for the center, James Cowles, chief executive Officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), told the FT. 
The company could not be immediately reached for comment.
The center in London will also house the EMEA unit of Citi ventures and employees from across the company's businesses, in a boost for UK's financial services sector ahead of Brexit, the FT reported. (http://on.ft.com/2BREJUO)
European Commission officials rejected the City of London's proposal to strike a post-Brexit free-trade deal on financial services, a major blow to Britain's hopes of keeping full access to EU markets for one of the world's top two financial centers.
Britain is currently home to the world's largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About 6 trillion euros ($7.35 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe's financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said earlier this month that it could move more than 4,000 jobs out of Britain if Brexit talks result in a divergence of regulations and trade agreements between Britain and the European Union. 
In the short term the bank will move between 500 and 1,000 jobs after Britain's formal exit from the EU, scheduled for March 29, 2019.
About 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if it is denied access to Europe's single market, a Reuters survey in September found.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 02:25PM ET</span>",Renault board member quits ahead of CEO succession meeting,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Senior  Renault  (PA:RENA) board member Thierry Desmarest has resigned from the French carmaker, sources told Reuters, days ahead of a meeting at which Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn is asking directors to back his chosen successor's appointment.
Desmarest's exit comes amid renewed tensions between Renault and the French government, which has been pressing Ghosn to recruit a second-in-command who could one day succeed him at the helm of the Renault-Nissan alliance.
Former  Total  (PA:TOTF) CEO Desmarest, whose mandate runs until 2020, told Renault early last week that he was stepping down early, people familiar with the matter said.
His exit closely follows that of Chief Performance Officer Stefan Mueller, which cleared the way for Ghosn to propose his other deputy, Thierry Bollore, as chief operating officer and heir apparent.
A spokeswoman for the French oil giant, where Desmarest remains honorary chairman, declined to comment. The company did not respond to Reuters' requests to speak to him directly.
A Renault spokesman said: ""We do not comment on rumors and speculation."" A French government spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.
At least two directors - other than Desmarest - have raised concerns about the recruitment process and its outcome, sources told Reuters.
""External candidates were not so much as considered,"" said a person with knowledge of the matter, even when profiles such as Toyota (T:7203) second-in-command Didier Leroy were put forward by recruitment firms.
Renault placed Bollore atop its shortlist at the start of the process and blocked attempts by the external advisers to bring Mueller, a German-born BMW (DE:BMWG) veteran, into serious contention, the source said.
DIFFERENCES
Desmarest, 72, had in any case planned to withdraw from the Renault board after the next shareholder meeting in June, a person close to the former oilman told Reuters. He had served on Renault's board for a decade and chaired its strategy committee.
""It was going to happen anyway,"" the person said. ""This is not motivated by polemics or the Ghosn situation.""
But the carmaker hurriedly circulated a draft statement among board members on Friday, attributing Desmarest's sudden exit to a discovered conflict of interest, two sources said.
""He's a very discreet man and he'll go without making a noise,"" said one, adding that Desmarest may attend Thursday's meeting but abstain from voting on Bollore's nomination. ""His goal is not to vote and not to be associated with this.""
Ghosn, 63, had earlier been expected to hand over the reins to a new chief executive and move to a new role overseeing Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi's three-way carmaking alliance.
But the plan foundered on differences with the French state over the alliance's future shape and direction. Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan (T:7201), which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) via a 34 percent stake.
Renault now plans to propose Ghosn's reappointment as CEO to the June shareholder meeting.
Both sides have been seeking to avoid a repeat of a bitter 2015 clash in which France raised its Renault stake to swing a shareholder vote and secure double voting rights.

The government had also pushed unsuccessfully for a full Renault-Nissan merger on terms that would safeguard French industrial interests.

The order, for 20 of the double-decker planes with an option for 16 more, was originally announced on a provisional basis in mid-January. Deliveries are to start as soon as in 2020, the Dubai-based carrier said.
Airbus had previously said it would have to end production of the A380 if it failed to secure the huge Emirates deal.
Alongside the contract signing, visiting French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum discussed the expansion of air services between France and the United Arab Emirates, the airline said without elaborating.

The latest order brings Emirates' commitment to the A380 program to 178 aircraft, it said, adding that it was evaluating engine options for the new planes.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",Bond vigilantes awaken counterparts in the stock market,"By Jennifer Ablan and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond vigilantes could be finding allies in the stock market.
With inflation fears back in vogue and the U.S. budget deficit seen ballooning, vigilantes have stormed fixed income trading floors and seem to be cropping up in equity markets too, where they may punish already battered stocks for policymakers' and lawmakers' actions. 
""The stock market is feeling the bond market's pain. Absolutely, no doubt - we have stock vigilantes too,"" Ed Yardeni, the longtime Wall Street strategist now president at his namesake research firm, told Reuters. 
The term ""bond vigilante"" was coined by Yardeni in 1983 to describe investors' insistence on high yields to compensate for the risk of inflation and budget deficits during the Reagan administration. A stock version of a vigilante would seek to influence lawmakers and policymakers by slamming equity prices.
Bond yields began to soar on Feb. 2 after U.S. government data showed the biggest wage gains since 2009, convincing investors of the growing threat of inflation, long tame since the 2007-2009 recession. 
Stock vigilantes could make their own demands of policymakers. 
Under vigilante logic, if rates are higher, if inflationary pressures are running hot, if the economy is nearing its long-run potential and the Federal Reserve really is going to raise rates quickly in response, then the value of stocks needs to be lower too. Potentially a lot lower.
""Over the last half a dozen of years we have been saying equity valuations can be higher because we are living in a low interest rate and low inflation environment, but that's reversing a little bit and that's what we are staring at now,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategies at Wunderlich Securities. 
Stocks have been falling apart in recent days, with the S&P 500 (SPX) down 11 percent from a high hit just two weeks ago. But the switchback comes amid a long bull market, during which equities had ignored until recently the stealthy run-up in 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) from 1.32 percent in 2016 to this year's 2.89 percent high.
U.S. stock investors have now turned hypersensitive to rising yields after the past week's surge, which lifts borrowing costs and could curb economic earnings and growth, Yardeni said. That also comes against the backdrop of accumulating government debt.
Jeffrey Gundlach, known as Wall Street's Bond King, told Reuters it is ""hard to love 10-year Treasury notes even at a 3 percent yield with boatloads of bond supply and a 4 percent real GDPNow and 2.9 percent average hourly earnings.
""Plus, if the economy tanks from the stock market crashing, then you are looking at even more supply. Like a couple trillion more on top of the couple trillion already barreling toward us in fiscal 2019,"" Gundlach said. 
On Friday, a brief U.S. government shutdown ended after Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law a wide-ranging deal expected to balloon the budget deficit. That comes after a tax cut also widely expected to expand the deficit. 
U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul attempted to block a vote on the deal on Thursday, flagging the stock market plunge in recent days among his concerns.
Nearly $300 billion in new spending included in the bill will mean the annual budget deficit will exceed $1 trillion in 2019, said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a private fiscal policy watchdog group in Washington.
BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) Chief Executive Larry Fink said in November that the United States is ""one of few nations that have our deficit funded by foreigners,"" and that it was a concern as people in those countries save less and consume more.
""The dependency on foreign ownership of our debt should be an alarming issue over a long horizon,"" Fink told Reuters.
""These nations are going to be moving from a saving society, especially Japan, to a consuming society as people age.""
Yardeni said the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy, known as quantitative easing, had overriden concerns on the accumulation of debt. That has all changed with the Fed raising rates.

""Both bonds and stocks have not reacted for so long to the mounting debt we've keep piling on because the Federal Reserve has had them on lock down,"" Yardeni said. ""Now with the Fed tightening and reducing its balance sheet, the dynamics have changed.""

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",Investor files lawsuit over U.S. LJM fund that lost most of its value,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An investor on Friday filed a lawsuit against managers of a U.S. mutual fund that relied heavily on a strategy that profits from calm markets but lost four-fifths of its value in turmoil this week.
In a complaint seeking class-action status filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, investor Leonard Sokolow said he owned shares of LJM Preservation and Growth Fund, a once-$800 million fund that lost most of its value despite touting its ability ""to deliver solid returns while maintaining risk parameters"" in its most recent annual report to shareholders.
""In truth, however, [the fund] was not focused on capital preservation and left investors exposed to an unacceptably high risk of catastrophic losses,"" the complaint said.
A spokesman for Chicago-based LJM Partners Inc, parent of the fund's operating unit, could not be reached.
The LJM fund appeared to be the latest casualty in a series of spectacular blow-ups of investment strategies that effectively bet on low or falling volatility.
Investors hungry for greater returns piled into options, futures, swaps and exchange-traded products that made such bets, in some cases earning triple-digit annual returns in recent years.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Tuesday it would terminate the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the S&P 500 after its value plunged nearly 93 percent in one day during the global market rout.
LJM Preservation and Growth Fund had been run by Anthony Caine, a veteran of the 1990s technology boom who later founded LJM, and Anish Parvataneni, a former trader for well-known investor Ken Griffin's Citadel.
In an environment that has been tough on high-cost fund managers, the LJM fund took in $393 million in new cash from investors in 2017, its best sales since launching in 2013, according to the Lipper unit of Thomson Reuters, despite fees as high as 3.34 percent a year.
LJM closed the fund to new investment this week, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 11:25AM ET</span>",Eight signals to watch that the U.S. stock rout is over,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock investors on Monday will be seeking to divine if the deepest weekly slide since January 2016 will continue or if the market will turn the corner after one of the most volatile five days in years. 
Equal parts science, art and luck may be needed to pick a bottom in the S&P 500. While it ended last week on an up note, the index was caught in its first correction in two years, after a 7 percent rally this year that culminated with a record high on Jan. 26, following a 19 percent 2017 gain. 
While Wall street experts caution that it is difficult to definitively pinpoint a turning point, several said they will monitor a number of indicators that could help show if the selloff has ended.
""People sometimes get pulled into wanting to call tops or bottoms,"" said Frank Cappelleri, chief market technician at Instinet in New York. ""I would say it is almost impossible to do that, especially on a continued basis, but I think identifying patterns when they develop can at least give you a sense that things are turning just a bit."" 
FEWER NEW LOWS: Wall Street's main stock indexes climbed more than 1 percent on Friday, giving investors some solace after a week of huge swings that shook the market out of months of calm.
Even with Friday's gains, the benchmark S&P 500 fell 5.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016, as volatility spiked.
""You want to see that less stocks are making new lows even if the whole market is down,"" Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Suntrust Advisory Services, said in an email. 
In one positive sign on Friday, 65 percent of S&P 500 stocks made new 20-day lows, compared with 79 percent on Tuesday, Lerner said. 
""What you want to see eventually is strong buying. You want to see multiple days where 90 percent of the volume is positive (stocks that are rising,)"" he said. 
SEARCHING OUT THE SECTORS: Cappelleri is watching for pockets of strength. ""That's step one: seeing the bleeding stop, at least for a few different areas or groups. And then from that point we can see if that broadens out a bit,"" he said.
Better performance of economically sensitive sectors such as financials could be a sign that investors are becoming less bearish. ""When people feel better about the market you don't want to see utilities lead,"" Lerner said.
TECH TRIPS UP: ""Any final flush for U.S. equity markets has to pull this group much lower and very quickly,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""One big reason we don't think U.S. stocks have bottomed: this hasn't happened yet."" 
The S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) led market gains in 2017, rising 36.9 percent for the year. The technology index is down 0.28 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 (SPX) is down 2.02 percent. 
VIX VISION: The market's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), known as the VIX, has spiked in recent days and earlier last week hit its highest level since August 2015. ""I'd like to see the VIX tamed and move back to the lower end of its trading range,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
Colas said: ""It is a declining VIX (often over weeks, not days) that sets the floor for stocks, not a peaky top. So even if this week was the high water mark for the VIX in this correction, we may well see stocks slip further.""
In the months before the selloff, the VIX was trading between about 10 and 13, well below its long-term average of 20. It closed Friday at 29.06. 
RELATION TO RATES: An increase in bond yields has been seen as a catalyst for the selloff, presenting investment competition to equities at a time when stock valuations are expensive. ""If we see some stabilizing in interest rates and bond yields in particular, that would seem to indicate what's going on there has settled down,"" Hellwig said.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields  early last week surged to 2.885 percent, the highest level since January 2014.
PANIC SAFE-HAVEN BUYING: Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, is looking for ""full-on panic."" There has been no sign of investors rushing into safe havens such as gold, U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. 
""To find the end you need to see evidence that it truly has convinced people it's going to go down more, or there's panic,"" Paulsen said. ""And I just haven't seen that yet, at least in behavior.""
MINDING MOMENTUM: Vincent Catalano, global macro strategist at Blue Marble Research in New York, is watching a key indicator of market momentum known as the moving average convergence divergence line, or MACD. ""When the line starts to flatten out, that's an indication that the pressure is ending, that we've reached the short-term bottom,"" Catalano said. MACD is a momentum oscillator widely followed by chartists that is based on the relationship between moving averages. 

TEST OF 200-DAY MOVING AVERAGE: In the most recent bull market's pullback, the 200-day moving average of the S&P – currently at 2,539 - has been tested, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. On Friday, the S&P 500 briefly dipped below that level before rebounding. ""That's typically what we've seen in past market cycles. It's stopped and bounced around at that point,"" McMillan said. But if the S&P 500 were to sustain losses below that mark, he said, a ""big round number,"" such as 2,500, would be the next support level he would look for on the S&P.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 10:17AM ET</span>",Breitling CEO ditched racy ads featuring women as unsuitable: paper,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The new chief executive of Switzerland's Breitling watch company said he has ended advertisements with some featuring women in shorts and flight suits catering to pilots of World War II-era fighter planes on grounds they were inappropriate.
Some of the ads portrayed women acting as ground support for male pilots flying P-51 Mustang airplanes. 
CEO Georges Kern, who took over the Grenchen-based timepiece maker last year after switching from luxury goods maker  Richemont  (S:CFR), told the SonntagsZeitung in an interview that he intervened after finding complaint letters from people concerned about the ads' portrayal of women.
""I stopped them immediately,"" Kern told the newspaper in an article that appeared on Sunday. ""Some customers thought they were funny. But such clips were no longer suitable and do not reflect values of today's society.""
Once tipped as a potential Richemont chief executive, Kern left for Breitling abruptly in July 2017 just four months after taking over as head of Richemont's watchmaking division.
New Breitling advertisements will start in May, he said, adding he planned to keep Breitling's airplane theme, including with the company's jet team, to maintain the watch's appeal with the aviation community.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Toyota leaves Pyeongchang podium to South Korean rivals,"By Liana B. Baker
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - For a major new Olympics sponsor, Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corp is oddly invisible at the Pyeongchang winter Games.
Unlike other top global sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Visa, Toyota is nowhere to be seen, having sent only a few dozen representatives to South Korea for the event.
Its cars are missing from Olympic fleets, the logo is nowhere to be seen and only visiting Toyota officials from other countries such as the United States, whose teams it separately sponsors, can wear Olympic rings on their clothing here.
That's because Toyota realized before signing with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) almost three years ago that these Games, like the South Korean car market, would always belong to Toyota's local rivals, Hyundai and Kia.
""Toyota felt that giving up some of our benefits from these partnerships at Pyeongchang 2018 was the right thing to do after conferring with the International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee,"" a Toyota spokesman said.
Toyota signed its nine-year deal with the IOC in 2015, after Pyeongchang was awarded the Games, the result of a 10-year campaign that had been backed by Hyundai and Kia which were already in separate sponsorship talks with local organizers.
Toyota still has the right as global IOC sponsor to use the Olympics logos in its advertising elsewhere in the world, and it did so prominently this month in two commercials during the U.S. Super Bowl, when a 30-second ad can cost $5 million.
The Japanese firm's marketing during the Pyeongchang Games, which formally opened on Friday, will be seen in 30 countries -- though not in South Korea, a market where foreign carmakers have long struggled, especially those from Japan.
Instead, Hyundai and its affiliate Kia are making the most of their domestic sponsorship rights, having signed their own separate deals with the Pyeongchang Games organizing committee.
They have erected pavilions in Olympic venues to show off their latest-technology vehicles, including Hyundai's hydrogen-fueled autonomous vehicles.
Hyundai, whose distinctive all-black pavilion was designed by British architect Asif Khan, has provided 4,100 cars and shuttle buses for the IOC to use for its VIPs and athletes.
Hyundai declined to comment.
The Pyeongchang organizing committee referred questions to the IOC, which said in an email to Reuters: ""In the short term, we worked in partnership with Toyota to enable Pyeongchang to continue their local sponsorship agreement which will provide additional support to the local organizers.""
LOOKING TO BEIJING 2022
Toyota's readiness to give up on sponsorship rights in South Korea underlines the tough nature of the market for foreigners, especially for exporters from Japan, a former colonial power that still inspires ill feeling among South Korean consumers.
Imported cars make up about 15 percent of the market, and these are mostly from European makers, South Korean industry data show. Toyota has been in the market since 2001 and its brands accounted for barely a tenth of imports last year.
Insisting on the domestic rights might not only have been futile from a marketing perspective, it could have backfired.
David Krysiek, chief executive of Atlanta-based brand communications firm Brandware, said Toyota avoided ""the disastrous prospect of being seen as a carpet-bagger in Korea"".
Toyota can at least count on dominating at the next Olympics, the summer Games in Tokyo in 2020, but the one after that could prove tricky: the 2022 winter Olympics in Beijing.
China, parts of which were also colonized by Japan, is another auto market that is tough for Japanese firms, but it is the world's largest and Toyota has no plans to take a step back from the domestic sponsorship rights, as it did in South Korea.
In 2012, Japanese car sales in China nose-dived during a flare-up in a territorial dispute between the two nations. Thousands of Japanese-brand cars were vandalized and mobs attacked dealerships in several cities.
Sentiment has since recovered, and Toyota has set an upbeat sales forecast in China for this year.
""Right now things are more or less back to normal, but we are still handicapped by the past,"" said the head of a major Japanese carmaker's China operations, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
He said ""normal"" meant that about 10 percent of Chinese consumers would not contemplate buying a Japanese car.
Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, who helped create the IOC top sponsors program, said there was also little risk in China that Toyota would be seen to be gatecrashing a party meant for local carmakers.

""China has its own local auto industry but it's not like what Hyundai and Kia means to Korea,"" he said.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 07:25AM ET</span>",Investors brace for more swings as U.S. inflation specter rises,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The inflation bogeyman has reared its ugly head and sent U.S. stock investors racing for the hills in recent days.
Next week, coming off one of the most volatile stretches in years, two important readings on U.S. inflation could help determine whether the stock market begins to settle or if another bout of volatility is in store. 
If the January's U.S. consumer price index due next Wednesday from the U.S. Labor Department, and the producer price index the next day, come in higher than the market anticipates, brace for more selling and gyrations for stocks. 
U.S. consumer prices rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in December and is forecast to stay around that pace this month. 
""If we get a hot CPI print it will insert additional uncertainty, but if we get a quiet, below-consensus print, you may see yields down and equities rally,"" said Jason Ware, Chief Investment Officer & Chief Economist at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
The equity market has become highly sensitive to inflation this month. A selloff in U.S. stocks earlier this week was in large part sparked by the Feb. 2 monthly U.S. employment report which showed the largest year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings since June 2009. 
Recent U.S. tax cuts that may spur economic growth, the prospect of more government borrowing to fund a widening fiscal deficit, and rising wages, have all pushed up benchmark U.S. Treasury yields to near four-year highs. 
""This is how we started, go back to Friday and this is exactly where we were,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.
""The conversation about equity risk premium, interest rates and inflation, we are coming full circle.""
The jump in wage inflation pushed yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) closer to the 3.0 percent mark last seen four years ago, denting the attractiveness of equities, and unnerving investors fearful inflation will force the U.S. Federal Reserve to raises short term interest rates at a faster pace than is currently priced into the market. 
The current earnings yield for the S&P 500 index companies stands at 5.4 percent, below the 6.4 percent average of the past 20 years. As bond yields rise the spread between the two narrows, prompting asset allocation changes between equities and fixed income. 
Investor concerns over inflation was reflected in Lipper funds data on Thursday, which showed U.S.-based inflation-protected bond funds attracted $859 million over the weekly period, the largest inflows since November 2016.
On Thursday, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said the central bank's forecast of three rate hikes still seemed a ""very reasonable projection"" but added there was a potential for more, should the economy look stronger.
Traders are currently putting the chances of a 25 basis point hike by the Fed at its March meeting at 84.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Benchmark 10-year note yields (US10YT=RR) this week rose to a four-year high of 2.885 percent. On Friday, benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.853 percent.
While many analysts were predicting bond yields to rise this year as global economies improve, the suddenness of the move was a large factor in the recent stock market selloff. 
The 10-day correlation between the S&P 500 index and yields on the 10-year note was at a negative 0.79, as of late Thursday.
On Friday, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index closed out their worst two-week performance since August 2011.
""The pace really does matter,"" said Ron Temple, Head of US Equities and Co-Head of Multi Asset Investing at Lazard Asset Management in New York. 
""If we see 3.0 percent next week that is going to spook people more - the equity market psyche is fragile at this point."" 
The fragile investor psyche is likely to lead to continued volatility coming off a week that saw the Dow suffer its largest intraday index point decline in history on Monday, nearly 1,600 points. The Dow currently has an average intraday swing over the past 50 days of 265.76 points, the highest since March 2016. 
While volatility has subsided a little from the heights touched earlier this week, it is far from an all clear, Nigol Koulajian, chief executive of Quest Partners, a New York-based systematic commodity trading advisor with $1.4 billion in assets under management, said.
Koulajian pointed to the fixed income market as the main catalyst right now for near-term moves in the stock market.
""Investors need to keep a very, very close eye on fixed income,"" he said. ""The catalyst needn't be big. When the market is this levered, even tiny events can trigger a big avalanche.""
But analysts also caution yields are not at levels that should be alarming to investors, and in fact are at levels that signal a healthier global economy, and the performance of some stocks this week points to a belief the consumer is also getting healthier.
The average yield on the 10-year Treasury note over the past 30 years is 4.834 percent, still well above current levels. 
""Fundamentals are still positive, there is strong economic growth and strong earnings growth - those will help stocks move higher over time,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.

""But it doesn't do much for predicting short-term moves.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's big banks are responding to a revenue crunch by cutting jobs and other costs, prompting fears on the eve of an inquiry into their businesses that the industry's tarnished reputation is about to take another hit. 
Regulators' demands that banks hold more capital and their scrutiny into internal operations have made cost-cuts the in-vogue metric at the so-called Big Four banks, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), to boost profits. 
But the strategic change will come at a cost for the banks. 
""If you can be the most successful at bringing your staff numbers down the quickest, that's going to give you the quickest cost advantage,"" said one senior bank insider with direct knowledge of the cost-cutting strategy. 
But, added the insider, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, as jobs cuts mount, ""society and the community will push back, won't accept it.""
Cost cuts are not limited to jobs, with banks preparing to make use of improved technology to reengineer back office functions, and reduce the number and physical size of their branches.
But the insider said he expected the Big Four to shed up to 40,000 jobs over five years as part of that overhaul, making a reduced wages bill the primary saving.
The focus on costs coincides with the start of a royal commission looking into misconduct in the financial sector starting Monday. 
Scandals that have shaken public confidence include allegations of interest rate rigging, claims of a toxic trading room culture within some banks, and accusations that some institutions withheld legitimate health insurance payouts and gave misleading financial advice.
The inquiry, expected to last a year and which can recommend criminal charges and legislative changes, could potentially result in restrictions that affect bank profits, similar to a government-imposed bank tax levied last year. 
SLIMMING DOWN 
According to the government, Australia's big four are still among the most profitable banks in the world, earning net profit margins of 36.4 percent in the June quarter of 2017.
Years of economic growth and a booming property market had encouraged executives to focus on lifting sales rather than trimming operations. ""Top line revenue growth is going to be a struggle, so they need to look closely at their cost lines really seriously,"" said Brad Potter, head of Australian equities at Nikko Asset Management, which owns shares in the major banks. 
""This is just early stages for banks,"" Potter said. ""There needs to be a massive reengineering of back-offices to cut costs."" 
Last week, CBA's outgoing chief executive, Ian Narev, warned that over the next five years, ""the level of competition in this industry will simply not sustain the cost structures we've got today."" 
Narev will leave CBA in April as it fights accusations by the country's anti-money laundering agency that it allowed thousands of suspicious transactions to pass through its systems. Job cuts could prove hard for banks given the trust they have lost in recent scandals, according to Julia Angrisano, national secretary of the Australian Finance Sector Union. 
""Rather than going through this stage with a sledge-hammer to shed tens of thousand of jobs, we think that this is an opportunity for banks to deal with disruption in the right way, re-skilling and re-training their workforce,"" Angrisano said.
NAB last year said it would cut 6,000 jobs over the next three years in a bid to save A$1 billion by 2020 through automating processes while also creating 2,000 new staff positions over the same period. 
Branches are a key focus for cost-sensitive executives as more people bank online. 
""It's likely we will see branch layouts, sizes and experiences evolve, but they continue to play a pivotal role in the experience our customers have,"" NAB's chief operating officer, Antony Cahill, said in an email to Reuters. 
A spokeswoman for Westpac said the bank believed staffing numbers would fall, but that it was taking a gradual approach. ANZ representatives did not respond to emailed questions about staff cuts. A spokesman for CBA declined to comment beyond Narev's remarks last week.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2018 06:34PM ET</span>","OxyContin maker stops promoting opioids, cuts sales staff","(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP said on Saturday that it has cut its sales force in half and will stop promoting opioids to physicians, following widespread criticism of the ways that drugmakers market addictive painkillers.
The drugmaker said it will inform doctors on Monday that its sales representatives will no longer visit physician offices to discuss its opioid products. It will now have about 200 sales representatives, Purdue said.
""We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,"" the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said in a statement.
Doctors with opioid-related questions will be directed to its medical affairs department. Its sales representatives will now focus on Symproic, a drug for treating opioid-induced constipation, and other potential non-opioid products, Purdue said.
Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Among other opioid producers, Endo International Plc (O:ENDP) agreed in July to pull its Opana ER painkiller after the Food and Drug Administration called for its withdrawal.
Purdue and other drugmakers have been fighting lawsuits by states, counties and cities that have accused them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing.
The lawsuits have generally accused Purdue of downplaying OxyContin's addiction risk and of misleading marketing that overstated the benefits of opioids for treating chronic, rather than short-term, pain.
At least 14 states have sued privately held Purdue. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday accusing Purdue of deceptively marketing prescription opioids.
Purdue is also facing a federal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut. 
Purdue has denied the allegations in the various lawsuits. It has said its drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and account for only 2 percent of all opioid prescriptions.
Purdue and three executives pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges related to the misbranding of OxyContin and agreed to pay $634.5 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe.
That year, Purdue also reached a $19.5-million settlement with 26 states and the District of Columbia. It agreed in 2015 to pay $24 million to resolve a lawsuit by Kentucky. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for his response to the opioid crisis. He has yet to declare it a national emergency as he pledged to do in August following a recommendation by a presidential commission.

The paper said Tesco (L:TSCO) was understood to be developing a separate brand that would match its German competitors on price with a more limited range than in its main stores.
Tesco had no immediate comment on the report.
Data from research group Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday showed sales at Tesco grew by 2.6 percent in the last 12 weeks but all of Britain's four biggest supermarkets had lost market share to Aldi  and Lidl.
Tesco has a 28 percent share of the British grocery market. Aldi's sales increased by 16.2 percent and Lidl's by 16.3 percent, boosting their respective market shares to 6.9 percent and 5 percent.
Tesco has tightened its hold on the nation's food market after the competition regulator last month cleared its 3.7 billion pound ($4.95 billion) takeover of wholesaler Booker (L:BOK).

Following an accounting scandal in 2014, Chief Executive Dave Lewis's strategy to rebuild the supermarket group has been based on increasing food sales.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Mayhoola, Fosun vie for control of French fashion label Lanvin: sources","By Pascale Denis
PARIS (Reuters) - Qatari investment fund Mayhoola, which owns Italian fashion house Valentino, and Chinese conglomerate Fosun, the company behind French tourism group Club Med, are vying to acquire a majority stake in struggling French fashion house Lanvin, two sources familiar with the talks said. 
The storied Parisian label, France's oldest surviving couture house, is controlled by Taiwan-based businesswoman Shaw-Lan Wang, and had enjoyed a revival in recent years under star designer Alber Elbaz. 
But his surprise sacking in 2015 was followed by a slump in sales, which left Lanvin facing a cash crunch at the end of 2017.  
Mayhoola, which also bought French luxury fashion firm Balmain in 2016, is one of two serious suitors now looking to take over Lanvin and in talks with the firm, the sources said. 
The other is Fosun (HK:0656), and a team from the Chinese group was due to visit Lanvin's couture ateliers in Paris on Saturday, one of the sources said.
Lanvin, Mayhoola and Fosun could not be reached for comment.  
Lanvin said in early November that Wang would put more money into the business by the end of 2017, but the cash injection never materialized. 
Managing Director Nicolas Druz said in December that ""sustained financial and industrial solutions that do not involve a capital increase will be found by end of March"". 
It was not immediately clear how much the sale of a controlling stake could fetch. In 2014, Wang rejected a Mayhoola bid for Lanvin of around 400 million euros.
The privately owned firm does not publish earnings. It made an 18.3 million euro loss in 2016, sources with knowledge of the situation had previously told Reuters. Losses had been forecast to deepen to at least 27 million euros in 2017 as sales continued to fall, they said.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2018 06:02AM ET</span>","Airbus halts some deliveries, tests after engine snag: sources","By Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) has stopped delivering A320neo jets powered by Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) geared-turbofan engines and halted pre-delivery test flights after the latest in a series of problems with the engines, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Airbus has briefed airlines and leasing companies and told them it cannot yet say how long it will take to resolve the problem, one source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Another said deliveries of the jets were not taking place, but that they had not been formally halted.
An Airbus spokesman said it is ""in discussions with customers about delivery schedules"" on a case-by-case basis.
The setback comes weeks after Airbus said it was overcoming a two-year sequence of problems on fuel-saving engines developed by United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney, one of two engine suppliers for its best-selling A320neo.
The European Aviation Safety Agency on Friday imposed restrictions on the use of recently delivered A320neo-family jets with engines starting at a certain serial number.
That followed a spate of in-flight shutdowns or rejected take-offs that one source said began happening 10 days ago.
The restrictions cover jets with two engines from the same affected batch - effectively grounding those jets.
India's IndiGo has grounded three jets, but regulators said its competitor GoAir is not affected.
In total, the grounding affects 15-20 recently delivered aircraft, the sources familiar with the matter said.
EASA's safety bulletin also bans airlines from using A320neo jets on extended trips over water or isolated areas when one of the engines comes from the suspect batch.
Aircraft using alternative engines from CFM International (N:GE) (PA:SAF) are not affected.
Airbus says there are 113 Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo aircraft flying with 18 customers. It is in the midst of increasing output and last week said it may speed up further.
A prolonged delay could have a financial impact for the planemaker, as it waits for payments that usually fall due on delivery, and for leasing companies, who start receiving rent on aircraft allotted to airlines as soon as they enter service.
""It is too early to determine financial implications, but the fact that it impacts a limited population of engines is a potentially mitigating factor,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew McConnell said before the delivery freeze emerged.

""Still, this will put GTF (geared turbofan) execution issues back in the spotlight after a smooth few months when news flow was mostly focused on solid orders and ramping production.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Chase Coleman's hedge fund Tiger Global Management presented investors with a 28 percent gain last year when stocks zoomed higher, but he assured them he has not give up on betting against duds when the time is right.
""While we have heard, read, and seen many signs of capitulation from short-sellers, we remain highly committed to the strategy,"" the firm said in its most recent client letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Last year it was wrong-footed by bets against grocer Whole Foods and mall operator General Growth Properties and said that six of its shorts were acquired.
""It is time-consuming and difficult, but we know that there will be a period when our hard work pays dividends,"" the letter, said about the practice of betting that certain stocks' prices will fall. The letter was dated Jan. 31, only days before the market began selling off.
Tiger Global's dedication to short-selling may calm some frayed nerves after a tumultuous week when the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index tumbled 10 percent from its January peak. The firm listed rising inflation, an escalation in trade wars and geopolitical instability as potential short-term threats to markets and stocks crumbled this week amid fears that rising prices could prompt faster rate hikes.
Hedge funds long marketed themselves as being able to protect capital when markets drop, but during the bull market, short-selling has largely been a drag on returns. Many firms gave up trying to pick losers.
At Tiger Global short-selling ""detracted roughly 12 percent"" from returns at its Tiger Global Investments portfolio, in 2017, the letter said.
This week shorting was seen as a prudent strategy. Data from Hedge Fund Research show the average hedge fund lost 2.21 percent so far this month.
Tiger Global said it was keeping its short-selling skills sharp even after frustrating outcomes in 2017. ""As our mentor Julian Robertson used to say, short-selling is a bit like going to the gym. You're not just going to show up one day and become powerful; you have to put in the reps on a consistent basis.""

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",SEC says releasing Tezos documents could hurt enforcement activities,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A top U.S. securities regulator says it cannot release documents related to the cryptocurrency project Tezos because doing so could interfere with an investigation or enforcement activities, according to a document seen by Reuters on Friday.
In a letter dated Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission denied a public information request from a lawyer representing class-action plaintiffs who say they were defrauded by Tezos' $232 million fundraiser in July.
The SEC letter said an exemption allows it to withhold records if their release might ""interfere with enforcement activities."" But it added that use of the provision should not be taken to mean any legal violations had occurred. 
The letter does not say that Tezos itself is under investigation. The class-action lawyer, David Silver, provided the document to Reuters. A spokesman for the Tezos project's founders did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The SEC declined to comment.
Tezos raised money in a ""initial coin offering,"" a type of online fundraiser where a new cryptocurrency is issued to contributors. While the Tezos ICO remains one of the largest by amount raised, contributors have yet to receive the tokens because the project has been derailed by infighting between its promoters.
The battle pits the project's founders, Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, against Johann Gevers, the president of a Swiss foundation that was set up to conduct the ICO. The Zug-based Tezos Foundation controls the funds, while the Breitmans control the project's computer code.
A spokesman for the foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Reuters detailed the battle in an investigation in October. Since then several class-action lawsuits have been filed in the United States against the project's organizers alleging that the fundraiser violated federal securities laws and defrauded investors.
The Tezos fundraiser was structured as a donation, though some contributors believed it was an investment. 
If deemed a donation and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of the SEC. 
The SEC has been studying ICOs and issued an investor bulletin in July that warned that some cryptocurrencies issued in ICOs may be considered securities. 
""To the extent that digital assets like ICOs are securities - and I believe every ICO I've seen is a security - we have jurisdiction and our federal securities laws apply,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday. ""We will enforce these laws.""
Reuters made a public records request to the SEC for documents related to Tezos in November. On Dec. 12 the SEC responded by saying it had conducted a search but had not found any such documents.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 07:51PM ET</span>",Waymo accepts $245 million and Uber's 'regret' to settle self-driving car dispute,"By Alexandria Sage, Dan Levine and Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will pay $245 million worth of its own shares to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit to settle a legal dispute over trade secrets, allowing Uber's chief executive to move past one of the company's most bruising public controversies.
The settlement announcement on Friday brought an abrupt halt to the captivating case just before the fifth day of testimony was to begin at a jury trial in federal court in San Francisco. 
In a lawsuit filed last year, Waymo said that one of its former engineers who became chief of Uber's self-driving car project took with him thousands of confidential documents. 
The lawsuit cost Uber precious time in its self-driving car ambition, which is a key to its long-term profitability. Uber fired its self-driving chief after Waymo sued, and it is well behind on its plans to deploy fleets of autonomous cars in one of the most lucrative races in Silicon Valley.
The settlement allows Uber's chief executive officer, Dara Khosrowshahi, to put another scandal behind the company and move ahead with development of self-driving technology, following the tumultuous leadership by former CEO Travis Kalanick, who testified at the trial on Tuesday and Wednesday.
As part of the deal, Waymo gets a 0.34 percent stake in Uber, worth about $245 million based on Uber's current $72 billion valuation, a Waymo representative said. The settlement includes an agreement to ensure that Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated into Uber technology, which Waymo has said was its main goal in bringing the lawsuit. 
In settlement talks last year, Waymo had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, and wanted an independent monitor to ensure that Uber would not use Waymo technology in the future, Reuters reported. Waymo also asked for an apology. Uber rejected those terms as non-starters.
Waymo had agreed earlier this week to a settlement proposal valued at $500 million, and Khosrowshahi brought the proposal to the Uber board of directors, offering his support. 
But Uber's board rejected those terms on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the discussions said, sending Khosrowshahi and chief legal officer Tony West back to renegotiate. 
In the interim, the famously pugnacious Kalanick testified in court, maintaining a calm demeanor as he answered questions about Uber's soured relationship with Alphabet and his admiration for Anthony Levandowski, the self-driving-car engineer whose actions led to the lawsuit.
After four days of testimony, Waymo had presented little public evidence that Uber used Waymo's trade secrets.
By late Thursday, Waymo agreed to the $245 million deal, one of the sources said.
In a statement on Friday, Khosrowshahi expressed ""regret"" for Uber's actions.
""While we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo's proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work,"" Khosrowshahi said in a statement.
Lidar is a light-based sensor crucial to autonomous driving.
Neither company offered details on what those steps will entail. Shares of Alphabet closed up 3.8 percent on Friday.
Elizabeth Rowe, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law, analyzed about 150 trade secret verdicts through 2014 and said $245 million would rank as the second highest. Given that landscape, along with the fact that Alphabet CEO Larry Page could have had to testify next week, the settlement makes sense for Waymo, she said.
""Their risks would have gone up on many levels,"" Rowe said.
Waymo's lawsuit said that Levandowski had downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles in December 2015 before he went on to work at Uber in 2016.
The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a separate, criminal investigation into the trade secrets. Levandowski has never publicly addressed the allegations of taking the documents and law enforcement has not charged anyone with their theft. Levandowski was not a defendant in the case. 
SERIES OF PROBLEMS AT UBER 
The Waymo lawsuit was the most pressing legal battle for Uber, but only one item in a long list of controversies that has dogged the company for the last year. 
Public accusations of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace prompted an internal investigation at Uber that resulted in more than 20 people being fired, and the company faces multiple federal criminal probes. The company has also suffered from turmoil at the top with the ousting of Kalanick in June and a bitter board dispute.
Uber had planned to have self-driving cars in 20 cities by the end of 2018, 50 cities by 2019 and 150 by 2020, according to documents shown in court. It is far from achieving those ambitions.
Uber now has small pilots in Tempe, Arizona, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although it has acquired the necessary California permit, it still does not have self-driving cars transporting passengers there.
The settlement increases Alphabet's stake in Uber from an initial investment of $258 million in 2013, which at the time was Uber's largest fundraising round.
Uber has gone on to raise more than $14 billion in new funding and last month closed a deal with SoftBank Group Corp, in which the Japanese conglomerate, along with other investors, took about a 17.5 percent stake in the company. SoftBank bought the majority of its stake at about a 30 percent discount from Uber's valuation.
Autonomous cars offer a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to remake urban transportation systems, and companies including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and scores of startups are competing to develop the technology.
To prevail in the trial, Waymo would have had to prove not only that Uber acquired Waymo's trade secrets, but that it used them in its own technology.
Kalanick in a statement on Friday said the path to victory was clear: Uber's sole objective was to hire the most talented scientists and engineers and it had never possessed trade secrets. 

""Had the trial proceeded to its conclusion, it is clear Uber would have prevailed,"" Kalanick said.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Wall Street rebounds but posts worst week in two years,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a wild week with a burst of buying, pushing the S&P 500 up 1.5 percent on Friday, but still recorded their worst week in two years, and investors braced for more volatile trading days ahead.
The sharp falls of the week confirmed the market was in a correction, down more than 10 percent from a Jan. 26 record high, and throwing the nearly nine-year bull market off course. The newly volatile market was shaken in part by rising bond yields, which led stock investors to rethink their positions after months of steady gains.
The S&P 500 ended the week nearly 9 percent below the all-time high set just two weeks ago.
“I don't see any reason to think that we're setting a pattern for next week or the rest of the year,"" said Rob Stein, chief executive officer of Astor Investment Management in Chicago. ""The only pattern we're setting is more volatility."" 
On Friday alone, the S&P 500 swung from gains of up to 2.2 percent to declines of 1.9 percent, echoing the big swings of the past week. The Dow moved in a range of more than 1,000 points, a more modest change than on Monday when the Dow fell as much as nearly 1,600 points. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 330.44 points, or 1.38 percent, to 24,190.9, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 38.55 points, or 1.49 percent, to 2,619.55, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 97.33 points, or 1.44 percent, to 6,874.49. 
Technology (SPLRCT) was the best-performing group on Friday, with  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) giving the biggest individual boosts to the S&P 500. Energy (SPNY) was the lone major S&P sector to end negative as oil prices tumbled. 
(Graphic: S&P 500 Sector Performance - http://reut.rs/2Bk7XKJ)
The benchmark S&P 500 fell 5.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. For the week, the sector that got hammered the most was energy.
Ninety-six S&P 500 stocks are down 20 percent or more from their own one-year highs, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The sharp selloff in recent days was kicked off by concerns over rising inflation and bond yields, sparked by last week's January U.S. jobs report.
""You have a fundamental difference between the economy and earnings doing well, versus interest rates going up and inflation picking up, and it’s still a question of which will dominate,"" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
Equities for years have looked relatively attractive compared to the low yields offered by bonds, but the rise in Treasury yields has diminished the allure of stocks, especially with stock valuations at historically expensive levels.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) hovered around 2.85 percent after touching a four-year peak of 2.885 percent on Monday.
“That’s part of this recalculation that has gone on in the market: How do we factor in higher bond yields?"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. ""And that is a process that is playing out.""
U.S. fund investors sucked $23.9 billion out of the stock market in the latest week, marking the largest withdrawals from those funds on record, but bulls were still encouraged by strength in the global economy and solid U.S. corporate earnings.
Also, the percentage of Main Street investors expecting stocks to fall reached a three-month high in the American Association of Individual Investors' weekly survey.
(Graphic: Bearish sentiment among individual investors - http://reut.rs/2BkoI8t)
During Friday's session, the S&P 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched technical level, before rising.
""You will often see bounces off those levels,"" said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston.
The S&P 500 lost $2.49 trillion in market value from Jan. 26 through Thursday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Volatility remained high compared to recent months. The market's main gauge of volatility, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), fell 4.4 to 29.06 on Friday but was still nearly three times the average level of the past year.
In the latest day of strong trading volume, about 12 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Friday, well above the 8.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. It was the first time weekly volume eclipsed 50 billion since August 2015.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.36-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 47 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 208 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended with a more than 1 percent gain on Friday after another session of whipsaw trading, though the Dow and S&P 500 posted their biggest weekly losses since January 2016.
Even with Friday's gains, all three major U.S. indexes were down more than 5 percent for the week, and investors said the sharp swings that marked the week's trading were likely to continue.
""I don't see any reason to think that we're setting a pattern for next week or the rest of the year. The only pattern we're setting is more volatility,"" said Rob Stein, chief executive officer of Astor Investment Management in Chicago.
The Dow had a more than 1,000-point difference between its high and low. Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, ended lower on the day but it remained well above its recent trading range.
Benchmark 10-year note yields closed a volatile week little changed as stocks gained and investors were likely wary of holding positions over the weekend. Oil prices fell more than 3 percent.
Concerns about higher bond yields and interest rates spurred recent selling of equities, disrupting an extended advance in stocks, though the retreat in the U.S. market had been long awaited by investors.
Higher yields tend to hurt equities because they increase borrowing costs for companies and ultimately consumers. They also present an alternative to investors who may reallocate some funds to bonds from equities.
On Thursday, the Dow and S&P 500 indexes slumped more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 record highs, confirming they were in correction territory.
Stocks on Friday began to bounce after the S&P 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, a level seen as technical support.
""You will often see bounces off those levels. In fundamentals, I did not see any news around that time when the market started turning around,"" said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 330.44 points, or 1.38 percent, to 24,190.9, the S&P 500 gained 38.55 points, or 1.49 percent, to 2,619.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 97.33 points, or 1.44 percent, to 6,874.49.
Next week, coming off one of the most volatile stretches in years, two important readings on U.S. inflation could help determine whether the stock market begins to settle or if another bout of volatility is in store.
WORLD STOCKS ALSO SUFFER WORST WEEK SINCE 2011
European shares fell 5.3 percent for the week, their biggest weekly drop since January 2016, and an index of world stocks also suffered its largest weekly percentage drop since January 2016. It was barely higher on Friday. 
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.40 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04 percent.
Emerging market stocks lost 1.74 percent.
Earlier, the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled as much as 6.0 percent to its lowest since May 2017, and the blue chip CSI300 index dived 6.1 percent.
Chinese equities were hurt by the drop in global shares and by traders closing positions before the Lunar New Year holidays starting next week.
Rising U.S. debt issuance is expected to weigh on bond prices in coming months.
The U.S. House of Representatives joined the Senate early on Friday in approving a budget bill that raises military and domestic spending by almost $300 billion over the next two years. With no offsets in the form of other spending cuts or new tax revenue, that additional outlay will be financed with borrowed money.
On Friday, benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8566 percent, from 2.849 percent late on Thursday.
In currencies, the dollar rose for its strongest week against a basket of currencies in nearly 15 months as some traders piled into the greenback after the volatility in stocks and bonds.
The dollar index rose 0.1 percent, with the euro down 0.1 percent to $1.2233. On the week, the dollar index gained 1.41 percent for its best week in almost 15 months.
Oil prices slid more than 3 percent as U.S. futures fell below $60 a barrel for the first time since December on concerns about rising crude supplies.
U.S. crude settled down $1.95, or 3.2 percent, to $59.20, the lowest settlement since Dec. 22. Brent futures fell $2.02 a barrel, or 3.1 percent, to $62.79 a barrel, its lowest settlement since Dec. 13.

Volatility Awoke From Slumber To Wipe Trillions Off Global Markets
Global equities came under heavy selling pressure this week, losing as much as $6 trillion in stock market capitalization as investors fled risk assets amid a spike in bond yields, while a shake-up in volatility-sensitive securities triggered a jump in volatility. 
The selloff was characterised by a sharp move higher in the so-called fear index VIX as market participants using financial instruments such as  XIV ETN, - to place highly leveraged bets against rising volatility - were caught off-guard after volatility awoke from its slumber rising to levels not seen since 2015.
Others, however, pointed to the rise in US bond yields as a reason for the selloff, claiming that higher bonds yields would go head-to-head with equities, competing for a larger chunk of investors’ portfolios.
The Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,600 points on Monday, recording its biggest ever points drop, but staged a late comeback Friday to close 330 points higher, offering a sliver of hope for the bulls, despite a 5% loss for the week.
Some said the late stage comeback in equities Friday was triggered after the S&P 500 fell below its 200-day moving average of 2,538.9, attracting technical support.
No Where To Hide: WTI Crude Saw Biggest Weekly Slide Since November 2016 
Crude oil prices settled at its lowest since November 2016 after a deluge of recent data reaffirmed investor expectations of rising US output which threatens to derail efforts by major oil producers to rein in excess supplies. 
The number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 26 to 791, the highest level since April 2, 2015, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
The Energy Information Administration, meanwhile, released Wednesday its weekly inventory totals showing both US crude and output rose.
On Friday U.S. crude futures fell 3.9% to settle at $59.20 a barrel.
Bank of England Rate Hike Talks Not Enough To Save Sterling From Slide 
The Bank of England stood pat on interest rates Thursday but signalled it may need to raise rates earlier than expected to curb the rapid pace of inflation.
The dollar, almost immediately, came under pressure as sterling rose 1% but gains proved short-lived as the greenback recovered sharply confining sterling to both a second straight weekly loss and the steepest fall since October.
GBP/USD fell 0.65% to $1.3821.
Gold Fell To Rising Dollar, Bond Yield Pressure For Second Straight Week
Soaring bonds yields and a rising dollar pressured gold prices to its second weekly loss. The yellow metal fell to about $1,315 an ounce from its weekly high of about $1,349 an ounce.
Sentiment on gold prices appeared to have turned sour as data CFTC COT data showed money managers cut their long bets on gold for the second straight week.
Crypto Fell. Fell Some More. Eventually Rebounded
Not be outdone by wild moves in equities, cryptocurrencies staged a roller-coaster ride of their own as bitcoin fell as much as 36% to a low of $6,000 before setting off on a rally above $8,000.
The move higher appears to be backed by new inflows into the market as the total cryptocurrency market cap at $420 billion, at the time of writing, rose nearly $100 billion from the lows seen at the depths of the tumble Monday.
Yet it remains to be seen whether the new entrants will continue to stay loyal to the “hodl” as total crypto market cap remained well below its early January peak of roughly $829 billion.
Bitcoin fell roughly 1.40% to $8,555.8 over the past seven days, while Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell 4.95% to $859.78 over the past seven days.
Ripple XRP, meanwhile, rose 6.95% to $0.89077, over the past seven days."

Three days after the implosion of an exchange-traded note betting on low volatility, Fidelity Investments said it had moved to protect investors from these products.
The fund giant is halting customer purchases of three volatility-focused exchange traded funds, Robert Beauregard, a company spokesman, said in an email. They are: ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures (SVXY), VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), and the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium Term ETN (ZIV).
The ban started Feb. 6, Beauregard said. The firm didn’t issue the news publicly until Friday. “We are allowing customers to sell out of existing positions,” he said.
Representatives for TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. said Friday that customers can still trade SVXY. Ameritrade, however, is holding a 100 percent margin requirement for those purchases, spokeswoman Kim Hillyer said.
Brokerage firms including E-Trade have moved to protect customers as global markets have plunged and volatility has surged. The fallout from the implosion of a vast array of arcane bets against stock-market volatility mounted this week.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG moved to liquidate one investment product and more than a dozen others were halted after their values sunk toward zero.
SVXY is down 91 percent since last Friday, XIV plunged 96 percent and ZIV fell 27 percent.
The Financial Times earlier reported on the Fidelity’s decision.
Fidelity said customers who want to buy funds that borrow money to increase their returns must sign an agreement that lays out the risks of the products and acknowledge that they have a “most aggressive” risk tolerance.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments on Friday told clients they could not buy shares in an exchange-traded fund that bets on the direction of Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" after the product was sideswiped by a selloff in stocks and lost 90 percent of its value this week. 
The company placed restrictions on investor purchases of ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, the latest investment product profiting from market calm to fall victim to the recent upsurge in volatility. 
""This security is restricted from online opening trades or restricted to closing trades only,"" said an alert on Fidelity's popular online brokerage.
Fund manager ProShare Advisors LLC was not immediately available for comment.
In recent years investors piled into options, futures, swaps and exchange-traded products that bet on low or falling volatility, in some cases earning triple-digit annual returns as markets trended higher.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Tuesday it would terminate the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the S&P 500 after its value plunged during the global market rout. That product is a rival of SVXY, which is not closing.

The once-$800 million LJM Preservation and Growth Fund that relied heavily on a similar strategy lost more than 80 percent of its value in recent market turmoil, and this week closed its doors to new investment.

1176,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. stock market chill threatens to 'put IPOs on ice',"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wide swings in the U.S. stock market has blunted initial public offering (IPO) activity on Wall Street in what was set to be the busiest week for new listings in more than two-and-a-half years. 
All signs points to the disruption to IPOs continuing.
Ten companies had planned U.S. stock market debuts for this week, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused exchange traded funds. It would have followed the biggest January haul of IPO proceeds on record, and would have been the most active IPO week since June 2015, Thomson Reuters data showed. 
Only six companies went ahead with their IPO due to the volatile stock market, which has sapped much of the investor demand for new listings.
This bodes poorly for companies looking to pull the IPO trigger in the short term. 
Forty companies have filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the past year, aiming to raise an aggregate $9.2 billion, according to data from Renaissance Capital. This does not include so-called confidential IPO filings which are not yet visible on the SEC's website. 
""This volatility has the potential to put IPOs on ice,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital. 
A saving grace for the IPO market is that mid-February typically sees a lull period for new listings. This is because the year-end financial information necessary for filing an IPO by a calendar-year company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes stale in the middle of this month. After that, companies will need to compile and audit a new set of quarterly earnings. Only three IPOs are currently scheduled for next week.
""When stability does come back to the market, the IPO market should benefit from a growing domestic and global economy with heightened consumer confidence,"" said Lear Beyer, co-head of Equity Capital Markets Origination and head of Financial Institutions Group Origination at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
U.S. stocks see-sawed this week, demonstrating swings Wall Street has not seen in years. The S&P 500 closed down 3.75 percent on Thursday and was on track for its biggest weekly percentage drop since 2011.
IPO postponements included a $500-million listing of IPSCO Tubulars, the U.S. subsidiary of Russian oil and gas pipe maker TMK; the $220-million flotation of Turkish fast-food chain operator TFI Tab Food Investments; and a $130-million listing by Argentine biotechnology firm Bioceres.
Medical technology company Motus GI, scheduled to list on Thursday, also did not price its IPO this week. 
The biggest IPO to go ahead was the $437-million listing for Cactus Inc, which supplies wellheads and pressure control equipment. 
Other listings included Victory Capital Holdings and Chinese wearable technology company Huami, although the Victory IPO priced at $13 per share, below its $17 to $19 indicated price range. Cardlytics priced on Thursday in a $70-million listing. 
Listings for blank-check company Mudrick Capital and medical aesthetics provider Evolus Inc went ahead, while Quintana Energy Services sold shares at $10, below its $12-$15 target range.
Of the seven listings this week, four were trading below their IPO prices on Friday. 

""Investors will be looking at what companies and sectors will benefit from the impact of the recent tax reform and a higher interest rate environment relative to inflation fears that have disrupted the market,"" said Beyer.

Earlier this month, model and actress Kate Upton tweeted accusing Marciano of using his power to harass women.
On Feb. 1 Guess Inc (N:GES) shares fell more than 17 percent following the claims by Upton accusing Marciano of harassing women. 
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in early February, the company denied any misconduct on the part of Marciano, but said it would investigate Upton's concerns if it determines they had merit. Marciano also separately denied the claims. 
The fashion retailer had then said it would investigate Upton's claims ""once they are known to determine if they have any merit.""
The committee will be made up of two independent directors, the company said in a statement on Friday.

Reuters has not independently confirmed the claims.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A winter storm swept across the northern U.S. Midwest on Friday, dumping up to nine inches (23 cm) of snow on Chicago and snarling hundreds of flights as it rolled east to threaten New York state and New England.
Chicago's metropolitan area was blanketed with its heaviest snowfall since at least late 2016 as the storm put an icy grip on much of Wisconsin, northern Illinois and Michigan.
The snow caused dozens of crashes on icy Chicago expressways as residents of the third-biggest U.S. city struggled to get to work and to dig out from a storm system that had stretched from Montana to Michigan.
“I hate you, Chicago!” Ieva Urbietyte, a 25-year-old customer service representative, said she thought while cleaning snow off her car in the Windy City. “Thankfully we don’t have to do this all the time.”
Weather forecasters in Detroit warned that snowfall there could surpass one inch (2.5 cm) an hour as the system headed east.
At the Argus Farm Stop in nearby Ann Arbor, Michigan, several customers arrived on skis, and store manager Laura Barch said she was eager to get into her snowshoes.
“I feel like this is going to be the one day out of the year” to use them, said Barch. ""This is the first real winter we’ve had in several years.”
Wind chill temperatures were expected to drop below 0 Fahrenheit (-18 C) in many areas across the upper Midwest. The central and northern Rockies also will see heavy snow, the National Weather Service said.
City officials announced school closures in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee because of the weather. 
National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said on Friday that the system was likely to drop another four or five inches (10 or 12.5 cm) of snow on the Midwest by the evening as it headed east toward New England.
The storm could dump up to a foot (30 cm) of snow in New York state as it picks up moisture off the Great Lakes, he added.
About 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, with about a third of flights into or out of Chicago and Detroit airports called off, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks airline traffic.

Winter weather this week killed people in accidents in the Midwest, including six in Iowa, two in Missouri and one in Montana, local media in those states reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jessica Jones, 26, jokes that when she wants to spend more money, she goes on Instagram. 
Jones, an at-home care provider in California, often gets the urge to buy the same shoes or makeup she sees people wearing when she scrolls through Instagram’s stream of carefully curated images. Last week, she bought a pair of Dolls Kill high heels embroidered with pink roses after seeing them on the app. 
Those Instagram-inspired purchases put Jones in good company. A recent study found that 57 percent of U.S. millennials shell out money they had not planned to spend because of what they see on social media. 
“Social media can be very aspirational, because people often post things that are an idealized version of what they’re living,” said Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert at NerdWallet. “You might get good ideas for a vacation or an outfit or jewelry, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but it might not fit into your budget.""
Nearly 90 percent of millennials (ages 20 to 36) surveyed by Allianz (DE:ALVG) Life Insurance Co of North America said social media pushes people to compare their wealth and lifestyle to others'. Only 71 percent of Generation X (ages 37 to 51), and just 54 percent of baby boomers (52 to 70) feel the same way. 
Enviable images of other peoples’ lives used to come mostly from glossy magazines and TV, but now we are constantly getting a peek via social media. 
“It can be an overwhelming influence on how you see the world,” said Paul Kelash, vice president of consumer insights at Allianz Life. “If you pay too much attention, then you might start making decisions you otherwise wouldn’t in your spending.”
DO I REALLY NEED IT?
To avoid getting into financial trouble, be honest about what is most important to you. 
“Ask: Do I really need that, or do I just want it?” Kelash said. 
Once that line is clearly differentiated, keep track of your budget and set goals. For the short term, that could be a vacation. A medium-term goal might be a house, while a long-term goal for most of us is retirement, he added.
The temptation to spend is partly why Joanna Zheng, a 24-year-old equity analyst in New York, recently cut back on her social media use. 
“Seeing a friend (on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Instagram) who is particularly well-dressed or has a cute purse makes me wonder how I can enhance my own wardrobe,” Zheng said.
When Zheng shops, however, she rarely regrets it and makes sure to compensate in other ways. Recently, Zheng bought a pair of merino wool Allbirds sneakers for around $100 that a friend recommended after later seeing several ads on Facebook. For the next few weeks, she avoided shopping areas to stem temptation.
Advertising companies understand how powerful social media ads can be. In 2017, Facebook alone brought in $39.9 billion of revenue from ads. Companies will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to have their product mentioned in social media posts by an influencer with a large following. 
Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, recently rolled out Instagram Shopping, which allows people to view product descriptions and pricing without ever leaving the app
Spending is also driven by posts from friends and family. In the Allianz Life survey, more than half of millennials report a “fear or missing out,"" also known as FOMO. In fact, 61 percent said they feel inadequate about their own life and what they have because of social media. 
To curb impulse purchases, decide ahead of time whether you are going online to shop or if you are just browsing, Palmer advises. Close out other shopping tabs to limit spending.
And rather than buying things immediately, Palmer suggests putting things in your basket to save and then revisit in a day or two. That makes it easier to take a step back and ask if the purchase fits your goals and budget. 
An added bonus: Sometimes retailers will send a discount code to entice you to buy. 
“It’s about separating that initial impulse to buy,"" Palmer said.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 02:17PM ET</span>",Airbus ordered to pay $99 million fine in Eurofighter case,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have ordered Airbus (PA:AIR) to pay 81.25 million euros ($99 million) to settle one of two investigations into alleged corruption surrounding the sale of Eurofighter combat jets to Austria in 2003, the two sides said on Friday.
The settlement includes an administrative fine of 250,000 euros and ""disgorgement"" - which legal experts broadly define as the recovery of ill-gotten gains - of 81 million euros.
Munich prosecutors have been investigating whether Airbus issued bribes to win the $2 billion contract: charges it denies. 
In a statement, prosecutors said they had not found evidence of bribery but that Airbus had been unable to account for over 100 million euros in payments to two shell companies.
EADS, as the main Airbus parent group was known at the time, sent funds totaling a triple-digit-million euro amount to Vector Aerospace LLP and City Chambers Limited, they added.
Most of these funds, by evading internal control mechanisms, had been used for what the prosecutors said were ""unclear purposes"", adding it could not be finally determined what the funds had been spent on.
Airbus said in a statement the penalty, which it had agreed to pay, related to the ""negligent breach of supervisory duties"" by unidentified members of Airbus Defence and Space’s former management. 
The former managers failed to ensure proper controls that would have prevented payments to ""business partners"" without the company getting proven services in exchange.
Airbus regularly uses the term ""business partners"" to refer to foreign sales agents or intermediaries. 
It is being investigated separately in France and Britain over the handling of agents in the sale of commercial jets.
While Friday's settlement ends the Munich investigation, Airbus and individuals including Chief Executive Tom Enders, who headed the company's defense business from 2000 to 2005, face an ongoing investigation in Vienna into the Eurofighter deal.

Airbus and Enders have denied wrongdoing and accused the Austrian government of playing politics with the investigation.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Renault's Mueller quits, clearing CEO succession path - sources","By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) Chief Performance Officer Stefan Mueller is leaving the company, sources told Reuters on Friday - likely clearing the way for rival candidate Thierry Bollore to be named second-in-command and eventual successor to CEO Carlos Ghosn.
Bollore, currently chief competitive officer, had been vying with Mueller for promotion in the succession process underway at  Renault . The former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive's departure was agreed this week, according to one of the company sources.
""As of today Stefan Mueller has not left the company,"" Renault spokesman Frederic Texier said. He declined to comment when asked whether Mueller's departure had been decided.
German-born Mueller and Bollore, a French former  Michelin  (PA:MICP) executive, both joined Renault in 2012.
Ghosn, 63, had earlier been expected to hand over the reins to a new chief executive and move to a another role at the helm of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.
But sources said the plan foundered on differences with the French state, Renault's biggest shareholder, over the alliance's future shape and direction. Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan (T:7201), which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) via a 34 percent stake.
Renault now plans to propose Ghosn's reappointment to the next annual shareholder meeting in June, sources also said, confirming a Feb. 1 report in Le Figaro.
The government has yet to agree with Renault on a ""road map"" for the alliance or bless Bollore's promotion to the new position of chief operating officer and heir apparent.
Both sides are seeking to avoid a repeat of a bitter 2015 clash in which France raised its Renault stake to swing a shareholder vote and secure double voting rights. The government also pushed unsuccessfully for a full Renault-Nissan merger on terms that would safeguard French industrial interests.

The appointment of Ghosn's second-in-command is expected to be approved at a Feb. 15 board meeting ahead of Renault's full-year results presentation the following day.

1184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 01:02PM ET</span>",Investors in These Assets Aren't Sweating the Turmoil in Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s the week that brought the stock market to its knees. But while that’s sending jitters across asset classes, there’s still no sign of a widespread flight to safety.
Even as global equities tumbled amid a surge in volatility, signs of risk-off sentiment across currencies, bonds and commodities have remained muted. Haven assets including gold and the Swiss franc dropped, while riskier counterparts such as peripheral European bonds rallied.
The Yield Curve
There’s no indication of a potential inversion of the U.S. yield curve -- often perceived as the harbinger of recession -- in the foreseeable future. If anything, a long-sustained flattening of the Treasury yield curve has been brought to a sharp halt amid the slump in equities.
For James Athey, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, that’s because investors are picking up on signs that inflation is finally rearing its head in developed economies after years of accommodative central bank policy. The prospect of an inverted curve has been pushed further down the line.
“Piece by piece, the pillars supporting the view that inflation was dead are being chipped away,” Athey said in emailed comments. “The market is having to re-adjust to potentially accommodate a more inflationary world and that means a steeper curve.”
Volatility gauges for U.S. Treasuries, gold and currencies have only increased relatively marginally even as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped to a two-year high. That provides a sign of reassurance that the fallout may be limited for investors, according to Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors Inc.
The Swiss franc is heading for its worst week in two months against the dollar, suggesting the equity turmoil did little to boost its haven appeal. While the yen rose this week, its gains still fell short of reversing the previous week’s slump.
“This doesn’t seem like your typical risk-off FX market despite what we’re seeing in global equities,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at ING Bank NV. “The contagion effects are fairly muted in terms of size, extent and what would be expected.”
Widely considered one of the safest asset types to own, German bunds languished near multi-year lows this week, while traditionally riskier peripheral European bonds in Spain and Italy climbed. That goes to show that traders are realizing that the era of easy money may be coming to an end, according to Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank in London.
“It’s interest rates in the lead at the moment, so this isn’t an equity slide on risk-off,” he said in emailed comments. “Things are better than expected, to the point where they need to factor in more tightening from central banks.”
That’s not to say non-equity markets are unperturbed. Volatility on junk bonds and emerging-market stocks jumped to a two-year high this week. Still, the iShares iBoxx U.S. high-yield bond exchange-traded fund has extended its outperformance against the iShares Treasuries fund, underplaying any notion of panic.
Gold prices are set for their second weekly decline. Prospects of faster monetary tightening in the U.K. and the U.S. had a greater pull on the precious metal, dragging it to its cheapest level in more than a month this week.

The move is the latest step by Nestle to expand its profile in healthy foods as it seeks to offset weakness in the packaged foods sector.
Nestle did not say how much it was paying and how big a stake it was taking in the company, which was founded in Ecuador in 2005, before expanding in the rest of South America and Britain and the United States.
As part of its health ramp up, Nestle spent $2.3 billion (1.65 billion pounds) on Canadian vitamin maker Atribum Innovations in December. It also announced deals for Sweet Earth vegetarian foods and Blue Bottle coffee last September and Chameleon Cold-Brew coffee in November.

LONDON (Reuters) - It has been a brutal week for world markets: More than $6 trillion in stock market capitalization lost in a selloff, the biggest one-day spike in the market's ""fear gauge"", and burned investors who bet on a period of extended calm.
Here are eight charts aimed at showing the extent of the damage, giving an end-of-week snapshot of markets, and helping assess the outlook.
Stocks hit reset button on 2018 - http://reut.rs/2BNP0Bl
STOCKS SAVAGED
Since the selloff began on Feb. 2, stocks have lost more than $6 trillion in market capitalization worldwide, and the MSCI World Index has erased all of its year-to-date gains.
Sea of red - http://reut.rs/2BiGglE 
As the above graphic shows, the selloff has battered Asian stocks the most, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's two main indices suffering losses in excess of 8 percent. U.S. shares come in next, followed by those in emerging markets, while European shares have suffered least.
Here is a snapshot of global markets' performance since Jan. 29:
Global markets change since Jan 29 - http://reut.rs/2BkbB7k
BETS ON EXTENDED CALM BURNED
The VIX index, also known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", saw its biggest one-day spike higher, forcing an implosion of products that bet on an extended period of calm.
As the graphic that follows shows, exchange-traded products (ETPs) that bet on low volatility all took massive hits. 
Volatility seismograph - http://reut.rs/2BjQK3X
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Tuesday it will shutter the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, likely leaving holders with just pennies on the dollar. 
Nomura Securities will redeem its Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed S&P 500 Vix Inverse ETN after a sharp equity selloff since late last week triggered a massive loss in the product.
Proshares says its short VIX short-term futures ETF will be open for trading on Tuesday and it expects normal operations going forward.
EXPLOSION CONTAINED
The spike in the VIX index has been far in excess of that seen in volatility indexes that track other assets such as currencies, gold and bonds.
Explosion contained - http://reut.rs/2BPKF0w 
THE TRIGGER 
Analysts say the huge spike in the VIX index was due to a rise in bond yields, on fears that central banks may start raising interest rates sooner as inflation picks up. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury is close to a four-year high of 2.885 percent, while J.P. Morgan's Global Bond Index has fallen to its lowest in four years. Both moves have also sparked a debate over whether a bull market in bonds is coming to an end.

Short volatility products take massive hit - http://reut.rs/2BSNCgG
THE OUTLOOK 
So is this the end of the global equity bull run? Analysts say economic fundamentals remain strong. Citi's Economic Surprise Index for the Group of 10 countries remains in strongly positive territory. A positive reading for the index suggests that economic releases have on balance been beating consensus.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Frenzied demand for Nvidia's graphic chips shoot prices through the roof,"By Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp's (O:NVDA) graphic processors, or GPUs, are so overwhelmingly popular that gamers and cryptocurrency miners are willing to pay up to three times the original list price to get their hands on its cards online.
The company's GeForce 1070 chip set, which retailed at $349 a year ago, was going for up to $900 from electronics wholesalers on Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) Friday, and the same demand stood behind a stellar set of corporate results on Thursday.
The company's share price rose 6 percent in early trading on Friday after at least 14 Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock - a measure of the confidence around the stock among sector analysts.
Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia's high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin.
The company's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners.
""We do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results.
Analysts also say Nvidia's competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year. 
The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia's revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.
The company's quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as  Alibaba  (N:BABA), Amazon (O:AMZN), Alphabet (O:GOOGL),  IBM  (N:IBM) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) adopted the new chip in their servers.
Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption.
One pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter.

Auto revenue was down as auto infotainment was becoming commoditized and the company is going through a revenue transition phase to ramping its autonomous driving platforms in volume likely in 2019,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Ross Seymore said.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 10:16AM ET</span>",Former Credit Suisse 'star' gets five years in jail for fraud,"By Stephanie Nebehay and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
GENEVA (Reuters) - Former  Credit Suisse  wealth manager Patrice Lescaudron was sentenced to five years in prison by a Geneva court on Friday for abusing the trust of clients and creating a fraudulent scheme that made him tens of millions of Swiss francs. 
The 54-year-old Frenchman appeared in court for the verdict wearing a grey fleece sweatshirt emblazoned with Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), the name of the sports car he purchased with the money he amassed.
Judge Alexandra Banna said the former banker was guilty of serious fraud and forgery in his handling of former clients, including former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and Russian oligarch Vitaly Malkin, over an eight year period. 
Reading the three-judge tribunal's verdict, she said he had caused losses totaling 143 million francs ($152 million) and made personal gains of 30 million francs.
The adviser was ""considered as a star"" on the bank's Russia desk, but had ""fooled the bank and the client"" through a fraud in which he ""copy-pasted signatures on documents so as to falsify transfer orders,"" Banna said.
Lescaudron admitted in court to having falsified trades and hidden mounting losses.
CRIMINAL ENERGY
Lawyers for billionaire Ivanishvili said fraudulent activities by the adviser lost the former Georgian leader hundreds of millions of dollars.
Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) said on Friday it was satisfied with the verdict. ""However, we will run a careful review and assess whether an appeal is made for technical reasons,"" the bank said in a statement.
The Zurich-based bank has said Lescaudron violated internal rules and Swiss law and worked to conceal this from the bank.
""Two years of criminal investigation have not revealed any indication that the former relationship manager was helped with his criminal actions by other Credit Suisse employees,"" the bank said in January. 
Lawyers for Ivanishvili have alleged Lescaudron was not a lone wolf, saying senior management had knowledge of his activity and the bank did not take action, but instead continued to charge commission payments on the products sold. They said in August that Ivanishvili was suing Credit Suisse.
Prosecutor Yves Bertossa told reporters on Friday he would not comment on the bank's role in the matter because it was the subject of a parallel procedure.
Lescaudron's sentence matched what prosecutors had sought.
VAST FORTUNES
Lescaudron amassed personal wealth of 32 million francs, including houses in Switzerland and the Italian seaside resort of Porto Cervo, and a Picasso lithograph.
His assets, including the Ferrari, a Rolex watch and jewels that the judge said had been financed by his crimes, were seized among items listed in a seven-page sequestration.
He was ordered to make repayments totaling more than $130 million, but was not barred from future work in banking.
The Porto Cervo house was seized, but the Lescaudrons were allowed to keep their family home in Arzier, Switzerland. 
Lescaudron has already spent two years in pre-trial detention, where the court heard he cooperated on the case and exhibited ""exemplary behavior.""
""The sentence is very harsh,"" Lescaudron's lawyer Simon Ntah said, adding he hoped the sentence would be commuted for good behavior so Lescaudron could be released in April 2019.

Britain's Monarch and Germany's Air Berlin both went bust last year, but the process was very different. 
Air Berlin was able to keep flying for just over two months thanks to a government bridge loan while it sought buyers for its operations, but Monarch's right to fly was withdrawn immediately, leaving thousands of passengers stranded and staff abruptly out of work. 
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said there should be a ""reasonable timeframe"" within which airlines could continue operating after entering insolvency to allow more passengers to complete their journeys. 
""It is up to member states to look at ways to better manage a bankruptcy,"" Monique de Smet, Director EU Affairs at IATA, told Reuters on Friday.
The European travel agents and tour operators' association last month said the EU Commission should introduce a mandatory mechanism to protect passengers against airline failure, with the cost borne by airlines and included in ticket prices.
Meanwhile, the UK has launched a review of consumer protection in the event of an airline or travel company failure in the wake of the Monarch collapse.
IATA says a rescue fund is not necessary and would distort competition, highlighting that its members in Europe already have a voluntary agreement to offer rescue fares to those needing to return home.
""This was used a lot with the Monarch case. If passengers are stranded again tomorrow, we already have a tool that works well,"" de Smet said, adding that buying tickets with credit cards also offered protection. 
Repatriating more than 100,000 Monarch passengers is estimated to have cost the British government about 60 million pounds ($83 million). The German government loan that kept Air Berlin flying for two months was for 150 million euros ($184 million).
That loan was due to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of Air Berlin's operations. However, after Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) pulled out of a deal to buy its Niki unit, that money seems unlikely to be repaid in full, which has led to criticism of the government's decision to award the loan from opposition politicians.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Expedia shares sink after disappointing 2018 forecast,"By Ankit Ajmera and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. online travel services company  Expedia  (O:EXPE) fell 16 percent in premarket trading on Friday, after forecasting 2018 selling and marketing costs would outpace revenue growth as it battles rivals for market share.
The company, which owns Expedia.com and Hotels.com, reported equally disappointing previous quarter results partly due to underperformance at its Trivago (O:TRVG) hotel-search website.
The latest quarter was the first full quarter under Expedia's new Chief Executive Officer Mark Okerstrom, who succeeded Dara Khosrowshahi after he left to take the top job at car-ride provider Uber Technologies Inc.
""Under the new management, Expedia is more aggressively investing in tech and marketing to scale its global footprint and catch up to industry leader Priceline Group Inc (O:PCLN), which currently has approximately 2x the inventory and room nights sold as Expedia,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.
Mahaney lowered his price target to $141 from $155, while maintaining an ""outperform"" rating.
Concerns that the apparent inventory war brewing between Priceline and Expedia after the management transition could weigh on the sector in a similar manner to what happened in China with online travel company Qunar, said Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos.
Profitability at Qunar and rival Ctrip (O:CTRP) were hurt a few years ago after a costly price war involving discount coupons to gain a bigger pie of the booming Chinese online travel sector.
""We don't envision a pleasant end to the apparent pricing war any time soon, noting that the Qunar situation took nearly 18 months to fully resolve itself,"" Kurnos said, downgrading the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and suspending a price target for the stock.
Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia said on Thursday that investments in its core business and in vacation rental site HomeAway, which competes with Airbnb, as well as higher cloud spending will hurt the first quarter of 2018.
Yet some analysts were optimistic about the long term prospects of Expedia as investments including increased hiring at its lodging business would drive faster earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow growth in 2019.
""We acknowledge Expedia is now likely to be a show-me story until the second and the third quarter... but we remain ""over weight"" and are buyers of (the stock),""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak said, lowering his price target to $150 from $160.

Up to Thursday's close of $123.03, Expedia's shares had risen about 0.2 percent in the past 12 months, underperforming a 13.6 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Travel and Leisure index (DJUSCG).

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","Sanctions bolstering Russian IT sector, IBS Group CEO says","By Maria Kiselyova and Anastasia Teterevleva
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian customers have stepped up purchases of Russian-made software due to the weaker rouble and the risk that contracts with foreign suppliers could be affected by Western sanctions, the head of Russian IT services company IBS Group told Reuters.
Demand for software is also rising as economic recovery leads Russian companies to once again invest in technology, Svetlana Balanova, IBS chief executive, said.
""Some customers who would consider (Germany's) SAP before, are now considering Russian IT systems - either 1C or Galaktika,"" she said in an interview.
Some are deterred by the cost of acquiring software from foreign suppliers after a sharp drop in the rouble. Others, mostly state customers, fear fallout from sanctions.
""Some sanctions have already been imposed and there could be more, and for many clients getting rid of sanctions risks is a clear business decision,"" Balanova said.
SAP , Europe's biggest technology company, has not lost any Russian clients because of sanctions risks, Natalia Parmenova, SAP's executive director in Russia and CIS, said in an emailed comment in response to an enquiry from Reuters.
SAP competed with Russian software producers only in niche products while SAP's portfolio was much broader, she said.
Balanova said IBS, whose customers include state energy majors Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Rosneft, was experiencing double-digit sales growth, but she gave no figures.
In 2016, according to market research firm IDC, IBS was among the market leaders in Russia in IT services revenue growth, posting a rise of around 30 percent in dollar terms.
While Western software companies have not themselves been targeted by sanctions, new sanctions restrict U.S. software companies' ability to extend credit to Russian financial or energy companies on a U.S. sanctions list.
RESTRICTIONS
Two of Microsoft's official distributors in Russia have imposed restrictions on sales of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) software to more than 200 Russian companies following new U.S. sanctions.
U.S. software company  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) has warned Russian oil companies that new deals, that are not in compliance with expanded U.S. sanctions, could not be signed, Russian daily Kommersant reported on Thursday.
Other Western software suppliers could potentially be affected by U.S. sanctions if they do business in the United States and Russian businesses fear the EU could take similar measures.
""We have customers for whom we develop solutions taking into account sanctions risks,"" Balanova said.
In an environment where many businesses seek affordable alternatives to foreign software, IBS has made product development a priority.
""We are currently seeing a very big demand for IT,"" Balanova said, adding the government's drive to digitalize state services has become a major new driver for the market.
Sources said in December that IBS, which dropped a Frankfurt listing in 2014 after spinning off its Luxoft unit, was again considering floating shares in 2018.
Balanova said IBS, whose main shareholder is Russian veteran tech entrepreneur Anatoly Karachinskiy, was considering fundraising, but declined to elaborate. 
""We grow ahead of the market and it's the right moment to accelerate our growth even further,"" Balanova said.
Over the past few years, IBS has transformed itself from a systems integrator into a company providing services from application consulting, customization and maintenance to design of IT infrastructure and product development.
Balanova said IBS has ramped up hiring while keeping its focus on the Russian market. IBS, which compares itself with bigger rivals including Atos and Capgemini, said separately its headcount rose by almost a third in 2017 to 3,100 people.

TMK (MM:TRMK) was the MOEX index's (MCX) worst performer, falling 3.8 percent and touching their lowest since Jan. 17. 
IPSCO suspended an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange, through which IPSCO and TMK had aimed to raise between $465 million and $535 million as a sharp global selloff in shares from record highs continued.
""While we received significant interest from potential investors, the continued market and economic volatility are not optimal conditions for an initial public offering,"" IPSCO's chairman and CEO Piotr Galitzine said in a statement.
IPSCO did not elaborate further. It is one of the largest North American producers of welded and seamless pipe for the oil and gas industry, with headquarters in Houston, Texas.
It halted its deal as the selloff in global stock indexes deepened on Thursday, with the fall in U.S. stocks confirming a correction for the market, in another volatile session stirred by concern over rising bond yields.
""So far they have only postponed, not canceled it (the deal),"" BCS investment bank analyst Oleg Petropavlovskiy said.
""Everything will depend on the state of the U.S. stock market. They can return with this deal if the volatility ends."" 
Friday's fall in TMK, Russia's largest maker of steel pipes, was the share's worst in a single day since Dec. 18. In London, TMK Global Depositary Receipts (L:TRMKq) fell 5 percent.
News of the IPO of its U.S. division had been a major catalyst for TMK shares in recent months, analysts at VTB Capital said in a note. The IPO was almost fully priced into TMK's value, BCS added.
TMK, controlled by Russian businessman Dmitry Pumpyansky, declined to say whether and when it would come back to the deal.
A day after IPSCO launched the sale in late January, Pumpyansky was included on a list of Russian ""oligarchs"" identified by the U.S. Treasury Department as being close to President Vladimir Putin.
The list of 210 prominent figures in Russian business and politics was drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into U.S. law in August last year although the document said inclusion did not mean those named were likely to be sanctioned.
The steel pipe sector has so far been unaffected by Western sanctions first imposed on Russia in 2014 over Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bank of China (BOC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) are among suitors looking at a potential purchase of German transport finance lender DVB Bank, three sources familiar with the matter say.
The preliminary interest by two of China's leading lenders follows a wider push by Chinese companies to scoop up assets in Europe, especially in Germany. 
In December, sources told Reuters that German cooperative lender DZ Bank was moving ahead with plans to sell its subsidiary DVB, which finances ships, aircraft, offshore oil rigs and the rail industry. The sales process is in its early stages. 
DZ Bank has had to make large provisions for bad loans in shipping, a sector which is slowly coming out of a near-decade long downturn. 
The sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said both Bank of China (SS:601988) (HK:3988) and ICBC (SS:601398) (HK:1398) were working on pitches. One source said they were expected to present their initial proposals this month. 
Officials at DZ Bank, Germany's second-largest lender, and DVB both declined to comment. 
An official at ICBC, which is China's largest state owned commercial bank, declined to comment. 
An official at BOC, the country's fourth largest lender, also declined to comment.
""There is interest from ICBC and Bank of China and this shows the Chinese are still looking for assets in Germany. It's unclear if they will take it to the later stages, but they are looking at it,"" one of the sources said. 
The sources said a sale framework could take at least six months and the process was still at the initial stages. 
The first source said the interest was for the entire bank, while the others said it was still unclear whether bidders would be able to hone in on specific assets.
DVB is unusual in banking because it straddles both aviation and shipping, and both lending and leasing – a combination rarely found in one package. 
Some buyers may aim to team up and then separate aviation and shipping, an industry banker said separately. 
The three sources said asset managers  Carlyle Group  (O:CG) and Apollo Global Management (N:APO) were also interested in DVB. 
Spokespeople for Carlyle and Apollo both declined to comment. 
Sources told Reuters in September last year that several potential buyers had signaled interest in buying DVB's shipping finance business, but the talks ended due to disagreements over the bank's valuation.
DZ Bank had been in talks to sell DVB to Mitsubishi UFJ (T:8306) in 2015, but no deal ever materialized.
Both ICBC and BOC were also among the early contenders to buy German state run bank HSH Nordbank, but later dropped out.
DISTRESSED LOANS
German banks, once world leaders in ship finance, are estimated to be holding at least $100 billion in distressed shipping loans. Shipping finance sources say much of this debt is unlikely to be recouped in full. This would mean heavy losses on investments.
One of the issues for potential buyers would be the cost of refinancing the shipping loans in the future. While DVB benefits from DZ Bank's AA minus rating, it would probably be downgraded significantly as a standalone business, according to finance sources. 
Chinese companies are making a push in Europe. 
Sources told Reuters on Thursday that white goods maker  Qingdao Haier  Co Ltd  (SS:600690) is planning to be among the first Chinese companies to sell D-shares in Frankfurt. Chinese conglomerate HNA Group raised its stake in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) last year.
The pace of Chinese asset purchases in Europe has raised concerns among officials. 

Matthias Machnig, state secretary in Germany’s economics ministry, was quoted in January as saying there was an urgency for Europe-wide measures - to police surging Chinese investment - to be adopted by the end of this year.

HUALIEN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Rescue operations in Taiwan started to wind down on Friday after a devastating 6.4-magnitude earthquake rocked the tourist area of Hualien this week, taking a toll of 12 dead and five missing. 
More than 270 people were injured when Tuesday's quake hit the eastern coastal city just before midnight, toppling four buildings, ripping large fissures in roads and unleashing panic among the roughly 100,000 residents. 
More than 200 aftershocks followed, hampering a round-the-clock rescue effort in which emergency personnel battled rain and cold to comb rubble in a search for survivors. 
Efforts on Friday narrowed to finding five Chinese nationals still missing after rescuers pulled two bodies, identified as Canadian citizens from Hong Kong, out of a 12-storey residential building that had been left tilting at a 45-degree angle.
Authorities said they would focus their search on the single building where the five missing were believed to be. 
""The military will continue to prioritize today rescuing the missing people in the Yun Men Tsui Ti residential building,"" it said in a statement. 
The building's extreme displacement made the search tough, the government said in a statement, adding, ""The space for our operations is small, so the progress of search and rescue can be slow.""
Power was restored to all affected areas in Hualien, although 8,500 homes are still without water. 
The military will work with local government officials to develop a plan to demolish a hotel, a residential building and other dangerous buildings, it said in its statement. 
The government vowed to redouble efforts to revise building regulations, aiming to limit damage in any future episodes.
Taiwan revised its building act on Jan. 30 to strengthen investigations of the structures of existing buildings and inspection of completed projects, the interior ministry said on Friday. 
The revision, expected to be discussed by a cabinet meeting at the end of February, would also seek third-party views in building assessments, it said. 
The government added that it would hasten reconstruction of old buildings to make them earthquake-resistant and work to boost the safety of other structures in affected areas. 
""At every stage, the central government will fully assist local governments,"" it added.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares posted limited losses on Friday morning after a fresh sell-off on Wall Street, which has now entered a correction with the benchmark S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 record highs. 
Europe's STOXX 600 share index fell 0.2 percent by 0900 GMT with most European bourses trading flat or in negative territory. The index had already fallen 1.6 percent on Thursday, with declines accelerating towards the end of the trading day.
So far this year the pan-European benchmark is down over 4 percent. 
""It would appear that the brief respite for stocks seen in the middle of the week turned out to be the eye of the storm as once again rising bond yields prompted a further bout of selling across the board, not only in the U.S. last night but in Asia again this morning"", said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Utilities stocks, which are expected to suffer as interest rates rise, were the worst performers and the sector's index fell 0.9 percent. 
Energy shares were also in negative territory as oil prices fell for a sixth day after Iran announced plans to boost production and U.S. crude output hit record highs. 
The oil and gas index lost 0.5 percent with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and  BP  (LON:BP) down both 1.1 percent. 
French asset manager Amundi posted the worst performance of the STOXX 600, losing 4.7 percent after publishing its annual results and new financial targets.
A.P. Moller-Maersk missed fourth-quarter profit expectations and fell 4.3 percent. 
Belgium's Umicore was the top-gainer after raising 892 million euros in equity for new investments in rechargeable battery materials at a discount of only 2.7 percent to Thursday's closing price. 
The technological sector was up 0.3 percent with Infineon rising 2.5 percent and Siltronic adding 2.3 percent. 
Shares in French cosmetics group L'Oreal rose 1.8 percent after its fourth-quarter sales beat expectations and comments by its CEO regarding its intentions on Nestle's stake further buoyed the stock. 
In the banking sector, Italian investment bank Mediobanca rose 1.9 percent after it raised its dividend guidance after second-quarter profit beat forecasts on higher net interest income and fees. 
Still in Italy, UBI Banca added 0.9 percent as it planned to sell a ""substantial package"" of bad loans over the next three years in an acceleration of efforts to clean up its balance sheet. 

The Italian bourse was one of the only in Europe to be trading in positive territory with a 0.3 percent rise.

1228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 04:02AM ET</span>","China, Hong Kong Are the Biggest Losers as Stock Rout Spreads","(Bloomberg) -- As global equity investors reel from the biggest selloff in two years, nowhere has the pain been more acute than in China and Hong Kong.
Benchmark indexes in the world’s second- and fourth-largest stock markets have fallen faster than any of their major peers since the rout began late last month, with worries over a Chinese deleveraging campaign adding to global concerns about rising interest rates and stretched valuations. As losses accelerated on Friday, both markets snapped their longest-ever streaks without a 10 percent correction.
The sudden tumble, China’s worst since the nation’s 2015 market collapse, has shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the calming effect of state intervention over the past two years. But after guiding the Shanghai Composite Index to its steadiest bull market in history, Chinese authorities are now showing an increased tolerance for losses as they seek to snuff out moral hazard and reduce risk in the nation’s $16 trillion shadow-financing system.
The big questions are whether stocks are signaling trouble ahead for the world’s second-largest economy, and whether declines in China will create a negative-feedback loop with international markets.
For now at least, analysts aren’t anticipating a 2015-style meltdown. They’re still sanguine about China’s growth outlook, with the consensus estimate for 2018 holding steady at 6.5 percent. Optimists point to calmer price action in the corporate bond market and the yuan, which still trades near its strongest in two years against the dollar.
Read more on the global slump: Six Views on How the Correction Finally Came
That said, market declines in China have a habit of snowballing. Many observers are braced for more volatility as liquidity conditions tighten before the Chinese New Year break that starts next week. On average, declines of 10 percent or more in the Shanghai Composite have lasted two months before the index began a reversal of the same magnitude.
“We are still in the depth of market volatility as sentiment was hurt by the double whammy of U.S. market turmoil and deleveraging efforts at home,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Shanshan Finance Co. “Risk appetite has dropped sharply and I don’t think the situation will get any better before the Chinese New Year holiday.”
The Shanghai Composite sank 4.1 percent to 3,129.85 on Friday, extending its slump from a Jan. 24 high to 12 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 3.1 percent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies in the city retreated 3.9 percent. The yuan strengthened 0.33 percent to 6.2977 per dollar in onshore trading.
Before losses in Chinese stocks shifted into high gear on Tuesday, the market had seemed like it would become a haven amid the global storm. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.7 percent on Monday, brushing off a tumble in U.S. stocks that sent the S&P 500 down more than 2 percent last Friday.
Shadow Banking
China’s equity market has always been somewhat insulated to global swings due to the country’s capital controls, and it has been unusually stable since Liu Shiyu took over as chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission with a mandate to rein in volatility in February 2016.
But the country’s markets have also grown more integrated with the international financial system in recent years after the opening of cross-border trading links with Hong Kong, making them more susceptible to turbulence overseas.
“Slowly but surely Chinese markets have become more connected with the rest of the world, so when you have a strong selloff in the U.S., Europe and Japan, increasingly you’re probably going to see more reaction also taking place in mainland China,” said Stefan Hofer, Asia chief investment strategist at LGT Bank AG in Hong Kong.
Opinions differ on the triggers for the global selloff -- analysts have cited everything from rising bond yields to inflated valuations and hedge funds selling out of arcane positions -- but one factor that has almost certainly weighed on Chinese shares is the government’s deleveraging campaign. The clampdown on shadowy wealth-management products has siphoned money from the equity market, pushed up corporate borrowing costs and raised the spectre of rising defaults.
While authorities would likely ease up on the crackdown if the market slump spirals into a crash, Jinkuang Investment Management’s Zhang Haidong said losses in stocks aren’t yet deep enough for the so-called National Team of state-run funds to ride to the rescue. The Shanghai Composite trades at about 16 times reported earnings, 7 percent higher than its five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“The market doesn’t look like it needs the helping hand of the National Team as it did back in 2015,” said Zhang, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Jinkuang Investment. “It’s still a rational correction after accumulated gains.”
As to whether the losses in China will spill over into other markets, CMB International Securities Ltd. strategist Daniel So said the chances of that happening are small for now. Futures on the S&P 500 were trading 0.7 percent higher before the open of U.S. markets on Friday.
“There’s a risk of a negative feedback loop, but I’d say that risk is still small,” So said. “Shares may remain weak before the Chinese New Year holiday, but it’s unlikely that the steep declines like today will occur again.”

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>",Chinese stocks crushed as 'bulls kill bulls' in exit stampede,"By John Ruwitch and Samuel Shen
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stocks suffered their worst day in almost two years on Friday, with blue-chip led carnage dragging the markets into correction territory after steep falls overnight in U.S. stocks.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 4.0 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 ended the day down 4.3 percent. At one point, both were down more than 6 percent.
It was the biggest single-day dive for the two since February 2016, when the fallout from a botched attempt to introduce a circuit-breaker mechanism after a market meltdown was still rattling investors.
Hong Kong shares, meanwhile, slumped to their biggest weekly loss since the global financial crisis.
""It's bulls killing bulls"", said hedge fund manager Gu Weiyong about the stampede out of stocks by once-bullish investors.
""If 10-year, risk-free rates keep climbing toward 5 percent, stocks with earnings multiples of 30 or more will become increasingly expensive, so they're getting dumped by institutional investors,"" said Gu, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Ucom Investment Co.
Chinese government bonds held steady. The price of the most-traded China 10-year treasury futures for March delivery was basically flat.
The yuan weakened against the dollar in thin volume, and the Chinese currency was on track for its first weekly loss in nine weeks.
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 3.1 percent while the sub-index tracking mainland Chinese companies shed 3.9 percent. The Hang Seng was down 9.5 percent for the week, its biggest weekly loss since October 2008.
All sectors fell on mainland and Hong Kong bourses, led by financial and property shares.
The SSE50, which tracks the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai, fell 4.6 percent. It soared 25 percent in 2017.
Analysts and market participants attributed the swoon to a cocktail of factors - margin calls, high valuations, the government's deleveraging program and jittery investors cashing out before long Lunar New Year holidays starting next week.
""Valuations on the A-share market are not cheap, considering tight liquidity conditions amid Beijing's deleveraging efforts,"" said Yang Weixiao, an analyst with Founder Securities.
Margin lending, wherein investors can multiply investable funds by using their securities as collateral, had dropped to a more than one-month low. Reuters data showed roughly 50 billion yuan in leveraged bets had been unwound this month.
Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Hong Kong, said Chinese shares were mostly dragged down by the U.S. correction but he had China-specific worries.
He cited ""valuations on China-consumer related industries and execution risks on deleveraging (more specifically financial deleveraging)"".
In the past, China's government has sometimes moved to prop up falling stock markets, but a hedge fund manager said that was unlikely this time.
""The bet on blue-chips was getting too concentrated, so a big correction was just a matter of time,"" he said.
Ucom's Gu said he saw no evidence the government was stepping in to stem the slide this week, the CSI300's worst since August 2015.
China's five state-backed mutual funds, launched during the 2015 stock market crash, cut their equity holdings in the fourth quarter.
China's central bank said on Friday it has released temporary liquidity worth almost 2 trillion yuan ($316.23 billion) to satisfy cash demand before the Lunar New Year holiday.
Some worries over the health of the world's second biggest economy also resurfaced, as China's producer and consumer inflation eased in January.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that China had approved licenses for an outbound investment scheme known as the Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP) plan for the first time since late 2015.

The scheme would reopen a channel for Chinese money to invest abroad, potentially adding to liquidity concerns in Chinese markets.

The EURO STOXX 50 gained 0.39%, France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.12%, while Germany’s DAX 30 was up 0.12% by 03:30 a.m. ET (07:30 GMT).
Equity markets remained highly volatile overnight, still weighed by concerns surrounding rising inflation, pushing bond yields up. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was still hovering near a recent four-year peak on Friday.
Markets were also hit after a midnight deadline to pass a U.S. budget deal was missed on Thursday due to a prolonged speech by Senator Rand Paul, who objected to $300 billion in deficit spending in the bill saying that it would “loot the Treasury.”
U.S. congressional leaders had reached a two-year budget deal on Wednesday to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.
Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) declined 0.40% and 1.07%, while Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) retreated 0.59% and 1.51%.

In London, FTSE 100 slid 0.56%, weighed by  Johnson Matthey  (LON:JMAT), whose shares plummeted 2.52%. The specialty chemicals group announced earlier in the week that it will have to pay a £50 million fine in a lawsuit with a car parts maker in the U.S.

 Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) was one of the top performers, with shares up 0.96%, closely followed by  Intu Properties  PLC (LON:INTUP), gaining 0.92%.
In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.60% climb, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.74% increase, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.79% gain."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Ant Financial Services Group is planning to raise up to $5 billion in fresh equity that could value the online payments giant at more than $100 billion, people familiar with the move told Reuters. 
A fundraising would bring Ant, in which e-commerce firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd is taking a one-third stake, a step closer to a hotly anticipated initial public offering by establishing a more current valuation.
Ant's last fundraising in 2016 valued the owner of Alipay, China's top online payment platform, at about $60 billion. The new round should start with a valuation of between $80 billion to $100 billion, the people said. 
Ant is currently in talks to appoint advisers for the fundraising which is expected to be launched in the next couple of months, they added.
Ant declined to comment on its fundraising plans. All the people spoke to Reuters on the condition they not be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. 
While no timetable for an IPO has been set, nor any location yet chosen, Ant's plans are being viewed as a pre-IPO fundraising, the people said. A pre-IPO round is an increasingly common move by sought-after Chinese companies to establish valuations and widen their investor base ahead of going public.
It was not immediately clear how the company plans to use the fresh cash.
The exact timing and size of the fundraising still depends on investor feedback but any deal will add to an already hectic pace of domestic and offshore fundraising by Chinese tech firms that are looking to expand both at home and abroad.
Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com is raising funds for its logistics unit with a target of attracting at least $2 billion, while live-video streaming start-up Kuaishou is nearing the close of a $1 billion funding round, sources have said.
""The overall China (e-commerce) market is growing and Ant's market share is very high,"" said Hao Hong, head of research, at brokerage BOCOM International. 
""So, even at a time like this, if Ant were to target $5 billion, that will not be a problem,"" he said, referring to the global stock market turmoil that has also hit Chinese equities, on track on Friday for their worst day in two years.
STEP AHEAD OF IPO
Ant's own existing investments include stakes in Paytm, the Indian mobile payment and e-commerce website, and Thai financial technology firm Ascend Money. 
Last month, however, Ant suffered a setback when a U.S. government panel rejected its $1.2 billion offer for money transfer company MoneyGram International over security concerns.
At home, in addition to its core online payments business, which Ant says has 520 million yearly users, the company also offers wealth management, credit scoring, micro lending and insurance services. 
Last week, Alibaba announced it would take a 33 percent stake in Ant - replacing the current system where Alibaba receives 37.5 percent of Ant's pre-tax profit - in what was viewed as an important step ahead of any IPO.
Alibaba set up Alipay in 2004, modelling the business on PayPal, to help Chinese buyers shop online, and later controversially spun it off ahead of its own listing in 2014. Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder, controls Ant, according to Alibaba filings with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Ant, seen by some analysts as one of the most valuable Alibaba assets due to its unique position in Chinese e-commerce, saw its pre-tax profit more than triple from 2016 to 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in 2017, according to Alibaba's latest financial filings.
Current shareholders in Ant include large state-owned institutions such as China Life Insurance, China Post Group - parent of Postal Savings Bank of China - and a unit of China Development Bank.

1239,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>","China, Hong Kong Suffer Most as Stock Rout Shatters Market Calm","(Bloomberg) -- As global equity investors reel from the biggest selloff in two years, nowhere has the pain been more acute than in China and Hong Kong.
Benchmark indexes in the world’s second- and fourth-largest stock markets have fallen faster than any of their major peers since the global rout began late last month. With losses deepening on Friday to more than 11 percent, both markets were poised to snap their longest-ever streaks without a 10 percent correction.
The sudden tumble, China’s worst since its 2015 market collapse, has shocked investors who had grown accustomed to the steadying effect of government intervention over the past two years. But after guiding the Shanghai Composite Index to its calmest bull market in history, authorities are now showing a higher threshold for losses as they seek to snuff out moral hazard and reduce risk in the nation’s $16 trillion shadow-financing system.
The big question is whether stocks are now signaling trouble ahead for the world’s second-largest economy. Most analysts are still sanguine, with the consensus growth estimate holding steady at 6.5 percent for 2018. Optimists point to the corporate bond market’s relative resilience over the past two weeks and a yuan that still trades near its strongest in two years against the dollar, despite losing some ground in recent days. Investors aren’t yet showing signs of 2015-style panic.
Read more on the global slump: Six Views on How the Correction Finally Came
Still, market declines in China have a habit of snowballing. Many observers are braced for more volatility as liquidity conditions tighten before the Chinese New Year break that starts next week. On average, declines of 10 percent or more in the Shanghai Composite have lasted two months before the index began a reversal of the same magnitude.
“We are still in the depth of market volatility as sentiment was hurt by the double whammy of U.S. market turmoil and deleveraging efforts at home,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Shanshan Finance Co. “Risk appetite has dropped sharply and I don’t think the situation will get any better before the Chinese New Year holiday.”
The Shanghai Composite sank as much as 5.8 percent on Friday, before paring some of its retreat to trade 4.1 percent lower at 3,128.25 as of 1:01 p.m. local time. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 3.2 percent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies in the city slumped 4.1 percent. The yuan weakened 0.16 percent to 6.3288 per dollar in onshore trading.
Before losses in Chinese stocks shifted into high gear on Tuesday, the market seemed like it would become a haven amid the global storm. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.7 percent on Monday, brushing off a tumble in U.S. stocks that had sent the S&P 500 down more than 2 percent last Friday.
Shadow Banking
China’s equity market has always been somewhat insulated to global swings due to the country’s capital controls, and it has been unusually stable since Liu Shiyu took over as chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission with a mandate to rein in volatility in February 2016.
But the Chinese market has also grown more integrated with the global financial system in recent years after the opening of cross-border trading links with Hong Kong, making it more susceptible to turbulence overseas.
“Slowly but surely Chinese markets have become more connected with the rest of the world, so when you have a strong selloff in the U.S., Europe and Japan, increasingly you’re probably going to see more reaction also taking place in mainland China,” said Stefan Hofer, Asia chief investment strategist at LGT Bank AG in Hong Kong.
Opinions differ on the triggers for the global selloff -- analysts have cited everything from rising bond yields to inflated valuations and hedge funds selling out of arcane positions -- but one factor that has almost certainly weighed on Chinese shares is the government’s deleveraging campaign. The clampdown on shadowy wealth-management products has siphoned money from the equity market, pushed up corporate borrowing costs and raised the spectre of rising defaults.
While authorities would likely ease up on the crackdown if the market slump spirals into a crash, Jinkuang Investment Management’s Zhang Haidong says losses in stocks aren’t yet deep enough for the so-called National Team of state-run funds to ride to the rescue. The Shanghai Composite trades for 16 times reported earnings, 7 percent higher than its five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“The market doesn’t look like it needs the helping hand of the National Team as it did back in 2015,” said Zhang, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Jinkuang Investment. “It’s still a rational correction after accumulated gains.”

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>","Airlines, flight schools try to lure pilots with cheaper - or free - training","By Brenda Goh
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In 2014, Danny Perna found himself caught up in the global shortage of pilots that has vexed airlines from China to the United States.
For the first time in 15 years, the founder of Epic Flight Academy in Florida couldn't find enough trained U.S. pilots to be flight instructors at his school. 
Offering sign-on bonuses of up to $10,000 did not help, he said. Eventually they decided to advertise a sponsorship program to partially fund pilot cadets' training. 
""Basically once we started to fund training then it satisfied the pilot shortage,"" he told Reuters by phone from Florida. Newly trained U.S. pilots are usually required to teach at flight schools to gain the hours needed to join an airline. 
""So in our opinion it's not a pilot shortage, it's a funding or finance shortage, the inability for young people to be able to afford training.""
His realization is hitting other airlines and flight schools too, as growing competition across the world for a shrinking pool of trained pilots pushes up salaries and prevents carriers from operating at full capacity. 
Pilots say the burden on cadets to pay for their flight training, which can cost more than $70,000, has been a key reason why enrolment has plummeted at flight schools, especially in places like the U.S. and Australia. Many banks suspended loans for flight training after the 2008 financial crisis.
Many experienced pilots were also laid off at the time, which analysts said concealed how few new student pilots there were.
""Trainees now have to consider where the cash will come from, be it huge bank loans or turning to the 'bank of mum and dad,'"" said Brian Strutton, general secretary of British Airline Pilots Association, which has expressed concerns that the profession was becoming ""inaccessible."" 
In June, training company CAE Inc forecast that the global commercial aviation industry would need an additional 255,000 pilots by 2027 to sustain rapid growth, but said that more than half of the necessary pilots have not yet begun training. 
""Many countries are in the same state (as the United States). They are having shortages in their military and in their commercial environment,"" said Vietnam Airlines JSC's chief executive, Duong Tri Thanh. 
""The problem we see, and are spending investment on, is how you reduce the cost or the time of getting somebody qualified into a jet,"" he added.
PAID TO TRAIN
Carriers such as Air France have in recent months announced plans to launch so-called ""ab initio"" programs, in which airlines pay for training pilots, then hire them. 
In October, Cebu Pacific said it would sponsor 240 aspiring aviators through a program through in which pilots would pay for their training later through salary deductions. 
Lufthansa Aviation Training in October said it was dropping the cost of its two-year training program to 80,000 euros ($98,080.00) from 100,000 euros.
""We see a growth in airline-sponsored programs, where graduates have line of sight to a job, from day one,"" said Nick Leontidis, group president of civil aviation training solutions at CAE Inc. ""Today, about 80 percent of our graduates are sponsored by an airline, where aspiring pilots are secured a job from day one.""
A spokesman for Air France said it its ab initio program last operated 9 years ago. The airline plans to put about 100 cadets through the relaunched scheme by 2022. 
Plane makers Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus said they were also expanding their range of flight training products and services to meet rising demand. 
Boeing has more than 80 flight simulators operating worldwide, while Airbus has more than tripled the number of flight training centers it has globally in the last five years, the companies said. 
Airbus is even looking to get into the ab initio game, said Laurent Martinez, the company's head of services. 
""We want to develop ab initio programs in partnership so we can extend our training capabilities from high school to a certified pilot,"" he said. ""We are developing this as we speak."" 
NO SHORT-TERM ANSWER
These efforts are not likely to help in the short term, however. 
Many airlines are for example competing against deep-pocketed Chinese carriers who are hiring aggressively because of fleet expansion. Chinese airlines fully sponsor training for pilots from China and sign them to long-term contracts, but have not been able to keep up with demand. 
Ryanair in September canceled 20,000 flights after saying it had a shortage of standby pilots due to a mismanaged regulatory change. The pilot shortage has also caused an increased number of flight cancellations by regional Australian airlines.
Besides changing how aspiring pilots can obtain funding, flight schools also said that the cost of flight training and recruitment tactics deserved a rethinking.

""We have to be realistic in as far as the education standards and the expectations of students are changing. You are dealing with millennials,"" said Shannon Wells, managing director at Airlines of Tasmania which owns the Par-Avion Flight Training school in Hobart, Tasmania. ""The recruitment strategy for aviation has to change a bit. I think it is still a bit stuck in the past in terms of learning techniques.""

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",U.S. fund that lost most of its value shuts doors to new investment,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. mutual fund that relied heavily on a strategy that profits from calm markets has shut its doors to new investment after losing more than four-fifths of its value in recent market turmoil, filings showed on Thursday.
The once-$800 million LJM Preservation and Growth Fund lost more than 80 percent in the week ended February 7, according to Morningstar Inc, after a surprise spike in market turbulence swiped investment strategies premised on low volatility.
A spokesman for the fund, which is run by a unit of Chicago-based LJM Partners Inc, was not immediately reached for comment after normal business hours.
The fund made extensive use of options, touting its ability ""to deliver solid returns while maintaining risk parameters"" in its most recent annual report to shareholders, while another document says the fund used techniques to ""mitigate losses in extreme market drops.""
The report described the fund's strategy as aiming to capture ""the spread between implied and realized volatility,"" a description that lines up with one of the hottest trades in financial markets over the last few years but that has blown up for a number of investors in recent days.
LJM Preservation and Growth Fund had been run by Anthony Caine, a veteran of the 1990s technology boom who later founded LJM, and Anish Parvataneni, a former trader for well-known investor Ken Griffin's Citadel.
In an environment that has been tough on high-cost fund managers, the LJM fund took in $393 million in new cash from investors in 2017, its best-ever sales since launching in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, despite fees as high as 3.34 percent a year.
Now, the LJM fund is closed to most further investment, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Investors piled into options, futures, swaps and exchange-traded products that bet on low or falling volatility, in some cases earning triple-digit annual returns in recent years.
Market swings been limited, resulting in low volatility measured by the CBOE Volatility Index. Investors typically also pay up for protection in the future, creating a gap between ""implied"" volatility in the future and ""realized"" volatility that already happened. That difference created extra profits for investors who were ""short"" volatility.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Tuesday it would terminate the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the S&P 500 after its value plunged during the global market rout.

Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 2.87% with Fast Retailing down 4.13%, while Australia's S&P/ASSX 200 eased 0.81%.
In Greater China, the Shanghai Composite fell 4.11% and the Hang Seng index dropped 3.11%. In China, consumer prices rose 0.6%, compared with a 0.7% gain seen on month for January and at a 1.5% rise as expected on year. Producer prices rose 4.3% on year as expected. The Aussie's fortunes are closely ties to economic conditions in top trade partner China.
China's central bank on Friday released temporary liquidity worth almost 2 trillion yuan ($316.28 billion) ahead of the week-long long Lunar New Year holidays.
The People's Bank of China had announced in December that it would allow some commercial banks to temporarily keep less required reserves to help them cope with the heavy demand for cash ahead of the festivities that are seen as the largest annual human migration as people travel to gather with relatives.
HSBC and China Construction Bank lost 3.17% and 5.07% respectively.
Overnight, Wall Street closed sharply lower on Thursday as the selloff resumed offsetting bullish earnings and upbeat labor market data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 23,860. The S&P 500 closed 3.75% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6777.16, down 2.93%.
Also weighing on sentiment was uncertainty over whether a far-reaching budget deal would be approval amid a CNBC report suggesting that Rand Paul was holding up the Senate's vote on the deal.
The vote comes amid opposition from both sides of the political isle amid concerns that the budget deal does nothing for young immigrants. The budget deal would have to be passed before midnight to avoid a government shutdown.
Upbeat labor market did little to boost sentiment amid widespread fear in the market as all sectors fell more than 1% with financials leading the decline, down roughly 4.5%, despite the prospect of higher interest rates.
Higher interest rates are seen as boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended Feb. 4, beating forecast for a 6,000 increase.

1244,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 10:31PM ET</span>",Global Stock Slump Continues; China Gets Hit Hard: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- The sell-off in global stocks that briefly looked to have ended mid-week has come back, tipping markets from the U.S. to Asia into declines exceeding 10 percent from their January highs . China, where retail investors dominate, got hit particularly hard Friday.
Equity traders have yet to get comfortable with a jump up in benchmark U.S. 10-year yields to their highest in four years, and worries over the unwinding of bets against volatility in stocks continue to cast a shadow over markets.
Japan’s equity benchmarks were down about 3 percent Friday, while South Korea’s fell almost 2 percent and Hong Kong’s slid almost 4 percent. Onshore China gauges at one point exceeded 5 percent losses on the day. U.S. futures were higher, after fluctuating between gains and losses. Elsewhere, West Texas Intermediate oil fell toward $60 a barrel. China set the yuan lower Friday after it fell the most since 2015 yesterday.
In stocks, the negative superlatives have piled up quickly: the S&P 500 has erased its gain for the year, closed at a two-month low and is on track for its worst week since 2011. The Dow plunged more than 1,000 points for the second time in four days. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is set for the worst week since at least February 2016.
Pressure on U.S. stocks again came from the Treasury market, where another weak auction put gave bond bears ammunition, sending the 10-year yield as high as 2.88 percent. Equity investors took the signal to mean interest rates will push higher, denting earnings and consumer-spending power.
For a market that hadn’t fallen 3 percent from any high in more than a year, the week’s action was enough to rattle even the biggest equity bulls. Accustomed to buying the dip, that wisdom is now in question when more selling by speculators may be imminent. Over $5 trillion has been wiped from global stock markets since Jan. 26, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
“There’s some big-money players that have really leveraged to the low rates forever, and they have to unwind those trades,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management. “They could be in full panic mode right now.”
As the equity selling intensified, haven assets grew attractive. Gold ticked higher, the yen held gains and even Treasuries pared the worst of their declines.
Volatility spread across assets. The Cboe Volatility Index was more than double its level a week ago. The VIX’s bond-market cousin reached its highest since April. A measure of currency volatility spiked to levels last seen almost a year ago, with a plunge in the yuan and a rise in the pound adding to turbulence. European equities weren’t spared, with the Euro Stoxx 50 volatility gauge spiking toward the highest since June 2016 -- the month of the Brexit vote.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Asian markets uneasy as longer U.S. debt yields verge on 3 percent,"By Vidya Ranganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - If this week's selloff in global equity markets is any guide, then Asia's frothy debt and stock markets have reason to be on edge over the steady rise in long-term U.S. bond yields that could push up global funding costs and drive capital out of the region.
A whiff of inflation in the United States sent global stock markets tumbling in the past week, wiping 7 percent off Asian equities, despite a still supportive backdrop of robust global growth, a weak dollar and rising company earnings.
Bond and currency markets were relatively unaffected, as they have been through the Federal Reserve's slow pace of policy rate rises since 2015 and more recent reminders from central banks in Europe and Japan about dialing down on stimulus. 
So far, long-term dollar yields have also stayed low, keeping a lid on funding costs for investors who have pumped billions of dollars into high-yielding emerging market assets.
But U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are creeping closer to 3 percent, where analysts say the current ""Goldilocks"" scenario of a strong economy and muted inflation would give way to fears of peaking growth, rising inflation and more rapid policy tightening.
""Our concept of Goldilocks is around a pretty modest rise in U.S. yields,"" said Daniel Morris, a senior investment strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management. ""A rise to 3 percent or so wouldn't be quite so benign. That would upset this Goldilocks view.""
Ten-year Treasury yields were falling through most of 2017 even as short-term dollar rates climbed. They spiked above 2.8 percent for the first time in 3 years last week, and have risen 50 basis points since November.
Investors would read a 3 percent mark on 10-year Treasuries as a situation in which U.S. inflation is accelerating, the Fed would have to raise rates faster and markets globally would be jolted, Morris said.
Complicating matters is the U.S. dollar, which has steadied this month after 13 months of a slow grind lower. The weaker dollar had provided foreign investors an added reason to stay invested in the appreciating Asian currencies.
""Emerging markets have become much more sensitive to the long end than the short end of the U.S. yield curve,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.
That was primarily because much of the money that has flowed into Asia since the global financial crisis a decade ago is real money whose funding costs are based on long-term yields, rather than investors loaded up on short-term leverage, he said.
""So if you have the U.S. 10-year at 2.3 percent, it still makes sense to invest your money in Indonesia. If the 10-year trades at 3.3 percent, the investment in emerging markets will probably need to be repriced.""
NOT ANOTHER TAPER TANTRUM
The five markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and India received net bond inflows of around $49 billion in 2017, while the flows to seven of the biggest emerging Asian stock markets were less than half that amount.
So far these bond markets aren't pricing in any major monetary tightening by local authorities, hence most of them are not too correlated to U.S. yields. Even yields on dollar-denominated bonds issued in Asia have been capped by narrowing spreads over Treasury yields.
Investors in some markets will have more cushion as U.S. yields rise, such as those in Indonesia's 10-year bonds that fetch 6.4 percent and India's at 7.5 percent. The more vulnerable are those in markets where 10-year yields are about the same as U.S. Treasuries, such as South Korea and Thailand.
As Treasury yields rise, emerging market investors will be forced to assess whether they are simply being compensated for the higher inflation or being paid to take on additional risk, said Maurice Meijers, CEO for Singapore at Robeco Institutional Asset Management. 
""A lot of market participants are not pricing in risk in their search for yield. Once Treasury yields rise dramatically, that would hurt things from a sentiment perspective,"" Meijers said.
Most fund managers think a slow grind higher in U.S. yields may cause less pain for emerging markets, at least far less than the turmoil during the 2013 taper tantrum, when the Fed first dropped hints of reducing its crisis-era stimulus.
Still, they worry that investors are complacent.
Alain Bokobza, head of asset allocation at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), said investors should ""prepare for the end of Goldilocks.""

""At 2.9-3.0 percent on the 10-year Treasury, global markets and emerging markets would start to be really worried,"" he said, describing that level as a threshold at which there would be worries about destabilization in the United States possibly causing an attack on the U.S. bond markets, and raising big questions about the sustainability of U.S. growth without inflation.

1246,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",Maryland sues Insys to enforce subpoena in opioid probe,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Maryland's attorney general has filed a lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena the state sent Insys Therapeutics Inc as part of a probe into allegations the drugmaker deceptively marketed a fentanyl-based cancer pain medicine.
Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh confirmed on Thursday that his office filed a lawsuit in state court after Insys resisted turning over documents sought as part of an investigation into the drugmaker's role in the opioid epidemic.
Frosh said the state had been investigating the Chandler, Arizona-based company since 2016 amid allegations that Insys had marketed its product Subsys to not just patients with severe cancer pain but for other conditions.
The lawsuit, filed on Monday, called Insys's resistance to turning over all of the documents the state sought ""troubling"" given its claims that its conduct had changed.
""Usually the reason people fight disclosures is that they don't want the people seeking disclosures to know what they've been up to,"" Frosh said in an interview.
Insys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has said that it has taken steps to prevent past mistakes from happening again and has said that Subsys made up 0.02 percent of opioid prescriptions in 2016.
Insys has found itself at the center of several lawsuits and investigations focused on Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.
Federal prosecutors in Boston have accused seven former executives and managers at Insys including billionaire founder John Kapoor of participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys and to defraud insurers.
According to prosecutors, beginning in 2012, Kapoor, former Insys Chief Executive Michael Babich and others engaged in a scheme to bribe medical practitioners by paying them to participate in sham speaker program events.
Prosecutors have sought to link the case to the national opioid abuse epidemic. Opioids were involved in over 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kapoor, Babich and their co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.

Insys has said it may have to pay at minimum $150 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. It already agreed to pay $9.45 million in settlements with four state attorneys general and faces lawsuits by five others.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 09:24PM ET</span>","Wall Street plummets; S&P, Dow confirm correction","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged around 4 percent on Thursday in another dramatic session, confirming a correction that has thrown the market's nearly nine-year bull run off course.
The bottom of this recent slide remained elusive for investors, who have been whipsawed this week by huge swings that have shaken a market that had only climbed steadily for months.
With Thursday's drops, the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials confirmed they were in correction territory, both falling more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 record highs. The S&P 500 slumped 3.8 percent on Thursday, while the Dow dropped 4.2 percent as losses accelerated late in the trading day.
The S&P 500 last confirmed a correction in January 2016, when it fell 13.3 percent amid concerns about a slump in oil prices.
The S&P closed below the intraday low it had hit on Tuesday, a key level traders had been watching.
Thursday marked another day of recent sharp swings including the S&P 500's biggest drop in more than six years on Monday that pulled equities away from record highs.
""The dust hasn't settled yet, and I think both buyers and sellers are trying to figure out what this market really wants to do,"" said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner for Meridian Equity Partners in New York.
""I would think that this continues to happen for the next few trading sessions for everything to kind of get flushed out.""
The retreat in equities had been long awaited by investors as the market climbed to record high after record high with few bumps. The S&P correction is the fifth of this bull market, according to Yardeni Research. The last bear market was during the 2008 financial crisis.
The sharp selloff in recent days was kicked off by concerns over rising inflation and bond yields, sparked by Friday's January U.S. jobs report, with investors pointing to additional pressure from the violent unwinding of trades linked to bets on volatility staying low.
Since Jan. 26, the S&P 500 has lost $2.49 trillion in market value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Equities for years have looked relatively attractive compared to the low yields offered by bonds, but the rise in Treasury yields has diminished the allure of stocks, especially with stock valuations at historically expensive levels.
Earlier on Thursday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) rose as high as 2.884 percent, nearing Monday's four-year peak of 2.885 percent, after the Bank of England said interest rates probably needed to rise sooner than previously expected.
""What we're seeing today is continued concerns around interest rates going higher, around valuations in the stock market,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer with Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 1,032.89 points, or 4.15 percent, to 23,860.46, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 100.66 points, or 3.75 percent, to 2,581 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 274.83 points, or 3.9 percent, to 6,777.16.
All 11 major S&P sectors finished lower, with financials (SPSY) and technology (SPLRCT) the worst-performing groups. All 30 components of the blue-chip Dow finished negative.
Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB), two of the big stocks that had led the S&P's rally over the past year, were among the biggest drags on Thursday.
After regular cash trading, S&P 500 e-mini futures  edged down 0.2 percent late on Thursday.
Thursday's slide put the S&P 500 back into negative territory for the year, down 3.5 percent.
Investors are weighing whether the sharp swings are the start of a deeper correction or just a temporary bump in the prolonged bull market.
A new survey by the American Association of Individual Investors showed the percentage of U.S. individual investors expecting a decline in stock prices has hit a three-month high.
Volatility remained high compared to recent months. The market's main gauge of volatility, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), rose 5.73 to 33.46 on Thursday, about three times the average level of the past year.
Equity options trading volume, already elevated this week, is likely to pick up as February contracts approach expiration next week, said Jon Cherry, head of U.S. options at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets in Chicago.
""A lot of people have been forced to put on positions that will need to be either wound down or rolled forward,"" Cherry said.
Thursday marked another session this week with strong volume. About 10.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 8.2 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by an 8.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 5.58-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 113 new lows.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",U.S. stocks selloff: Will machines make it worse?,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Machine-guided, numbers-obsessed fund managers could cause U.S. stock prices to weaken further as they adjust to the return of wild gyrations in global markets.
Several years of generally low volatility, when shares have not experienced big day-to-day oscillations, in part due to money-printing and bond-buying policies pursued by the world's major central banks, has led investors to shovel billions of dollars into some highly technical and risk-focused strategies.
""There will be for the rest of this week a systematic selling,"" from funds that each chase such trends in the market, said Jerry Lucas, senior strategist at UBS AG (S:UBSG) Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office.
These volatility-contingent strategies include volatility control funds, risk-parity funds, commodity trading advisers (CTAs) and trend followers, analysts said, although it was unclear what their impact was in Thursday's stock market selloff. 
With the recent return of stock market gyrations, such funds are expected over time to shed relatively riskier assets, such as equities, in some cases to achieve a constant level of volatility, those analysts said.
U.S. stocks have made wild swings this week amid an overall sharp decline. The S&P 500 index's (SPX) 3.75 percent fall on Thursday meant the index has technically entered a correction, defined as a 10 percent fall, since it reached a record high on January 26. (N)
 BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP) strategist Anand Omprakash said Thursday's rout in U.S. stocks was likely partly driven by some systematic strategies that have short reaction time horizons.
""When markets start to become volatile, they basically have to start selling equities,"" Omprakash said.
However, Michael Mendelson, a risk-parity portfolio manager at AQR Capital Management LLC, said in a note that risk-parity strategies would not have caused the sell-off.
""The media and the analysts generally get the idea right, that risk-parity and trend-following strategies tend to sell when volatility rises. But when it rises quickly, they are really selling after that spike,"" said Mendelson. 
""It takes an awful lot to move big global stock markets and the sizes and trading speed of risk-parity and trend-following strategies just don't get you there,"" he said. 
Ben Hunt, chief investment strategist at Salient, whose Salient Risk Parity Index is used as a market benchmark, said he believed selling pressure Thursday was coming from financial advisors selling options on their clients’ accounts, rather than strategies such as risk-parity.
""What gets painted as the bogeyman here is things like risk parity funds,"" said Hunt. ""Two things: these funds are barges, not speed boats, they change very slowly. A daily change in volatility is not a factor.""
Hunt said even a sustained shift higher in volatility of an asset class would only trigger a small fraction of change in a given day. 
Trend-following hedge funds were stopped in their tracks by global market volatility this week, with some giving up all of their gains from a stellar start to the year.
Market participants peg the overall amount of money in volatility-contingent strategies at around $1.5 trillion and warn that a new era of heightened volatility could eventually lead to extended weakness in stocks and other riskier assets.
""Right now, the momentum is all to the downside,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co.

""Until that has broken, we're still vulnerable.""

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. gunmaker Remington seeks financing to file for bankruptcy: sources,"By Andrew Berlin and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Remington Outdoor Company Inc, one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, has reached out to banks and credit investment funds in search of financing that will allow it to file for bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The move comes as Remington reached a forbearance agreement with its creditors this week following a missed coupon payment on its debt, the sources said. The company has been working with investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) on options to restructure its $950 million debt pile, Reuters reported last month.
Remington is seeking debtor-in-possession financing that will allow it to fund is operations once it files for bankruptcy, the sources said. The size of the financing and timing of Remington's bankruptcy plans could not be learned.
Some potential financing sources, including credit funds and banks, have balked at coming to Remington's aid because of the reputation risk associated with such a move, according to the sources. 
Remington, which is controlled by buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, was abandoned by some of Cerberus' private equity fund investors after one of its Bushmaster rifles was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Remington did not respond to several requests for comment. Cerberus declined to comment.
Credit rating agencies have warned that Remington's capital structure is unsustainable given its weak operating performance and significant volatility in the demand for firearms and ammunition. 
Remington's sales have declined in part because of receding fears that guns will become more heavily regulated by the U.S. government, according to credit ratings agencies. President Donald Trump has said he will ""never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.""
The Madison, North Carolina-based gun manufacturer faces a maturity of an approximately $550 million term loan in 2019. Remington also has $250 million of bonds that come due in 2020 and are trading at a significant discount to their face value at around 16 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns about repayment.
The term loan maturing next year is also trading at a significant discount to full value, at around 50 cents on the dollar, the sources said.

Remington's sales plunged 27 percent in the first nine months of 2017, resulting in a $28 million operating loss.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 05:49PM ET</span>","Twitter surprises with revenue turnaround, shares surge","By David Ingram and Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday delivered its first quarterly profit and an unexpected return to revenue growth helped by expansion outside the United States, pushing shares in the social network to more than two-year highs. 
Overall revenue rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, handily beating analyst estimates that called for a fourth straight quarter of declines.
Twitter's previous inability to turn a profit or log consistent revenue growth had confounded investors given its ubiquitous media presence and popularity among celebrities, athletes and politicians such as U.S. President Donald Trump.
Revenue from outside the United States rose 17 percent, making up for an 8 percent decline in U.S. sales. Revenue from Japan rose 34 percent to $106 million, and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said Chinese exporters were strong advertisers abroad. 
Shares closed 12.1 percent higher at $30.18 after hitting a high of $35.00. Twitter was founded in 2006 and went public in 2013 at $26 a share.
Twitter, which has doubled the number of characters allowed per tweet and made other changes to attract users, said the number of daily active users rose 12 percent. 
""Advertisers want eyeballs, so anything Twitter can do to maximize the number of people accessing the platform daily for a good chunk of time allows for better ROI,"" or return on investment, analyst Erna Alfred Liousas of Forrester Research said. 
Monthly active users grew more slowly, up 4 percent from a year earlier to 330 million. That was flat from the third quarter, which the company blamed in part on seasonal weakness and its purge of fake and spam accounts.
Twitter said revenue was helped by using data to make the targeting of ads more individualized, a process known as machine learning. That raised clickthrough rates, or the ratio of users who click on a specific ad to the number that view it. 
The company also cited higher video ad sales and redesigned ad formats as helping to grow revenue. 
""They are showing the right tweets to the right people at the right time, and as you do that, not only do you drive consumers to use Twitter more, but you attract more and more advertisers to want to be on the platform,"" analyst Richard Greenfield of BTIG Research said. 
Overall revenue was $731.6 million, beating Wall Street's target of $686.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company reported $87 million in data licensing and other non-advertising revenue, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Ad revenue rose 1 percent to $644 million. 
Twitter reported a net profit of $91.1 million, or 12 cents per share, compared to a loss of $167.1 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted profit was 19 cents per share, topping analyst expectations of 14 cents per share.
The company said it expects to be ""GAAP profitable for the full year 2018,"" referring to generally accepted accounting principles. 
But analysts were split on what lies ahead for the company. 
Twitter needs to attract more new users and is trading at a ""lofty premium"" given expected earnings, James Cakmak of Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co said in a client note.
Greenfield said he expected growth for years to come. ""This is all about really looking at the potential of revenue growth as they scale and leverage their cost structure,"" he said. 
Chief Executive Jack Dorsey focused for the past year on tweaking the product he co-founded to attract users, including by trying to limit user harassment. Twitter has also struck deals with media companies for live news and entertainment shows. 
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has 2.1 billion monthly users, while Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), which does not report a monthly figure, has 187 million daily users. 
Dorsey told analysts on a conference call that he was not planning a search to replace Anthony Noto, who is leaving as chief operating officer to become CEO of online lender Social Finance Inc and whose duties have been absorbed by others.
""We're not going to have to do any backfilling,"" Dorsey said. 
Shares in Twitter had already surged 47 percent over the past 12 months as of Wednesday's close, outpacing a 17 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. 
    That came even as social media companies are grappling with a regulatory backlash in Europe and the United States over privacy, possible user addiction, hate speech and alleged abuse of by Russia to sway foreign elections. 

Twitter's quarterly profit and rising revenue reignited speculation on Thursday among some analysts that a larger company could try to buy it. The Walt Disney Co expressed interest in 2016, though at the time Twitter shares were trading around $18.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 05:36PM ET</span>",News Corp results beat on gains in digital real estate unit,"(Reuters) - Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp (O:NWSA) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, as growth in its online real estate business helped offset a fall in advertising revenue.
Sales in its news and information services business, which accounts for about two-thirds of total revenue, fell marginally to $1.30 billion in the second quarter.
Advertising revenue fell 6 percent, but those declines were made up by a similar increase in circulation and subscription revenue.
The company's Dow Jones unit helped drive most of those gains on the back of continued digital subscriber growth at the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper's average daily digital subscribers jumped 28.6 pct to about 1.4 million.
The company, which is controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, also owns the New York Post and major newspapers in the UK and Australia.
Earlier in the day, rival  New York Times  Co (N:NYT) also posted strong revenue growth, driven by its online business. 
Revenue from New Corp's online real-estate business rose about 21 percent to $292 million, while its book publishing and cable network programming units also recorded a rise in sales.
Net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $83 million, or 14 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31 from a loss of $289 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company said it recorded a charge of $174 million related to the new U.S. tax law.
Excluding items, the company earned 24 cents per share.
Total revenue rose to $2.18 billion from $2.12 billion.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 19 cents on revenue of $2.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

News Corp's Dow Jones unit competes with Thomson Reuters, which is the parent of Reuters News, and Bloomberg LP.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","AIG posts $6.7 billion loss on tax reform, catastrophes","By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) posted a $6.7 billion fourth-quarter loss on Thursday as the U.S. insurer booked a big charge related to U.S. tax reform and losses from global catastrophes. 
Excluding one-time items, adjusted fourth-quarter earnings were $526 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with an adjusted loss of $2.8 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
Analysts were expecting earnings of 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
AIG booked $762 million of catastrophe losses during the quarter, largely from wildfires that raged through California and caused significant damage to homes and businesses.
The quarter also reflected a ""modest"" reserve boost to cover future claims, driven by losses in its international commercial businesses. 
AIG's general insurance business posted just $13 million in adjusted pretax income, compared with a $4.9 billion loss in the year-ago quarter, which was affected by a review that caused AIG to significantly boost reserves. 
The insurer's life and retirement business was also affected by a re-evaluation of its underlying method of predicting losses. The business booked a $90 million charge, primarily due to what AIG called a ""modernization"" of actuarial systems and models. 
That business' adjusted pretax income fell 10 percent to $782 million from $866 million in the year-ago quarter. Overall, AIG's bottom line was mostly hurt by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, posting $6.7 billion worth of charges related to the new tax law. 
U.S. tax reform has caused many financial services companies to book big one-time losses for earnings held overseas and also for an accounting oddity related to losses booked during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, even though lower corporate tax rates will help them in the long run. 
Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who has been in the role for less than a year, AIG has been looking to acquire businesses and restructure itself to boost results, with a particular focus on technology. 
The insurer now has three units, including a general insurance business, a life and retirement unit and a standalone technology unit. 
In its announcement on Thursday, AIG said it had recently formed a Bermuda-based legal entity named DSA Reinsurance Company. The entity's main purpose is to reinsure old policies the company has on its books, many of which have been contributing to losses. 

Last month, AIG also agreed to purchase reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (N:VR) for $5.6 billion in a bid to expand its offerings and improve underwriting tools.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 04:57PM ET</span>",Uber board got assurances on diligence ahead of self-driving deal: investor,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A key Uber investor testified on Thursday that the company's board received assurances that due diligence had turned up no problems with a self-driving car startup which Uber acquired, differing from testimony by Uber's former chief executive.
Benchmark venture capitalist Bill Gurley, who has since left Uber's board, said that before the company acquired a startup founded by a former Waymo engineer in 2016, board members were told that due diligence on the company ""had turned up nothing."" 
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo sued Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] a year ago, accusing it of theft of self-driving car trade secrets. 
Waymo said that one of the company's former engineers, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles before Uber acquired his startup, Otto.
The trial could influence one of the most important and potentially lucrative races in Silicon Valley - to create fleets of self-driving cars.
Gurley's recollection is different with former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who testified on Wednesday that he never read a due diligence report prepared by an outside firm that determined Levandowski did possess Alphabet data.
Kalanick denied telling the board that diligence on Levandowski had come back ""clean.""
As part of the Otto acquisition, Uber indemnified Levandowski and his team against any future lawsuits filed by Waymo over trade-secret theft.
In a brief appearance on the witness stand on Thursday, Gurley said he could not say for sure who from Uber management assured the board, but recalled that Kalanick led the majority of the presentation. He called the indemnification agreement ""atypical.""
""We as a group made the decision to move forward because the diligence was OK,"" Gurley said in court on Thursday. He also said ""as far as I know"" no trade secrets came from Waymo to Uber. 

The trial is expected to continue through next week. The jury will have to decide whether the documents downloaded by Levandowski were indeed trade secrets and not common knowledge, and whether Uber improperly acquired them, used them and benefited from them.

Upbeat labor market did little to boost sentiment amid widespread fear in the market as all sectors fell more than 1% with financials leading the decline, down roughly 4.5%, despite the prospect of higher interest rates.
Higher interest rates are seen as boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.

Bearish sentiment rose 6.3 percentage points to 35 percent, putting it above the historical average of 30.5 percent for the first time in nine weeks. Conversely, bullish sentiment declined 7.7 percentage points to 37 percent, below the historical average of 38.5 percent. Investor optimism is now at a two-month low, according to the AAII survey. 
Investors have been expecting greater market volatility, though the timing of this week's market drop may have caught many investors by surprise, according to the AAII.
The survey was conducted Feb. 1 to Feb. 7, concluding two days after Monday's sharp stock selloff.
Neutral sentiment, or the expectation that stock prices would stay flat, rose slightly by 1.5 percentage points to 28 percent.
The recent records in the major U.S. stock indexes, as well as tax code overhaul and U.S. Federal Reserve policy were named in the survey as significant influences on investor sentiment. 

Among industries favored by AAII survey respondents, finance and technology topped the list, each garnering more than 30 percent of votes. Energy, retail and consumer discretionary were among the least popular industries, with just over a quarter of votes combined.

The application was filed with Germany's financial watchdog BaFin last summer, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported, adding Ford was looking to hire about a dozen extra staff as part of the expanded banking business.
Ford's car financing arm, Ford Credit Europe, is based in the southeast town of Warley in Britain, and handles leasing, loans and insurance for its customers across Europe, with one branch being located in Cologne.
Should Britain leave the EU as planned, Europe's banking supervision might no longer permit Ford to steer its car financing business on the continent out of Britain, the paper said.

Ford spokespeople in Germany were not immediately available for comment.

Once bumpiness had flooded into the market, various forms of volatility-targeting strategies were set in motion and added to outflows that will keep investors on edge for several days, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists Marko Kolanovic and Bram Kaplan wrote in a note Thursday. Some systematic strategies may end up selling at the lows and later buying back at the highs, they said.
“Strategies that are selling are those that use realized volatility, correlations, VIX and price momentum as signals to adjust exposure,” the report said, noting that assets under management in those areas have increased greatly in the past decade, to what they estimate is now about $300 billion. “On the other side, electronic market making depth becomes severely diminished at the same time these signals are triggered.”
READ FURTHER: Buzzwords to Navigate a Volatility-Led Market Panic
The report said that in terms of systemic flow and electronic liquidity, the current market moves are playing out the same way as in August 2015.
“It started with the de-risking of trend followers, short volatility positions, and strategies sensitive to bond-equity correlation. Similar to Aug 24th, by far the largest and quickest punch came from hedging flows for the trillion dollar+ S&P 500 index put option complex (gamma hedging) on Monday, and was compounded this time with liquidations in the VIX complex. As this was unfolding, electronic liquidity, in the once-most-liquid product, S&P 500 e-mini futures, evaporated.”
Still, JPMorgan sees a big difference with August 2015 as well.
“While for equities this looks like a 2015 type of crisis, other asset classes disagree. This is because there is a big macro/fundamental difference between now and the August 2015 market crisis,” they said. “In 2015, we dealt with an EM crisis (e.g. China), crisis of credit spreads, collapse in commodity prices, and weak global growth. There were legitimate fears of a global recession. Now, the situation is exactly the opposite: global growth is very strong, U.S. corporate earnings are at record highs (and continue to be revised higher), commodities have stabilized, and the USD is weak.”
“All of these factors make a big difference, and should give confidence to fundamental investors to step in and short-circuit the feedback loop of programmatic selling and depleted equity liquidity,” the strategists said.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines cut involuntary passenger bumping to lowest rate on record,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. airlines reduced the number of passengers involuntarily bumped from their seats on crowded planes to the lowest number on record in 2017, the U.S. Department of Transportation said on Thursday. 
U.S. carriers bumped passengers at a rate of just 0.34 per 10,000 passengers last year, nearly halving the rate of 0.62 per 10,000 set in 2016.
Last year's rate was the lowest since record-keeping began in 1995, the Transportation Department said in a report.
The improvement follows an industry pledge to overhaul overbooking policies after the forceful removal of a passenger from an overbooked United Airlines (N:UAL) flight last year sparked a worldwide backlash and calls for increased government oversight of airline regulations.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), the second largest U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, recorded the fewest bumped passengers in 2017, at a rate of 0.05 denied boarding per 10,000. United, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, bumped passengers at a rate of 0.23 per 10,000 passengers. American Airlines (O:AAL), the country's largest airline, had a rate of 0.38 per 10,000.
While a record-breaking year for airline safety and performance, 2017 was also a time of reckoning for carrier customer service practices, after a series of unflattering headlines and public relations nightmares shined a critical light on the industry. 
After the United Airlines incident and a subsequent congressional inquiry into the matter, major U.S. carriers announced changes to their booking policies. These included increasing the maximum passenger incentive for passengers to forgo their flights, which rose to nearly $10,000 in the cases of United and Delta. 
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) said the carrier would no longer overbook its flights. In 2017, Southwest bumped passengers at a rate of 0.53 per 10,000 passengers, ranking number nine out of 12 airlines measured.
Prior to the United incident, just one of the major U.S. carriers, JetBlue (O:JBLU), had a policy explicitly stating it would not overbook its flights. In 2017, JetBlue bumped passengers at a rate of 0.41 out of 10,000 passengers.

In December, the number of customer complaints about U.S. carriers filed with the Transportation Department dropped to 628 from 1,254 in December 2016.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 02:56PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse kept $300 million from brokers in closed U.S. unit: lawsuit,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A new lawsuit accuses  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG of withholding up to $300 million of pay from U.S.-based brokers who refused or were unable to move to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co after their private banking unit was shuttered in 2015.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday, Christopher Laver said Credit Suisse canceled deferred compensation owed to him and other brokers who did not join Wells Fargo under a ""recruiting agreement"" between the banks, by maintaining a ""facade"" that they had voluntarily resigned en masse.
Laver said Credit Suisse knew many brokers would not join Wells Fargo because its business and client base were different but entered the recruiting pact because a sale of the unit would have constituted a ""change of control"" requiring the payments.
""Credit Suisse should not be able to avoid its obligation to compensate the advisers fully and fairly by claiming they 'resigned' when, in fact, Credit Suisse simply ceased operating this business,"" the complaint said.
Laver lives near San Francisco, worked at Credit Suisse for 13 years and has worked for another Swiss bank, UBS, since leaving. He has been in financial services since 1981.
The proposed class-action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco seeks unspecified damages for roughly 200 brokers.
Credit Suisse spokeswoman Karina Byrne the lawsuit had no merit and that it is ""standard industry practice"" for Wells Fargo and other brokerages to pay the deferred compensation at issue to new hires.
""Simply put, the plaintiff here is looking to be paid the same money twice,"" she said.
Wells Fargo is not a defendant and was not accused of wrongdoing.
Credit Suisse awarded Wells Fargo the exclusive right to recruit its brokers on Oct. 20, 2015. It told its roughly 275 brokers in 13 U.S. offices that the business was too small to compete without significant investment or acquisitions.
In addition, ""they were told if you went to Wells you could keep your deferred compensation, and if not you were out of luck,"" Robert Nelson, a lawyer for Laver, said in an interview.
Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco. Its retail brokerage recently had 14,544 financial advisers and $1.7 trillion of client assets, and its wealth management business recently had $248 billion of client assets.

The case is Laver v Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00828.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 31 U.S. senators said on Thursday they had written to the leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) demanding information on the consumer watchdog's stalled probe into credit reporting agency Equifax Inc's (N:EFX) massive data breach.
The letter adds to mounting pressure on Mick Mulvaney, the interim head of the CFPB, to resume a full-scale probe into the company after Reuters reported that the bureau had pulled back from an investigation into how hackers were able to steal data Equifax had gathered on around 143 million Americans.
The Reuters report prompted a barrage of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who urged the CFPB to launch a full-scale probe.
The letter, which was dated Feb. 7, was led by Hawaii's Democratic Senator Brian Schatz and signed by 29 Democrats, including all those on the Senate Banking Committee, and two independents. 
The senators ask Mulvaney and the CFPB's Deputy Director Leandra English to provide detailed information on the status of any probe into Equifax, including whether the agency has issued subpoenas, interviewed Equifax personnel or conducted onsite inspections. 
A spokesman for the CFPB confirmed the agency had received the letter but declined to comment further. 
Earlier this week, John Czwartacki, senior adviser to Mulvaney said in a statement that Mulvaney takes data security issues very seriously. 

""Under his direction, the CFPB is working with our partners across government on Equifax’s data breach and response. We are committed to enforcing the law,"" he said.

The company has made a big number of mergers amid a slowing Chinese economy that has impacted its access to new financing, and led to liquidity problems, Chairman Chen Feng told Reuters last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japan warned Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that its companies would have to leave Britain if trade barriers after Brexit made them unprofitable.
Japanese firms have spent more than 40 billion pounds ($56 billion) in Britain, encouraged by successive governments since Margaret Thatcher promising them a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.
But after May and several of her top ministers met bosses from 19 Japanese businesses, including Nissan, SoftBank and bank Nomura, Japan's ambassador to Britain issued an unusually blunt warning on the risks of trade barriers. 
""If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operations,"" Koji Tsuruoka told reporters on Downing Street when asked how real the threat was to Japanese companies of Britain not securing frictionless EU trade. 
""So it is as simple as that,"" he said. ""This is all high stakes that all of us, I think, need to keep in mind.""
Japan, the world's third largest economy, has expressed unusually strong public concerns about the impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom, the second-most important destination for Japanese investment after the United States.
In a warning after the shock 2016 Brexit vote, Japan expressed fears about a cliff edge that could disrupt trade when Britain formally leaves the bloc in March 2019. 
Major corporations have sought a two-year transition period, which they hope will ease Britain into its new relationship with the bloc.
Both London and Brussels hope to agree a transition deal lasting until the end of 2020, in which Britain would remain in the single market and be bound by all EU laws, by a March 22-23 summit.
May and her ministers assured Japanese businesses of the importance of maintaining free and frictionless trade after Brexit during the meeting but said nothing firm on the matter, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
""The point about frictionless trade and tariff-free trade was made in the meeting and acknowledged by the government and all sides as being important but nothing firm,"" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
CUSTOMS UNION UNCERTAINTY 
A spokesman at May's office said she had agreed with them on the need to move on quickly in the Brexit talks to secure a trading relationship with the EU that is as tariff-free and frictionless as possible after the transition period.
Thursday's meeting came after a Brexit sub-committee of ministers discussed their Brexit strategy including how closely Britain should remain aligned with the EU and its customs union, a divisive issue for the ruling Conservatives. 
Brexit minister David Davis said there was still progress to be made in the committee, after disagreements between ministers erupted into the public domain. 
Hitachi Europe's Deputy Chairman Stephen Gomersall, Mitsubishi CEO for Europe and Africa Haruki Hayashi, SoftBank Investment Advisers UK CEO Rajeev Misra and Nomura's Executive Chairman in Europe, the Middle East and Africa Yasuo Kashiwagi joined the meeting with Japanese investors. 
Nissan's Europe Chairman Paul Willcox, Honda's Senior Vice President in Europe Ian Howells and Toyota's Europe President and Chief Executive Johan van Zyl were also present.
Collectively the three carmakers build nearly half of Britain's 1.67 million cars.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As world markets catch their breath after a week of turmoil, investors are concerned that a new era of heightened volatility could eventually lead to a second wave of selling as investment strategies popular for years are forced to unwind.
U.S. stocks (SPX) plunged nearly 8 percent in three trading days until Tuesday as an explosion in implied volatility readings prompted investors to dump equities on growing anxiety about overheating economies, inflation and rising borrowing rates.
The epicenter of the selloff was in the highly leveraged world of exchange-traded funds and related products, where investors had successfully bet for years on market volatility remaining extraordinarily low for long periods.
These complex products hinged on being 'short' on volatility futures such as the CBOE's Vix gauge of one-month implied volatility - betting on low volatility, in other words.
When the Vix shot up over two turbulent trading days, however, these trades faced a near total wipeout, triggering reversals, a further huge spike in volatility and then some of the biggest one-day falls in U.S. and world equities in years.
Although the washout was violent, it was extremely quick, and stock markets have bounced more than 5 percent off Tuesday's lows. 
Nevertheless, volatility gauges remain at more than twice the previous year's average.
If they don't retreat further soon, analysts fear another wave of selling in the weeks ahead.
Highly leveraged yield-seeking strategies in high yield bonds or commodity-linked currencies that have mushroomed in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis are likely to come under pressure the longer volatility stays high.
""If vol (implied volatility) stays between 20 and 30 for a protracted period of time, some of the existing volatility-targeting strategies would have to de-risk,"" said Vineer Bhansali, chief investment officer at California-based investment adviser LongTail Alpha, a firm that runs tail-risk strategies using options and other types of derivatives.
""But the path from here to that point is likely to be somewhat disorderly.""
While markets have focused on leveraged exchange-traded notes as a guide to how large these bets are --  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists estimate these products lost about $3.4 billion in the selloff -- investors believe the scale may be far bigger.
At the height of its popularity last month, Credit Suisse's 'inverse VIX' note (P:XIV), the second-biggest publicly traded product tracking the VIX, had $1.8 billion of assets, according to Thomson Reuters data.
But thanks to years of generally low volatility, in part due to money printing and bond-buying policies pursued by the world's major central banks, investors have shovelled billions of dollars into so-called 'carry trades' that often depend on financial calm persisting for long periods. 
LARGE BETS 
These trades typically involve borrowing in near zero interest rate currencies to invest in high yield bonds and notes in emerging markets or junk-rating companies - and praying there's no sudden foreign currency spike to wipe out accumulated profits. 
But the risk of the latter grows the longer financial volatility measures stay high.
Though estimates of how much money is actually parked in such strategies are hard to come by given a general lack of transparency, some broad numbers exist.
A November paper by Bhansali and Lawrence Harris, a professor at USC Marshall School of Business, estimated that total assets under management in volatility-contingent strategies is about $1.5 trillion, including implicit volatility sellers such as risk parity funds, volatility targeting funds, risk premium harvesting funds and trend followers.
AQR, a hedge fund, says that so-called risk parity strategies alone hold about $70 billion in global equities.
Those strategies of selling volatility and buying risky assets have proved to be tremendously profitable in recent years.
The VIX has drifted lower since early 2016, staying at depressed levels below its 20-year average for nearly two years with spikes only a handful of times in the last decade.
But this week's brief spike above 50 and its subsequent partial retracement to below 30, more than double its trading range last year, has turned the spotlight on such strategies.
UBS analysts estimate that a U.S. equity decline of 7.4 percent, as seen over the last five working days, has historically been associated with a high yield spread widening of 75-80 basis points while the actual move has only been 21 basis points.
That spread is likely to adjust higher as funds who have become very comfortable in selling volatility in recent years take a more cautious view.
Davide Silvestrini, EMEA Head of global quantitative and derivatives strategy at JP Morgan, said the sharp losses experienced by short vol strategies will likely lead to reduced volatility selling flows from institutional investors.
""Not only do we expect volatility to increase in 2018, and would urge investors to remain cautious of leveraging positions too far, but we also anticipate that markets will retain the effects of volatility shocks more deeply in their collective conscience,"" said Eoin Murray, head of investments at Hermes Investment Management, which controls 31 billion pounds of assets.
HIDDEN RISKS
Though market volatility has come back down significantly, a global head of equity trading strategy at a bank in London said many bank desks who are holding long volatility bets thanks to funds who have had to exit their positions are ""comfortable holding them as they expect volatility to remain high.""
And that has large implications for other asset classes, namely fixed income and currencies where low volatility has been a principal driver of large returns. Indeed, three month implied volatility for the euro this week is well below 2017 highs.
Hans Redeker, global head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley in London said though the initial focus of these funds have been in the U.S, commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar and the Canadian currency which have been the focus of global macro funds will come under pressure thanks to worsening fundamentals.

""I am a bit surprised that we haven't seen the contagion effect on other markets and that makes me wary about the outlook in the near term,"" said Morgan Stanley's Redeker.

The current bull market is, give or take, 108 months, or 9 years old. That definitely makes it the second longest since World War II. The duration of the longest one, however, is open to debate. It either ran from 1987 to 2000 or 1990 to 2000. So, at the most it lasted 12.8 years, which blows away the current one. At the least, it stretched nine and a half years, or 115 months, which puts the current one pretty close.Overall, the current bull market looks to be in the middle of the pack. Four in history lasted more than 12 years. The longest was slightly more than 15 years, stretching from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Four bull markets lasted well less than 9 years. The shortest being 2.5 years in the early 1970s.Though much is made of bull markets, they are pretty much the status quo for stocks.

1342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",Europe's Central Banks Echo Fed in Shrugging Off Market Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- Global central bankers aren’t being knocked off their monetary policy paths by this week’s turbulence in stocks.
After investors woke up to the likelihood that officials are serious about pulling back stimulus this year to control inflation, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney declared on Thursday that he may even need to raise interest rates faster than previously thought.
“There will be ups and downs in financial markets,” Carney told reporters in London. “What’s happened in volatility markets is not an entirely surprising development.”
European Central Bank speakers also brushed aside the sell-off by continuing to debate how to end their bond-buying program, which is currently set to run until September.
Policy makers should not “allow ourselves to become unsettled by the decline in equity prices we have just witnessed,” Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said in Frankfurt.
The European outlooks added an international flavor to the arguments made this week by Federal Reserve policy makers that the market turmoil isn’t enough to force a rethink of their plan to gradually raise U.S. interest rates this year.
While the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index plunged 4.1 percent Monday and has remained jittery since, central bankers contest that equity valuations were probably overdue a correction, and the declines haven’t been deep enough to undermine their economies.
Healthy Move
“More volatility in the markets, and maybe addressing some of the excesses and imbalances in the markets, by having a little more volatility, may be a healthy thing,” Fed Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan told Bloomberg Television on Thursday.
“I’ll be watching carefully to make sure it does not transmit, though, to tighter financial conditions or spillover to the economy,” he added. “But at this point, I’d be optimistic that it won’t.”
Having already raised interest rates in November for the first time in a decade, the BOE put investors on alert for another increase perhaps as soon as May by lifting its forecasts for economic growth and saying inflation will remain above its 2 percent target.
“It will be likely to be necessary to raise interest rates to a limited degree in a gradual process, but somewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than what we had thought in November,” Carney said. “Domestic inflationary pressures are likely to firm.”
Long Process
The ECB is for now continuing to pump liquidity into the euro area, despite almost five years of economic growth. Yet Weidmann said in his speech that “if the expansion progresses as currently expected, substantial net purchases beyond the announced amount do not seem to be required.”
His colleague Peter Praet -- the ECB’s chief economist -- acknowledged the trend, but argued that policy normalization will be a “long, complex” process.
The sanguine stance on markets may extend to Latin America later on Thursday. Mexico’s central bank is expected by economists to raise its benchmark a quarter point to 7.5 percent, continuing a two-year hiking cycle.
Aftershocks from the global stock selloff continued reverberating in markets, with shares falling in Europe and rising in Asia. For UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber, a former ECB policy maker, that’s nothing to fear.
“The market has shown an unprecedented level of complacency,” he told Bloomberg Television. “A correction was waiting to happen.”

(Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters  Corp (N:TRI) (TO:TRI) beat Wall Street profit expectations in the fourth quarter as it kept a lid on costs, but revenue slightly missed forecasts.
The news and information company, in its first earnings report since announcing it would sell a majority stake in a unit to Blackstone, reported quarterly revenue of $2.94 billion, up 3 percent. 
Net earnings were $591 million, or 81 cents per share, down from $2.24 billion, or $3.03 per share a year earlier.
Adjusted for special items, earnings were 60 cents per share. 
Analysts, on average, were looking for profit of 58 cents per share, and revenue of $2.95 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Last week, U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) announced a $20-billion deal to buy a 55-percent stake in Thomson Reuters' Financial & Risk business, which provides news and analytics to financial services companies. That deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018. 
Thomson Reuters said last week it would not provide earnings guidance for 2018 until next quarter. 
Thomson Reuters' shares were 0.3-percent lower at $40.42 on the New York Stock Exchange and down 0.5 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Despite market volatility and the ""digestion period,"" resulting from the F&R sale, Drew McReynolds, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said he expects Thomson Reuters' stock to find a ""stronger floor in the low US$40s."" 
Net sales in the Financial & Risk division, Thomson Reuters' biggest unit, were positive for the quarter. 
Revenue for the unit rose 1 percent to $1.55 billion excluding currency. Under the deal with Blackstone, Thomson Reuters will retain a 45-percent stake in Financial & Risk.
Thomson Reuters, which is the parent of Reuters News, competes for financial customers with Bloomberg LP, as well as News Corp's (O:NWSA) Dow Jones unit.
Thomson Reuters has relied heavily on cost-cutting in recent years as its core customers, including banks, brokerages and investment houses, retrench in the face of weakening trading conditions, tougher regulations and the rise of passive investing.
After the Blackstone deal, Thomson Reuters will focus on expanding its Legal, Tax & Accounting and Regulatory businesses, the company has said.
Revenue in the Legal business was $881 million in the fourth quarter, up 1 percent excluding currency. The company's Tax & Accounting unit reported revenue of $443 million, up 6 percent excluding currency.

Reuters News revenue was $75 million in the quarter, down 5 percent excluding currency.

1349,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",VIX Curve in `Backwardation' Means Stocks May Still Be Hurting,"(Bloomberg) -- The rebound in S&P 500 Index futures from a 5 percent drop Monday could be seen as a sign that the stock market is still recovering from its wounds, but a closer look at the curve of volatility futures shows it may still need intensive care.
Since stocks started tumbling on Feb. 2, a close relationship has developed between the active S&P 500 futures contract price and the spread between first and second-month VIX futures contracts. This correlation only appears during turbulent times.
The entire VIX futures curve is in backwardation, a signal that investors expect more volatility in the near-term. That’s seen in the contract pricing, where front-month contracts are more expensive than second-month. The inverse is normally true.
“The M1-M2 VIX futures spread can be used as another temperature gauge for the market, just like spot VIX,” said Dave Roberts, an independent trader of volatility derivatives and associated products. “That graph works really well in tight time frames when the curve is in extreme backwardation (like now) because the M1-M2 spread is currently very sensitive to the S&P 500’s movements (both up and down).”
Two other times the volatility complex looked like this include the fallout from the market plunge after China’s devaluation of the yuan, and the fourth quarter of 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Typically, the VIX futures curve should be in so-called contango -- or rather, upward sloping. That’s because of the general understanding that the degree of uncertainty tends to increase over time. With the current slope of the curve doing the opposite, it suggests market participants are preoccupied with the risk that’s right in front of their faces.
The connection between equity futures and the spread between the first and second months on the VIX curve falls apart during contango. Therefore, a breakdown in this relationship -- ironically, even one that results in a move lower in equities -- could be an early indication that trading activity is approaching more normal levels.
“If the market moves back down near the recent lows but the M2-M1 spread stays constant -- or even comes in a bit, causing the lines to diverge -- it may signal the fever is starting to subside,” said Roberts.
A move in the curve back to contango would also be a confirmation of a return to normal trading conditions.

1350,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 09:33AM ET</span>",We're at a 'watershed point in markets' — here's why we aren't out of the woods just yet," Wall Street has found a semblance of stability after a roller-coaster week, but some investors are convinced the rockiness in stocks and bonds isn't quite over for one main reason: The markets have yet to fully come to terms with how aggressively the Federal Reserve may respond to surprising economic strength.
At its core, the market sell-off, which shoved the  Dow Jones industrial average nearly 1,600 points lower Monday in the  biggest intraday point drop in history, showed traders adjusting to signs of firmer economic growth and, potentially, a resurgence of long-dormant inflation.
That meant pushing Treasury yields substantially higher, which some say frightened stocks, leading to a swift slump for a market that many believed was well into bubble territory.
So where does this leave us now?  Perhaps not quite there yet.
""We're at a watershed point in markets,"" Robert Tipp, the chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income, told Business Insider. ""This is something we haven't seen in a while in terms of the growth backdrop"" both in the US and around the world, he said, adding that European economies ""are doing really well"" after years of crisis conditions.
The US economy has trudged along at a stable but unspectacular growth rate of about 2% for much of the economic recovery since the Great Recession, allowing the unemployment rate to come down slowly to a 17-year low of 4.1%.
Still, wage growth has been weak, so weak in fact that the first sign of strength, tucked in the January jobs report, seemed to freak everyone out. Against that backdrop, US inflation has been undershooting the Fed's 2% target for much of the expansion.
Now there are renewed hopes that the combination of an improving job market and a short-term economic boost from the Republican tax cuts will put growth into a stronger range this year, perhaps closer to 3%.
Investors are essentially waiting to see whether this growth materializes and trying to figure out how the Fed will react. The US central bank has raised interest rates five times since December 2015, to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%, after leaving them at effectively zero for seven years in response to the recession and its aftermath.
""The Fed we think is going to tighten four times this year,"" David Page, a senior economist at AXA Investment Managers, told Business Insider. ""The market hasn't even priced in three times,"" much less the three or so additional hikes Fed officials themselves have penciled in to their quarterly forecasts.
He thinks the US economy will expand by 2.9% in 2018 and inflation may breach 2.5% in the first half of the year because of the short-term moves in oil and the dollar.
Page said the recent change of guard at the Fed's helm, with Jerome Powell taking over for Janet Yellen as chair, further complicates the Fed's ability to telegraph its intentions to markets, increasing the risk of further hiccups.
""What you see with a change in leadership is this loss on the part of the market of knowing whom to listen to,"" Page said. ""For the next couple of quarters, the market is going to start to feel who it listens to. There is a risk that somebody gives you a steer that's not quite on track.""
Adding to the uncertainty the Fed's seven-member board is down to just three members with another one being confirmed. This could, for a period, give unusual weight to the  views of regional Fed presidents."

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 08:47AM ET</span>","Reckitt, GSK balance risk-reward in high-stakes Pfizer fight","By Martinne Geller and Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - The leaders of GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) -- two of Britain's best-known but underperforming companies -- are in a high-stakes battle for a dose of Advil to ease their pain.
The drugmaker and consumer goods group, both under investor pressure to improve operations, face a tricky risk-reward balance in a potential $20 billion auction for Pfizer’s (N:PFE) consumer healthcare unit.
 Pfizer 's cabinet of strong brands such as painkiller Advil, Centrum vitamins and Chapstick lip balm present a great opportunity for both Reckitt and GSK to build all-important scale in the still fragmented over-the-counter (OTC) market.
OTC remedies are durable brands with loyal customers, and buying the Pfizer business would cement either Reckitt and GSK in a market-leading position.
The acquisition would be a financial stretch for both, however, and the growing threat from Amazon.com (O:AMZN) in the OTC space is a further uncertainty.
Both CEOs have expressed interest in the Pfizer auction, though neither company has confirmed its participation. But people familiar with the matter say they are in the running.
""Neither of them have to do this deal,"" said  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) portfolio manager Steve Clayton, who owns shares in both companies across funds worth 500 million pounds ($695 million).
""The value of our investment is dependent most on the stuff that they already own. That has to be management's No. 1 priority.""
With Reckitt and GSK shares having underperformed their respective European sectors by 13 and 14 percent in the past year, both bosses already have their work cut out.
Reckitt has grappled with a slowing market and ongoing fallout from a South Korean safety scandal, a failed product launch and a cyberattack.
GSK has struggled with a scarcity of promising new drugs in its pipeline at a time of mounting competition in its core respiratory and HIV divisions.
CONVINCING INVESTORS
Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt's CEO since 2011, has a reputation for savvy deal-making and financial rigour in his quest to turn Reckitt from a stodgy British maker of cleaning products into a consumer healthcare powerhouse.
Yet he came under pressure last year for his high pay, which was slashed, and the $16.6 billion acquisition of struggling baby formula maker Mead Johnson, its biggest ever.
GSK's Emma Walmsley, who took over in April, has yet to convince some investors that her background selling shampoo at L'Oreal (PA:OREP) has prepared her for running one of the world's biggest drug operations. Doubling down in consumer products risks increasing that scepticism.
She must also ensure buying Pfizer does not endanger the dividend or derail existing priorities to invest in pharmaceutical research and have resources to buy out  Novartis 's (S:NOVN) minority stake in their consumer health joint venture, if the Swiss company decides to sell from next month.
Both companies must also evaluate how far they are prepared to let credit ratings slip for a big acquisition, at a time when global interest rates look to be on the rise.
Reckitt has said it would be willing to temporarily let its rating slide to BBB for a ""spectacular"" deal.
""A short-term downgrade in debt rating for what is a once-in-a-generation opportunity makes sense,"" said Reckitt shareholder Harold Thompson, a partner at consumer goods-focused investment firm Ash Park Capital.
GSK is currently rated A2 and Moody's Investors Service analyst Knut Slatten said its credit quality in 2018 would hinge on the company's appetite for deals.
Yet  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said downgrades may not be necessary, given a range of available financing options aside from just taking on debt or issuing equity, which would dilute shareholder returns. Examples include bridge loans secured by asset sales or partnering with a financial investor.
GSK could do the deal through its joint venture, and in Reckitt's case, the home and hygiene business could be a fertile ground for disposals, especially since it now operates as a separate business from health, as of this year. ""They've been presented with an opportunity in Pfizer that really pushes them to decide the next decade of their destiny,"" Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said of Reckitt.
Reckitt will report full-year results on Feb. 19, and another improvement in Mead Johnson could warm more investors to a Pfizer bid if it signals that deal's integration is on track.

1381,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 07:29AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Market Volatility Comes Roaring Back! What's Next?,"Investing.com - Aftershocks from this week's wild roller-coaster ride on Wall Street continued to reverberate around markets on Thursday, a sign that market participants remain jittery amid increased volatility levels.
The wild ride in U.S. equities started on Monday, when both the Dow and S&P 500 indices plunged more than 4%, with the former notching its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly 1,600-point drop, as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of higher rates.
On Tuesday, the 30-stock index swung 1,167.5 points before closing 567 points higher.
The turbulence continued Wednesday, with U.S. stocks finishing lower despite climbing earlier in the session, as the S&P 500 recorded its largest one-day reversal since February 2016.
The Dow has lost 4.3% since last Friday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, meanwhile, are down 4.5% and 4.1%, respectively, since then.
There was no obvious single reason behind the shakiness, but the wild swings were blamed on concerns about rising interest rates, program trading and volatility funds that use leverage.
The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, has also been all over the map this week. On Monday, it more than doubled from 17.34 to 37.32. It also hit 50 on Tuesday before closing at 29.98. On Wednesday, it traded at 26.41.
A decline in stocks usually leads to a rise in volatility, but never like this. The latest spike in volatility could point to a big problem on Wall Street, some traders believe.
Trading algorithms and levered fund products may have separated this market from past historical patterns, causing moves to be exaggerated.

1382,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 07:03AM ET</span>",Fed's Kaplan Says Market Volatility `May Be a Healthy Thing',"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said the recent financial market upheavals may actually be beneficial and he doesn’t expect them to have a negative impact on the economy.
“More volatility in the markets, and maybe addressing some of the excesses and imbalances in the markets, by having a little more volatility, may be a healthy thing,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Manus Cranny, adding that the preceding months of smooth sailing were “historically unusual.”
Treasury yields have risen and stock markets plunged at least in part due to investors’ concern that the Fed may pursue additional rate increases this year as inflation finally picks up toward the central bank’s 2 percent goal. The VIX index, which uses derivatives to track expected volatility in U.S. stocks, has spiked in recent days after months of calm, causing substantial losses for investors who had been making returns betting against its rise.
Kaplan, 60, does not vote on monetary policy this year. He has been growing increasingly confident in the economic outlook in recent months, saying last week that he now feels more firmly that three rate hikes will be appropriate in 2018, though six months ago he might have said two to three.
“I’ll be watching carefully to make sure it does not transmit, though, to tighter financial conditions or spillover to the economy,” he also said. “But at this point, I’d be optimistic that it won’t.”

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Haier to headline launch of Chinese D-shares in Germany - sources,"By Tom Sims, Julie Zhu and Fiona Lau
FRANKFURT/HONG KONG (Reuters) - White goods maker  Qingdao Haier  Co Ltd (SS:600690) is planning to be among the first Chinese companies to sell so-called D-shares in Frankfurt, four people with direct knowledge of the process told Reuters.
The Haier listing would kick off the D-share project - D is for Deutschland - on the infant China Europe International Exchange based in Frankfurt.
CEINEX was set up with the blessing of Beijing and Berlin in 2015 and is mostly owned by Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE (LON:SSE)) and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn). [http://reut.rs/2E7Yzs5]
CEINEX has been working to enlist prominent Chinese companies for a splashy debut for the new market. 
A circular for potential investors and issuers of D-shares, seen by Reuters, described the CEINEX's goal as to attract ""Chinese national champions"" and the ""best of the best.""
CEINEX and Haier declined to comment. All the people declined to be named as the information was not public.
The establishment of D-Shares would mark the latest in a series of gradual moves by China to increase foreign engagement with its companies, albeit often at a distance. D-shares would join a long list of offshore Chinese forms of equity including H-shares and red-chips in Hong Kong, S-chips in Singapore and N-shares in New York. 
This universe already makes up more than a quarter of the global emerging markets equities index produced by MSCI, which last year decided to include domestically-listed Chinese shares - known as A-shares - for the first time. 
The German project has high-level backing: China's Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were present in 2015 at the signing of the agreement between Deutsche Boerse and Shanghai Stock Exchange that formed CEINEX. [http://reut.rs/2EaH1f8]
Haier, with 10.3 percent of the global market for white goods such as refrigerators in 2016, according to consultancy firm Euromonitor, has a large footprint in Europe and plans to expand in the region. 
Qingdao Haier, its main Shanghai-listed unit, is China's top household appliances maker and in 2016 acquired  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's appliance business for $5.4 billion. 
An initial wave of three D-share listings on CEINEX is expected to raise between 500 million and 1 billion euros for each of the companies that lists, for a total of up to 3 billion euros, according to two people with knowledge of the process. 
While the size of Haier's share offering has not been finalised, it would likely reach about 1 billion euros, as both SSE and Deutsche Boerse are keen to land a ""landmark"" transaction, according to two of the people. 
CEINEX said in marketing materials that it is carefully vetting potential D-share issuers and has created a short-list of 10 A-share listed blue-chips following meetings with 80 such companies. 

""This time, the Chinese national champions come to Europe,"" the marketing materials said. ""Different from Chinese red-chips that listed on Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the last 10 years.""

The breaches included failures in separating client securities, reporting direct business transactions, complying with short selling requirements, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in an e-mailed statement on Thursday.
These breaches took place between 2010 and 2016.
Credit Suisse had reported their regulatory breaches and failings to the SFC and involved their senior management to address the regulatory concerns at an early stage, SFC said.
""In this instance, Credit Suisse's prompt and extensive co-operation have significantly expedited the effective resolution of the issues that caused the SFC's concerns,"" said SFC's executive director of enforcement, Thomas Atkinson.
""Otherwise, the sanctions for similar failures would have been substantially higher.""
Credit Suisse said it had taken ""appropriate action to ensure its legal and regulatory obligations were upheld at all times"", and to prevent repetition of these incidents.
""The resolution announced by the SFC today does not place any constraints on Credit Suisse's business activities in Hong Kong or elsewhere.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - When Boeing's P-8A Poseidon first arrived at the Singapore Airshow two years ago, it caused a stir. Defence buyers around the region were intrigued by the new aircraft, which was touted as reliable, capable and absolutely necessary in a region abundant with naval tension, both above and below the water.
In 2018, the need has grown. China has spent the last few years building up military installations around the South China Sea and its submarines are prowling farther afield, stoking Asian interest in planes that can sweep large swathes of ocean.
The number of offerings on the market has grown too, but the cost of such specialised aircraft has kept the purchases relatively small for now.
""Special-mission aircraft are a strategic asset,"" said Avishai Izhakian, Israel Aerospace Industry's (IAI) deputy general manager for airborne systems and radars, explaining why sales of such planes have remained elusive. ""As such, the procurement process is very lengthy.""
Among those joining Boeing (NYSE:BA) in trying to address the market are Saab (ST:SAABb)'s Swordfish Maritime Patrol Aircraft, based on the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) Global 6000 business jet; the Kawasaki (T:7012) P-1; the Airbus (PA:AIR) C295 MPA and proposed maritime patrol variant of its A320neo; Leonardo's (MI:LDOF) ATR 72MP; and IAI's ELI-3360 Maritime Patrol Aircraft, based on the Bombardier Global 5000 business jet.
The Swordfish is not yet in production, however, and the Japanese Self-Defense Force is the sole customer for the P-1. India and Australia are so far the only Asia-region buyers of the $175 million P-8.
No big sales of maritime patrol aircraft were announced at this week's Singapore Airshow, the biggest regional aerospace and defence event.
Still, planemakers at the airshow said that Asia remained a promising market.
""There is a requirement need out here in the Asian region for P-8s,"" Matt Carreon of Boeing said at a media briefing on Tuesday. He cited the large volume of shipping traffic, the amount of piracy and the ""current political climate"" as reasons why maritime patrol would be important to Asian militaries.
Two P-8s were on display at the airshow, one flown by the U.S. Navy - the aircraft's biggest customer by far, with 98 ordered and 64 delivered - and the other by the Royal Australian Air Force, which has ordered 12. Britain and Norway are the only other two announced buyers.
Gene Cunningham, Boeing's vice president of global sales for defence, space and security, said the company was in advanced discussions with South Korea over a P-8 sale. There might be a decision by the end of 2018, he added.
On Thursday, South Korea's defence procurement agency confirmed it would buy a maritime patrol aircraft from a foreign company. The Yonhap news agency, citing an unnamed military source, said the decision would be between the P-8 and Saab's Swordfish for a deal expected to be worth about $1.75 billion.
TARGET MARKET
The moneymaking potential for sales in the Asia-Pacific region is clear. The U.S. State Department gave permission last year for a nearly $1.5 billion P-8 sale to New Zealand, although no deal has been announced.
Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea are among others in the region shopping for maritime patrol aircraft, several planemakers said.
""If they are concerned about the proliferation of submarines, we are talking to them,"" said Robert Hewson, Saab's head of communications for Asia Pacific.
Hewson suggested the Swordfish would be as little as half the cost of the P-8 over its lifetime.
IAI's Izhakian, speaking on the sidelines of the airshow, said the P-8 was better suited for large militaries with bigger budgets than for most potential Asian countries, leaving an opening for smaller aircraft with advanced sensors.
""This is our niche, to provide a more affordable solution with more capability,"" he said.
Like Saab and IAI, Boeing designed its aircraft around the bones of a civilian plane, in this case the ubiquitous 737 passenger jet. Carreon said the aircraft's familiarity, plus the ability add in third-party or local systems, made it attractive to even smaller customers.
""They are shocked at the value they're getting,"" he said.
DEFENCE SPENDING RISING
Boeing is marketing its jet as a natural upgrade of the older, propeller-driven Lockheed (N:LMT) P-3 Orion, which performs the same mission. Only one buyer, India, had not flown P-3s before purchasing P-8s.
Kawasaki was displaying a model of its four-engine P-1 jet, which replaced Japanese P-3s, but Hideki Yamaoka, associate officer and project manager of the company's Advanced Aircraft Export Project, said it was generally ""too high-end for the requirements"" of Asian customers.
Unmanned drones are another option. Joseph Song, vice president for international strategic development at General Atomics Aeronautical, which makes the MQ-9 Reaper, said he saw potential for growth in Asia.
""I think the maritime mission is going to be as big as the land mission in the future, driven by Asian customers like Australia, India, Japan, Korea, and I think Singapore and other countries will certainly play a role,"" he said.
After a meeting of Southeast Asian defence ministers this week, Singapore defence minister Ng Eng Hen said the country was spending more all around, including on ways to keep an eye on the seas around the island city-state.
""Defence spending on the whole, not only maritime surveillance, has gone up,"" he said. ""That's a fact.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A European recovery rally dissipated on Thursday with benchmarks across the region weighed down by commodities and technology stocks, while acquisition approaches sent Danish telecoms group  TDC  and Swiss insurer  Swiss Re  flying.
Europe's STOXX 600 share index (STOXX) fell 0.5 percent by mid-morning, pulled lower by a 1.5 percent decline in basic resources (SXPP), and weaker industrials stocks. 
The index was still down 2.8 percent year-to-date after equities worldwide took a battering this week. The previous two sessions saw the heaviest volumes traded on the STOXX 600 in more than seven months.
Financials limited the damage, with euro zone banks (SX7E) gaining 0.4 percent after strong earnings from UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Merger and acquisition activity drove the top European gainers. 
Danish telecoms company TDC (CO:TDC) led the STOXX 600, shooting up 16.3 percent and on track for its best day since June 2007, after it rejected a takeover approach from Macquarie and three Danish pension funds.
Swiss Re (S:SRENH) shares jumped 4.6 percent after the reinsurer said it was in talks with Japan's SoftBank (T:9984) to sell a minority stake.
Strong results also boosted some stocks as investors' focus turned back to the European earnings season. 
""At the end of the day for us, the question was does this correction change the earnings picture or the economic picture? At this point, no it doesn't,"" said Pierre Bose, head of European strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Societe Generale shares rose 3.9 percent after the bank reported forecast-beating results despite a quarterly drop in profits.
""French retail revenues better than guidance, and good numbers in markets with equity derivatives back to normal,"" said Jefferies analysts. 
Italy's UniCredit rose 3 percent after profit topped forecasts, and Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) led Italian stocks with a 4.1 percent gain after the bank raised its target for shedding bad loans.
Norwegian consumer goods firm Orkla (OL:ORK) gained 5.8 percent after its fourth-quarter earnings beat forecasts.
Schibsted (OL:SBSTA), however, fell 5.5 percent after traders said its third-quarter earnings missed forecasts. 
After this week's sharp correction, valuations of the STOXX 600 have fallen back below their one-year average. 
""It's not cheap, but it's much closer to fair value,"" said Credit Suisse's Bose. 
""The market was moving close to vertically for the first few weeks of this year, and absolute valuation has been a bit expensive for the past 18 months. From that point of view the correction that we've had is actually extremely helpful.""
But the market was still warily eyeing volatility levels which partly determine how asset allocators measure the levels of risk they can take on. 

""If volatility remains higher, the one thing that does change for investors everywhere is the risk/reward ratio,"" said Bose.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>","Shares fragile, U.S. budget deal puts bonds on defensive","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets remained on shaky ground on Thursday as U.S. bond yields crept back towards four-year highs after U.S. congressional leaders reached a two-year budget deal to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.
While the deal was a rare display of bipartisanship that should stave off a government shutdown, it looks set to widen the U.S. federal deficit further and could fan inflation -- prompting the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates faster.
The Bank of England meets later in the day and is expected to say that another rate increase could be nearing as Britain's economy grows faster than expected.
European stock markets opened the day lower, with blue-chip indexes in Frankfurt, Paris and London down 0.3-0.7 percent. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.1 percent, but remained near six-week lows hit earlier this week amid a rout in world stocks.
In China, Shanghai's benchmark index hit a six-month low, even as data showed the country's trade performance in January had exceeded expectations.
Investors remained wary after an aggressive selloff in equities in the past week on worries about the prospects of rising interest rates, which would shut off the liquidity spigot that has fed an exuberant rally in riskier assets. 
SPENDING SOARS
Still, U.S. stock futures traded higher, pointing to a firm opening for Wall Street shares after the U.S. budget deal.
""The scale of increase in spending was much larger than what markets were expecting just a few months ago. It will have as big an impact as tax cuts,"" said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities.
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX and often seen as investors' ""fear gauge"", fell 2.3 points to 27.73, but that was still more than twice the levels generally seen in the past few months.
Combined with an expected economic boost from President Donald Trump's planned tax cuts, the increased deficit spending could overheat already strong U.S. growth and accelerate inflation to levels not seen over a decade.
Such fears drove the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield back up to 2.84 percent, near Monday's four-year peak of 2.885 percent.
The Senate and the House were both expected to vote on the deal on Thursday, amid some opposition on both sides of the aisle.
""The news yesterday has set up a test for 3 percent on 10-year Treasury yields,"" said Francois Savary, CIO at Prime Partners, a Swiss wealth manager. ""They have made no effort to go for any consolidation, which shows they don't want to control what's happening with budget finances.""
In Europe, bond yields were also higher, with the prospect of increased fiscal spending after Wednesday's coalition government deal in Germany adding to some upward pressure on yields.
BOE AWAITED 
In currency markets, sterling was a touch weaker at $1.3865, not far from Tuesday's two-week low of $1.3838, ahead of a Bank of England meeting.
The BoE is widely expected to keep rates on hold as it weighs up the impact of November's rate rise on the economy.
Investors are more focused on whether any of the nine rate-setters vote for a hike at this meeting. That would be seen as adding to the likelihood of an increase in May, the next time the BoE is due to update its economic forecasts.
The budget deal in Washington supported the dollar against a broad range of currencies. At 0942 GMT it stood at 90.554, up 0.33 percent on the day. 
Europe's single currency dipped to $1.2231, its lowest level in more than two weeks, while the dollar was 0.3 percent firmer at 109.66 Japanese yen.
New Zealand's dollar fell to a four-week low at $0.7190 after New Zealand's central bank lowered its forecasts for inflation right out to 2020 and said stock market volatility this week was a warning that investors were nervous about the risk of higher inflation and rising interest rates.
The Chinese yuan, which last month posted its biggest monthly gain ever, slipped back 0.5 percent to 6.3205 per dollar.
Oil prices largely reversed earlier falls on Thursday as a North Sea pipeline outage and record Chinese imports countered U.S. crude production soaring past 10 million barrels per day.

The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.56%, France’s CAC 40 slid 0.31%, while Germany’s DAX 30 was down 0.63% by 03:30 a.m. ET (07:30 GMT).
Concerns over recent volatility on global stock markets persisted on Thursday. Equities wordlwide plummeted late last week after a strong U.S. jobs report sparked concerns over rising inflation.
Markets began to stabilize on Wednesday but traders were still cautious as high bond yields could cause them to plunge again.
European equities also found some support after German political leaders reached a breakthrough in coalition talks on Wednesday, putting an end to months of uncertainty.
Financial stocks were mostly higher, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) gained 0.34% and 4.03%, while Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) were up 0.04% and 3.47%.
Societe Generale earlier reported a small fourth-quarter profit, beating expectations for a loss, while Commerzbank said it may resume dividend payments for the first time in three years after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue of €2.19 billion.
Among peripheral lenders however,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) tumbled 0.90% and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) advanced 2.87% in Italy, while  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) dropped 0.56% and BBVA (MC:BBVA) edged up 0.12% in Spain.
Unicredit reported on Thursday its highest fourth-quarter profit in 10 years, beating analysts' estimates.
Elsewhere,  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) saw shares surge 4.56% even as the French advertising group Publicis said it plans to downwardly revise its 2018 profit target. The company reported a 0.8% rise in 2017 underlying sales to €9.69 billion.
In London, the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 slid 0.41%, weighed by sharp losses in the mining sector.
Shares in  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) declined 1.85% and BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) tumbled 1.92%, while rival group  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) lost 2.09%.
 Sage Group  (LON:SGE) was one of the worst performers on the index, with shares down 2.38% after UBS downgraded its ‘sell’ recommendation on the stock to “neutral”.
Financial stocks were also on the downside, as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) fell 0.30% and  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) retreated 0.45%, while the Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and Lloyds Banking (LON:LLOY) declined 0.68% and 0.89% respectively.
Meanwhile,  Compass Group  PLC (LON:CPG) was one of the top performers, with shares up 5.29% after the catering company said it expected full-year organic revenue growth to be at the higher end of its forecast, thanks to ongoing strength in the North American market and better-than-expected performance in Europe.
Later Thursday, the BoE was expected to leave its monetary policy on hold. Investors will especially be focusing on the central bank's statement for potential indications on future policy moves.
In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.24% gain, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.23% rise, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.40% increase."

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Samsung chairman named as suspect in $7.5 million tax evasion case,"By Ju-min Park and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' (KS:005930) ailing chairman, Lee Kun-hee, was named by South Korean police on Thursday as a suspect in an 8.2 billion won ($7.5 million) tax evasion case that involved the use of bank accounts held by employees. 
A series of scandals have dogged the family of Samsung, the country's biggest business empire. 
The chairman's son Jay Y. Lee, heir to the Samsung Group, was released from detention earlier this week after an appeals court halved his sentence for bribery and corruption to 2-1/2 years and suspended it for four years. 
Following a heart attack in 2014, the elder Lee, 76, has remained hospitalized in Seoul's Samsung Medical Centre and is difficult to communicate with having shown little sign of recovery. Until his imprisonment Jay Y. Lee had been regarded as the de facto head of the group.
Police said elder Lee could not be questioned due to his physical condition and Samsung declined comment.
""Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee and a Samsung executive managed funds in 260 bank accounts under names of 72 executives, suspected of evading taxes worth 8.2 billion won,"" Korean National Police Agency said in a statement, planning to send the case to prosecutors. 
Police added that the accounts, holding some 400 billion won, were found in the course of their probe into alleged improper payments for the renovation of Lee's family residence. 
The investigation into tax evasion harks back to the late payment of 130 billion won in tax in 2011, though only 8.2 billion of that sum falls within the statute of limitations, according to police.
The graft case that led to the younger Lee's arrest last year and brought down the former president Park Geun-hye prompted Samsung to vow to improve transparency in corporate governance and grant heads of the group's affiliates more autonomy from the Lee family. 
The group dismantled its corporate strategy office in late 2017. 
The new liberal government led by President Moon Jae-in elected after the corruption scandal promised to put family-run conglomerates under stronger scrutiny and end the practice of pardoning corporate tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes.
Though Jay Y. Lee has not been seen back at the office since his release on Feb.5, but members of the Korean business community expect him to take up the reins once again, and invest more in the business to create jobs that might help soothe public anger. 
Returning home from prison, the younger Lee apologized for not showing his best side and said he would do his best but did not give specifics on his business plans. 
While he spent a year behind bars, Samsung Electronics, the world's top semiconductors maker, earned record profit as it benefited from a memory chip ""super cycle"".
It is not the first time the elder Lee has been investigated for tax evasion. He was convicted in 2009 and later pardoned for tax evasion after being embroiled in a scandal that also involved the use of accounts held by trusted employees.
Police say they have since identified more such accounts.
Shares in Samsung Electronics rose 1.1 percent compared to a 0.5 percent rise in the wider market (KS11). Blue chip tech stocks bounced after recent falls as investors saw current valuations as attractive, analysts said.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 02:01AM ET</span>",China conglomerates aim for reset in tighter credit environment,"By Matthew Miller
BEIJING (Reuters) - More than a year ago, China abruptly shifted from a policy of providing its private conglomerates with cheap cash to push them to become global champions, and tightened capital controls and bank credit.
That seismic shift is still being felt today, as the non-state companies dump property and company stakes, and grapple with developing coherent strategies.
On Monday, Dalian Wanda Group announced it would sell a $1.24 billion stake in Wanda Film Holdings Co (SZ:002739) to  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Cultural Investment Holdings Ltd (SS:600715), a Beijing government-backed company.
That followed Wanda's announcement last week that it was shifting a $5.4 billion stake in its property unit to outside investors, led by Tencent Holdings (HK:0700).
For HNA Group, the aviation company that has extended its reach into logistics, tourism and financial services after splashing out $50 billion on dealmaking, the process of deleveraging has just started.
In recent weeks, the company has announced moves to raise billions in funding, including offloading property in Australia and hiring bankers to sell its leading stake in the Spanish hotels company NH Hotel Group SA (MC:NHH).
Last month, at an extraordinary meeting with its major bank creditors, HNA said the company faced a potential cash shortfall of at least $2.4 billion in the first quarter of the year.
Its liquidity problems have extended from overdue aircraft lease payments to a missed early repayment of a 1.7 billion yuan ($268.55 million) trust product.
Other private conglomerates like Fosun International (HK:0656) and Anbang Insurance Group are either reshaping their businesses and reducing debt, or halting fresh buyouts and searching for new shareholders under strict supervision of regulators.
""Some Chinese companies have gone on overseas acquisition binges and now they have too much debt,"" said Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor who has written about Dalian Wanda. He added that it was unclear whether the companies were ""looking for re-invention or just trying to put together a business logic that makes sense"".
HNA, Wanda and Anbang declined to comment. Fosun did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CONTROLLING RISK
The Chinese government is trying to control financial sector risk, and has made clear that its crackdown on companies using excessive leverage and short-term funding to buy offshore assets, especially in non-strategic sectors like property and sports, is set to continue.
The country's banking regulator last month said the reduction of corporate debt was a top priority. The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) also said it would move to clean up financial holding companies and dispose of high-risk institutions.
""A reset is a good way of describing what is going on,"" said Hernan Cristerna, global co-head of M&A at  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co. 
""The behavior of some - not all - of the companies was not entirely aligned with the industrial, dependable and cooperative approach that China wants to establish in the global arena.""
The CBRC had already targeted Wanda, HNA, Fosun and Anbang last June when it ordered top banks to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by those groups, halting some deals and prompting the current round of asset sales.
Other non-state conglomerates have also been under pressure to sell stakes, including Tomorrow Group, with interests in more than 30 domestic financial institutions.
The CBRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
KEY TRANSFORMATION 
Dalian Wanda's 14 percent equity stake sale in its commercial real estate unit to an investor group that included Tencent,  Sunac  China Holdings (HK:1918) and JD.com Inc (O:JD), is part of a move by the group's property arm into an operation with fewer assets. 
It follows a year of painful sales that included landmark real estate projects in London and Sydney, along with Wanda's $9 billion divestment of much of its domestic hotels and theme parks business.
""The key to Wanda's transformation is the transformation of Wanda Commercial Properties from a heavy-asset enterprise to an enterprise that focuses on light assets,"" Wang Jianlin said last month. That means more partnerships, fewer self-owned properties, and a significant reduction in corporate debt, Wang said. Last week's deal also is expected to pave the way for the re-listing of Wanda's commercial properties unit, analysts say, and may help Wanda develop an online-offline strategy. 
Fosun International, which paid $1.1 billion to buy Club Med and holds stakes in an assortment of lifestyle companies, including AHAVA, an Israeli skincare brand, also has undergone strategic rebranding. Fosun has also moved to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce net debt, and balance its acquisitions with asset sales. It is also looking to diversify risk through more public market listings, including the share sales of its tourism business. 
In January, Moody's Investors Service upgraded Fosun's corporate family rating to Ba2, still speculative, citing the firm's ""improved business profile"" and expectations that the company would maintain current leverage ratios.
The strategic shift by many of the non-state conglomerates has been accidental but necessary, said one senior Asia banker who has worked with some of the companies. 
""All these guys thought of themselves as private equity,"" the banker said. ""That mentality is now changing into 'what are the two or three businesses we truly care about and have scale and logic in?'""

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 01:45AM ET</span>",Walmart makes push to sell online goods at $10 and up to capture elusive e-commerce profit,"By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is asking vendors to supply it with more merchandise priced at $10 and up, as part of a major push to finally turn a profit at its online business, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. 
The new focus at the world’s largest retailer is on dry grocery products such as sauces, soaps and general merchandise items such as toys and home furnishings, the sources said.
Walmart’s goal is to see higher profit margins selling these more expensive items given the built-in cost of delivering goods purchased online, according to the people familiar with Walmart’s new strategy. 
Shipping Gillette Mach 3 Disposable Razors at $6.97, for example, costs the same as Gillette Fusion5 ProGlide Men's Razor Refills at $12.97.
In meetings last week with suppliers including Procter & Gamble Co,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) PLC, Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB) and Clorox Co, Walmart's e-commerce chief Marc Lore said Walmart.com wants to focus on merchandise priced at least $5 and preferably, more than $10, the people said. 
""Walmart has started to understand it cannot make money if they offer the lowest prices online on every item and then spend $4 or $5 trying to ship it over,"" said one supplier present at the meetings. ""It is not sustainable and more importantly their shareholders won't allow it.""
Walmart’s directive to suppliers marks a shift in strategy. The retailer for years has squeezed suppliers for pennies to drive the lowest prices for shoppers, both online and at its brick-and-mortar stores. Walmart will continue to press for bargain-priced items to sell at its 4,700 stores. But in addition, it will now implore suppliers to provide it with more expensive goods for sale online.
This new emphasis on more higher-priced goods at Walmart.com comes after the retailer acquired Jet.com in 2016 and is investing billions of dollars to make its online business more competitive. 
Walmart declined to comment on the meetings, but affirmed its commitment to “Every Day Low Prices” and offering the best prices online. 
“We are constantly looking for opportunities to expand our assortment with new items, and want to ensure that the items we add to the assortment are a great value but also make economic sense for the channel,” a Walmart spokeswoman said. 
Two people present at the Walmart meetings in Bentonville, Ark. - who were not authorized to speak on the record - said Walmart wants to avoid selling products online at a loss like rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), where there is much less of a focus on retail profit. Seattle-based Amazon profits on many but not all transactions, depending on price-matching, an order’s size, shipping speed and other factors. 
While Amazon has pressured suppliers for discounts usually given to bigger retailers, a person familiar with the matter said, it has been happy to sell popular items at cost or even at a loss if it means winning customers' loyalty over the long term. 
For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2BGby73. 
Amazon has a diverse array of profitable businesses to offset its retail losses, including commissions for third-party sales on its site, advertising sales and a business handling large enterprises' computing needs in the cloud. 
Amazon accounted for 43.5 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales in the 12 months to October 2017, compared to Walmart’s 3.6 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer.Walmart.com has tripled the items it sells to 70 million in the past year. It is looking to grow that fast, as it plays catch up with Amazon’s more than 300 million products for sale. 
Walmart.com already had begun to raise prices on some items sold online last year. By now enlisting suppliers to provide it with higher priced goods, it is taking that strategy a step further.
The move to offer more $10-and-up merchandise for sale online carries significant risk if bargain hunters reject the push and seek lower-priced goods elsewhere. A majority of Walmart’s low-income customers still tend to shop at its brick-and-mortar stores. 
But the retailer, with $485 billion in annual sales, is trying to attract a slightly more affluent audience to Walmart.com. 
For some suppliers, Walmart’s directive will entail going back to the drawing board and coming up with new items to sell on Walmart.com. That, in turn, will require planning and investment in new product design, packaging, marketing and sales. One Walmart vendor said that more than 95 percent of its merchandise currently for sale on Walmart.com is priced between $3 and $8. 
Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Unilever declined to comment. Clorox did not respond to requests for comment.

""They are no longer saying 'give us the lowest priced product for dot com,'"" said one person present at the meetings, referring to Walmart.com. ""They want items that retail for more than $10; those are the products that make money for them online.”

Mexican news outlet Aristegui Noticias reported on Tuesday that officials gave Chinese representatives 11 months' notice about a contract to build a train project linking Mexico City with the wealthy, industrial city of Queretaro, citing a letter from China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) (SS:601186).
The report details a 2014 meeting between Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who was then finance minister, and Chinese officials to discuss cooperation between the countries, which took place 10 days before the international tender launched.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry stressed the meeting between Videgaray and Chinese officials was publicized and touched on a wide range of projects, including the Mexico-Queretaro railway, which was already public.
""At all times, it was made clear to Chinese officials that the projects would be realized through public tenders,"" the ministry said, adding that efforts to promote ties between the countries via a working group were ""announced in an open and transparent fashion.""
However, questions were raised after 16 firms - including  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Mitsubishi (T:8058) - withdrew from the rail tender, leaving a consortium led by state-controlled CRCC as the de facto winner, Reuters reported.
Around that time, it also emerged that Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's wife was buying a home from a Mexican firm that was part of the Chinese-led consortium, touching off a political firestorm.
Videgaray's participation in the working group was not mentioned in a Mexican government auditor's report, which found that Videgaray and Pena Nieto had not benefited or tried to influence officials responsible for awarding contracts, according to Aristegui Noticias.
The group in which Videgaray participated has yielded other successful collaborations between the nations, such as a Mexico-China investment fund, the foreign ministry said.

The yuan dropped the most since August 2015 after trade figures missed estimates and amid speculation policy makers will step up efforts to rein in gains.
Shares in Japan closed higher after almost flat-lining earlier, a pattern of swings that has unfolded this week in the wake of the recent rout. China’s stocks fell for a third day, while Hong Kong shares climbed. S&P 500 Index futures were up after dropping early in Asian trading. U.S. 10-year yields were steady after gains resulting from weak demand at a bond sale Wednesday that had pushed the yield back toward the recent four-year high.
“There are a lot of risks ahead and we’ve been lulled into a false sense of security over the last couple of years with central banks keeping rates low for a very long time,” Steve Goldman, Kapstream Capital head and portfolio manager, said on Bloomberg TV. “Risk assets are going to continue to perform well albeit with a lot more volatility than what we’ve seen in the past.”
Concerns that the Federal Reserve could accelerate its tightening schedule this year has triggered a surge in government bond yields. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Wednesday sustained inflation could force more hikes. For equity bulls, a lingering issue is the wisdom of doing what they always do -- buy the dip -- when more selling by speculators may be imminent after Monday’s break in volatility markets. Accounts of losses and liquidations at hedge funds specializing in the asset class were rife Wednesday morning even as Wall Street strategists urged investors to consider the market’s solid underpinning in economic growth and earnings.
For more on this week’s market turmoil:
The yuan fell the most since the currency’s devaluation in August 2015 after China reported a much narrower than expected trade surplus as imports jumped. The country has resumed its Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership plan after a two-year halt, granting licenses to about a dozen global money managers that can raise funds in China for overseas investments, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing people it didn’t identify.
Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar fell after the central bank delayed the timing for when it expects to reach it’s inflation target and cut its growth forecast. Oil extended a slide after a report showing record crude production from U.S. fields. Gold dropped to a four-week low. U.S. equities fluctuated through the session on high volume before ending lower after heavy selling in the final 15 minutes of trading Wednesday. While the Cboe Volatility Index eased back, it’s about 40 percent above its average since 1990.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 12:41AM ET</span>",BlackRock plans to raise $10 billion for equity investments: source,"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) plans to raise about $10 billion as part of a new business that would take direct stakes in companies, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The move marks a new strategy for the company that manages more than $6 trillion for investors through publicly offered mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, many of which own broad swaths of the market. 
A multibillion-dollar fund could put the world's largest asset manager in more direct competition to own promising private companies with the likes of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (N:BRKa) Warren Buffett and private-equity firms, including Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), from which it was initially spun out.
The approach would likely be to take minority stakes in companies and hold them for a relatively long period of time, the person said.
BlackRock was not immediately available for comment. The company's plan to raise about $10 billion was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has long pushed corporate executives to adjust their behavior to focus on generating long-term value for shareholders, rather than simply meeting short-term profit targets.
The person said the new effort is being chaired by Mark Wiseman, a top executive who the company hired in 2016 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Wiseman's first big move was to spearhead an effort to improve BlackRock's ability to pick winning stocks in part by using technology to aid the process.

(Reuters) - At least four companies managed to price their initial public offerings (IPOs) in New York on Wednesday, defying this week's stock market volatility which led to three other stock market flotations being postponed.
The S&P 500 and the Dow saw their sharpest drop in more than six years on Monday, and volatility has continued even as the indexes recovered some of their losses. This has made the steady investor demand typically required for an IPO scarce.
IPO pricings that had been scheduled for Wednesday in New York for  Cactus Inc  (N:WHD),  Evolus Inc  (O:EOLS), Victory Capital Holdings (O:VCTR) and Mudrick Capital  went ahead. 
However, Victory Capital's IPO was priced well below its $17 to $19 indicated price range, at $13 per share. Quintana Energy Services postponed its IPO on Wednesday, while Chinese wearable technology Huami (O:HMI) had yet to publicly give an update on its IPO as of late Friday. 
""When the market has that kind of a swing, it has a negative effect on the IPO market,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange traded funds. 
""The IPO market will probably not be closed, but it's going to affect the deals that are on the calendar,"" Smith added.
On Tuesday, Turkish fast-food chain operator TFI Tab Food Investments postponed its planned $220 million initial public offering in New York.
Argentine biotechnology firm  Bioceres SA  (BA:BIOX) this week extended by one day the offer period on its IPO in the U.S. market.
Last year saw an 84 percent pick-up in the proceeds raised from IPOs on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ after a weak 2016, according to consultancy E&Y.
The uptick continued last month with 20 new listings worth $9.95 billion, the biggest January haul on record, Thomson Reuters data showed.

However, U.S. security company ADT Inc (N:ADT), owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO), last month priced its IPO well below its expected range.

LG and rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) had hoped to avoid any fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" manufacturing and jobs mantra, but took a hit after his decision last month to impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports of washing machines and key components.
According to a South Korean newspaper, the two companies are planning to hike the prices of their washing machines in the United States by about 5-10 percent in the second quarter.
They are currently in talks with U.S. retailers such as  Best Buy  (N:BBY),  Home Depot  (N:HD), Lowe's (N:LOW) and Sears, Korea Economic Daily reported, citing unnamed industry sources. 
LG, which had said it would hike prices in the United States after the tough tariffs were announced, did not specify when the 4-8 percent rise would come into effect. 
The company will concentrate its efforts on selling more of its premium washing machines, priced at $900 or more, in the United States, an LG spokeswoman said. 
Samsung Electronics did not have an immediate comment. 

Asked if it plans to raise washer prices in the United States, Samsung previously said it was reviewing the implications of the U.S. decision and any changes would be discussed with its business partners directly.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The board of Wynn Resorts has been sued by shareholders, claiming the board knew for years that Steve Wynn, founder and chief executive of the casino operator, had been accused of sexual misconduct and failed to investigate.
The company declined to comment.
Wynn resigned on Tuesday after accusations of sexual misconduct by women who worked for him, becoming one of the biggest names in the business world to quit over such accusations. The accusations were reported by the Wall Street Journal in January.
Wynn has called the claims ""preposterous"" and the board of Wynn Resorts has said it was investigating.
Casino veteran Matt Maddox has replaced Wynn as chief executive of Wynn Resorts.
Shares in Wynn Resorts, which owns the Wynn, Encore Las Vegas casinos and Wynn Macau unit, have declined nearly 20 percent since the newspaper report on Jan 26. The company is worth around $17 billion by market capitalization.
The case is a derivative lawsuit, meaning any damages paid by Wynn and the other board members who are named defendants would be paid to Wynn Resorts, not directly to investors.
The lawsuit filed in Clark County, Nevada, claimed, based on press reports, that ""a board representative"" was notified of Wynn's alleged misconduct in 2009 by Wynn's then-wife Elaine. 
The Norfolk County Retirement System, a Wynn Resorts investor, claimed in the lawsuit that the board should have known of its founder's misconduct by 2015 when a lawsuit by Elaine Wynn accused her former husband of ""reckless risk-taking behavior.""
The lawsuit said the board breached its fiduciary duty to investors by not investigating the accusations and by continuing to recommend Wynn's leadership to investors.
Wynn Resorts illustrates the risk to a company's stock from misconduct accusations against an executive.
The company has formed a special committee to investigate Wynn, which is often used as a defense against a derivative lawsuit. The plaintiff said the directors on the special committee were not truly independent of Wynn.
Dozens of high-profile men have been fired or have resigned from their jobs in politics, media, entertainment and business after facing accusations of sexual misconduct.

Twenty-First Century Fox Inc reached a $90 million settlement of shareholder claims over harassment allegations at its Fox News Channel, which cost the jobs of longtime news chief Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O'Reilly.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 09:05PM ET</span>","Tesla sticks by Model 3 target, warns spending could rise in 2018","By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said on Wednesday it was sticking with Chief Executive Elon Musk's revised production targets for its Model 3 sedan, cheering investors who have put up with two delays, but the electric automaker's plans to raise spending this year underscored its growing need for cash.
Reflecting the mixed fourth-quarter report, shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company, which are up 10 percent since the start of the year, were barely changed in extended trading. 
Money-losing Tesla's long-term viability depends on annually selling billions of dollars of Model 3s, the new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S.. Tesla said that net reservations for the new model were stable during the fourth quarter.
Production delays blamed on battery issues resulted in only 1,550 deliveries in the fourth quarter, far below the 4,100 vehicles expected by analysts - meaning revenue from the highly anticipated vehicle has yet to hit Tesla's bottom line. 
But obstacles to production of 5,000 vehicles by the end of the second quarter ""were getting smaller with every week,"" Musk told analysts on a conference call. Once at that production rate, Tesla could begin to generate sustained positive operating income ""at some point in 2018,"" Musk said. 
""I'm cautiously optimistic that we will actually be GAAP profitable with no asterisk,"" he added. Using that accounting method, Tesla lost nearly $2 billion last year.
Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss, but the loss was not as wide as analysts were expecting, and revenue just topped targets.
CASH BURN
Musk reiterated a bold goal to produce 1 million vehicles annually by 2020, with plans to make capital investments related to the upcoming Model Y SUV toward the end of this year. Nearly two years ago, Musk proclaimed that Tesla would produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018, which Model 3 troubles has made near impossible.
Analyst Jamie Albertine at Consumer Edge Research said there was a trade-off between accelerating growth and vehicle quality, and it was better not to rush Model 3 production and risk a recall. Tesla's reiteration of its production target for the quarter was good news, he said.
Tesla Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said that more than 50 percent of Tesla's spending was on the Model 3, underscoring that project's importance and its high cost. 
Tesla burned through $3.4 billion last year, and $787 million in the fourth quarter alone, and said capital spending in 2018 would be ""slightly more"" than in 2017 due to expanded production at its Fremont factory and Nevada Gigafactory. 
Other upcoming capital needs include the recently unveiled Tesla Semi, the Model Y and a factory in China. 
Tesla ended the fourth quarter with $3.37 billion in cash, just below the $3.5 billion in the previous quarter, which had been boosted by a $1.8 billion debt sale. For the first time, Tesla securitized its leases, raising $546 million earlier this month in securitized notes backed by Model S and X lease payments.
Still, Tesla's cash burn eased in the quarter, in part thanks to customer deposits for the just unveiled Semi truck and Roadster, inventory reduction of finished vehicles and some Model 3 capital spending deferred to the first quarter.
The niche carmaker has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV. 
Still, it faces a wave of electric vehicles from competitors on the horizon. Global automakers from  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) to Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) are cumulatively investing $90 billion in electrification over the next five years, with luxury models from Audi and Tata Motors Ltd's Jaguar (NS:TAMO) due to hit showrooms this summer. 
Amid that sales pressure, Musk announced that Jon McNeill, president of global sales and service, and seen by some as a possible successor to Musk, was leaving the company. He will join U.S. ride hailing company Lyft as its new chief operating officer.
Despite the competitive environment, Tesla's stock has soared 35 percent in the last year, making the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker, with a market capitalization of $56.1 billion, just behind General Motors Co (N:GM), which had net revenue of $145.6 billion in 2017. 
Musk scored a clear victory on Tuesday with the successful launch of the world's most powerful rocket, Falcon Heavy, made by his private company SpaceX. But some analysts have questioned whether his myriad of other interests, from space exploration to tunnel boring technology, are a distraction at a critical time within Tesla. 
Net loss widened to $675.4 million, or $4.01 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $121.3 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Total revenue rose to $3.29 billion from $2.28 billion.

Excluding items, the company lost $3.04 per share, above the $3.12 per share loss expected by analysts.

""Swiss Re informs that it is engaged in preliminary discussions with SoftBank Group Corp regarding a potential minority investment in Swiss Re,"" the world's second largest reinsurer said.
The deal under discussion is for the purchase of up to a third of Swiss Re's shares at a premium, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Such a deal would make SoftBank the largest investor in the reinsurance group at a time when chief executive Masayoshi Son is moving to transform the telecoms company he founded into one of the world's largest technology investors. 
SoftBank plans to offer Swiss Re's insurance products directly to users of other companies it has invested in, such as Uber and WeWork, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 
A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment. 
On Wednesday, SoftBank said it was planning to raise further funds that could be used to shore up its finances or to make further investments by listing its domestic telecoms unit. Local media estimated the proceeds at $18 billion.
SoftBank last year raised more than $93 billion to create the Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund, and by the end of December had invested $27.5 billion in 20 tech firms through its investment arm.
The group's total interest-bearing debt at the end of December was 15.8 trillion yen ($144.5 billion) and Masayoshi Son said on Wednesday he wants to keep debt levels below 3.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortization. That ratio stands at 2.8 times currently. 
Swiss Re's shares last traded at 90.18 Swiss francs, giving it a market capitalization of 31.51 billion francs ($34 billion). 
Swiss Re's largest shareholder is BlackRock Institutional Trust Co with a 5.02 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
""Discussions are at a very early stage. There is no certainty that any transaction will be agreed, nor as to the terms, timing, or form of any transaction,"" Swiss Re said.

SoftBank shares fell 1 percent in early morning trading in Tokyo, compared with a rise of just under 1 percent in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index (N225).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The sharp drop in U.S. stocks earlier this week, which led to the liquidation of two popular exchange-traded products (ETPs), was not caused due to volatility-linked securities, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Ed Tilly said on a call with analysts on Wednesday.
Monday's volatility shock in U.S. stock markets had led to some misconceptions about the Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX (VIX), and related exchange-traded products (ETPs), Cboe's Tilly said.
""The market drop caused a spike in realized volatility and in turn risk was repriced. It's important to note that products linked to volatility do not cause volatility,"" he said.
Tilly was speaking on a conference call hosted by Cboe to address concerns around market volatility in the aftermath of Monday's historic hit to stocks.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) slumped more than 4 percent on Monday while the VIX index - Wall Street's so-called fear gauge - registered its largest-ever single-day jump.
Investors using ETPs linked to the VIX were pummeled and two banks,  Credit Suisse  Group (S:CSGN) and  Nomura Co Ltd  (T:9716), said on Tuesday they would terminate two exchange traded notes that bet on low volatility in stock prices.
Some market participants blamed Monday's late-day stocks meltdown and the after-hours futures rollercoaster on the massive unwinding of short positions in volatility-linked ETPs.
Tilly said he expected investors to continue to use short volatility strategies in the future, noting that there are many other ways for investors to express a short volatility bias without resorting to VIX-linked ETPs.
The liquidation of the VIX-linked ETPs has left many retail players smarting from big losses and led to calls for more regulation.
Cboe Chief Operating Officer Chris Concannon said it was likely that regulators would take a closer look at these products.
""Whenever you have these events where you see investors harmed by a liquidation event, there is going to be a great deal of regulatory scrutiny,"" Concannon said.

""Really the scrutiny will be around how they were sold and who they were sold to,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  Prudential  Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), the largest U.S. life insurer by assets, on Wednesday reported a 7.6 percent rise in quarterly operating profit that topped analysts' estimates, helped by higher policy fees in its annuities business.
Prudential's adjusted operating profit was $1.17 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $1.09 billion, or $2.46 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $2.65, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Adjusted operating income from the company's individual annuities business rose 28 percent to $541 million, driven in part by higher policy fees that were triggered by higher account values in variable annuities.
Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential's total assets under management rose to $1.39 trillion as of Dec. 31 from $1.26 trillion a year earlier.
Adjusted operating income for the investment management division surged 36.6 percent, to $306 million, from the prior year quarter in part because of rising stock market values.
The results come in a quarter in which financial services companies have revealed more details about the impact of U.S. tax reform on their businesses.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the most far-reaching tax reforms in the United States for 30 years, lowered the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and imposes a repatriation tax on earnings from foreign subsidiaries. 
Prudential (LON:PRU) booked a one-time gain of $2.87 billion in the quarter related to the tax law.
Adjusted operating income for Prudential's individual life insurance business sunk 29 percent to $98 million from the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects more claims than expected and changes that Prudential made to actuarial assumptions as part of a yearly review, the insurer said.
Prudential's group insurance and retirement unit reported a 13.3 percent drop to $313 million from the year ago quarter, driven in part by higher expenses and weaker underwriting results in its group life insurance business.
Shares of the insurer were up 1.60 percent at $111.17 in extended trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished lower on Wednesday, losing ground late in the session as a jump in Treasury yields kept investor nervousness high.
Oil prices fell to a one-month low after U.S. data fueled fears of oversupply. 
Wednesday's lower close in stocks followed another choppy trading session, suggesting that investors are still jittery after the recent steep selloff in equities.
On Tuesday, U.S. stocks roared back from Monday's selloff, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 index saw their biggest one-day declines in two years. 
A spike in bond yields last Friday sparked the Wall Street rout, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling.
Benchmark Treasury yields rose on Wednesday after the weak demand in the U.S. Treasury Department auction of new 10-year notes and the U.S. Senate reached a budget deal, possibly adding to pressure on stocks. 
""Obviously there's a lot of concerned and nervous people. You might have had day traders trying to get out at the end of the day. Who knows what tomorrow brings,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""The 10-year rate went back up... so if you start making new territory there, that could start making people very nervous."" 
On Wednesday, benchmark 10-year notes last fell 18/32 in price to yield 2.834 percent, from 2.766 percent late on Tuesday.
The yields had reached as high as 2.885 percent in overnight trading on Monday, the highest since January 2014, after stronger inflation data on Friday led investors to fear that the Federal Reserve may raise rates more times than previously expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 19.42 points, or 0.08 percent, to 24,893.35, the S&P 500 lost 13.48 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,681.66 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.90 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,051.98. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, fell 2.3 points to 27.73, but that was still more than twice levels generally seen in the past few months.
""We certainly could be looking at a market that's going to have to get more comfortable with the potential for a higher rate of inflation and potentially higher interest rates. Central bank tightening needs to be taken seriously all of the time,"" said Fritz Folts, chief investment strategist at 3EDGE Asset Management, in Boston.
Earlier European shares closed up 2.0 percent, snapping a seven-day losing streak, while a world stock index was up slightly.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 2.02 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.06 percent.
Emerging market stocks lost 0.24 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.4 percent lower.
In the energy market, oil prices fell 2.0 percent. U.S. crude fell 2.5 percent to settle at $61.79 per barrel and Brent dropped 2 percent to $65.51. U.S. data showed an unexpected build in refined products, fanning fears of oversupply headed into the slow-demand season. 
DOLLAR UP, GOLD SLIPS
The U.S. dollar rose, marking its biggest one-day gain in more than three months against a basket of currencies, with much of the dollar's advance stemming from euro's weakness in the wake of reports that the leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), Martin Schulz, would not be taking over as finance minister for Europe's biggest economy
The dollar index rose 0.84 percent, with the euro down 0.03 percent to $1.2258.

Gold slipped as the U.S. dollar strengthened. Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent at $1,313.67 per ounce.

(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) trounced Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday, helped by increases in the fees it collects from cable and satellite distributors.
Shares of the media company, which is in the process of selling film and television assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), initially climbed 2 percent in after-hours trading, then sank back to the unchanged mark.
Revenue from Fox's cable division, which houses the Fox News and FX channels among others, rose 11 percent from October through December to $4.41 billion, accounting for more than half of total revenue in the quarter.
That beat analysts' average estimate of $4.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Fox plans to focus on sports and news after it wins regulatory clearance to sell much of its film, television and international assets to Disney. 
Last week, Fox announced a deal to air Thursday night National Football League games on its broadcast network for the next five seasons, paying more than $3 billion according to a source familiar with the matter.
Wall Street analysts asked about the deal on a conference call following earnings. Fox executives stood behind it, even though NFL TV ratings have declined for the past two seasons, arguing the scarcity of big, live audiences will continue to make NFL games attractive to advertisers and concentrating more games on one network will help draw viewers. Fox already airs Sunday afternoon NFL games.
""We really want Fox to be the home of that kind of compelling product,"" said Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch.
Revenue at the Fox broadcasting unit fell 5.8 percent to $1.81 billion, as the year-ago quarter included strong ratings during the U.S presidential election and baseball's World Series. Profit was hit by higher sports programming costs including more NFL and Big Ten Conference college football games.
Fox, like its peers, has been adapting to keep hold of viewers gravitating toward online streaming services. The company said it now reaches nearly 4 million customers through digital television services. 
Total revenue rose 4.6 percent to $8.04 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $7.94 billion. Revenue at Fox's film division fell 1 percent to $2.25 billion.
The company said it gained $1.34 billion from the recent U.S. tax law. (http://21.cf/2siO7g9)

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","Canada's Trudeau under pressure to cork provinces' wine, oil row","By Rod Nickel and David Ljunggren
WINNIPEG, Manitoba/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced pressure on Wednesday from an important political ally and the business community to settle an oil pipeline dispute that has sparked fears of a trade war between two neighboring provinces.
Alberta and British Columbia (B.C.) are scrapping over  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) Canada's planned C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which was approved by Ottawa in 2016.
While Alberta oil companies need the line to reach higher-paying offshore markets, it is opposed by many in B.C. who worry about spills on their land and coastline.
The escalating tension has forced Trudeau to take a firm approach to getting the pipeline built and helping Alberta recover from a deep dive in energy prices, without losing crucial British Columbia political support.
B.C., ruled by a left-leaning New Democrat-Green alliance, said last week it would temporarily block increased oil shipments through the province while it examines how easily Alberta oil can be cleaned up. Alberta retaliated on Tuesday by halting imports of B.C. wine.
The trade war tit-for-tat has been mocked as the ""Pinot pipe"" war, and inter-provincial ""sour grapes,"" and has stirred speculation about what goods might be targeted next.
""Alberta won't back down, but we need Trudeau to step up,"" said Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, an important Trudeau ally, on Twitter.
Notley has cooperated with Trudeau on implementing a carbon-pricing plan to reduce emissions, and Trudeau in turn backed the Trans Mountain project. 
Notley's call was echoed by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. ""Boycotts ... will not resolve an issue that is ultimately our federal government's responsibility,"" the chamber said.
B.C. Premier John Horgan said on Wednesday that he had no intention of escalating the trade battle with Alberta: ""I don't believe it's in anyone's interests to have dueling premiers."" 
Officials from his government will meet with their federal counterparts on Thursday to ""clarify our intentions and clarify what we believe is our jurisdiction"" on the pipeline issue, he told reporters.
Trudeau said his government would stand up for the ""national interest,"" but disclosed little about possible next steps. ""We're continuing to discuss and engage with the B.C. government, with the Alberta government,"" he told reporters in Ottawa on Wednesday.
A Canadian government source said Trudeau spoke with both premiers last week and made it clear he wants the pipeline built. Pressed as to what the prime minister might do next, the source cited Trudeau as saying last week that the dispute was still in the early stages.
Whatever happens, the dispute offers Trudeau big risk and reward, said Tom Bateman, associate political science professor at New Brunswick's St. Thomas University.
Voters in environmentally conscious B.C. provided the government in the last election with its biggest beachhead west of Ontario, which Trudeau needs to maintain in the 2019 vote. 
But forging a resolution would also help Trudeau shed his ""fluffy and superficial"" reputation, Bateman said. ""He's in a box and he's got to figure a way to get out of it.""
MUDDY WATERS
Kinder Morgan is carrying out little construction work as it seeks the final permits and path approvals it needs from municipal governments and has delayed the project's start-up date to December 2020.
Under a trade agreement among western provinces, B.C. has the right to block oil if it has environmental concerns, said Ross Hickey, assistant economics professor at University of British Columbia.
If British Columbia decides the pipeline is too risky, after completing its spills study, Trudeau could ask Canada's Supreme Court to settle the question of whether federal or provincial authority prevails, said Peter Russell, professor emeritus of political science at University of Toronto.
""It's kind of the Canadian way,"" Russell said. ""We have strong and popular governments at the federal and provincial level, and they fight each other over popularity, jurisdiction and power more than any other country in the world.""
A spokeswoman for Kinder Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ottawa is due to unveil draft legislation on Thursday to improve the way pipelines and mines are assessed.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Bulls vs. bears: taking sides on the stock market,"By Lewis Krauskopf and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a steep pullback in U.S. stocks in the last few days from record highs set in January, investors are debating whether the market is ready to resume a march higher or if they should be bracing for a steeper correction.
Here are five arguments for each case: 
REASONS TO BE BULLISH 
STRONG FUNDAMENTALS: A strong economy is key to optimism that stocks will keep rising. Bulls cite a healthy labor market and strong earnings. Labor: U.S. job growth surged in January and the unemployment rate of 4.1 percent is at a 17-year low. Earnings: Wall Street now expects S&P 500 earnings growth of 18.4 percent for the year, up from a 12 percent estimate on Jan. 1 as analysts account for an earnings boost from a corporate tax cut.
""We see a continued strong macro background,"" said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. 
THE PULLBACK FINALLY HAPPENED: As the market steadily climbed to record highs in January, investors were nervous that the longer the market went without retrenching the more severe a pullback could be. The S&P 500 late last month reached a streak of 396 trading days without a 5 percent correction, the longest on record, according to LPL Financial. With Monday's drop, the S&P 500 had declined 7.8 percent from its Jan. 26 record.
""It was about time to see a little bit of a correction in stocks,"" Matthew Cheslock, trader at Virtu Financial, said from the New York Stock Exchange floor earlier this week. 
POLICY POTENTIAL: With a U.S. tax overhaul now signed into law, investors are more optimistic that Congress may be able to pass legislation to boost infrastructure spending. That stands to directly sway shares of construction-related stocks, but could also stimulate growth more widely.
Companies “have announced significant earnings pickups as a result of the lower tax rate,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. ""We definitely think that is not fully factored into the market.""
RATES STILL LOW: Even as concerns about rising bond yields and interest rates spook some investors, bulls are quick to mention that rates are rising off extremely low levels.
""Rates and inflation, even though they have ticked up, are still at very low levels relative to history, monetary policy is still easy,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. 
THE LONG-TERM VIEW: Strategists are keeping their year-end targets intact. Despite the 6.2 percent drop in the benchmark S&P 500 from its Jan. 26 high to Feb. 6, investors are still expecting mild to moderate gains by year-end.
REASONS TO BE BEARISH:
INFLATION: The biggest, most commonly held fear investors are talking about right now is that inflation will rise sharply enough to force the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest rate increases. The S&P 500 fell 2 percent on Feb. 2 after data showed the biggest annual gain in wages in more than 8-1/2 years. 
""If interest rates continue to accelerate to the upside, what scares the market is if they go up fast,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas
LINGERING VOLATILITY: Shaken after months of a relatively subdued market, Wall Street is bracing for more severe swings ahead. While some traders view this as opportunity, the renewed volatility also could make investors more skittish about stocks.
""The market is in concussion protocol here,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina. ""It took a very violent hit over the last several days, there are going to be some lingering effects from that.""
Investors are also keeping an eye on other potential risks: U.S.-North Korea tensions, an ongoing probe of possible ties between President Donald Trump's election campaign and Russia and the possibility that Democrats could gain ground on Trump's Republican party in U.S. mid-term elections in November.
MORE SHOES TO DROP: The stock slump led to a massive unwinding of a short position in products related to the VIX volatility index, as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Nomura announced the shuttering of their respective exchange-traded notes that bet on lower volatility.
“Is there some systematic risk that we are not seeing as a result of some of these trades that are being unwound?” said Greenwood Capital's Todd.
STRETCHED VALUATIONS: Even after the pullback, stocks look expensive to some investors. The S&P 500 was trading on Tues. at 16.9 times Wall Street estimates for the next 12 months compared with its 20-year average of 16.4 and the 20 year median of 15.6.
""We're dealing with a very historically expensive market offering little attractive value. I expect investors will get a better entry point in the future,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
CHANGE AT THE FED: Investors have generally expected a smooth transition from Janet Yellen to Jerome Powell as Fed chair, with little difference in approach to rate policy.
But a change atop the U.S. central bank still adds to the uncertainty in the market, and the pullback could test whether Powell's leadership will provide a ""put"" that supports stock prices as had been the expectation for investors under past Fed chairs.
""Until we see what Powell policy is, the markets aren’t likely to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>",Brazilian antitrust agency approves Bayer-Monsanto tie-up,"By Bruno Federowski and Leonardo Goy
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian antitrust agency Cade on Wednesday approved Bayer AG's (DE:BAYGn) proposed takeover of U.S. seeds company  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) without requiring further asset sales beyond a global proposal announced last October.
Cade's commissioners voted 4-2 in favor of the tie-up under an agreement, negotiated between the companies and global antitrust agencies, that included the sale of several of Bayer's assets to BASF SE (DE:BASFn).
Approval of the transaction in Brazil, a powerhouse producer of grains and other agricultural commodities, clears a crucial hurdle for the deal, which the companies initially aimed to have approved by the end of 2017. 
The transaction, valued at $66 billion when announced in September 2016, would create the world's largest seeds and pesticides company. The value of the deal has since been revised to $63.5 billion as Monsanto reduced its debt load. [IFR3fvQLn]
The companies are waiting for approval of the deal in jurisdictions including the European Union and the United States, where final rulings are still pending.
In Brazil, the transaction faced fierce opposition from soy and cotton growers as well as seed producers who thought it would give the combining companies excessive market power.
Rachel Mendonça, an attorney who represented three associations against the deal, highlighted Cade's imposition of limits on licensing and sales practices by the new company, but conceded she had lost the argument for more asset sales in Brazil.
Earlier this week, Bayer said in a statement it had proposed solutions to allay antitrust concerns in the EU. Bayer had agreed to sell seed and herbicide businesses to BASF for 5.9 billion euros ($7.24 billion). It emerged this week the offer would also involve divestments of vegetable seeds business in some EU countries, a source familiar with the matter said.

Most of Cade's board said those measures would be enough to address antitrust concerns laid out by its technical staff in October, when it recommended the deal be blocked or approved with conditions.

China Consumer, Wholesale Inflation 
China releases January consumer and producer price inflation on Thursday. The reports are expected to show that consumer prices rose by an annualized 1.5% last month, while producer prices are forecast to increase by 4.3% on a year-over-year basis.
Commodities such as gold are highly sensitive to Chinese macro data as the Asian nation is largest consumer of commodities. 
Bank of England Rate Decision
Economist forecast Bank of England (BoE) officials will vote to keep interest rate unchanged following the central bank’s decision to hike rates in November 2017 for the first time in decade.
The BoE inflation report is expected to show inflation continues to run ahead of the central bank’s 2% target, and could draw hawkish commentary on monetary policy from the BoE.
During its December meeting, the BoE Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 9-0 in favour of keeping rates unchanged. 
GBP/USD fell 0.48% to $1.3882.
US Initial Jobless Claims, Fed Speakers

(Reuters) - Credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's on Wednesday cut  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's credit ratings, days after the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed regulatory restrictions on the bank.
Wells Fargo's long-term issuer credit rating was downgraded to ""A-"" from ""A"" and short-term issuer credit rating to ""A-2"" from ""A-1"". Regulatory risk for Wells is more severe than previously expected and the process for improving its governance and operational risk policies may take longer than previously expected, S&P said in a statement.  Wells Fargo said it was disappointed with the S&P rating. As part of the Fed's restrictions, the lender is not allowed to grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 ""until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls"". 
""We take the consent order very seriously and are confident in our ability to meet the requirements, while continuing to serve customers' financial needs"", the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>",Fidelity's new asset allocation head tasked with stemming outflows,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments has lured an executive from a rival firm to help stem billions of dollars in outflows from its flagship retirement franchise. 
The mutual fund giant said on Wednesday it had hired AllianceBernstein executive Vadim Zlotnikov to take over its $440 billion global asset allocation division. Zlotnikov will report directly to Charlie Morrison, Fidelity's head of asset management. 
Zlotnikov's new duties include oversight of Fidelity's Freedom Funds, which are a staple offering in retirement plans offered by U.S. corporations, hospitals, municipalities and universities. The funds have lost market share to Vanguard, but in the past three years they have put up performance figures that are better than a majority of rivals, industry data shows. 
""We've seen stronger client demand for the Freedom Funds over the past year, driven by their outstanding performance and low fees,"" Fidelity spokesman Adam Banker said in an email. 
Still, Zlotnikov, who had been chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein, will have to contend with Vanguard Group, which has dominated the target-date fund industry since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2014, Vanguard usurped Fidelity as the No. 1 provider of funds that reduce risk as investors near retirement.
Assets in Fidelity's Freedom Funds, which include the $31 billion 2020 Fund, increased 23 percent over the past three years to $224 billion, according to data from Morningstar Inc. But those gains at the No. 2 target-date fund provider have come mostly from the buoyant stock market. 
During the past three years, investors have made net withdrawals of nearly $8 billion from Freedom Funds, according to Morningstar. 
By contrast, Vanguard's target-date fund assets have surged about 66 percent over the past three years to $373 billion, according to Morningstar. Vanguard has benefited from capital gains while collecting a dominant share of the net deposits flowing into the target-date fund industry.
Zlotnikov is expected to join Fidelity late in the second quarter. He succeeds Nancy Prior, who had been leading Fidelity's bond and global asset allocation divisions. Prior will continue in her role as president of the bond division, Fidelity said.

Many are even looking for an opportunity to buy ""short volatility"" again using exchange-traded products (ETPs).
Two banks,  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) and  Nomura Co Ltd  (T:9716), said on Tuesday they would terminate two exchange traded notes (ETN) that bet on low volatility in stock prices, including Credit Suisse's VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (P:XIV) which will stop trading by Feb. 20. 
""(Volatility-linked ETPs) are the easiest way for long portfolio managers to hedge their portfolio,"" said Seth Golden, the Ocala, Florida-based president of Finom Group, who rose to fame last year after the New York Times profiled the former logistics manager for discount store retailer Target who started trading volatility products.
As long as people are looking to hedge their exposure there will be other participants willing to take on that risk, he said.
    Monday's volatility shock resulted in a 32 percent drawdown for Golden but as of Tuesday, he was only down about 16 percent, he said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the performance of Golden's portfolio.
    ""I was not only able to weather the storm but also put on exposure, add to my current short position, to the level that I desire,"" he said. 
    Across internet forums where such investors gather, and in interviews with Reuters, many volatility investors' reactions have melded confusion, disappointment and anger over a bad trade with a continued appreciation for exchange traded notes like XIV and other similar products.
One post on Reddit came to the defense of the bank that issued the product, ""CREDIT SUISSE DID NOTHING WRONG,"" while another poster claimed to have lost $4 million.
Investors said that volatility will be traded whether or not ETPs exist, and that those products just offer an easy way to make those bets. 
A return to normal market conditions could also revive a trade that delivered some investors a near-600 percent gain for the two years ending Feb. 1, analysts said.
""XIV has made me a lot of money, and I do see the opportunity to make more money with these types of products in the future,"" said Phoenix, Arizona-based David Meyers, CEO of A La Carte Charts Inc, a social media site geared toward active investors.
Some investors said they would miss Credit Suisse's XIV note especially because it does not result in a cumbersome extra tax document for investors, unlike some rival products.
XIV's prospectus spelled out the risks of an investment in the ETN, saying a large decline could result in its closure, removal from the market and likely loss of all or a substantial part of the investment.
""The long term expected value of your ETNs is zero,"" the prospectus says.
Scott Wetherington, the chief investment officer at Cavalier Investments LLC, said he sold his XIV stake a few weeks ago but ""we likely could and would"" buy another short-volatility product.
He said the termination of XIV should not have come as a shock in light of the market's sharp movement, and that he was ready for the volatility.
""We weren't surprised by it at all - it's stated in the prospectus pretty clearly,"" said Wetherington.
""I just don't think people really take the time to do the due diligence.""
If investors do decide to challenge Credit Suisse over their product, it would not be the first time. 
The firm was sued in 2012 by investors who owned a ""leveraged"" ETN after new issuance of the notes, designed to double the return of an index, were suspended. A U.S. federal appeals court in 2014 ruled in favor of the bank, saying no reasonable investor could have read disclosures for the product without understanding their risk.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank [RABO.UL] on Wednesday agreed to forfeit over $360 million and pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court over its processing illicit funds and then conspiring to obstruct an examination by its primary regulator, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The bank admitted it allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in untraceable cash from Mexico and elsewhere to be deposited into branches in California and transferred without proper notifications to federal regulators, the Justice Department said in a statement.
Separately, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced on Wednesday that it had imposed a $50 million civil penalty on Rabobank for deficiencies in its Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance program.
Rabobank chose to ""look the other way"" when it learned of transactions indicative of international drug trafficking, organized crime and money laundering, Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Cronan said in a statement.
Bank executives then tried to hide its anti-money laundering program deficiencies during a 2012 examination by the OCC, to avoid sanctions imposed for similar failures in 2006 and 2008, the statement said.
Rabobank's guilty plea took place in U.S. District Court in San Diego. It pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstructing an examination by the OCC.

The bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In January, it said it had taken a 310 million euro ($373 million) provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 ahead of an expected settlement with the U.S. government.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 02:44PM ET</span>",U.S. senators ask FDA to reject Philip Morris' iQOS application,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Tom Lasseter
WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ten U.S. senators called on the Food and Drug Administration to reject Philip Morris International Inc's (N:PM) application to market its iQOS smoking device as being less risky than cigarettes, according to a letter to the agency's commissioner.
The senators, all Democrats, cited remarks by an expert scientific panel that reviewed the application for the FDA and voted last month to recommend against granting Philip Morris permission to do so, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. 
The senators also referred to a Reuters report in December that identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA by Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Former Philip Morris employees and contractors also described irregularities in those experiments.
Philip Morris International, the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value, has applied to the FDA to be able to sell iQOS in America and for permission to market it as a modified-risk tobacco product. That designation could mean that Philip Morris would be allowed to sell iQOS to consumers as presenting less harm or risk of disease than traditional tobacco.
By heating tobacco instead of burning it, the company says iQOS avoids subjecting smokers to the same levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in regular cigarettes. The device is part of a $3 billion-plus investment by Philip Morris in new-generation smoking platforms. 
The senators' letter, dated Feb. 7, asked FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to ""avoid rushing through new products, such as IQOS, to fit within this evolving FDA policy, without requiring strong evidence that any such product will reduce the risk of disease, result in a large number of smokers quitting, and not increase youth tobacco use.""
It also said: “Such thorough review is especially critical given the tobacco industry’s deceitful history of marketing products under the guise of lower risk.”
The signatories include Elizabeth Warren, a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate, and five members of the Senate’s powerful appropriations committee, including Dick Durbin and Jack Reed.
    Durbin and Senator Richard Blumenthal, who also signed the letter, released statements to Reuters at the end of last month expressing concern about the iQOS application to the FDA.
An FDA official said on Wednesday the agency had received the letter and would respond directly to the senators.
    Philip Morris did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A company spokesman referred to a Jan. 29 statement in which Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said, ""We look forward to working with the agency to clarify outstanding points so as to best assist in their ongoing decision-making process, which inherently entails a certain degree of scientific uncertainty pre-market.”
The advisory panel said Philip Morris had not proven that iQOS reduced harm compared with cigarettes. It did conclude that iQOS exposes users to lower levels of harmful chemicals, but said the company had not shown that lowering exposure to those chemicals is reasonably likely to translate into a measurable reduction in disease or death. The recommendation is not binding.
    Since the first of two days of meetings by the FDA scientific advisory panel on Jan. 24, which expressed doubts about Philip Morris’ application to the agency, the company’s stock has fallen about 9 percent as of the market's close on Tuesday. The stock was down 0.7 percent Wednesday afternoon.
    Philip Morris is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Kalanick returns to court in Waymo-Uber autonomous car secrets trial,"By Dan Levine and Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick's famously competitive nature was the focus of questioning on Wednesday in a trade-secrets trial in which Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] is accused of stealing self-driving car designs from rival Waymo.
In Kalanick's second day of testimony, Waymo sought to portray the ex-CEO as so eager to improve Uber's lagging autonomous car business that he did a deal to acquire a self-driving startup and hire its visionary founder without properly assessing the risks.
Kalanick's testimony is a crucial part of the trade-secrets trial that has captivated Silicon Valley and could influence one of the most important and potentially lucrative races in Silicon Valley -- to create fleets of self-driving cars.
In the lawsuit, Waymo, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving car unit, said former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential documents in December 2015 before Kalanick hired him at Uber in 2016. Levandowski is not a defendant in the case. Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, which Uber rejects.
Kalanick, who was ousted as CEO in June, appeared subdued in his short responses to questions by Waymo's lawyers. In many cases the Uber co-founder, wearing a business suit and tie, a change from casual startup attire, said he could not recall specific conversations. His court testimony marks his first public response to Waymo's allegations.
Waymo alleges Levandowski downloaded the confidential files a month before leaving to start self-driving truck company Otto, which was quickly acquired by Uber, putting Levandowski in charge of Uber's autonomous car division.
Kalanick testified that he found Levandowski to be an ""incredible visionary"" and ""very charming,"" and began negotiations with the engineer in 2015 to try to hire him, frustrated by the slow pace of Uber's own self-driving program.
These discussions happened before Otto was even formed, and Kalanick said he saw buying Otto as a way to hire Levandowski. He testified Wednesday that he never read a due diligence report prepared by an outside firm that determined Levandowski did posses Google data, although, as CEO, Kalanick could have read any document he wanted.
As part of the deal, Uber agreed to indemnify Levandowski against any legal action, Kalanick said. The board of directors approved the Otto acquisition in April, about three months after the startup was founded. 
Kalanick conceded that the legal battle makes hiring Levandowski ""not as great as what we thought it was at the beginning."" But he said that ""to no extent at all"" did he hire Levandowski to get trade secrets and Levandowski never told him he would bring Waymo's secrets to Uber.
The ex-CEO has said he saw developing self-driving cars as existential to Uber, and was rankled that Uber was trailing Waymo.
'SECOND PLACE, FIRST LOSER'
In court Wednesday, Waymo attorney Charles Verhoeven showed Kalanick a text from Levandowski in which Levandowski told Kalanick: ""I just see this as a race and we need to win. Second place is first loser.""
When asked if he agreed with that sentiment, Kalanick said: ""Well, I first heard it from my high school football coach, but yes.""
Waymo also played for the jury a video of the ""Greed is Good"" speech in the movie Wall Street, which Levandowski had sent to Kalanick along with the emoticon of a winking face. The speech includes lines such as ""Greed is right"" and ""Greed works.""
Kalanick was also shown in court an email from another executive, which said the ""X factor"" of acquiring Levandowski's company was the ""IP in their heads.""
Kalanick said he did not remember the email but did not deny reading it.

Testimony is expected to continue through next week. The 10-person jury will have to decide whether the documents were indeed trade secrets and not common knowledge, and whether Uber improperly acquired them, used them and benefited from them.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 02:09PM ET</span>","France, Germany want progress on taxing tech giants","By Ingrid Melander
PARIS (Reuters) - France and Germany intensified calls on Wednesday for U.S. technology giants to pay more tax in the European Union, with Paris saying the new bill could amount to billions of euros.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he wanted the EU to adopt new rules on taxing digital companies next year, while in Germany, the two parties seeking to form the next government said they wanted a new Europe-wide corporate tax system to stamp out multinational tax avoidance. 
""It's not possible, not sustainable, that we tax manufacturing industries while billions in profits earned by GAFAs on European soil evaporate,"" Le Maire said, citing an acronym commonly used in Europe top describe tech giants including Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
""We want a fair taxation of digital giants that creates value in Europe in 2019,"" he said in an interview with Reuters and a small group of European newspapers. 
U.S tech groups such as Google, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, and Apple use complex intra-group arrangements to pay low single-digit tax rates on profits derived from European customers.
Frequently these strategies hinge on the co-operation of smaller EU nations like Luxembourg which sometimes take a light touch approach on tax to help encourage inward investment. 
President Emmanuel Macron's government has proposed taxing the tech giants on revenues rather than profits, to get around the problem that the companies shift the profits from where they are earned to low tax jurisdictions.
The EU is mulling new tax rules on digital companies which may include a tax on their turnover, a levy on online ads or a withholding tax on payments to internet firms.
However, previous international efforts to tackle profit shifting by digital companies has faced legal difficulties, not least around defining what is a digital company. 
The coalition agreement between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats, published on Wednesday, said the parties backed another possible solution. 
""We support a common, consolidated tax base and minimum rates of business taxation,"" the coalition partners said, adding that they wanted, with France, ""to give a European answer to international changes and challenges in this area, not least in the United States.""
A common, consolidated tax base system would apportion companies' European profits to countries proportionate to the where their customers and operations are located, rather than allowing them to channel the profits into lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland. 
The European Commission declined to comment on the German coalition deal, but did say it would come forward this spring with new rules for digital taxation. 
Italy, Germany and Spain, together with France, are spearheading the push for tax reform. They face resistance from smaller nations like Ireland who are a hub for those firms' investments and fear changes could hurt their economies.
Le Maire said countries should not go easy on the tech giants to lure investment. 
""Kissing the feet of GAFAs won't ensure our prosperity,"" Le Maire said.
He said that the companies should be paying billions of euros annually in EU tax.
""European citizens would struggle to understand why the taxation of digital giants at a European level only raised tens of millions of euros. They would see that as a provocation and they would be right."" 
The French government is open to working with other members of the OECD group of industrialised nations, which are currently seeking international solutions to the problem of corporate profit shifting. 
""But we won't be slowed down or blocked by technicalities,"" he added. 
EU states could have lost 5.4 billion euros in tax revenues from Google and Facebook between 2013 and 2015, according to an EU lawmaker's report. 

While the European Commission has pledged to follow the lead of the OECD, it has also kept open the option of acting unilaterally.

1476,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 02:02PM ET</span>",Greece's Fast-Growing Aegean Air Prepares $5.5 Billion Jet Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Aegean Airlines, the former island-hopper that’s expanded to replace defunct Greek flag-carrier Olympic Air, plans to order at least 50 new single-aisle jetliners in the next three or four weeks.
Aegean, which has already doubled its fleet since 2013, will choose between the latest Airbus SE A320neo and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737 Max narrow-body models, Chief Executive Officer Dimitrios Gerogiannis said in an interview Wednesday.
“We are now in the last mile of the process, really in the last days,” Gerogiannis said at the Aviation Club in London.
The aircraft, to be delivered between 2020 and 2024, will replace an aging all-Airbus jet fleet, as well as add capacity for expansion, according to Gerogiannis. Aegean said it’ll probably need 75 planes by 2023, a figure that includes turboprop models to link Athens with domestic locations.
A baseline A320neo jet has a list price of $110.6 million, valuing Aegean’s planned deal at at least $5.5 billion. While the carrier currently owns only four of its Airbus planes, leasing the rest, that proportion may increase with the new fleet, Gerogiannis said. The company may also take a higher number of bigger narrow-bodies than it has now to help meet growth plans.
Aegean was founded as a regional carrier in 1999 and traded blows with Olympic after the state operator was privatized in 2010. The Greek economic crisis weakened the larger company and Aegean won approval to step in and take it over in 2013, transforming into a major international airline.
Gerogiannis said there’s no immediate prospect of Aegean entering the long-haul market on routes once served by Olympic, though that’s something that may be considered going into next decade. Shares of the company have gained 9 percent this year after advancing 30 percent in 2017, valuing it at 643 million euros ($790 million)."
1477,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 01:58PM ET</span>",Casino magnate Steve Wynn quits as CEO after sexual misconduct claims,"By Farah Master
(Reuters) - U.S. casino mogul Steve Wynn has resigned as CEO of his company Wynn Resorts following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances, becoming one of the most prominent business leaders to quit over sexual misconduct allegations in recent months.
The company said it was appointing Matt Maddox, its president since 2013, as chief executive, effective immediately. Maddox, who has been with Wynn Resorts Ltd since it was founded in 2002, is seen as a firm hand and is widely viewed as a favored protege of Wynn.
As the ""MeToo"" movement galvanizes women to publicly air their experiences, Wynn's decision represents a rare resignation by a head of a major listed company in the wake of such accusations.
It has also led to speculation that Wynn Resorts could become a takeover target, and raises the question of how much influence Wynn, its biggest shareholder, will continue to wield over the firm and how much scrutiny from authorities that will invite.
Wynn, 76, has denied the accusations published by the Wall Street Journal as ""preposterous"" and said they were instigated by his ex-wife, an accusation that a representative for Elaine Wynn has denied.
He also resigned as finance chairman of the U.S. Republican Party's fundraising arm, the Republican National Committee, in January.
""In the last couple of weeks, I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity...I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles,"" he said in a statement.
Sparking a wave of harassment and abuse allegations against dozens of powerful men, the ""MeToo"" movement has had its biggest impact so far in the media industry and politics. U.S. Senator Al Franken resigned in December after facing a series of sexual misconduct allegations.
Movie producer Harvey Weinstein, and head of animation at Walt Disney Co's Disney and Pixar, John Lasseter, are among some of the high-profile men who have been singled out for sexual misconduct.
FOUNDER OF MODERN LAS VEGAS
Wynn, who according to Forbes has a net worth of $3.3 billion, started in Las Vegas casinos in the 1960s, creating some of Las Vegas' most iconic landmarks – the Mirage, Bellagio and Treasure Island.
But he was forced to sell his multi-billion dollar operation Mirage Resorts to tycoon Kirk Kerkorian in a hostile takeover in 2000. Kerkorian then created MGM Mirage and Wynn went on to create Wynn Resorts with his ex-wife in 2002.
Shares in Wynn Resorts, which owns the Wynn, Encore Las Vegas casinos as well as its Wynn Macau unit, have tumbled nearly 20 percent since the Journal report on Jan 26. The company is worth around $17 billion by market capitalization.
Shares in Wynn Macau have slumped around 17 percent before they were put on a trading halt on Wednesday.
Some analysts noted that questions remain over whether Wynn will sell or reduce his stake and how much fighting will ensue over control of the firm. 
""Some investors might consider the resignation of Steve Wynn as the removal of an overhang on the stock, but we think that many uncertainties remain around who will be the controlling shareholders in future,"" said Praveen Choudhary, analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Hong Kong.
Wynn owns about 11.8 percent of Wynn Resorts followed by his former wife who has 9.4 percent.
WYNN MACAU GOLDMINE
On Wednesday a women's advocacy group called Ultra Violet said they would fly a plane banner over the Nevada Gaming Control Board meeting to urge the regulatory body to revoke Wynn’s gaming license. The banner was to read WYNN IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR #FIREWYNN.
All regulators have announced probes into the allegations and even if Wynn were to sell shares, authorities could still well scrutinize his involvement with the company, said Choudhary.
Wynn Resorts, which uses the founder's signature in the company's logo, said its board ""reluctantly"" accepted the resignation.
""Steve Wynn is an industry giant. He is a philanthropist and a beloved leader and visionary. He played the pivotal role in transforming Las Vegas into the entertainment destination it is today.""
Wynn Resorts said on Wednesday it remained committed to being an inclusive and supportive employer, adding that more than 40 percent of all Wynn Las Vegas management are women, the highest in the gaming industry. It has set up a special committee to investigate the accusations.
Wynn's Macau business has been a goldmine for Wynn Resorts, generating more than 75 percent of its total revenues. It has two lavish resorts in the world's largest gambling hub where only six firms have licenses to operate casinos. 
Either Wynn Resorts or its businesses could become M&A targets that would attract a plethora of suitors, analysts said.
""Not only the other 5 Macau concessionaires but you now have a dynamic where you have these gaming REITs that have been established in the States like MGM Growth Properties and GLPI, they would be interested,"" said Grant Govertsen, analyst at Union Gaming in Macau. 

""You would also have financial buyers who would be interested along the lines of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Apollo Global Management,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Wynn Resorts Ltd shares jumped 10 percent on Wednesday, as investors approved of the casino operator's decision to give company veteran Matt Maddox the top job, replacing casino mogul Steve Wynn who resigned following sexual misconduct allegations.
Wynn, 76, who has denied the accusations, stepped down as CEO on Tuesday. He, however, is Wynn Resorts' largest shareholder and owns about 12 percent of the company. 
Wynn's decision removes some overhang from the stock, which has lost nearly a fifth of its value since Jan. 26 when reports of the allegations first surfaced, analysts said.
The resignation could reduce the risk of tarnishing the company's brand, Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek said. 
""Our view that Wynn Resorts is likely to retain its gaming licenses is buoyed by Steve Wynn's removal ... given that gaming commission investigations of suitability appear to be centered on allegations against the company founder,"" Wasiolek said.
Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts are investigating the allegations.
Still, Maddox has big shoes to fill.
Wynn started in Las Vegas casinos in the 1960s, creating some of Las Vegas' most iconic landmarks.
He was forced to sell his multi-billion dollar operation Mirage Resorts, which included trophy hotels like the Bellagio, to tycoon Kirk Kerkorian in a hostile takeover in 2000. Kerkorian then created MGM Mirage and Wynn went on to create Wynn Resorts in 2002.
Wynn's shares have risen more than 15-fold since its initial public offering in 2002.
TAKEOVER TARGET?
Wynn, known for building luxury resorts, and the surging profits from its Macau business make the company a lucrative takeover target for real-estate focused companies and Chinese investors, analysts said.
""We continue to believe that Mr. Wynn's quintessential strength lies in his resort design abilities,"" said Gabelli & Co analyst Adam Trivison.
""So much so that his resorts have demonstrated superior performance under the management of others, i.e. Bellagio, and thus would hold their value in an M&A scenario, which admittedly is more likely given Mr. Wynn's departure,"" Trivision said.
The previous experience of Maddox - working in corporate finance in Caesars Entertainment and as a banker for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities - may come in handy while planning the company's future.
Maddox, 42, moved to the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau soon after Wynn Resorts secured its concession there. 

He has been with the company since it was founded 16 years ago and was named president in 2013. He has taken an increasingly active role in investor conference calls and discussions over business operations.

The A400M - ordered by Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey - has been hit by engine gearbox problems and delays in fitting parachuting capacity and advanced defenses.

Airbus has been urging the seven nations to cap its exposure to fines and payment delays triggered by technical delays on the program. The company had been keen to reach a deal before it reports earnings on Feb. 15.
The company said the buyers had agreed on Wednesday ""to work
on a number of contractual elements including a revamped delivery plan as well as a roadmap for the development and completion of military capabilities for the A400M.""
Airbus last year cited ""huge losses"" on the project and warned of ""significant risks"" ahead. The program was initially valued at 20 billion euros but its cost has ballooned to well over 30 billion, sources told Reuters last year.
""Since its inception in 2003, this program has suffered not only from a number of operational issues but, more importantly, under a flawed contractual set-up and insufficient budget which resulted in significant losses for Airbus,"" Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in the statement.

""We have a good chance to stop or at least reduce the bleeding now and deliver the capabilities our customers need,"" he added.

1486,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 12:32PM ET</span>","Good Is Bad, Bad Is Good and Trump Is Miffed at Stock Traders","(Bloomberg) -- The word is officially out: Good is bad in the stock market once again (and, by extension, bad is good).
When President Donald Trump finally weighed in Wednesday on the roller-coaster ride in equity markets, he went all the way back to the initial trigger from last week, lamenting how a strong U.S. jobs report sparked the first round of selling. “In the ‘old days,’ when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up,” Trump said on Twitter. “Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down.”
All of which is sort of right. There are plenty of times in the past when good data was bad for the stock market -- anyone who was around for the Greenspan Fed years, remembers that -- but for the most part over the last decade, he’s right, good was indeed generally good. In fact, of the 10 biggest positive surprises in that span on an index that measures how data stacks up against expectations, the S&P 500 rose seven times.
So the reaction to the January jobs report -- a 2.1 percent plunge in the S&P 500 Index on Friday alone -- seemed to signal a break from that pattern. Why? Because unlike recent years, when the economic expansion was tepid and in its early stages, growth is running so hot now that investors fear that signs of even more strength will prompt the Federal Reserve to speed up the pace of interest-rate increases.
And not only could higher rates cool the economy back down, but they make it more expensive to buy stocks on credit. Both of which are potentially bad for the market. As a result, experts say, good-is-bad is likely to be the new pattern for a while.
“There’s an element of truth in that yes, good news is prompting markets to reassess the loose monetary policy that has been in place the last 10 years,” said Massud Ghaussy, director at Nasdaq Advisory Services. “As we’re seeing inflation pick up, as we see wage growth, as we see GDP growth kicking in, the Federal Reserve has no other choice but to essentially raise interest rates and normalize -- and that will in turn shock the equity markets.”
The turmoil that started Friday and contributed to biggest market rout in almost seven years on Monday is familiar to anyone who has lived through past episodes of Fed angst. It’s a sort of paranoia that any sign of inflation that will encourage policy makers to raise rates.
“It’s the most common thing that can halt a bull market,” said Donald Selkin, New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which manages $2 billion. “The Fed sees economic activity picking up, and the demand for credit picks up, then they say ‘oh, we have to raise rates to cool things off a little bit.’
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans did just that Wednesday, sending the S&P 500 Index down from its session high after saying that if officials get “more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted.”
The worry for equity investors is that higher interest rates bring higher Treasury yields, which could dampen the stock market’s upward climb in a variety of ways.
The 40-day correlation between the U.S. Citi Economic Surprise Index and the S&P 500 is at its lowest level since 2015. The gauge, which rises when economic data is better than expected, jumped nearly 10 percent Friday as equities tanked.
“Oftentimes, the employment numbers or other meaningful economic statistics don’t register very significantly in terms of market reaction and the market will tend to trade within the confines of directionally what it had been going into it,” said Jim Grabovac, an investment strategist at McDonnell Investment Management. “Coming into last year, the markets underestimated what the Fed would ultimately do with three tightenings. We think coming into this year with this reaction thus far, the market is probably overestimating.”
And as traders assess what better-than-expected economic data means for the Fed’s interest rate hike trajectory, they’re also trying to figure out how much President Trump’s tax overhaul will fuel growth.
Analysts at Strategas Research Partners estimated the tax cut will add 0.2 to 0.3 percent boost to GDP this year, which is currently growing at a yearly rate of 2.5 percent. Now “the realization is kicking in that economic growth will be higher,” the analysts led by Daniel Clifton, head of policy research, wrote in a note Monday.
The Atlanta Fed increased their GDP growth forecast last week to 5.4 percent, the highest reading since 2012. Clifton notes that this number could change throughout the quarter, but a growth number of this caliber isn’t too surprising when compared with historical reactions to fiscal policy.
“In 2003, when the tax rates on income were dropped, real GDP was 7 percent at a time of consensus 2 percent growth,” Clifton wrote. “Yields had to move higher to reprice this ‘unexpected’ growth.”
Still, some say good news can’t stay bad news forever. According to Keith Parker, head of equity strategy at UBS Group AG, the S&P 500’s pullbacks actually tend to be narrower when economic data beats forecasts.
“When economic data surprises have been positive, equity pullbacks have averaged 5 percent, suggesting last week’s 4 percent selloff is close to an end,” he wrote in a note to clients Monday.

The Financial Conduct Authority has completed a public consultation on its proposals for creating a new category of sovereign-controlled firms seeking a listing.
It would mean relaxing a rule that companies float at least 25 percent of their shares, and British fund managers have expressed concerns about governance. London is competing with rival listing centers like New York for what would be the world's biggest IPO.
""There was a range of views on both sides of this issue,"" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told parliament's Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday.

The Force Ouvriere union had planned to bus in large numbers of workers from across the country to rally at Carrefour's Massy headquarters near Paris but local authorities have restricted transport in some regions due to the snow, it said in a statement.
Under pressure to increase profits, Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard announced last month cost savings of 2 billion euros by 2020, including a voluntary redundancy plan for 2,400 employees at its French head office and plans to sell or close 273 underperforming Dia stores, which employ up to 2,100 people.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 11:14AM ET</span>",Snap shares surge after app redesign sparks user growth,"By Sonam Rai and Laharee Chatterjee
(Reuters) - Shares of Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) surged 35 percent on Wednesday after the company reported its first user growth since going public in 2017, sign that a redesign of its messaging app is taking hold in its battle with Facebook's (O:FB) Instagram.
The stock pushed past its IPO price of $17 for the first time since July last year and as many as 10 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the stock.
Snapchat had earlier worked better on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) phones but the Android version had issues. The company said that after fixing those software bugs, customers were now staying longer on the Android version of its app.
""Snap made significant progress on redesigning the user experience, with some proof points around engagement,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said. ""Of course, expectations were low, but investors should gain confidence from this execution.""
CEO Evan Spiegel said the redesigned app will fully roll out in the current quarter.
Advertisers are also taking to an auction-based advertising system that made it cheaper and easier to buy ads on Snapchat.
""Advertiser count on auction doubling sequentially, which speaks to the company's efforts to date to evangelize the platform,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Stephen Ju said.
Analysts, however, warned that the company still has significant challenges ahead.
""A good quarter doesn't change our fundamental view that Snap has its work cut out to continue to deserve a premium multiple,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said.
Snapchat faces stiff competition from Instagram, which has more than twice the daily users of Snapchat and threatened to stamp out Snapchat by copying features such as photo filters and disappearing slide shows.
Most analysts still view Facebook as better positioned to corner a bigger share of advertisers than Snapchat.
Only five of 36 brokerages rate Snap as ""buy"" or higher, 18 ""hold"" and 13 ""sell"" or lower. Their median price tag was $12.50. RBC Capital Markets analysts were most bullish with a price target of $21.

The stock was up 35 percent at $19.08, notching its biggest one-day gain since its debut.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May and finance minister Philip Hammond will meet representatives from major Japanese businesses on Thursday as concerns about Brexit grow among some of the world's biggest foreign investors.
Japanese firms have spent billions of pounds in Britain over recent decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.
Carmakers Nissan (T:7201), Toyota (T:7203) and Honda (T:7267) began operating in Britain from as early as the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain's 1.67 million cars, the vast majority of which were exported overseas.
May's meeting with major Japanese investors comes amid an intense debate inside her government about how closely Britain should remain aligned with the EU, and its customs union, after Brexit.
""The meeting will be tomorrow afternoon and the attendees will cover the most significant investors in the UK in such areas as banking, life sciences, technology and the manufacturing sector,"" a spokesman at May's Downing Street office said. 
Many Japanese drug companies have made Britain their European base in recent years and are worried, like their peers, about the future of drug regulations, with any divergence with the European Union likely to pose regulatory challenges. 
Banks Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have London bases but have already decided to set up operations in Europe to retain access to the single market as they await clarity on future trading arrangements. 
Nissan, which runs Britain's single biggest car factory in Sunderland, northern England, will be among the attendees at Thursday's meeting.
The company announced in 2016 that it would build two new models at the site after what a source said was a government promise of extra support in the event that Brexit hits the competitiveness of the plant.
""Nissan Europe Chairman Paul Willcox will join representatives from other Japanese companies in meeting the Prime Minister and Chancellor on Thursday to discuss our operations and investments in the UK,"" the firm said in a statement.

Many businesses fear Britain could face a disorderly Brexit that would weaken the West, imperil Britain’s $2.7 trillion economy and undermine London’s position as the only financial center to rival New York.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Volatility means trend is no longer the hedge fund's friend in 2018,"By Maiya Keidan and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Trend-following hedge funds were stopped in their tracks by global market volatility this week, with some giving up all of their gains from a stellar start to the year.
Investors locked into steady moves had enjoyed strong gains as markets 'melted up' with the aid of easy monetary policy that leading central banks have said they plan to tighten. But this week's sudden halt in the trend has not sparked investor panic, fund managers contacted by Reuters said.
Performance statistics gathered by HSBC in the week to Feb. 2 showed double-digit gains in January for a clutch of trend-following funds, after human-led hedge funds beat these machine-driven funds during 2017.
Four of the top-five best-performing funds in January ran algorithmic strategies, while only one was human-led, according to the data compiled by HSBC.
Among the trend-following funds to set the running were Netherlands-based Tulip Trend Fund, which was up 14.4 percent to Jan. 31, and the Cantab Capital Partners Quantitative Fund, which had risen by 9.2 percent to Jan. 26.
Aspect Capital's Diversified fund made 8.8 percent in January, while Sweden's Lynx Asset Management fund made 8.6 percent in January, according to its website.
But fears that rising inflation could prompt central banks to hit the monetary brakes more quickly prompted profit-taking, with U.S. stocks posting their worst day in 7 years on Monday and volatility surging, knocking trend-followers.
As the sell-off accelerated and volatility rose, hedge funds sought to protect against further losses by hedging and also cut back on their use of leverage,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
As trend-following funds typically invest more heavily into their positions the longer the trend continues, including using leverage to amplify the bets, the falls were felt more keenly. 
TULIP WILTS 
The Tulip fund, named because of the association with its Dutch trading adviser's homeland, was among those to give up gains, said Thomas Kummer at Progressive Capital Partners, which manages the fund.
""The fund was down around 6 percent on Friday and was down around (an estimated) 13 percent on Monday,"" Kummer said.
Another to suffer was Dunn Capital, whose WMA Institutional UCITS Fund had been up 10.1 percent in late January.
""We have given back the January profits in our WMA strategy like other trend followers have,"" Niels Kaastrup-Larsen, Dunn's managing director for Europe, said.
This was to be expected from such a strategy when there were ""big reversals in many sectors at the same time, he added.
Lynx's fund, meanwhile, was down 11.3 percent at the close on Tuesday, its website showed.
Anthony Lawler, co-head GAM Systematic, which manages Cantab as part of its business, told Reuters the falls would be unlikely to change much in the mind of fund managers. 

""The reversal moves in the past few days are not likely to scare systematic trend managers as they are within expectations over a market cycle and our risk management is built with the long term in mind,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) said on Wednesday it would relocate its global headquarters from downtown Manhattan to midtown, expanding its presence at the Times Square (NYSE:SQ) office tower from where it broadcasts the market opening and closing bell ceremonies.
Nasdaq will expand its space fivefold at 4 Times Square, a 48-story tower owned by The Durst Organization. The building, built in 1999, recently underwent a $140 million renovation that included a new entrance and lobby, among other upgrades.
The exchange's increased presence in the heart of Manhattan will drive its brand forward and offer an ""unparalleled experience"" for its clients, Nasdaq said in a statement.
Nasdaq's plans include a state-of-the-art corporate event space, designed to host more than 400 people, on the 10th floor, featuring an outdoor terrace overlooking Times Square, the company said.
The 15-year lease for 145,000 square feet includes an extension of the current 24,000 square foot MarketSite lease. Further terms on the transaction were not disclosed. 
Times Square is a major tourist destination for visitors to New York and a magnet for retailers' flagship stores. Commanding more than $2,000 a square foot, it remains in strong demand for both retail and entertainment.

Nasdaq last week posted higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings amid a rise in revenue from non-trading related businesses, now a bigger part of the exchange's strategic focus.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",No easy solutions to Chipotle's public image problem,"(Reuters) - Two years after a string of hygiene-related lapses, Chipotle Mexican Grill's (N:CMG) disappointing quarterly results on Tuesday were marked largely by the absence of major new ideas on how to turn around the burrito chain's battered public reputation.
Chipotle shares fell 10 percent in premarket on Wednesday to $275.50, the lowest since November, with analysts worried by further declines in the number of visitors to its restaurants and predictions they would continue.
Managers said there was hope of a turnaround in the second half of the year, but the Mexican restaurant chain is still being weighed down by the bad PR dating back to an outbreak of E. coli and Salmonella that sickened 50 people in late 2015.
In the months following the outbreaks, Chipotle took drastic measures, including shutting down its system-wide chain for hours to train and educate employees on food safety, added four new board directors, and for the first time in 20 years introduced another protein, Chorizo, to its menu.
It also experimented with a loyalty program briefly, something it once dismissed as unnecessary discounts for frequent customers, and introduced a raft of other initiatives that have so far failed to right the ship.
In November, founder and Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said he would step aside after failing for two years to rescue sales and the company's reputation. He is still executive chairman.
There were some signs of progress in the fourth quarter: training, field support, and refocused incentive programs have begun to move the needle on satisfaction scores, speed of service, and hospitality, according to the company. 
Same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter also rose better than analysts had expected, in part due to price hikes.
But Wall Street analysts said that it remained a long road back to pre-outbreak sales levels.
""Same-store sales have begun to recover, but food safety outbreak impacts and operational overhang remain,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst John Glass, who is rated 4/5 stars for his estimate accuracy, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.
Analysts were divided on what more the company needed to do to get back the customers it has lost, but a majority lauded the company's efforts to put more of its savings into labor, new stores and building its mobile ordering efforts.
""Guest experience and digital efforts in 2018 could help stabilize and then grow traffic, which would allow for margin expansion,"" Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said.
However, brokerage Stifel in a note titled ""Investors still waiting for earnings with integrity"" said it found Chipotle's spending and capital allocation missing the mark.
""We struggle to see how the company justifies its general & administrative spending plan for 2018 and why it does not allocate even more capital to existing stores and less to new stores,"" Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull said, downgrading the stock to ""sell"".
UBS also cut Chipotle to ""sell"" earlier this week, citing a difficult industry and ""brand perception challenges"". 
Overall, brokerages are on the fence on Chipotle, with 24 of the 35 analysts covering the stock rating it ""hold"" and the others split almost down the middle.

Its median price target is $306.36, compared with its Tuesday close of $304.33.

1511,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",JPMORGAN: Investors stressing over inflation should pay close attention to one peculiar trend," Inflation fears have been central to the shaken market confidence of the past few trading sessions, yet one strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is totally sanguine about the inflation risks facing the US economy.
John Normand, head of cross-asset strategy at JPMorgan uses a large sample of historical comparisons in inflation, core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy and are a favorite of central bankers, as well as wage growth as measured by average hourly earnings.
Normand’s message: There’s a pattern.
""Over the past two decades, inflation has surprised more to the downside than to the upside on all indicators,"" he writes in a research note.
Core CPI has met consensus forecasts ""about 40% of the time since the late 1990s, exceeded expectations 26% of the time and undershot expectations 33% of the time.""
Average hourly earnings met estimates 25% of the time, overshot 29%, and undershot 45%.
The market’s vertiginous plunge, which has since stabilized, first started last Friday after the market latched onto data  showing a 2.9% spike in annualized average hourly earnings, the biggest gain since the recession.
Normand uses the following chart to show the combined trajectory of these key indicators for Federal Reserve policy — and to show inflation leery-investors are likely jumping the gun, and not for the first time.
""This underapreciation of disinflationary forces probably explains why the consensus has incorrectly forecast the direction of Treasury yields most years since the global financial crisis,"" he says.
US inflation has undershot the Fed's 2% target for much of the economic recovery despite an extended period of low interest rates and solid economic growth, in part because of  stagnant underlying wages for most workers."
1512,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",GOLDMAN SACHS: Here are the 3 areas of the stock market to buy following the meltdown," Following the massive two-day stock meltdown, your first instinct might be to stay far, far away from the equity market.
Goldman Sachs disagrees. It argues that, if anything, the temporary weakness created more investment opportunities — and the firm has narrowed them down to three main areas.
But before we get into their suggestions, let's briefly marvel at just how catastrophic the damage in the stock market was. For one, the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its biggest single-day point decline in history, while the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) spiked the most on record.
Further, as of Tuesday's close, the benchmark S&P 500 had fallen 6.2% from a recent high reached on January 26. That snapped the index's 404-day stretch without a 5% drawdown, breaking the longest such streak in 90 years, according to Goldman data.
As for the reason for the selloff, it depends who you ask.
Some market experts attribute the selling to rising correlations between stocks and bonds, leaving ""no place to hide"" when there's turbulence in one or the other. Others blamed machine-based investing. And some found fault in the short-volatility trade, which blew up in fantastic fashion, taking a pair of wildly popular exchange-traded products with it.
But you're here for Goldman's recommendations. So without further ado, here are the three areas of the stock market the firm finds appealing in a post-selloff world, because of their dislocation from the drivers of this week's madness."
1513,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>","Wells Fargo Hikes S&P 500 Target, Saying Worst in Stocks Is Over","(Bloomberg) --  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) has a message for its clients: the worst is over, and you are free to trade.
The firm sees almost 10 percent upside to the S&P 500 through 2018, with most of the gains coming in the next three to six months. It’s boosting its year-end target for the gauge to 2,950 from 2,863.
“The pullback in the equity market provides almost a free look at earnings,” analysts Christopher Harvey and Anna Han wrote in a note Wednesday. This year “will be a tale of two halves,” with the first featuring strong corporate earnings growth and a healthy merger-and-acquisition cycle, and the second “heavily influenced by the Fed tightening cycle.”
The increase in the target was partially due to Wells Fargo’s increase in annual earnings-per-share projections to $150.76 from $146.01, the analysts said, and also to a reduction in the risk premium to 150 basis points from 165 basis points as the Cboe Volatility Index spiked and interest rates rose. The new 2,950 target compares with an average 2,923 prediction from strategists whose estimates are compiled by Bloomberg as of Jan. 19.
“Recently, we’ve been telling clients to slowly and methodically invest their cash as the selloff unfolded. Now, we’re telling clients that they’re free to trade (invest the balance of your cash),” the report said. “Get in motion.”

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 08:59AM ET</span>",Hasbro posts surprise revenue drop as Star Wars toys fail to shine,"(Reuters) - Toymaker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) reported a surprise fall in quarterly revenue on Wednesday due to a decline in sales of its toys based on the Star Wars franchise and the lingering impact of the bankruptcy of retailer Toys 'R' Us.
The company's shares fell 3.2 percent to $90.94 before the bell. The toy industry was jolted by the retailer's collapse last October, forcing Hasbro, rival Mattel (O:MAT) and other toy makers to find other outlets for sales during the all-important holiday season.
The maker of My Little Pony and Nerf guns, had prewarned in October that holiday sales would be hit by the bankruptcy of Toys 'R' Us - one of biggest sellers of Hasbro's toys.
Hasbro has focused on linking its toys to big movie franchises like Star Wars and The Avengers, which have created a new generation of young fans through video games and apps.
However, 2017 was the worst year for movie ticket sales since 1992, according to Box Office Mojo, as moviegoers lost interest in sequels, in turn affecting the market for toys based on movie characters like Iron Man and Luke Skywalker.
""A decline in Partner Brands and Europe revenues resulted in us not meeting our fourth quarter revenue expectations,"" Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner said.
Net revenue from the company's partner brands unit, which includes toys based on movie franchises, fell 21 percent to $342.9 million.
""Our Partner Brands estimate of +8% could be too high as Stars Wars could have been below expectations,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Weiser wrote in a pre-earnings note.
The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company's revenue fell 2.1 percent to $1.6 billion, while analysts had expected it to rise to $1.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.30 per share.
Hasbro reported a net loss attributable to the company of $5.3 million, or 4 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, due to a $296.5 million charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.

A year earlier, the company posted profit of $192.7 million, or $1.52 per share.

1517,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",World's Largest ETF Hit by Biggest Four-Day Outflow on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The global market maelstrom spurred money managers to yank a record $17.4 billion from the mighty SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) over the past four trading sessions. The $8 billion removed on Tuesday alone was the third-largest daily withdrawal in the post-crisis era.
The last time redemptions were close to matching this frenetic pace? In late 2007, when cracks in U.S. equities began to show before the global financial crisis unfolded.
Even with the historic wave of outflows, the world’s largest exchange-traded fund has received a net $2.4 billion of inflow this year to reach assets of $276 billion, while eking out a 0.85 percent gain.
Investors are catching their breath after the selloff, which followed the fastest-ever flow of money out of funds holding U.S. Treasuries and high-yield debt and into global stocks, in the week to Jan. 31. That spurred Bank of America’s equity sell signal to ring louder. The total inflow into stock funds globally last month surged to $102 billion, according to EPFR Global data.
The worst may be over for the S&P tracker, with bears easing back on hedging options. Contracts protecting against a 5 percent decline surged to their highest price ever relative to calls on Monday, according to three-month data compiled by Bloomberg. That position, known as skew, has since eased to less than a point above the five-year average.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 07:12AM ET</span>",Spanish union to take legal action against Ryanair over contracts,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Representatives of Spanish pilots working for Ryanair (I:RYA) will launch legal action against the airline over contracts they say fail to comply with Spanish law, the SEPLA union said on Wednesday.
Ryanair decided in December to recognize unions for the first time but is struggling to formalize relations in some countries. It warned its pilots this week that it would face down ""laughable demands"" for conditions similar to high-cost rivals even if that meant strikes at Easter.
In a letter sent to members that was reviewed by Reuters, SEPLA accused Ryanair management of failing to negotiate in good faith since Europe's largest budget airline opened the recognition talks.
""After the last few weeks' events and based on the statements of our managers, it has become clear that Ryanair has no intention of negotiating with the pilots' representatives until they are forced to do so,"" the letter, dated Feb 6, said.
""We have been naive in believing management really wanted to change the course of such toxic labor relations.""
SEPLA said it planned to submit two lawsuits to Spain's High Court regarding Ryanair's contracts. It says they represent 500 of 800 Ryanair pilots based in Spain.
Ryanair said it complied fully with all European Union and Spanish employment law, adding that an appeal court ruling in the city of Valencia last month meant that Spanish courts had no jurisdiction over Ryanair pilot and cabin crew employment.
The airline received a boost last week when it struck its first formal recognition agreement with Britain's pilots' association and chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Monday that major progress was being made in Italy and Portugal, where unions had threatened strikes before Christmas. 
Other say they will refuse a unilateral offer of a pay rise unless they get assurances it won't impact future talks on pay and conditions.
Analysts at Goodbody Stockbrokers said that while not all negotiations have gone smoothly, Ryanair had gone some considerable way in addressing non-pay issues with their pilots. 
""The contentious relationship with this - increasingly smaller - rump of pilots will rumble on for some time, with this the reason why management warned of possible negative PR from the threat of strikes leading up to the Easter holiday period,"" Goodbody wrote in a note. 

""However, what is becoming clearer is that the risk to the group is diminishing daily as more pilots accept the pay offer, even where unions have lobbied against them doing so.""

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Sovereign fund redemptions from global markets fall 35 percent year-on-year in 2017,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds' (SWFs) redemptions from global stock and bond markets fell by about a third year-on-year to $38.1 billion in 2017, preliminary data from research firm eVestment showed on Wednesday.
Fourth quarter outflows slowed to $2.5 billion, the lowest level since SWF redemptions from third-party asset managers began in the third quarter of 2014, suggesting the high watermark of selling has passed.
The figures from eVestment, which collates data from about 4,400 firms managing money on behalf of institutional investors, are preliminary as fund managers holding about a fifth of the prior quarter's assets have still not reported, but the directional trend is not expected to change, the firm said.
Oil-backed sovereign funds were put under pressure when oil prices tumbled from their mid-2014 highs of $115 a barrel to below $30 in January 2016, forcing governments to dig into their rainy-day SWFs to fill budget gaps.
In 2015 redemptions topped a whopping $80.1 billion as SWFs liquidated stocks and bonds to raise cash. The selling continued throughout 2016 with some $58.8 billion of outflows.
But with oil prices rising in 2017 to trade at around $65 a barrel by year-end, the level of redemptions has slowed.
Fourth quarter redemptions were down from a revised $5.5 billion in the third quarter, and from $7.6 billion in the second quarter.
However Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment, noted that 66 percent of investment products still experienced net outflows, with only a third registering inflows.
Among those with net inflows were passively-managed non-U.S. equity strategies, which pulled in $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, and passive U.S. equity, with $823.5 million.
Global equity markets rallied hard in 2017, with the MSCI World Index gaining around 20 percent and U.S. equities 19 percent.
Actively-managed strategies continued to suffer sizeable outflows, with non-U.S. equity products losing $2.2 billion.
Low-yielding bond products also remained out of favor, with non-U.S. fixed income losing $1.7 billion.
Since the global financial crisis, the $6 trillion SWF sector has cut its allocation to government bonds and ramped up its exposure to unlisted assets such as private equity, property and infrastructure in pursuit of higher returns.

The U.S. trade commission last month handed an unexpected victory to Bombardier against Boeing, in a ruling that allows the Canadian company to sell its newest jets to U.S. airlines without heavy duties.
Embraer, a more direct competitor to Bombardier in the market for smaller passenger jets, is backing a separate Brazilian government complaint against Canada at the World Trade Organization, Embraer Commercial Aviation CEO John Slattery said.

“We were the harmed party,"" he told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow. ""Illegal subsidies were given both by the federal government and the state of Quebec to Bombardier. In addition to that Bombardier sold the aircraft in the North American market below cost.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Supermarket group  Tesco  (L:TSCO) is facing a potential bill of up to 4 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) to bring the wages of its female employees into line with men, according to the law firm pursuing Britain's largest equal pay claim.
Tesco is Britain's biggest retailer and its largest private sector employer with more than 310,000 staff.
Law firm Leigh Day said on Wednesday the mainly male staff in the company's distribution centers were paid considerably more than its largely female store workers. The law firm said it was also working on claims at supermarket rivals Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Asda, the British arm of Walmart (N:WMT).
Unequal pay for men and women is currently a hot topic in Britain's boardrooms and corridors of power. The resignation last month of Carrie Gracie as China Editor for the BBC led to an investigation into pay differences at the public broadcaster.
British Business Secretary Greg Clark told Sky News he was ""surprised"" by the scale of the claim against Tesco.
A Tesco spokesman said the firm had not yet received a claim.
""Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do,"" he said.
Tesco shares were down 0.9 percent at 1010 GMT.
Leigh Day said Tesco distribution center staff may earn in excess of 11 pounds ($15.4) an hour, while the most common grade for store staff saw them receive around 8 pounds per hour.
This disparity could see a full time distribution worker on the same hours earning over 100 pounds a week - or 5,000 pounds a year - more than female store staff.
The law firm said more than 200,000 Tesco employees may be underpaid and estimated shortfalls could reach 20,000 pounds each, meaning the potential bill for Tesco could be as high as 4 billion pounds.
Leigh Day said it had already started submitting claims on behalf of its clients through conciliation service ACAS, the first stage in the Employment Tribunal process.
It said it had been approached by over 1,000 employees and former employees of Tesco.
""In terms of equal worth to the company there really should be no argument that workers in stores, compared to those working in distribution centers, contribute at least equal value to the vast profits made by Tesco,"" said Leigh Day employment lawyer Paula Lee.
The firm said it was also representing over 20,000 shop-floor workers in equal pay claims against rival supermarket groups Sainsbury's and Asda.

ATHENS (Reuters) - A deal to sell National Bank of Greece's insurance unit to U.S. and Dutch investors looked as though it might unravel after a legal row erupted between the two buyers on Wednesday.
U.S. investor Calamos Family Partners (CFP) said in an emailed statement it had filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against Dutch EXIN Financial Services Holdings for defaulting on loans.
Calamos Investments and EXIN Partners, a Netherlands-based investor focused on insurance, reinsurance and asset management, had agreed last year to acquire 75 percent of the National Bank of Greece's (AT:NBGr) insurance unit - National Insurance - for 718 million euros ($889 million).
The agreement was signed in June but the buyers have yet to notify regulators at Greece's central bank of key details on the acquisition.
""The Bank of Greece has not received the folder containing the final shareholding structure of the buying group,"" a senior central bank official told Reuters, declining to be named. ""We are expecting EXIN to do so in the next days.""
The investment was supposed to be concluded by the end of March according to the terms of the deal.
National Bank of Greece was not immediately available for comment. Under the deal, National Bank was to keep a 25 percent stake in the insurance unit.
EXIN was not immediately available for comment.
In an emailed statement, Calamos Family Partners (CFP) said it was seeking immediate repayment of more than $41 million in principal, plus interest, owed to them by EXIN under a series of loan agreements. The full amount was payable on December 31 2017, and was now in default.
It said EXIN has repeatedly failed to provide requested financial statements and other financial, accounting and regulatory information and records as required by the applicable loan agreements. In addition, the lawsuit seeks a full accounting of when and how EXIN used the borrowed funds.
CFP said they were also sending a cease and desist letter to EXIN instructing it to remove any reference to Calamos or affiliated entities. There was no specific reference in the email to the Greek deal. On Wednesday morning EXIN's website still had Calamos listed under its partner section.
National Bank of Greece had put its insurance subsidiary up for sale as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations and focus on core banking.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 05:02AM ET</span>","U.S. solar industry lost nearly 10,000 jobs in 2017","By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - The U.S. solar industry lost nearly 10,000 jobs last year, led by steep losses in mature markets like California and Massachusetts where installation growth has slowed, according to a new report published on Wednesday.
It was the first time employment has contracted in the fast-growing industry since the non-profit research firm The Solar Foundation began tracking solar jobs in 2010.
Nationwide, solar employment fell 3.8 percent to 250,271 jobs in 2017 from a high of 260,077 in 2016. A drop in both utility-scale and residential solar installations, as well as industry jitters about tariffs on imported solar panels, were to blame for the decline, the report said.
Employment in the solar industry far outpaces that of the coal, wind and nuclear energy industries, the report said, citing federal jobs data.
U.S. solar installations fell in 2017 after logging a record-breaking year in 2016 as developers raced to take advantage of a federal tax credit that was meant to expire that year. The credit was extended by Congress, but it takes time for companies to rebuild their project pipelines.
In addition, demand for residential systems has slowed in large markets like California, Massachusetts and Nevada because incentives have become less lucrative. Home solar also broadly pulled back after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc bought SolarCity, putting the brakes on the installer's aggressive expansion in part by eliminating its vast door-to-door sales operation.
The industry reported strong job growth in states including Minnesota, Arizona, Utah, New Jersey, New York and Tennessee.
Overall solar employment is expected to resume growth next year, The Solar Foundation said, projecting employment of more than 263,000 by the end of this year, an increase of 5 percent.
That forecast is based on projections made before President Donald Trump last month imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels. The impact of the tariffs may not be fully felt until 2019, report author Ed Gilliland said in an interview.
The trade case that resulted in the tariffs was brought by two U.S. solar manufacturers, Suniva and SolarWorld, which said they could not compete with an influx of cheap panels from overseas, mainly Asia. The Solar Energy Industries Association trade group opposed tariffs, arguing they would drive up prices for the solar installers and developers.

Nearly 78 percent of solar jobs are in installation, sales and project development, compared with just 15 percent in manufacturing, The Solar Foundation's report said.

Didi, which bought out Uber's China business in 2016, said in a statement on Wednesday it would build an ""open new energy car-sharing system"" that would allow members to use vehicles on demand through an app-based system.
Car sharing, along with pay-per-use models and ride-hailing, is shaking up the traditional auto industry model that is based on individual ownership, even as the market makes the seismic shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles.
Global firms are racing to get ahead in the fast-growing car-sharing market to avoid falling behind. Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) has its Car2Go service, while BMW took full control of its DriveNow service last month.
The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said last month it would invest as much as $1 billion in over five years in a bid to adapt to rapid industry change.
Didi said the new network would also include Chinese electric carmaker BAIC BJEV, Ford partners Changan Automobile Group and Zotye Automobile, Chery Automobile, Geely Auto, KIA Motors and others. 
A person familiar with Didi's tie-up with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said the partnership was about looking at the possibility of supplying all-electric battery car models for Didi's new service.
The alliance, however, will also likely explore broader business opportunities with Didi's new energy vehicle sharing service, the person said without elaborating.
""This cooperation fits with the alliance's expansion in vehicle electrification, autonomy, connectivity and new mobility services,"" Ogi Redzic, senior vice president of Connected Vehicles and Mobility Services for Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, said in a statement.
The global car-sharing market is expected to hit $16.5 billion by 2024, from just $1.2 billion in 2015, according to a report last year from Global Market Insights. China is expected to see particularly fast growth.
Didi, which dominates China's ride-hailing market, has previously announced plans to create a domestic charging network for electric cars. The firm has said that it aims to have 1 million electric cars on its network by 2020. 

In November, Didi had said that more than 260,000 electric vehicles were running on its network.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares broke a seven-day losing streak on Wednesday as investors took heart from a strong bounce on Wall Street at the end of a rollercoaster session. 
All sectors in Europe were trading in positive territory, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index to rise 0.7 percent by 0851 GMT. The index is down 3.5 percent year-to-date.
Traders said further turbulence ahead could not be ruled out as volatility remained high in the wake of historic stock market declines caused by worries over inflation. Wall Street futures were pointing to a weaker open on Thursday. 
""It remains too early for the moment to suggest that this might be the end to this particular bout of weakness,"" said Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK. 
A number of well-received company updates also provided support. 
Hexagon soared 7 percent to lead gainers on the STOXX after the Swedish industrial technology company reported fourth-quarter core earnings ahead of analyst forecasts.
 Statoil  (OL:STL) rose more than 2 percent. The Norwegian oil producer said it would raise its dividend after beating fourth-quarter earnings forecasts, helped by higher oil prices.
""We see this as a decent set of numbers with some positive commentary on the growth portfolio, as well as guidance on significant FCF (free cash flow) to come through,"" said analysts at RBC Capital Markets. 
Miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) shares edged up 0.1 percent, paring back earlier gains as its record dividend fail to impress investors.
Delivery Hero and insurer Hannover Re also rose on the back of strong results. 
Some disappointed, with ABN Amro falling 3.4 percent. The Dutch bank beat analyst expectations with a 63 percent jump in fourth-quarter net profit, but some traders voiced concerns over cash returns, saying it was light on capital. 
Enzyme maker Novozymes and brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLa) also fell sharply following their updates. 
According to Thomson Reuters data, 48.2 percent of STOXX 600 companies that have reported results so far exceeded earnings estimates. That's below the 50 percent beat seen in a typical quarter. Revenue beats at 57.3 percent however are above a typical quarter. 
Elsewhere,  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) fell 0.7 percent after reports that the retailer is facing Britain's largest ever equal pay claim and a possible compensation bill of up to 4 billion pounds.

Among country benchmarks, the UK's FTSE added 0.6 percent, while Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent. The German index showed little immediate reaction to reports about developments between Conservatives and Social Democrats over a coalition government deal.

1536,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 03:05AM ET</span>",How Two Tiny Volatility Products Helped Fuel Sudden Stock Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Two days after a sudden spike in volatility sparked a stock-market crash, market participants are left to ponder the wreckage of the sell-off and the mysterious dynamics that caused it. One theory that’s emerging: the curious case of the tail wagging the dog.
Two exchange-traded products that democratized access to one of Wall Street’s most tried-and-true strategies -- selling volatility -- had just $3.6 billion in assets on Monday. That’s a tiny fraction of the roughly $2 trillion estimated to be linked to short-volatility strategies -- and a speck of dust compared to the $23 trillion in market value of S&P 500 companies.
Yet the popularity of these vehicles might have contributed to one of the most violent moves in U.S. equities in history: one that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average slump more than 6 percent in a span of six minutes. After the dust settled, the combined assets in the two exchange-traded products shrank to $135 million. One of them -- the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, known as XIV -- will soon be extinct.
No one knows for sure what played out on the afternoon of Feb. 5 on Wall Street, cautioned  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA managing director Ramon Verastegui, but there’s reason to believe the sharpness of the retreat in equities was linked to traders’ understanding of how the exchange-traded products would behave. As funds’ assets swelled, so too had their power to move the underlying VIX futures markets, he suggests. And market participants knew it.
Products such as XIV and its close relation, the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY), aim to offer investors exposure to the inverse of the daily moves at the front portion of the VIX futures curve, and typically benefit from market tranquility.
The VIX futures curve is linked to the Cboe Volatility Index, often called the market’s ""fear gauge,"" which in turn is a measure of the implied volatility in the S&P 500 Index over the next month. (The VIX tends to move in the opposite direction of U.S. stocks.) Such products typically buy VIX futures as the index rises and sell them as it falls as they seek to maintain a constant degree of exposure to the underlying index.
""People know that ETNs have to rebalance, and which way they have to go and about how much they have to buy,"" Verastegui said. ""Imagine you are a trader, it’s 2:30 p.m. and VIX futures are up about 3 points -- you know what is going to happen at the close.""
Best Options
At that point, a trader’s best options to cover existing exposure or attempt to benefit from the presumptive end-of-day move would be to buy VIX futures or short stocks, added Verastegui.
It was a theory echoed by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc analysts in a research note published after Monday’s sharp spike in the VIX. As volatility-related products scrambled to buy VIX futures in order to rebalance ahead of their 4.15 p.m. daily deadline to calculate the value of their underlying assets -- they effectively pushed up the price of the contracts and eventually the index.
Demand from leveraged VIX exchanged-traded products was ""the major driver for the move post the cash close,"" Barclays analysts led by Maneesh Deshpande said.
There are other clues in the case -- notably that the big fall in stocks hasn’t yet significantly affected other asset classes. That the volatility spike was concentrated in equities supports the notion of a VIX product-propelled plunge, according to George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. During other eruptions of volatility -- the aftermath of China’s shock devaluation of the yuan in August 2015, for instance -- volatility in stocks, bonds, currencies and even oil jumped.
""This is the exact opposite of a number of different volatility spikes we’ve seen in recent years,"" he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. ""Frankly, it’s a reason to think that some of the worst of the recent moves in the VIX and the delta moves in cash equities have been driven specifically by equity-vol products that have not spread out to other asset classes.""
To be sure, the seeds for a pull-back had been sown well ahead of 3 p.m. on Monday. January’s stock-market euphoria and strong returns likely prompted pensions to reduce risk after a strong start to the year, setting the stage for a grind higher in realized equity volatility that would hit a remarkable crescendo as Wall Street chased the moves in a bid to cover a so-called short gamma position.
But even as 2018 kicked off with soaring stocks and subdued volatility, signs of complacency in short-vol land had cropped up.
Dave Roberts, an independent trader of volatility products and associated derivatives, noted that at the expiry of the January VIX contract, the front and second-month contracts were trading at a fairly narrow spread, in contrast to the wider gap at the December expiry. All else equal, that’s a negative development for shorting volatility through VIX exchange-traded products, as the trade offers positive carry to the extent that second month VIX futures are higher than the front month.
To Roberts, this served as a signal that the dynamics of the trade had changed -- a shift seemingly ignored by the record $1.7 billion in assets that piled into XIV and SVXY in January as investors enjoyed a strong rally in stocks.
""On the 30th, when February VIX futures went over March, that was my signal to get out and walk away because stuff gets out of control when the board goes backward,"" he said. ""If you’re going to play the short-vol game, basically the goal is to just stay alive and avoid any circumstance where things can go up in smoke in minutes.""
Others weren’t so lucky. On the social media forum Reddit, trading the XIV had proved so popular that it had earned its own forum called ""tradeXIV."" That forum is now home to a host of horror stories from retail investors who lost nearly everything and the hard lessons learned.
""You have some less sophisticated investors that don’t understand the VIX complex in total, not to mention the F-1 filings of the products they’re participating in,"" said Seth Golden, president of Finom Group, adding that many of them were pushed out of the trade. F-1 filings are a type of financial-registration form.
The former  Target  manager
Golden, a former logistics manager at Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT) who became the subject of a New York Times profile on day traders shorting volatility, said he came into the year with an underweight position in short vol after a torrid 2017, but has added to it amid the market carnage with an eye on increasing exposure to roughly 20 percent of his portfolio from 13 percent.
One silver lining to the crash: SVXY and XIV now lack the heft to roil markets, according to some. Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, said the massive purchases of VIX futures carried out on Monday ""covered 96 percent of their risk,"" adding that they had ""effectively been wiped out."" Analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., agreed, noting that the volatility complex was effectively long vol after Monday’s big move.
Purgative Effect?
The decimation of these products potentially removes one avenue for volatility spikes, as their rebalancing needs are a function of their assets and the move in VIX futures. More than a dozen of volatility-pegged products were halted on Tuesday as the Cboe Volatility Index gyrated wildly. Shares in the Cboe itself, which has reaped licensing fees from the oodles of products tied to its flagship index, also tumbled a record 17 percent on Tuesday. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile, Wall Street quickly shifted its attention to how this recent episodic surge in volatility could spur further pain in stocks. Barclays, Goldman, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). have each warned of a wave of equity selling -- with estimates as high as $225 billion -- in the coming days in response to Monday’s mayhem, primarily as a result of trend-following strategies or target-vol funds paring down risk.
However, SocGen’s Verastegui isn’t sure it’s that simple. Not too many funds are strictly rules-based, he said. And most assets tied to volatility-targeting strategies afford their managers ""a huge among of discretion"" -- so divining how much they might divest is no easy task, he says.
One Down...
On Tuesday,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) AG, the issuer of XIV, exercised its discretion and announced the redemption of the note. On Feb. 5, the indicative value of the product was less than or equal to 20 percent of the prior day’s closing indicative value, the bank said, adding that it suffered no trading losses related to the notes. Shares of the Swiss-based bank had been down as much as 8.5 percent as investors feared XIV’s demise could dent its earnings.
SVXY, for its part, lives to fight another day -- albeit with massive losses. ProShares said the fund’s tumble ""was consistent with its objective and reflected the changes in the level of its underlying index."" The product will be forever linked with the events of Feb. 5 -- when many investors learned that a seemingly free lunch can spoil quickly, and ruin some other people’s parties too.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 02:59AM ET</span>",Strategists still see year-end gains in U.S. stocks despite selloff,"By David Randall and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 4.5 percent drop in the benchmark S&P 500 over the last five days has not dented strategists' expectations for mild to moderate gains in the U.S. stock market by the end of the year, with corporate earnings and interest rates not expected to derail equities.
Only one of the more than 10 U.S. equity strategists contacted by Reuters on Tuesday has lowered their year-end target for the S&P 500. The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent, to 2,695, on Tuesday, one day after posting its largest one-day loss in more than six years.
Despite the steep declines in the stock market, strategists say that they remain optimistic that the sell-off does not reflect underlying weakness in corporate earnings or signal that the rise in interest rates will accelerate and derail the nine-year-long Wall Street bull market. 
Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York, still expects the S&P 500 to reach roughly 3,000 by the end of 2018, an approximately 11 percent gain from its current level, she said.
""We felt markets had gone up too fast. It didn't seem sustainable. We feel it was healthy to take a breather and reset,"" she said, adding that financial and defense companies in particular could move higher once the sell-off is over.
Fourth-quarter earnings in the S&P 500 are expected to grow 14 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. Of the 275 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported their results, 77.8 percent posted earnings above analyst expectations, a rate approximately 13 percent higher than the historical average. 
""The fact is that the economy seems to be heating up,"" said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. ""Right now the market is over-interpreting that the Fed is going to go too far too quickly to combat early signs of inflation. The tax cuts may heat up the economy more than the Fed anticipated but I don't think that's a problem for this year.""
Strategists said that the decline in stocks was overdue after 2017, a year that saw the S&P 500 jump 19 percent, and may continue despite the nearly 2 percent gain in the index on Tuesday. The S&P 500 is now up 0.8 percent for the year, after hitting a high of 2,872.87 on Jan 26. 
""I think the market is going have its confidence restored only when we have a successful retest of the low that was put in yesterday,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel, was the lone strategist to cut his forecasts. He now sees the S&P 500 ending around 2909 for the year, below his previous target for 3,000. 

""We have higher earnings due a lot to new tax rates, but a lower multiple,"" he said.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",Foreigners pare holdings in Asian equities at start of Feb amid stocks rout,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Foreigners trimmed their holdings in Asian equities in the first week of the month, as regional markets were enveloped in a broad global equities sell-off and surging volatility in the wake of rising U.S. bond yields.
Exchange data showed, foreigners sold about $2 billion in South Korean equities and $1.3 billion in Taiwan equities so far this month. Indonesia, Philippine and Thailand markets also saw outflows in that period. 
The sell-off was triggered by a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields following Friday's data that showed U.S. wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009, raising the alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.7659 on Wednesday in Asian hours after rising to a four-year high of 2.885 earlier this week.
Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Hong Kong, said flows into Asia financial assets depend on U.S. financial conditions such as S&P returns, the CBOE Volatility index (VIX) and credit spreads.
""Financial conditions in the U.S. are going to be more challenging than last year given higher volatility, the S&P risk (especially if US-Treasury resumes their rise) and the risk of credit spread widening,"" Benzimra said. 
The CBOE Volatility index, the closely followed ""fear-index"" measure of expected near-term stock market volatility, jumped to a 2-1/2 year high of 37.32 on Tuesday. It was last trading at 29.98.
However, some analysts said the sharp equities fall of the past few days doesn't portend the start of a bear market as economic fundamentals and corporate earnings in the region remain strong. 
Thomson Reuters data, available for 28 percent of Asian companies which reported earnings, showed their net profits beat analysts' estimates by 6 percent on average in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
A DBS report said the current bout of consolidation presents an opportunity to gain exposure to Asia for longer-term investors. 
""The current market turmoil is similar to other mid-cycle correlations seen in recent years and such pull backs have previously coincided with sharp spikes on the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) before rationality returns,"" the DBS report said. 
Asian shares' forward 12-month P/E was trading at 14.22 at the end of January, much cheaper than that of the United States at 18.87 and 17.1 globally.

Exchange data for January showed foreigners invested about $7 billion in Asian equities last month, the highest inflows since March 2017. Taiwan, India and South Korea led the regional flows last month.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2018 01:42AM ET</span>",SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket soars in debut test launch from Florida,"By Joey Roulette
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - The world's most powerful rocket, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, roared into space through clear blue skies on its debut test flight on Tuesday from a Florida launch site in another milestone for billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's private rocket service.
The 23-story-tall jumbo rocket, carrying a cherry red Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Roadster from the assembly line of Musk's electric car company as a mock payload, thundered off its launchpad in billowing clouds of steam and rocket exhaust at 3:45 p.m (2045 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, where moon missions once began. 
Boisterous cheering could be heard from SpaceX workers at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, California, where a livestream feed of the event originated. At least 2,000 spectators cheered the blastoff from a campground near Cocoa Beach, 5 miles (8 km) from the space center.
Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy's two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight.
Then, capitalizing on cost-cutting reusable rocket technology pioneered by SpaceX, the two boosters flew themselves back to Earth for safe simultaneous touchdowns on twin landing pads at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, about eight minutes after launch. Each rocket unleashed a double sonic boom as it neared the landing zone.
The center booster rocket, which SpaceX had predicted was less likely to be salvaged, slammed into the Atlantic at about 300 miles per hour (483 kph), showering the deck of the nearby drone landing vessel and destroying two of the ship's thrusters, Musk told a post-launch news conference.
'CRAZY THINGS COME TRUE'
Still, the Silicon Valley mogul known for self-deprecating understatement hailed the launch as a victory and ""a big relief.""
""I had this image of this giant explosion on the pad, with wheels bouncing down the road and the logo landing somewhere with a thud. But fortunately, that's not what happened,"" he said. ""Crazy things come true."" 
While the Falcon Heavy's initial performance appeared, by all accounts, to have been near flawless, it remained to be seen whether the upper stage of the vehicle and its payload would survive a six-hour ""cruise"" phase to high Earth orbit through the planet's radiation belts. 
The launch, so powerful that it shook the walls of the press trailer at the complex, was conducted from the same site used by NASA's towering Saturn 5 rockets to carry Apollo missions to the moon more than 40 years ago. SpaceX has said it aspires to send missions to Mars in the coming years.
The successful liftoff was a key turning point for Musk's privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, which stands to gain a new edge over the handful of rivals vying for lucrative contracts with NASA, satellite companies and the U.S. military.
Falcon Heavy is designed to place up to 70 tons into standard low-Earth orbit at a cost of $90 million per launch. That is twice the lift capacity of the biggest existing rocket in America's space fleet - the Delta 4 Heavy of rival United Launch Alliance (ULA), a partnership of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co - for about a fourth the cost.
The demonstration flight put the Heavy into the annals of spaceflight as the world's most powerful rocket in operation, with more lift capacity than any space vehicle to fly since NASA's Saturn 5, which was retired in 1973, or the Soviet-era Energia, which flew its last mission in 1988.
Propelled by 27 rocket engines, the Heavy packs more than 5 million pounds of thrust at launch, roughly three times the force of the Falcon 9 booster rocket that until now has been the workhorse of the SpaceX fleet. The new rocket is essentially constructed from three Falcon 9s bolted together side by side.
'NEW SPACE RACE?'
Going along for the ride in a bit of playful cross-promotional space theater was the sleek red, electric-powered sports car from Musk's other transportation enterprise, Tesla Inc. 
Adding to the whimsy, SpaceX planted a space-suited mannequin in the driver's seat of the convertible Tesla Roadster.
Musk mused that ""it may be discovered by some future alien race."" The white spacesuit was real, he said.
A third burn was successful, Musk Tweeted late on Tuesday, sending the Tesla Roadster into its planned trajectory. 
""Exceeded Mars orbit and kept going to the Asteroid Belt,"" he tweeted. 
The roadster, which carries a plaque inscribed with the names of more than 6,000 SpaceX employees, could instead end up in perpetual Earth orbit.
The launch followed an impressive run of successful paid missions - 20 in all since January 2017, when SpaceX returned to flight following a 2016 launchpad accident that destroyed a $62 million rocket and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite that it was to put into orbit two days later.
Musk said he hoped Tuesday's achievement would encourage a new ""space race"" by private ventures and other countries, an allusion to the 1960s Cold War contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.
""Space races are exciting,"" he said.

SpaceX had previously announced plans to eventually use Falcon Heavy to launch two paying space tourists on a trip around the moon. Musk said on Monday he was now inclined to reserve that mission for an even more powerful SpaceX launch system, the Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, whose development he said was proceeding more swiftly than expected.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has given its financial regulator sweeping powers to cap bank bosses' pays, delay their bonuses and even ban them from the industry if found guilty of non-compliance, as it scrambles to restore trust in the scandal-hit sector.
The move, plans for which were first announced in May 2017, underscores the immense pressure on the government to rein in a sector that in recent years has faced accusations of withholding legitimate health insurance payouts, giving misleading financial advice and rigging interest rates.
The series of scandals has cost Australian banks, among the most profitable in the world, hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and triggered a royal commission - an inquiry with the power to recommend criminal charges that starts next week.
Under the new law passed by the Senate on Wednesday, banks in Australia, the world's No.12 economy, must do business with ""honesty and integrity"" and their senior executives will be held directly accountable for non-compliance.
""This legislation is part of a broader suite of financial services reforms ... to put consumers first, ensuring Australians can have trust and confidence in the banking system,"" Treasurer Scott Morrison said in an emailed statement.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) can cap and delay executive bonuses, disqualify executives from the industry and levy fines of up to A$210 million ($166 million).
Shareholders and investors have been disappointed with the high salaries that banks' top brass continue to draw amid mounting worries about the integrity of the sector.
In 2017, the outgoing chief of Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), which is embroiled in a money-laundering scandal, saw his total pay slashed by more than half to A$5.5 million, a reduction many thought did not go far enough.
The CEO of top investment bank  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG), known as the ""millionaires' factory"" because of its lofty executive pay, took home A$18.7 million the same year.
A spokesman for the Australian Bankers' Association said banks ""take executive accountability very seriously which is why they supported the government's initiative in this area"".
The group was, however, disappointed the government declined requests to delay the new laws from a July 1 start date.
REGULATOR REBUKED
The Senate's measure comes after a report from the country's chief economic advisory body accused APRA of failing to stimulate competition and creating an environment that promoted record profits over the interests of customers.
The Productivity Commission also said a three-decade-old law stopping takeovers between the so-called ""Big Four"" banks was outdated and should be removed.
It will hand in its final report by July 1.
A spokesman for Treasurer Morrison said the government would then consider its response.
Australia's big banks - CBA, National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) - reported a combined net profit of about $25 billion in the 2017 fiscal year, up 6.4 percent on a year ago, according to KPMG.
CBA, the biggest of the ""Big Four"", is defending allegations by Australia's anti-money laundering agency that it allowed thousands of suspicious transactions to pass through its systems, including failing to report attempts to wire money by an individual convicted of terror-related offences.
APRA said it welcomed the Commission's draft report.
""We have actively engaged with the Commission in the preparation of the draft report and we will continue to do so as it prepares its final report,"" an APRA spokesman said.
Shares of the ""Big Four"" are down this year, extending their losses from 2017. On Wednesday, CBA stock edged down about a percent after the lender posted a surprise dip in interim profit, citing unusual regulatory compliance costs.
Westpac, ANZ and NAB shares ended flat, lagging the broader market <>AXJO> that rose 0.75 percent.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - An HNA Group company has failed to make an early payment it had agreed to on a 1.7 billion yuan ($271.9 million) trust product that falls due next week, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said, the latest indication of financial stress at the highly leveraged conglomerate.
CITIC Trust issued the one-year loan product last year on behalf of HNA Real Estate Group, a property development arm of the Shanghai-listed HNA Infrastructure Investment Group Co.
Although a payment is officially due on Feb. 16, CITIC Trust had requested early repayment, due to concerns about HNA's liquidity situation and the upcoming Chinese New Year holidays, the sources said.
A few days ago, HNA Real Estate provided a promise letter to CITIC Trust stating that it would repay part of the trust loan by Feb. 5, the sources said. That promised early payment failed to materialize due to HNA's tight liquidity situation, the sources said.
Details on the size of the early payment for the trust product were not immediately available.
The uncertainty over HNA's repayment of the trust loan underscores wider apprehension surrounding the debt-troubled conglomerate, as well the ongoing heated discussions now taking place behind the scenes between the group and its creditors.
Late Tuesday, HNA Infrastructure published a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange asserting that the company was able to meet its loan principal and trust income obligations on time.
Repayments on the trust product, HNA Infrastructure said, are staggered from Feb. 16 through the end of November.
The company also it was coordinating with CITIC Trust to ""deal with the matter"".
CITIC Trust would take legal action against HNA if the payment fails to materialize, one of the sources said, pointing to the value of guarantees HNA pledged for the loan. 
The HNA trust loan is guaranteed by the rights to use three plots of land that are part of HNA's Sun Moon Plaza project, a shopping development located across the road from the provincial government offices, according to a product description.
HNA Infrastructure Investment Group also provided guarantees for the payment, according to the description.
CITIC Trust declined to comment.
HNA said that it wouldn't comment beyond the Shanghai Stock Exchange statement.
HNA is facing liquidity pressure and a potential cash shortfall of at least 15 billion yuan in the first quarter of the year, the company told its major bank creditors at a meeting in Haikou last month.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Former Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick testified at a trial over technology trade secrets on Tuesday that delays in Uber's self-driving car development led him to hire a star engineer from rival Waymo as part of attempts to catch up with competitors.
Kalanick, known to be hard-charging and combative in his work, spoke softly on the witness stand in San Francisco federal court and avoided becoming argumentative in front of the jury in what were his first public comments on allegations by Waymo that Uber stole its self-driving car technology.
The ride-hailing firm's co-founder, Kalanick testified for less than an hour and will be questioned further on Wednesday by lawyers for Waymo, which sued Uber a year ago saying a Waymo engineer downloaded confidential documents in December 2015 before Kalanick hired him at Uber in 2016.
The 10 jurors will have to decide whether the documents were indeed trade secrets and not common knowledge, and whether Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] improperly acquired them, used them and benefited from them. Their decision will influence one of the biggest technology races in Silicon Valley. 
Kalanick testified that in 2015 he became unhappy with the pace of development at Uber's Advanced Technologies Center, the hub of its self-driving car operations. He said he began negotiations with Anthony Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, while Levandowski still worked for Waymo, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving car unit.
On the witness stand, Kalanick acknowledged that he was a ""big fan"" of Levandowski's.
""Look, I wanted to hire Anthony and he wanted to start a company. So I wanted to come up with a situation where he could feel like he started a company and I could feel like I hired him,"" said Kalanick, who appeared in court in a business suit and tie, a departure from the usual Silicon Valley casual.
How he presents himself and the company to the jury is crucial, legal experts said.
Despite Kalanick's plan, Uber still lags in the competitive field of autonomous vehicles.
When Waymo attorney Charles Verhoeven asked Kalanick if he agreed Google is the industry leader for self-driving cars, the former top Uber executive said: ""I think that's the general perception right now.""
Levandowski is not a defendant in the case but is on Waymo's witness list. He declined to answer questions at a pretrial deposition last year, citing his constitutional rights against self incrimination, and lawyers for both Waymo and Uber have said they expect him to do the same if called at trial.
Verhoeven has positioned Kalanick as a main figure in the case, emphasizing his competitive nature and desire to win at all costs. During the trial's opening statements on Monday, Verhoeven said competitive pressures were so great to develop self-driving cars that Kalanick decided ""winning was more important than obeying the law."" 
The dispute between the companies has captivated Silicon Valley and could help determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of autonomous cars.
Between his domineering personality, micromanaging tendencies and broad control over the company through stock ownership and governance rules, Kalanick largely made Uber in his image. He drove Uber's 2016 acquisition of Otto, the self-driving truck startup founded by Levandowski, which merged the companies' businesses and put Levandowski in charge of Uber's autonomous-driving unit.
At one point, Kalanick was shown notes from another Uber executive that captured Kalanick's sentiments about the Otto deal. According to the notes, Kalanick said some objectives of the Otto deal were gaining a ""pound of flesh"" as well as ""IP,"" meaning intellectual property.
Asked if he ever said ""pound of flesh"" regarding the Otto deal, Kalanick said he did not know. 
""It's a term I use from time to time,"" he said.
Kalanick also said he could not recall listing ""IP"" as an objective. Verhoeven then asked if Kalanick knew that ""intellectual property"" referred to property that belongs to someone else.
""Yes, sir,"" Kalanick said.
Uber bought Otto about three months after it publicly launched.
Kalanick said he promised Levandowski and his team nearly $600 million in incentive payments if they met certain technical milestones with the development of self-driving car systems.

Kalanick has stayed mostly out of public eye since he was forced by investors to resign in June. His exit followed months of scandal, including a public allegation of sexual harassment that triggered an internal investigation and resulted in more than 20 employees being fired, litigation and federal criminal probes that led shareholders to question his leadership abilities. He remains on the board of directors.

Soon-Shiong, a major shareholder in Tronc and chief executive of NantHealth Inc (O:NH), will also buy the Times' sister newspaper, the San Diego Union-Tribune, the source said. 
Tronc was not immediately available for comment.
The Times, acquired by Tronc's predecessor Tribune Co in 2000, has undergone several management changes and rounds of layoffs, reflecting a struggle by newspapers in general to adapt to digital media.
The newspaper's publisher and CEO, Ross Levinsohn, agreed to take an unpaid leave of absence last month following disclosure of sexual harassment allegations against him while he worked at other companies. 

Tronc acquired the San Diego Union-Tribune in May 2015. Its other newspapers include the Baltimore Sun and the Hartford Courant.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Shorting short volatility U.S. exchange trade products reaps big gains,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Monday's slump in the U.S. stock market may have been painful for those betting against volatility in prices, but traders who took opposite positions hoping to gain from a sharp move are likely to laugh all the way to their banks.
Shorting volatility, or betting on calm stock market conditions, had been one of the most successful trading strategies until Monday, when a massive selloff in U.S. stocks derailed some popular short volatility exchange traded products (ETPs).
One trader's pain, however, is another's gain. 
With short-volatility ETPs, such as VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (P:XIV), the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:SVXY), and VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term ETN (O:ZIV), all logging massive losses, traders who had bearish bets against these products have much to be happy about.
For traders who targeted these ETPs, their 2018 year-to-date paper profits rose by $639.4 million, to $1.03 billion, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners showed, even though some of these bearish bets may have been hedges meant to offset positions held elsewhere.
""With the CBOE SPX Volatility Index (VIX) almost tripling over the last three trading days mark-to-market profit and losses have been significant,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners.
Dusaniwsky noted that with  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) announcing on Tuesday that it would terminate its XIV ETP fund, short sellers will have to buy back shares to cover their short positions on or before February 20th, the last day of trading for the product.

Dusaniwsky said this could lead to higher volatility for XIV over the next few days as traders look to buy XIV to cover their short position.

The Sweden-based company's full year revenue rose about 40 percent from 2016, according to The Information's report, which cites two investors briefed on the numbers. Spotify could not be immediately reached for comment. The company is the biggest music-streaming company in the world and counts Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) as its main rivals. Spotify filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering last month and is targeting a direct listing in the first half of 2018 that would allow some longtime investors to cash out, Reuters had reported, citing a source. The company had an operating loss of between 70 million and 90 million euros in its third quarter, suggesting that full year operating losses will top 300 million euros($371.43 million), The Information said. 
Spotify, which was valued at as much as $19 billion last year, said in June that it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs. Spotify last reported more than 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple Music, its closest rival.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:57PM ET</span>",What were the chances? U.S. stock selloff sinks Probabilities Fund among others,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Probabilities Fund was supposed to take some of the risk out of the stock market. 
The $81.2 million mutual fund, backed by an eponymous firm based in San Diego, aims to have a double leveraged position in the U.S. stock market during periods when there is a high likelihood of further gains, and a portfolio all in cash during times it sees a high chance of losses. 
Yet the Probabilities fund, once a hedge fund before converting itself into a plain-vanilla mutual fund in 2013, found itself wrong-footed on Monday, entering the day with positions in exchange-traded funds that returned double the gain or loss of the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index. 
During the 4 percent decline in the S&P 500 index, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points, the Probabilities Fund dropped 8.2 percent, the largest decline among any actively managed U.S. stock fund tracked by Lipper. 
""We are currently in the bullish phase of our trading strategy and yesterday's return reflected a leveraged position,"" Jonathan Chatfield, the fund's chief portfolio manager, told Reuters.
""We exited the leveraged position and were one times long at the market open this morning. The positive impact of yesterday’s trades should be reflected in an improvement in Tuesday's closing"" price, he added.
On its website, the Probabilities Fund Management LLC says that the Probabilities fund's strategy between the start of 2008 and the end of 2017 has resulted in a nearly 188 percent gain, compared with a 126 percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index.
The largest one-day decline in U.S. stocks in more than six years punished fund managers large and small on Monday, leaving just one actively managed large-capitalization stock fund positive for the day. 
Those that suffered the steepest declines were those that used leverage, made concentrated bets in only a few stocks, or focused on thin slices of the market, all strategies that were richly rewarded during the 19 percent rally in the S&P 500 that left the index starting the year with record highs. 
Instead, fund managers are starting to feel the first cracks in the nine-year long bull market as interest rates rise and the era of cheap money appears over. 
The $16.2 million Upright Growth fund, for instance, dropped 7.1 percent on Monday alone, stung by steep loses in the four companies that make up 80 percent of its assets: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV, Himax Technologies Inc, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
The $2.9 billion Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace Portfolio, meanwhile, fell 5.1 percent on Monday, dragged lower by declines in Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). 
Both firms declined to comment for this story.
SHORT-SELLERS RIDING SELLOFF 
Left behind during the meteoric rise in the S&P 500 and Dow last year, short-sellers, who make money by wagering that a company's share price will fall, finally pocketed some profits during Monday's downdraft.
Collectively, traders with short positions in electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gleaned a $314 million profit yesterday, the largest among all single stock positions tracked by data firm S3 Partners. 
Traders shorting Nvidia Corp, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) each reaped gains of $248 million or more, according to S3 Partners data.
Noted short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, who continued to add to his short position in Tesla throughout 2017, told Reuters on Monday: ""Markets sometimes go down, too.""
The drop in Tesla likely also benefited managers like David Einhorn whose Greenlight Capital has been betting against Tesla,  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Amazon and Netflix, a group he calls the ""bubble basket.""  
Greenlight returned only 1.6 percent last year and lost 6.0 percent in January as these stocks roared higher. A spokesman for Greenlight declined to comment.
For a number of hedge funds, bets on technology stocks have paid off in the last few months. For example, Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management gained 28 percent in 2017 and posted a 9.9 percent gain in January. A spokeswoman declined to comment.
Funds that take both long and short positions also buffered the stock-market blow with their short bets on Monday. For example, the $5.9 billion AQR Long-Short Equity fund, a mutual fund which employs a hedge-fund like strategy, fell 2.5 percent yesterday, or about half of the decline of the broad market.
Overall, the lone actively managed large-capitalization stock fund that posted a gain Monday was the $115 million Arin Large Cap Theta fund, which blends a long-equity portfolio with a buy and write option strategy that allows it to collect extra income while limiting its swings up or down. 
The fund, which gained 0.68 percent yesterday, is up 4.5 percent over the last year, trailing the S&P 500 by approximately 10 percentage points.

""We have been stuck in the mud, working very hard and producing very little, and then you have days like yesterday where the market sells off and we're able to stay out of harm's way,"" said Joseph DeSipio, the chief market strategist at suburban-Philadelphia based Arin Risk Advisors. ""This may be the thing that convinces people to stick to more traditional ways of investing and buy and hold great companies.""

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:57PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse 'volatility' fund liquidated after market selloff,"By Michael Shields and Trevor Hunnicutt
ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) said on Tuesday it would terminate the second-largest publicly traded product betting on future swings in the S&P 500 after its value plunged during the global market rout.
The fund's spectacular demise marked just one of the casualties in the ""short-vol"" trade investors piled into in recent years to profit from stable markets with complex products that gained on low and stable volatility.
Those bets unraveled on Monday as the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) suffered their biggest respective percentage drops since August 2011. U.S. stocks ended Tuesday with gains after another wild trading session. 
Monday's selloff triggered the termination of Credit Suisse's VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note (ETN) (P:XIV), which tracks financial instruments that effectively bet against a fall in markets. It will stop trading by Feb. 20, the Swiss bank said in a statement.
The notes were worth a combined $1.6 billion on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, but ended Tuesday at a more-than-92 percent discount to their closing value the prior day.
Just one fifth of XIV's outstanding shares are owned by funds and institutions, according to Morningstar Inc. That suggests retail investors could own a sizeable chunk of the volatility product which booked a 585 percent gain for the two years ending Feb. 1.
Credit Suisse said earlier it faced no material impact from the fall in the ETN, in which it has a 32 percent stake. The bank's exposure to the product, which Credit Suisse launched in 2010 and of which it has around 4.8 million units, was fully hedged, according to a source familiar with the matter, meaning they made other trades to eliminate their own risk.
Credit Suisse's European-listed shares closed down 6 percent during a broader selloff.
""LONG TERM VALUE...ZERO""
The long-awaited market decline from record highs sent people to options for protection, raising prices for those derivatives, and eroding the value of XIV and other investments that effectively bet on tranquil conditions.
Janus Henderson Group plc (N:JHG), which markets the notes and owns the VelocityShares brand, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Nomura Securities (T:8604) said earlier Tuesday it would redeem its Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed ""Next Notes"" S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse ETN (T:2049) after a massive loss in the product. Those notes will be redeemed at a cut of 96.1 percent from its closing price on Monday, and will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Feb. 19, Nomura said.
Other similar products were halted from trading. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) fell 20 percent on Tuesday, meaning many inverse products could have made back some of their losses had trading in the products not been stopped.
""The unexpected level of volatility has impaired the trading of the underlying derivatives used by many VIX-related exchange-traded products,"" said Horizons ETFs Management (Canada) Inc, which halted one of its volatility products and discouraged investors from buying another.
XIV's prospectus spelled out the risks of an investment in the ETN, saying a large decline could result in its closure, removal from the market and likely loss of all or a substantial part of the investment.
""The long term expected value of your ETNs is zero,"" the prospectus says.
It is not the first challenge for investors in a Credit Suisse ETN.
The firm was sued in 2012 by investors who owned a ""leveraged"" ETN after new issuances of the notes, which doubled one market's returns, were suspended. A federal appeals court in 2014 ruled in favor of the bank, saying no reasonable investor could have read disclosures for the product without understanding their risk.

In 2016, the bank took its leveraged oil-tracking notes off of exchanges without offering all of its investors a way to redeem them, forcing some to trade ""over-the-counter,"" where there was no guarantee of recouping their full investment.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co is developing plans to offset a provision in the new U.S. tax law that incentivizes farmers to sell crops to rival cooperatives, the grain merchant's chief said on Tuesday, highlighting the threat the law poses to privately held elevators and processors.
The provision allows farmers a 20 percent deduction on payments for sales of crops to farmer-owned cooperatives, but not for sales to private or investor-owned grain companies such as ADM and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL).
That has driven fears among U.S. ethanol producers and privately run crop handlers that they could be squeezed out of the competition to buy farmers' harvests.
Members of Congress have assured ADM the provision will be ""fixed legislatively"" soon, Chief Executive Juan Luciano told analysts on a conference call. However, the company has already suffered a minor commercial impact from the rule and is working on potential options to offset it, he said.
""Of course, the team has been looking at options,"" Luciano said, after ADM reported quarterly earnings. 
""We're not going to sit idle and see ourselves losing share.""
Luciano did not elaborate on the options or the impact of the provision on the company. A spokeswoman later declined to provide details.
Republican leaders of Congress have been working with representatives of grain companies and cooperatives to address the issue since early January. 
Some grain handlers were hoping Congress would include a solution in a spending bill that the U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on Tuesday evening.
Republican senators Pat Roberts of Kansas, John Hoeven of North Dakota and John Thune of South Dakota were still working on a resolution on Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Roberts said. 
""Whether it's coming now or coming in the next month, it's coming in the near future,"" Luciano said on the call.

The grain sector is struggling with low crop prices following years of big harvests and is paying close attention to the tax law after support from rural communities helped propel U.S. President Donald Trump into office in 2016. The restructuring of the tax code, the biggest in 30 years, handed Trump his first major legislative victory since taking office.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Stock market volatility raises risk for U.S. public pension funds,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Recent stock market volatility could sting some U.S. public retirement funds in the short term and lead to bigger state and local government contributions in the event of a prolonged market downturn, pension analysts said on Tuesday. 
The portfolios of some funds have bulked up on riskier and more volatile investments over the past eight years, Eileen Norcross, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said.
""Some of these plans are going to suffer, at least in this quarter, losses of some sort,"" she said. 
But Rebecca Sielman, a consulting actuary at consulting firm Milliman, said an important component in calculating funding for nearly all public retirement systems is smoothing out gains and losses over typically a four- to five-year period to dampen the impact of market volatility.
""What happened yesterday was just a very small blip,"" Sielman said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a record 1,175 points, or 4.6 percent, on Monday, though Tuesday's gains wiped out some of those losses.
State pension funds, for example, allocated on average 64.8 percent of their investment portfolios to equities, including real estate and private equity in fiscal 2016, according to a June 2017 Wilshire Consulting report. Of the 131 state retirement systems covered in the report, 16 had equity allocations of 75 percent or higher, while 11 were below 50 percent. 
As a result, the funding status of public pensions is ""very reliant"" on the performance of the stock market, said Yimeng Yin, a research analyst at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. And if the funds' assumed rate of investment return, which average around 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent, is not met, state and local government budgets will be hit, he said.
""If there's a sustained low-return market, the government contribution will eventually rise and crowd out some other public services,"" Yin said.
Public funds had median gains of 15.17 percent in calendar year 2017 and 9.08 percent over the past five years, Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service reported on Tuesday.
State and local pension assets totaled $4.16 trillion in the 2017 third quarter, an increase of 8.6 percent over the same quarter in 2016, according to Federal Reserve data.

State unfunded pension liabilities hit $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2016, according to Moody's Investors Service, and totaled $456 billion for the 50 largest local governments Moody's rates.

(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts as theme park crowds packed a new ""Avatar"" land, making up for a decline at the ABC broadcasting network.
Shares of Disney rose 2.7 percent in after-hours trading to $108.99. Through Tuesday's close, Disney shares had fallen 1.3 percent this year, compared with 0.8 percent increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The media and entertainment conglomerate reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 for October through December, ahead of the $1.61 analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company also announced it was expanding its ""Star Wars"" universe, hiring the creators of HBO hit ""Game of Thrones,"" David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, to write and produce a new series of films set in the galaxy far, far away. 
Disney is working to transform itself over the next few years from a traditional media company into a digital entertainment leader to reach audiences that prefer to watch TV shows and movies online through subscription services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
In December, Disney announced a $52.4 billion deal to buy film, television and international assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, a move that will allow it to offer more programming to online viewers.
Investors have been rattled by the loss of pay TV subscribers to ESPN, Disney's largest network. That trend continued in the quarter, which also was hit by fewer college football games compared with a year earlier. The revenue paid by distributors to carry ESPN rose. 
Profit at the media networks division fell 12 percent, mostly due to a decline at ABC, which saw lower advertising revenue and income from program sales, plus higher production cost write-downs. 
To counter the shift to online viewing, Disney will launch a streaming service for sports fans in the spring called ESPN Plus to reach digital audiences, followed by a family entertainment offering in 2019. ESPN Plus will cost $4.99 per month, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on a conference call.
""The company has clear tailwinds heading into 2018,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said. 
For the December quarter, Disney reported net income of $4.42 billion and said revenue rose 3.8 percent to $15.4 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $15.46 billion.
The media conglomerate recorded a $1.6 billion gain due to recent changes to the U.S. tax law.
The theme parks division generated $1.3 billion in operating income for the quarter, helped by strong park attendance and cruise ship bookings over the Christmas and New Year's holidays, Disney said. Visitors flocked to an ""Avatar""-themed land at Walt Disney World in Florida and to a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" ride at Disneyland Resort in California, the company said. 
Disney's movie studio turned out three blockbusters in the quarter. They were ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and ""Coco,"" but operating income at the studio fell because of lower home entertainment and streaming sales. 

Operating income for the studio declined 2 percent to $829 million, Disney said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Deep losses in Wall Street stocks and recent optimism about profit growth have left the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index trading at its lowest price-to-earnings multiple in over a year.
While some traders warn that a ""buy the dip"" mentality may be coming to an end after a nine-year stock rally, analysts who remain bullish say U.S. economic growth remains on track after running at an annualized 2.6 percent in the last quarter of 2017.
Haverford Trust Chief Investment Officer Hank Smith said that despite the S&P 500's 4.5 percent slide over the past three days, he expects the index to end 2018 with a 12 percent gain. 
""Fundamentals are strong: the rate of GDP growth is accelerating here and abroad; corporate profit growth is accelerating here and abroad,"" Smith said. 
The S&P 500's deep loss over two days through Monday left it priced at 16.9 times earnings expected for the next four quarters, its lowest level since November 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors use earnings multiples to judge whether a stock looks cheap or overvalued. 
(Graphic: S&P 500 and forward PE - http://reut.rs/2BHl6P3)
Prior to the Wall Street selloff that began last Friday, the S&P 500 was trading at 18.2 times expected earnings which was pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14.5. In December, the S&P 500's forward PE reached as high as 18.9 before analysts began to increase their estimates for companies reporting their fourth-quarter results. 
Wall Street's largest companies are not the only ones to have seen their earnings valuations decline in recent sessions. The S&P 600 index of small-capitalization U.S. companies ended Monday at 18.2 times expected earnings, its lowest level since before August last year, which is the most recent data collected by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Although Wall Street's recent selloff accounts for part of the recent dip in the S&P 500's earnings valuation, analysts' earnings estimates for companies have also been steadily rising, fueled by corporate tax cuts passed by the U.S. Congress in December as well as by an improving global economy. 
S&P 500 components are expected by analysts to grow their earnings per share in 2018 by 18.4 percent. At the start of January, analysts estimated that S&P 500 EPS would rise 12 percent in 2018.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) has seen ""strong demand"" for replacement iPhone batteries and may offer rebates for consumers who paid full price for new batteries, the company said in a Feb. 2 letter to U.S. lawmakers made public on Tuesday.
Apple confirmed in December that software to deal with aging batteries in iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE models could slow down performance. The company apologized and lowered the price of battery replacements for affected models from $79 to $29.
In the letter released Tuesday, amid nagging allegations that it slowed down phones with older batteries as a way to push people into buying new phones, the company said it was considering issuing rebates to consumers who paid full price for replacement batteries.
The letter, released by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, also said Apple provided a phone-slowing software update in January 2017 but did not disclose it until a month later.
In the letter, Apple said it had known about battery problems caused by a manufacturing defect as early as fall 2016. 
Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the committee, said in a statement that ""consumers rely on clear and transparent disclosures from manufacturers to understand why their device may experience performance changes.""
Thune said that in discussions with the committee ""Apple has acknowledged that its initial disclosures came up short. Apple has also promised the committee some follow-up information, including an answer about additional steps it may take to address customers who purchased a new battery at full price.""
Apple did not immediately comment on Thune's statement. The company also sent a letter in response to Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the U.S. House of Representatives. Apple told the committee that it would consider extending its reduced-cost battery replacement program beyond 2018 if it can't find a way to prevent sudden shutdowns in older iPhones without throttling processor speeds.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission said they were investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures that it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries, Bloomberg reported.
In a statement last week, Apple said it had ""received questions from some government agencies"" and was duly responding to them. The company had ""never, and would never, do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,"" the statement said.
Consumers so far have filed some 50 proposed class action lawsuits over Apple’s latest iPhone software update, which they allege caused unexpected shutdowns and hampered the performance of iPhone models of the SE, 6 and 7 lines.

Government agencies in countries ranging from Brazil to France and Italy to South Korea are also investigating Apple following complaints.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Deduction scramble helped drive U.S. wave of tax bonuses: experts,"By David Morgan and Alana Wise
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump signed into law an overhaul of the U.S. tax code in late December that slashed the corporate tax rate, managers at Southwest Airlines Co wasted no time.
Within days of the law's enactment, the Dallas-based carrier announced that because of anticipated savings under the new law, it would give $1,000 bonuses to each of its 55,000 employees. 
Southwest was not alone. More than 200 companies in recent weeks have cited the tax law in declaring bonuses for at least 3 million U.S. workers, according to Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax activist group in Washington.
Besides being eager to offer a swift thank you to employees, Congress and Trump, companies had another reason to move so quickly on bonuses, said tax experts and corporate executives.
Bonuses are a tax deductible business expense. Since Trump's tax overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, a bonus deduction booked in 2017 could provide a company with tens of millions of dollars more in tax savings than one booked in 2018, depending on its size and scope.
Bonuses declared in fiscal 2017 can be claimed as 2017 deductions as long as the bonuses are paid out by mid-March 2018 for companies with calendar fiscal years, said tax experts.
""A deduction in 2017 is a lot more valuable than a deduction in 2018, because of the 14 percentage point difference in tax rates,"" said Robert Delgado, head of a compensation and benefits group at audit, tax and advisory firm KPMG LLP.
At Southwest, Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo told Reuters in an interview, ""We went to work immediately over the holidays to look at our options.""
On the bonus, she said, ""Because it was approved prior to the end of the year, it ended up being a deduction for 2017.”
The large corporate savings obtainable by taking a bonus deduction in 2017 instead of 2018 will not be equally available to employees earning $200,000 or less who get a bonus in 2018, said the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.
For them, tax will be due on bonuses and their tax rates will be only slightly lower this year than last, nowhere near the deep cut in the corporate rate, tax experts said. 
Maximizing the value of deductions for bonus payments is a legitimate strategy for corporations, whose shareholders expect them to pay the lowest taxes possible.
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) unveiled $1,000 bonuses for more than 200,000 employees on Dec. 20, the day Congress approved the law. Similar announcements followed from Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and other companies.
Some of the bonuses would have been awarded anyway, experts said, but the tax bill allowed employers to be more generous.
Walmart, which handed out bonuses worth $200 to $1,000 depending on years of service, routinely offers its employees quarterly performance-based bonuses. But the company described this payment as a one-time bonus set after the tax bill passed. 
Steve Seelig, a compensation expert at consulting firm Willis Towers Watson, said declaring a post-tax overhaul bonus was a compelling move for companies in several ways.
""It engenders good will with their employees, it gets good press, there's good reaction in Congress. Not only do you get all that, you get a better deduction,"" he said.
To get a 2017 bonus deduction, a corporation must ensure a bonus qualifies as a ""fixed and determinable"" liability. This can require the board to pass a resolution authorizing a bonus payment and a message alerting employees to the plan.

""Companies are continuing to evaluate bonuses and whether it makes financial sense to pay them ... and get the deduction earlier,"" said Jerry Karlin, an employer tax expert at Deloitte Tax LLP. ""That's not new. There's just a greater economic savings this year.""

Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months were up 0.9 percent for the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.
Net profit was $43.8 million, or $1.55 per share, up from $16 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding the 21 cent per share gain related to the new U.S. tax law, Chipotle beat Street's profit view by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Revenue jumped 7.3 percent to $1.1 billion, to match Wall Street's view. Traffic declines partially offset same-store sales gains related to last year's menu price increases.

The trader, whose nickname was bestowed by Macro Risk Advisors’ Pravit Chintawongvanich, has been notable in recent months for large trades. The patterns on Friday contributed substantially to activity on a day that the Cboe exchange later said set volume records. The bets have usually been in line to book profits if implied equity volatility rises moderately.
The market participant changed behavior recently; the signature used to be trading three-month options and rolling after two months, but appears to have switched to a one-month cycle, Chintawongvanich said on Jan. 11.
The activity Tuesday appeared to be closing a spate of trades from Friday, a day the Elephant’s signature pattern had also been detected. About 260,000 March $15 calls were sold today, while the same number of March $25 calls and March $12 puts were bought.
The trades on Friday appeared to involve a new position via the sale of 262,500 $12 March puts, buying 262,500 $15 calls and selling 525,000 $25 calls. That was after closing out the prior existing position by buying back 262,500 February VIX puts with a strike price of $12, selling 262,500 $15 calls, and buying back 525,000 $25 calls.

The auction, slated for March 29, will offer 70 blocks in the offshore Ceará, Potiguar, Sergipe-Alagoas, Campos and Santos basins and on-shore basins of Parnaíba and Paraná.
The deadline to register for the auction is Wednesday. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Chevron did not bid in an October auction that opened Brazil's offshore pre-salt play to foreign operators and was dominated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSA). 
However, Chevron is seeking to ramp up its production in Brazil. 

Reuters reported in December that Chevron had reached preliminary agreement with oil services company Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) to drill six wells in a Brazilian offshore field in a bid to lift its output there after a 2011 oil spill that cut production.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Lawsuit claiming Citigroup ran 'boys club' dismissed by U.S. judge,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit by a fired  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) financial adviser who said the bank's ""culture of gender discrimination"" made it clear that ""the boys were in charge.""
U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan said most of Erin Daly's claims over the alleged bias and harassment she faced in her seven years at the New York-based bank did not belong in federal court because she had agreed to arbitrate them.
He also said Daly waited too long to accuse Citigroup of firing her in retaliation for reporting her boss's alleged violations of rules to prevent insider trading, by demanding nonpublic details about stock offerings that he wanted to pass to favored clients.
Michelle Daly, a lawyer for the plaintiff, had no immediate comment. Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos declined to comment.
The lawsuit is one of many over the years accusing U.S. banks of favoring male bankers, traders and financial advisers over their female counterparts, and permitting improper conduct.
Erin Daly claimed that Citigroup stripped her of client contact and responsibilities because of her gender, in an effort to reduce her to a ""glorified secretary"" because its ""boys' club"" policies dictated that ""the men were doing business.""
Sullivan agreed with Citigroup that Daly's whistleblower claim under the federal Sarbanes-Oxley governance law was stale because Daly brought it two years after her December 2014 dismissal, missing a 180-day deadline.
He also said Citigroup's having allegedly alerted a U.S. brokerage regulator, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), about shortcomings in Daly's work did not create a ""continuing violation"" that meant the 180-day limit had not run.
The plaintiff, a resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, had sought double back pay, unpaid bonuses and punitive damages.

The case is Daly v. Citigroup Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-09183.

1586,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>",Dow Jones Soars After More Than 900 Point Swing From Session Lows,"Investing.com – Wall Street surged intraday Tuesday as investors returned to take advantage of cheaper stocks following Monday’s steep selloff while signs of progress toward a budget deal eased uncertainty.
“Senate Democratic leader Schumer and I had a good meeting this morning about a caps deal and the other issues we’ve been discussing for some months now, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters.” “I‘m optimistic that very soon we’ll be able to reach an agreement.”
Signs of progress toward a budget deal come just two days before a stop-gap government funding measure – passed in January - is due to expire.
Tech led the move higher after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) caught a bid as fears of a prolonged selloff appear to have faded with the so-called fear index CBOE Volatility Index slumping more than 20%.
Also adding to positive sentiment on equities were reports that president Donald Trump is poised to unveil his infrastructure plan on Monday which aims to generate at least $1.5 trillion in investments."

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Icahn calls U.S. stock nosedive 'rumblings of an earthquake': CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn warned on Tuesday that investors have exposure to ""way too many derivatives"" and called the stock market's nosedive just ""rumblings of an earthquake.""
""The market is really not a place for the average person to be playing around with derivatives,"" Icahn said on CNBC. ""Today, you have these triple-leveraged ETFs (exchange-trade funds) that are crazy.""
U.S. stocks swung wildly between positive and negative territory on Tuesday, a day after the Dow and S&P 500 indexes saw their biggest one-day declines in more than six years, while a world stock index dropped more than 1 percent. The pullback followed a rapid run-up in the start of the year and strong 2017 gains. 
Icahn, who has been raising red flags on the stock-market's meteoric rise, said the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials indexes should recover, given the ""great fundamentals"" in U.S. companies and the recent tax cuts.
""I think this market will bounce back probably. Eventually, you get through this little panic thing,"" Icahn said. ""Ironically, even though I am bearish and we have a lot of hedges on, I am not that bearish.""
Icahn said investors should not use the markets like a casino. ""... that's a huge mistake. This casino is on steroids.""
He suggested that the Federal Reserve's loose quantitative easing policies had helped prop up stocks. ""I don't think this is the explosive time (for stocks)...I think here, we will get out of this.""
All told, Icahn said the major risks are in ETFs and exchange-traded notes (ETNs). 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Tuesday it would terminate the second-largest publicly traded product tracking swings in the S&P 500 after its value plunged during the global markets selloff. 
VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note (ETN), which tracks financial instruments that bet against a fall in markets, will stop trading by Feb. 20, the Swiss bank said in a statement.
The notes were worth a combined $1.6 billion on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, but the redemption after Monday's selloff will likely leave investors with a fraction of their initial investment, just one casualty of the global selloff.
""It completely evaporated in one day,"" Icahn said of XIV. 

""One day, this thing is just going to implode because you have too much leverage with too many people buying these (ETF) things and Wall Street sells them these products. And I’ve been saying for a long time, it is extremely dangerous,"" he added.

1610,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 12:32PM ET</span>",Bitcoin Draws Congress' Ire as Regulators Bemoan Oversight Gaps,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S.’s top market cops on Tuesday identified gaping holes in regulators’ ability to police cryptocurrencies, opening the door for Congress to tighten oversight of what’s become a global investment craze.
Lawmakers may need to to pass legislation that gives federal agencies jurisdiction over Bitcoin’s spot market and the online platforms that digital coins trade on, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.
The regulators said the first step was for federal and state watchdogs to work together to come up with a coordinated plan for monitoring crypto exchanges, which have been beset with trading disruptions and thefts of coins that have rattled investor confidence.
“We may be back with our friends from Treasury to ask for additional legislation,” Clayton said during the hearing.
Ramped up oversight and tough words from regulators across the globe have had an impact on Bitcoin, the biggest digital currency. It has tumbled for five-straight days, and dropped below $7,000 on Tuesday for the first time since November. Giancarlo said the falling price reflects regulatory actions taken in recent weeks.
But there are limitations to the SEC and CFTC’s reach. To the extent that virtual currency exchanges are policed at all in the U.S., they are governed by state rules designed for money transmission services. Authorities have become increasingly concerned in light of recent events such as the admission by a Japanese exchange that it had been robbed of more than $500 million in digital tokens.
Giancarlo and Clayton, Trump administration appointees who took office with mandates to dial back regulation, are trying to balance a desire to promote the kind of innovation that blockchain technology represents against the need to protect investors. At Tuesday’s hearing on virtual currency oversight, they sought to assure lawmakers that they’re doing both.
The SEC has been focused on so-called initial coin offerings, which Clayton has said are often securities offerings that should be registered with his agency. To date, none have completed that process, Clayton said. He added that he believes many ICOs are done illegally. In the offerings, companies sell digital coins that investors are supposed to be able to eventually redeem for goods and services. ICOs raised an estimated $3.7 billion last year.
‘Off the Grid’
The CFTC identified Bitcoin as a commodity in 2015 and has used its anti-fraud authority to bring enforcement cases against platforms offering Bitcoin trading. The agency is also charged with overseeing Bitcoin futures contracts after two exchanges brought them to market last year.
Giancarlo said the CFTC’s authority is largely limited to derivatives markets. He noted that spot market exchanges, where much of the trading occurs, doesn’t fall under any federal regulators’ jurisdiction.
“There was this perception that Bitcoin was off the regulatory grid,” Giancarlo said during Tuesday’s hearing. “One of the things that Chairman Clayton and I have been working so hard to do is disabuse that notion. We are limited in our regulatory authority to set regulatory standards on these underlying platforms. But, when it comes to enforcement, when it comes to ICOs, we’re using core authority to drive the message.”
Giancarlo added that the CFTC is preparing to bring more enforcement actions against fraudsters who have raised money from investors through digital coin scams.

1629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>","This Is a Global Equity Maelstrom, Not a Bond Tantrum. For Now","(Bloomberg) -- Don’t blame bonds for the spike in stock market fear gauges.
While the latest stock rout followed a surge in U.S. Treasury yields last week, volatility in the rates market remains contained, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. The bank’s MOVE Index, a gauge of price swings in the U.S. Treasury market, rose to the highest level since May 2017 -- a muted advance relative to the equity panic. The S&P 500 was hit by the worst one-day decline since 2011 while the CBOE Volatility Index surged to its highest level since August 2015.
With U.S. Treasuries benefiting from haven bids, the modest uptick in interest-rate volatility suggests stretched positioning in stocks spurred the global selloff -- rather than panic over higher U.S. yields, according to the index provider.
“While many suggest this shock was driven by concerns of inflation leading to faster than expected policy normalization (the right thing to be concerned about in our view), rates have been incredibly stable compared to past bond-led shocks such as the taper tantrum,” strategists led by Benjamin Bowler wrote in a note.
On Tuesday, three-month options on 10-year Treasury futures rose the most since November 2012. Even with that advance, the index is back to September 2017 levels, after hitting a record low in December.
Meanwhile, U.S. 10-year breakevens Monday dropped the most since July last year on a closing basis, and are little changed Tuesday, suggesting a fresh repricing of inflation expectations may not be the proximate cause for this week’s rout.
“Key to understanding whether this is a short-term technical equity selloff, which quickly reverses, or the beginning of something bigger, lies in where rates vol goes from here,” Bowler and team wrote.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 11:27AM ET</span>","After profit beat, GM looks to trucks, SUVs to rev up margins","By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Tuesday a richer mix of full-size pickups and mid-size SUVs in North America should help it offset higher commodity costs in 2018 and maintain pretax margins above 10 percent.
The automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly results as cost cutting and higher vehicle prices offset a double-digit decline in U.S. sales volume, and it predicted 2018 would be a strong year globally and in North America. GM shares rose 3.8 percent to $41.03 in late morning trade.
Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts that GM expects its financial performance to ""accelerate further in 2019,"" when the company launches redesigned heavy-duty pickups and full-size SUVs in North America, as well as a new family of low-priced compacts in emerging markets.
Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said GM's capital spending will remain at about $8.5 billion through 2019, then should start to ease. He said GM expects to generate free cash flow of $5 billion in 2018, with as much as $2.8 billion available for additional share repurchases.
Stevens said despite recent stock market volatility over concerns the U.S. economy may be overheating, the No. 1 U.S. automaker is ""not overly concerned about inflation.""
""Our forecast is premised on continued growth in the U.S. economy,"" Stevens said. He said GM expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 75 basis points in 2018.
Detroit-based GM's global pre-tax margin rose to 8.2 percent in the quarter versus 6.5 percent in the same quarter in 2016. Its North American pre-tax margin was 10.7 percent.
GM said results improved across all segments and its South American business had returned to profitability in the second half of 2017.
The solid performance from GM underscores the current struggles of cross-town rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) to boost its own profitability. Ford's fourth-quarter automotive operating margin fell to 3.7 percent, from 5.7 percent a year earlier.
Another GM rival, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Japan's biggest automaker, said on Tuesday it expects a weaker yen to lift net profit to a record high this year, offsetting sluggishness in the United States where it has grappled with lower sales and steeper discounting.
GM's results came despite an 11 percent decline in wholesale vehicle sales in North America in 2017. The automaker cut its inventory of unsold vehicles during 2017 with production halts, addressing a concern for the industry. 
Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said ""GM has done a very nice job,"" but added he will be watching ""to make sure they keep their vehicle mix and maintain pricing."" 
Another thing to keep an eye on with GM is its plans to roll out electric vehicles and self-driving cars, ""which will require quite a bit of investment,"" Windau said.
EXIT FROM SOME MARKETS
GM also exited some markets in 2017, pulling out of India and parts of Africa, and selling its Opel/Vauxhall unit in Europe to France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP).
In a call with analysts, Stevens said GM's struggling operations in Korea may require ""additional restructuring.""
The automaker's results come as overall U.S. auto industry new vehicle sales are in decline. Sales fell around 2 percent in 2017 after hitting an all-time record in 2016. Sales are expected to fall around another 2 percent in 2018.
GM reported a fourth-quarter loss of $4.9 billion or $3.46 per share, compared with a profit of $2.1 billion or $1.36 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM posted earnings per share of $1.65. On that basis analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.38. 
The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will record a $7.3 billion non-cash charge for its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings related to deferred tax assets that will lose their value because of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate.
GM said last month it expects 2018 earnings will be largely flat compared with 2017 and forecast higher profits in 2019. For the full-year 2017, GM reported earnings per share of $6.62, above its forecasted range of $6 to $6.50.

GM said as part of its profit-sharing agreement with the United Auto Workers union, its roughly 50,000 hourly workers would receive up to $11,750 for 2017, a bonus that will be paid out on Feb. 23.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 11:16AM ET</span>",Wall Street drops in volatile trade after steep falls,"By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading on Tuesday, as a pullback from record highs steepened following the biggest one-day declines for the S&P 500 and Dow in more than six years.
Major indexes swung up and down after starting the session 2 percent lower, underscoring a return of volatility to a market that until recently had been known for the absence of such major shifts.
The sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback long-awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent.
“Put your seatbelts on. It’s going to be a volatile ride for the next several trading sessions,"" said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey.
“Fundamentals are moving forward in a positive way, which gives us confidence that in the long run you’ll continue to see higher highs within the markets.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.37 points, or 0.14 percent, to 24,311.38, the S&P 500 lost 7.95 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,640.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.12 points, or 0.25 percent, to 6,950.41. 
The market's pullback comes amid concerns about rising bond yields and higher inflation. These were reinforced by Friday's January U.S. jobs report that prompted worries the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected this year.
""You continue to have investors re-rating stocks based on higher inflation and higher interest rate expectations,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
Tuesday brought another day of volatility a day after a steep selloff that brought the biggest percentage daily declines for the S&P 500 and the Dow since August 2011 and a near 1,600 point intraday loss for the Dow.
At its session low on Tuesday, the S&P had declined 9.7 percent from its Jan 26 record high. At its lowest point on Tuesday, the Dow was off 10.7 percent from its Jan 26 record.
Market experts said the selloff, including the overnight slide in S&P 500 futures, may have been magnified by the violent unwind of a trade betting on volatility in U.S. stocks staying low as the CBOE Volatility index, known as the VIX, notched its biggest one-day jump on Monday in over two years.
""If this is just the implosion of shorting volatility, it's not the end of the bull market,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.

""People will be afraid now of shorting volatility. It'll change the complexion of the market. It takes away what many considered to be easy money.""

1642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 11:03AM ET</span>",Every Market Rout Has Its Cassandras. This One Is No Exception,"(Bloomberg) -- It was one of the best advertised stock-market selloffs in history.
For weeks -- months, even -- prophets of doom have been warning about sky-high equity valuations and investor complacency, as evidenced by historically low volatility. Acting on those forebodings, however, was a different matter.
“The few investors that are talking about risks aren’t really acting on them,” said Simon Raubenheimer, a portfolio manager at Cape Town-based Allan Gray Group Ltd. who oversees the equivalent of about $1.3 billion in four equity funds, on Jan. 31. “That’s the big-picture worry for us.”
Other investors sounded similar warning bells. On Jan. 19, Gavekal Research Ltd. founder and chief economist Anatole Kaletsky said bond yields were entering a danger zone for equities and stocks would suffer a “deep correction” should they head toward 3 percent. That was when U.S. Treasury rates were nearing 2.6 percent -- they have since climbed to as high as 2.88 percent.
Read more here on what’s behind the global equity selloff
Bloomberg reported on Jan. 25 how some emerging-market investors were turning their focus to strategies to avoid losing returns reaped in the past two years of booming equities. Amundi SA, Congest SA and Investec Bank Plc were among those -- but none recommended shedding stocks for safer assets.
The list goes on and on.
Even policy makers joined the chorus. A “reappraisal of investors’ view about future risks to global inflation may cause a correction of global risk premia,” European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said as recently as last week.
The question now, of course, is whether this is merely a temporary pullback or the start of a prolonged selloff. There is no shortage of answers.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 10:42AM ET</span>","Bond bears smell blood, others claw for buying opportunity","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of the biggest U.S. investors believe the bond market has slipped into a bear phase. Others believe it has turned into one of the best buying opportunities in years.
Pimco, one of the world's largest bond fund managers, and widely followed Guggenheim Partners are among the investors who say benchmark 10-year Treasuries yielding 3 percent - now within reach - are too hard to resist. Other players, such as Wall Street bond king Jeffrey Gundlach, see a lot more selling pressure to come. 
""Valuations are beginning to look more interesting,"" said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co, known as Pimco, which oversees more than $1.75 trillion in assets. ""We can see some further weakness in rates, especially the first half of year. But we still see limited upside for yields from here.""
Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim, who helps oversee more than $260 billion in assets, agreed. ""We’re waiting for 3 percent,"" he said. ""We definitely will add there. No one will perfectly time the bottom."" 
Investors have already pounced on bonds even below the 3 percent level. 
On Monday, investors rushed into Treasuries as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average nosedived more than 4 percent - reversing a move on Friday when a spike in bond yields, which move inversely to prices, triggered an equity rout. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury ended the session at 2.71 percent, down dramatically from 2.852 percent on Friday, the highest level since January 2014. 
The flight to safety trade moderated in early trading Tuesday, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury rising back to 2.86 percent, once again hitting four-year highs. Some investors expect the move to be long-lasting: Inflationary fears, strong economic data and an announcement of bigger Treasury auctions have and will continue to drive yields higher, they say.
Indeed, the 10-year Treasury yield hit a four-year high on Friday after the latest monthly U.S. jobs report showed solid wage gains, effectively confirming an expected rate increase at the Federal Reserve’s next meeting, in March. 
Investors have been bracing for such moves in Treasuries.
Yields in the $14 trillion market for U.S. government debt touched record lows in 2016, driven by years of aggressive central bank intervention in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis to keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy. 
Now, as the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates three times this year and as some economists predict that the European Central Bank will start to raise rates later this year, investors are grappling with the effects of prolonged rising rates for the first time in nearly 10 years.
With inflationary pressures and massive budget deficits having become the topic du jour this year, the bond-market ""vigilantes"" term has made its way back onto trading floors.
The term ""bond vigilantes"" was coined by Ed Yardeni, the longtime Wall Street strategist now president at his namesake research firm. Yardeni was describing the demand by investors in the 1980s for high yields to compensate for the perceived risks of inflation and budget deficits. 
All told, the jump in Treasury yields has yet to make its way into the broader economy in the form of higher borrowing costs, yet it will likely start to dampen the housing and auto markets as consumer loans become more expensive, said Gary Cloud, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund. That, in turn, will make it less likely that the Fed raises rates more than three times this year, he said. 
""We're not haters of the bond market here at all. Treasuries look very cheap compared to other income classes"" such as high-yield credit or mortgage debt, he said. 
TECHNICAL SIGNS
Not all prominent bond fund managers are buying in. Billionaires Bill Gross and Ray Dalio believe the bond market is at the beginning stages of a bear market.
Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, told Reuters on Saturday that it is ""hard to love bonds at even 3 percent when GDPNow for Q1 2018 is suggesting annualized nominal GDP growth above 7 percent,"" referring to a new indicator of economic growth from the Atlanta Fed. 
Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year note yields have broken above a long-term downtrend in effect since the 1980s, which some technical strategists see as a bearish indicator going forward. If yields continue to rise, it could further confirm the breakdown of the more-than 30-year bull run. 
Paul Ciana, a technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), sees the next major support level for 10-year notes at around 2.95 percent, the 150-month simple moving average, which they last touched in 2007. A break above that could lead the yields to next test 3.28 percent, the 200-month simple moving average, which has not been reached since 1989. 
Ciana sees a monthly close above 3.03 percent as technically confirming a so-called double bottom, which is when yields retest a previous low and which can signal a trend reversal. A close above that level could send the benchmark yields ""well into the mid-4 percent area,"" Ciana said in a report on Monday.
Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he would be a buyer when the yield curve inverts. 
The yield curve - the plot of all of the yields on Treasury securities of maturities from four weeks to 30 years - is used as a signal of economic health of the economy. An inverted curve, when short-term yields are higher than long-term ones, has served as a classic precursor of economic recession.

""If you're a bond investor you'll lose much more sleep than equities,"" said Bernstein.

The S&P 500 was down four points or 0.17% to 2,644.52 as of 10:20 AM ET (15:20 GMT) while the Dow composite decreased 51 points or 0.21% to 24,294.28, after falling nearly 2.00% when markets opened and tech heavy NASDAQ Composite was up 41 points or 0.60% to 7,009.06.
The Dow lost over a 1,000 points at the close on Monday, as inflation concerns pushed stocks down. The negative movements started on Friday after a report showed that U.S. wages increased at its fastest pace in eight and a half year.
Bond yields rose after the report, as investors grow concerned that inflation will rise and the Federal Reserve will interest rates more than expected next year. The 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.758% while the 30-year Treasury note decreased to 3.047%. The movement in bond prices has contributed to market volatility. As bond yields rise, prices fall.
Technology and healthcare stocks were among the biggest gainers. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surged 2.00% while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) increased 2.23% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) inched up 1.51%.
Meanwhile General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose 5.34% after its fourth quarter results were better than expected. Bank stocks also rallied, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) up 1.74% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) increasing 2.25%.
Elsewhere,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) inched down 0.10% amid lingering concern that the Fed had put a growth cap on the firm until it addresses its governance plans. Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) was down 0.98% ahead of reporting its fourth quarter earnings results later in the day.
In Europe stocks were down. In Germany the DAX fell 221 points or 1.75% while France’s CAC 40 decreased 102 points or 1.93% and in London the FTSE 100 lost 121 points or 1.66%. Meanwhile Spain’s IBEX 35 fell 209 point or 2.08% and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 inched down 67 points or 1.95%.
In commodities, gold futures fell 0.27% to $1,332.90 a troy ounce while crude oil futures fell 0.48% to $63.84 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, gained 0.28% to 89.82."

The bank said Tuesday that it saw an ""irrevocable call notice"" on the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, or XIV, in which it was the largest investor.
The exchange-traded note is designed to return the inverse performance of CBOE's volatility index, or VIX, which saw its largest increase on record Monday amid a 4%  plunge in stocks.
The VIX reflects traders' expectations for rough patches in the stock market, and usually trades in the opposite direction to the S&P 500. As stocks surged to new highs last year, the VIX fell to record lows, benefitting the products designed to rise when it falls. 
In its notice, Credit Suisse said it will no longer issue new units of the exchange-traded notes, and expects that its last day of trading for XIV will be on February 20. The following day, investors will get a cash payment per ETN equal to XIV's value, Credit Suisse said. 
On Monday, the XIV, along with the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) wiped out nearly $3 billion, according to Macro Risk Advisors. Both had profited from the market's calm in 2017."
1648,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 10:06AM ET</span>",Dividend plays on slippery ground as bond yields steepen,"By Rushil Dutta
(Reuters) - After a decade of easy-money policy that cut bond yields to almost nothing and lifted U.S. stock markets to records, companies that pay big dividends now look among the most exposed as Federal Reserve interest rate rises pull returns on government debt higher.
A third day of losses for stock markets on Tuesday added to worries over the fate of a stocks bull market stretching back to the global financial crisis of 2008-9.
That has only added to concerns over equity income plays, which targeted high-dividend stocks as an alternative form of ""fixed income"" to record low-yielding bonds. 
The S&P 500 dividend yield has been at around 2 percent for the past nine years, drawing investors looking for dependable returns. For major utilities it has been far higher and currently is about 3.7 percent.
But as 10-year Treasury yields get closer to those levels, the rationale - given the higher risk involved and lower leverage - starts to evaporate.
Utilities (SPLRCU), a bellwether of bond proxies, and its defensive peer the real-estate sector <.SPLRCR>, have fallen nearly 11 percent and 8 percent, respectively, since early September - against a near 8 percent growth in the broader market (SPX).
That corresponds with the moment U.S. Treasury yields began their ascent, with 10-year paper (US10YT=RR) now at about 2.7 percent after hitting a four-year high following strong U.S. jobs data last week.
""Given that for a long time the dividend yield on the S&P 500 was higher than the 10-year treasury yield, investors had gravitated from bonds to equities and their income,"" said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at Chicago-based BMO Private Bank.
""That is no longer the case. The higher yields go, the more competition there will be for equity income investing.""

BLOATED VALUATIONS
Not all dividend plays are equal, however. 
The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (K:SCHD), one of the biggest exchange traded funds providing exposure to dividend ""aristocrats"" – stocks which have 25-year histories of annual dividend raises – is up about 9 percent, outperforming the broader market slightly.
The top 10 holdings in the Schwab ETF, constituting nearly 44 percent, range from technology heavyweights like  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) to Verizon (N:VZ) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), among other Dow 30 members. 
The PowerShares International Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF (O:PID) - which tends to include companies with shorter, 10-year histories of raising payouts - for comparison is up just 1.1 percent in the same period.
Telecom stocks have also fared better than their defensive peers, rising 5 percent, helped by a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 7.45 that is at the bottom end of its historical range and much cheaper than the broader market.
By contrast, the utility sector's price-to-earnings ratio of 18 has been bloated by another year of stellar gains for Wall Street, trimmed only slightly by three days of dramatic falls. 
""Those of higher valuation have more vulnerability to the downside as yields continue to tick up,"" said Jason Ware, Chief Investment Officer at Utah-based Albion Financial Group.
""There are spots in the utility market; (stocks that are) trading at 18 to 21 (price-to-earnings), where they ought to be trading at 13 to 14."" 
Ratings agency Fitch last month said that many regulated utilities companies would also have to reduce how much they charge customers to reflect new tax rates.
That coupled with a deferred tax charge stemming from December's new tax bill is expected to squeeze credit in the capital-intensive sector, the agency said.
""After several false alarms 2018 finally might be the year where we move (interest rates) beyond 'Lower for Longer' and back towards more of an 'Old Normal',""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a recent note.

""To the extent that involves higher yields, chances are it would also bring back lower utility stock valuations.""

The stock-market turmoil may have been painful for investors with short-vol positions as VIX is soaring. Yet, once that positioning is unwound, volatility-selling strategies should come back into play.
For one, S&P 500 realized volatility at 18 percent simply doesn’t justify VIX at 50 -- a level that implies consistent average daily fluctuations of over 3 percent in the U.S. stocks index. Compare that with actual average swings at just 0.07 percent over the past year, and it becomes clear it’s only a matter of time before option sellers fade these extremes.
Furthermore, the current volatility spike has much to do with market structure, with VIX futures likely driven higher by the rebalancing of VIX exchange-traded products following the systemic selling of volatility tails in this bull cycle.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), the country's largest meat processor, has invested in Tovala, a startup company that makes internet-connected steam ovens for ready-to-cook meals as it expands beyond its traditional markets.
Tyson Ventures, its $150 million venture capital arm, joined other investors in the deal raising funds for Chicago-based Tovala, which uses bar-code technology in meal preparation. Tovala will use the money for marketing, product investment and expansion.
David Rabie, Tovala co-founder and chief executive officer, said the ovens will make it easier for people to eat at home by controlling the experience including the hardware, software and food without sacrificing convenience, health or taste.
Tovala provides a steam oven and delivers ready-to-cook meals, and the customer scans a bar code with a smart phone to cook the meal.
Last month, Tyson said it invested in Memphis Meats, a startup that grows meat from animal cells. Late last year Tyson increased its stake from 5 percent in plant-based protein producer Beyond Meat, but did not say by how much. 
The financial terms of the Tovala deal were not disclosed. 
""We're a protein company now and with that comes a whole host of new spaces to look at and opportunities to consider, if you think about that in the framing for what we're going to ultimately focus on,"" Justin Whitmore, Tyson's executive vice president of corporate strategy and chief sustainability officer, told Reuters.
Whitmore said the deals with the alternative protein startups does not mean Tyson is moving from its traditional meat roots. 
""Growth in protein implies there could be new alternatives emerging and that's where you see some of our investments in the cultured and veg-based meat spaces and our protein space as well,"" said Whitmore.

(This version of the story corrects to show that amount invested in Tovala was not disclosed and that $150 million is the size of the venture capital arm)

1652,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",Correction Or Conclusion For Bull Market In Stocks?,"Investing.com - Investors may be excused for not knowing what to make of the staggering two-day stock market selloff.On the one hand, Wall Street firms have been calling for a correction in the relentless rally for quite some time.On the other hand, the most recent Bank of America/Merrill Lynch fund managers survey showed most see the rally running into next year.Don't be confused by the two. The Dow Industrials' enormous decline Monday was the biggest in history based on the number of points -- 1,175 -- but on a percentage basis, there have been a few bigger, including the crash of 1987.Along with the Dow's big loss last Friday, the benchmark index is down 8% from its recent record high.But that's still shy of the 10% threshold that qualifies as a correction.Corrections are common, and, analysts say, healthy events for stock markets, even if they are unsettling for investors.History shows the average bull market correction is 13%, taking place over four months time. It then takes about fourth months to recover those losses.The current bull market is the second longest on record.It's also the longest the S&P 500 had gone without a decline of more than 5% since the market crash of 1929.The recent spike in interest rates, which some are blaming for the selloff, has often spelled the end to bull markets in the past.So, this could be the beginning of a correction or the beginning of the end of the bull market.Investors may have to decide on whether to ride it out or take the money and run. "

Large speculators, by contrast, have been preparing for the return of choppy market conditions.
After cutting bets against Cboe Volatility Index futures for most of the weeks since the end of last year, they pushed the number of shorts outstanding to the fewest since November 2016, the latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The VIX surged as much as 35 percent on Tuesday and traded at 49.21 as of 7:52 a.m. in New York, a level that would mark its highest since the 2009 stock-market bottom if held through the close.
Though it’s likely few investors foresaw the maelstrom, they held record short wagers as recently as October as the volatility index headed for an all-time low the following month. For those with a glass-half-full disposition, the positioning data suggest Monday’s equity pain could have been a lot worse.
2017 was tough for anyone wagering on market turmoil as equity volatility kept on sinking, and traders turned their focus to the opposite strategy: going short volatility. That led to surges in the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN and ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, which almost tripled in value.
The move among hedge funds and large speculators to pare short exposures now looks foresighted. By contrast, the two securities saw inflows last week, including a record day for the VelocityShares note, known by its ticker XIV.
Their future is now uncertain, after plunges in the past two days, and both were halted on Tuesday pending news.
Here’s where volatility stands for major global indexes:

""It is important for us, there is no doubt we will increase investments,"" Dudley, himself a U.S. citizen, said in an analyst call after BP reported a surge in profits in 2017.
BP invested $90 billion in the United States over the past decade, excluding $65 billion in fines and clean up costs over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, making it the country's biggest investor in the energy sector, Dudley said.
""The regulatory system in the United States is suddenly so much easier. It was becoming an avalanche of regulations in every direction,"" he said. ""From a business community stand point this is quite transformational, there will be a lot of capital attracted to the U.S. because of that.""
BP took a one-off charge of $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, though it expects a long-term boost from the corporate-friendly rates.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:48AM ET</span>","Emerging markets suffer $4 billion outflows, biggest since U.S. election, IIF says","LONDON (Reuters) - Investors have pulled nearly $4 billion out of emerging markets since Jan. 30, according to data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) - the biggest slump since the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The bulk of the outflows came from equities, which have lost $3.4 billion since flows turned negative on Jan. 30, the IIF said. South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand suffered the worst losses. 
MSCI's benchmark emerging markets index has fallen over 6 percent since the start of the month and was set for its worst daily fall since November 2016 on Tuesday, tumbling 3 percent.
Investors have scrambled for the exits after data on Friday's showed the largest U.S. wage growth since 2009. That has fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates faster than had been expected, which would mean higher borrowing costs for emerging markets. 

""While we remain generally optimistic on EM flows this year, downside risks should not be understated,"" the IIF said. ""A sustained global equity market sell-off would clearly be one such downside risk.""

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Planemakers look at higher output to meet demand,"By Jamie Freed and Tim Hepher
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The world's largest planemakers signaled a possible increase in output of their most popular passenger jets on Tuesday, highlighting their confidence about growth in demand for air travel.
Although new orders have dwindled following a seven-year boom, executives at the Singapore Airshow suggested Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) have enough business in their bulging order books to speed up their already-record production of narrowbody jets.
""The success of the product is forcing us to look at any opportunities we have to improve the rate. We have not come to any conclusion yet but this is something we are looking at very closely,"" Airbus sales chief Eric Schulz told a news conference.
Schulz, making his first appearance since being recruited from Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) to replace retired sales chief John Leahy, shrugged off concerns about the ability of the supply chain to keep up with higher production rates.
""I think the supply chain will be able to cope and we will be able to raise rates as needed in the market,"" he said.
His comments match confidence from rival Boeing as the industry responds to growing demand for medium-haul jets. 
In an interview with Reuters, a senior Boeing official said the U.S. company was confident in demand for its 737 MAX jet, the latest version of which was rolled out on Monday.""There is upward pressure (on production rates) because we are oversold,"" Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said.
""If you want a (737) MAX today, we are talking 2023,"" he added, referring to long waiting times for new jets.
Just as airlines overbook seats, planemakers typically sell more aircraft than they plan to produce to protect themselves from airlines going bankrupt or failing to take delivery.
These comments show both planemakers are confident they can preserve an adequate buffer, even with higher output.
Engine maker CFM International, which supplies both Boeing and Airbus, said last month that planemakers had begun asking about its ability to support higher production.
Boeing currently produces 47 of its 737 narrowbody aircraft per month and is heading toward 57 per month next year. 
Airbus is increasing production to 60 per month by mid-2019.
Industry sources have said both companies are looking at increasing production to as much as 70 single-aisle jets a month. 
But the head of the world's largest aircraft leasing company is yet to be convinced that markets can support such levels.
""Can both of them go to 70? I don’t think so. 140 a month, I don't think that is possible at the moment,"" AerCap (N:AER) Chief Executive Aengus Kelly told Reuters when asked whether the market could support such levels of production.
Even so, he expected Airbus and Boeing, who make up the bulk of the $140 billion a year jet market, to exercise restraint.
""If the market can take it, they will give it. If the market won’t take it, they won’t,"" he said. 

""What is much more important for the manufacturers is not what they say they do, and not what the orders are but what they are delivering,"" Kelly said. ""If you look back over the last 20 years what you see is a very strong correlation between traffic growth and deliveries,"" he added.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Nissan to launch new all-electric Leaf in Asia-Pacific markets,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said on Tuesday it will launch the new version of its all-electric vehicle Leaf in seven markets in Asia-Pacific, and explore bringing it to two more, in its latest push to boost sales of electrified vehicles.
Lower-emission vehicles have become a major priority for the world's top automakers, who are poised to introduce dozens of new battery electric and hybrid gasoline-electric models over the next five years. 
Nissan, Japan's No. 2 automaker, will launch the model in Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand during the next fiscal year, and also explore introducing it in Indonesia and the Philippines.
The company is also looking at the option of bringing vehicles based on its ""e-Power"" gasoline hybrid technology to Southeast Asia.
""We are seriously planning. I want to find some good chance to announce some concrete timing in the market,"" Yutaka Sanada, Nissan's regional head, said when asked about the company's plans for ""e-Power"" technology in Southeast Asia.
He said the technology was a ""very good bridge"" to attract car buyers to try electric vehicles as it gave the experience of driving an electric car, but did not require charging stations.
Currently, electric cars account for a small portion of the market in Southeast Asia, due to low affordability and the lack of charging infrastructure. 
For example, the share of hybrid and electric vehicles in 2017 was less than 2 percent in Thailand and 0.4 percent in Indonesia compared with Japan's 27.3 percent, data from LMC Automotive shows.
Sanada said that while there were no immediate plans to produce electric vehicles in Southeast Asia, Nissan would consider local manufacturing depending on market growth.
""Once regional demand is to some size, of course in order to keep efficiency, we consider local production. It is normal for all manufacturers,"" said Sanada, a regional senior vice president at Nissan. 
He said the company was discussing a number of ideas, including the expansion of charging stations, with the government in Thailand, which is offering incentives to car manufacturers to localize.

Such discussions included potentially manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries in the country, but there were no concrete plans yet, Sanada said.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 06:13AM ET</span>","Stock sell-off overdue, investors lick their wounds and hunt","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - It had been a long time coming.
The speed of Monday's jaw-dropping sell-off on Wall Street had traders and investors bumped and bruised. But few seemed surprised that a pullback had actually happened. Some were looking for the right time and opportunity to wade back in - but wary of catching a falling knife.
""We finally got the correction we were all kind of figuring would happen,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""It feels a lot more painful only because we haven't seen it in 14-15 months or so, and it's certainly, from the way we look at it, healthy."" 
Stocks have been on a bull run since 2009, accelerated in the last year by strong earnings and the Trump administration's corporate tax cut. The S&P 500 rose 19 percent in 2017 alone. 
But with valuations sky high after the buying binge carried deep into January, something had to give. The down days started last week. The shakeout accelerated on Friday, with the S&P's biggest drop since September 2016 after jobs data raised the specter of inflation and spooked investors. 
Monday started out in the red, but calm. The afternoon was anything but, as frantic selling set in.
“The market panicked for whatever reason,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York said in the afternoon. ""The sharp reversals you saw in the last hour or so is recognition of the fact that things got overdone."" 
CATCH A FALLING KNIFE? 
The Dow briefly entered correction territory on Monday with a 10 percent dip from its Jan. 26 record. It ended down 4.6 percent on the day, while the S&P 500 fell 4 percent. 
Since the S&P's Jan. 26 all-time high it has fallen 7.8 percent. Of its 11 sectors, energy led the decline with a 10.5 percent drop followed by a 9.4 percent drop in healthcare and an 8.8 percent drop in materials. The best performer was utilities with a decline of just under 4 percent (3.97) followed by real estate which fell 5.1 percent and telecom, which fell 5.5 percent.
After the close of trading, equity futures traded sharply down, indicating another day of selling was ahead.
""If I were running a hedge fund, I wouldn't be rushing to buy; I'd be waiting,"" said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co in New York.
No S&P sector looked like a safe bet in the current environment. 
“I have a strong feeling that this sell-off is going to intensify because bears are seeing blood on the Street and all they want is right in front of them,” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, London
Even so, some investors went shopping as they kept their focus on strong economic data and earnings growth.
The utilities and real estate indexes performed better than the S&P on Monday, but with declines of 1.7 percent and 2.7 percent, the traditionally defensive sectors could hardly be called safe havens. 
These are considered bond proxies, and along with consumer staples and telecommunications, are seen as relatively safe in even the dourest markets due to their high dividend yields and predictable if slow growing earnings. 
But with interest rates rising, the dividend yields look less competitive compared with bond yields. 
That leaves some strategists talking up cyclical sectors such as financials, industrials, materials and technology as beneficiaries of a strong economy.
LOOKING FOR THE SAFEST BET 
""Right now there's no safe place to hide,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
However Pavlik said he bought stocks on Friday, and on Monday as he was banking on a continuation of strong economic growth and a rapid increase in U.S. earnings.
""This is not going to be a protracted sell-off. This is going to happen relatively quick because the economic numbers are still so good,"" he said. 
Since the S&P's financial sector fell 5 percent on Monday, some investors said they saw the decline as a buying opportunity as bank profits are boosted by rising interest rates because they can charge customers more for borrowing money.
""You have a great opportunity to buy financials here,"" said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. ""With a strengthening consumer that's going to continue to borrow and spend your best opportunity is in financials and technology.""
In particular Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , which fell 6.7 percent in the last two sessions, looked like a bargain to Blancato, who said he bought the stock Monday. ""Apple is getting very inexpensive."" 
While the broader market is punished by inflation anxiety, Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis says investors should buy stocks in energy and materials companies and in a diverse array of commodities to profit from rising commodity prices. 

""If commodities rise maybe stocks go down over all. Even energy and materials stocks might come down but they might outperform,"" said Paulsen.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",European shares hit six-month low as volatility shakes markets,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares hit their lowest level since August 2017 on Tuesday as a global sell-off in equities deepened and volatility spiked on growing worries over inflation and rising bond yields.
All sectoral indexes were trading in negative territory, pushing the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index to fall for the seventh straight session, down as much as 3.2 percent, while the euro STOXX volatility (V2TX) hit a 10-month high. 
The STOXX index recovered some ground and was down 1.8 percent by 1002 GMT, as confidence in the region's economic recovery partly offset concerns about the rising volatility. 
""Price action is clearly driven by technical factors, tied to a brutal awakening of stock volatility,"" said Alessandro Balsotti, head of asset management at JCI Capital Ltd. 
""Ultimately I think the robust economic phase will be able to withstand the bloodshed on volatility,"" he added. 
Wall Street fell around 4 percent on Monday, as investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation, although futures pointed to a rebound on Tuesday.
The sell-off followed a stronger than expected jobs report in the U.S. last week that fueled worries over inflation and concerns the Federal Reserve will raise rates at a faster pace than expected.
Although the steep declines on Wall Street from record highs spilled over to other markets, some investors believe European equities could outperform the United States as the region's economic and monetary policy cycles are at a less mature phase.
""It seems that the much-heralded interest rate rise has finally started. This is justified in the United States... but it is less justified in the euro zone, where interest rate levels seem excessive,"" Natixis strategists said.
""This correction is a buying opportunity,"" they added.
After a strong 2017, European shares rallied in January to reach their highest level in around 2 years on expectations that economic growth would boost company profits. February's pull back has pushed the STOXX 600 7 percent below the January peak.
Among the top fallers on Tuesday were Ocado (L:OCDO), down 6.6 percent, after the British online supermarket missed forecasts with flat full-year core earnings, while Babcock (L:BAB) declined 2 percent after lowering its revenue forecasts.
Among the biggest sectoral fallers were banks (Sx7P) and auto (SXAP) stocks which had benefited the most from the rally seen at the start of the year. 
Among the few stocks in positive territory, AMS (S:AMS) jumped 12.2 percent after the chipmaker reported a surge in fourth-quarter profit as the Austria-based group benefited from rising demand for the sensors it makes for smartphone producers such as Apple (O:AAPL). 
 Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) rose 1.7 percent after Italy's biggest retail bank pledged to halve its soured loans and grow revenue strongly while cutting costs under a new four-year plan. Traders said the market welcomed Intesa's dividend plans. 

Elsewhere,  BP  (L:BP) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) were lower after their earning updates.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2018 05:05AM ET</span>","Boeing signs nearly $1 billion of services deals, eyes $50 billion target","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing's services unit announced on Tuesday deals worth nearly $1 billion as part of its effort to more than triple the division's annual revenue to $50 billion in as little as five years.
The jet manufacturer has been looking to boost revenue in its services business which involves jet maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), data analytics and pilot training. 
Revenue grew by 5.5 percent to $14.6 billion in 2017 and the growth rate is forecast to be even higher this year, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Global Services CEO Stan Deal told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow.
""Over the next 5 to 10 years we are going to accomplish that as a stretch objective,"" he said of the $50 billion target, adding it will ""clearly involve"" acquisitions.
Deal said areas of interest for acquisitions included aircraft interiors and data analytics. 
The agreements announced on Tuesday included landing gear exchange deals with Japan's ANA Holdings Inc and Malaysia Airlines and an order from cargo group DHL for a 767-300ER converted freighter. 
The revenue split in the Dallas-based services division is about half military and half commercial services at present, but Deal said that balance was expected to shift toward commercial over time.

""Commercial is just more rapid because of the strong continued growth in commercial aviation and the continued strong growth projections particularly in the Asia-Pacific,"" he said.
