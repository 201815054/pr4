China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX two months ago after a crash in Ethiopia killed 157 people in March, in the second such incident for Boeing's newest aircraft. The U.S. air regulator expects approval for the plane to return to service as early as late June, sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Earlier this week, China's biggest airlines formally asked U.S. planemaker Boeing to compensate them for losses caused by the grounding and delayed deliveries of 737 MAX jets.
""We sincerely hope Boeing will place great importance to the compensation requests made by our member companies and offer solutions in a reasonable and legal manner,"" said CATA in a statement on its website on Friday.
The association represents 41 Chinese airlines including compensation claimants Air China Ltd, China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd and China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co Ltd.
""We will closely monitor developments and provide proactive and necessary assistance upon request from our member companies, to safeguard their legitimate and lawful rights and interests,"" the association said.
Chinese airlines had 96 737 MAX jets in operation before the grounding and were due to receive delivery of over 130 more this year, CATA said.
""As time passes, associated losses will further increase,"" it said.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - British Airways will resume flights to Pakistan next week a decade after it suspended operations following a major hotel bombing, becoming the first Western airline to restart flights to the South Asian country. 
BA halted service to Pakistan in the wake of the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in the capital Islamabad that took place during a period of devastating Islamist militant violence in Pakistan.
Security has since improved, with militant attacks sharply down in the mainly Muslim country of 208 million people, reviving Pakistan as a destination for tourist and investors.
""The final touches are coming together for the airline's return ahead of the first flight on Sunday June 2,"" British Airways said in a statement. It will launch a three-per-week service to London Heathrow, it said. 
""We're on board,"" Pakistani Civil Aviation spokeswoman Farah Hussain said about the flights resumption. 
BA, which is owned by Spanish-registered IAG (L:ICAG), will begin the London Heathrow-Islamabad service with the airline's newest long-haul aircraft, the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner.
At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (KA:PIAa) (PIA) flies directly from Pakistan to Britain, but its ageing fleet of planes is a frequent source of complaints by passengers.
Middle Eastern carriers Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates have a strong presence in Pakistan and have been eating into PIA's dwindling market share. Turkish Airlines also lays on a regular service to Pakistan.
Islamabad has been running international advertising campaigns to rejuvenate its tourism sector, which was wiped out by Islamist violence that destabilized the country following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
""We hope customers in both the UK and Pakistan will enjoy the classically British service we offer, with thoughtful bespoke touches,"" Andrew Brem, Chief Commercial Officer at British Airways, said in BA's statement.
BA said there will be a halal meal option in every cabin and the airline would also ensure sauces in every meal do not contain alcohol or pork.

5,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 03:13AM ET</span>","In Vietnam's booming energy sector coal reigns, but renewables play catch-up","By Khanh Vu and Henning Gloystein
HANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam has become a hot spot for energy investors eying a spend of up to $150 billion over the coming decade to meet surging power demand, with coal set to dominate despite signs of a government effort to go green.
With a population nudging 100 million and annual GDP growth around 7%, Vietnam has forecast power generation will need to rise from about 47,000 megawatts (MW) currently to 60,000 MW by 2020 and 129,500 MW by 2030.
(GRAPHIC: Vietnam power generation capacity - https://tmsnrt.rs/2X1Vzar)
To meet these targets the country will need to add more than neighbor Thailand's total installed capacity by 2025 and its electricity sector will likely be bigger than Britain's by the mid-2020s.
""Vietnam is a big growth story for the coal industry. Coal demand will be extremely strong,"" said Pat Markey, Managing Director of Sierra Vista Resources, a Singapore-based commodity advisory.
Once largely reliant on hydropower, the production hub for global companies such as Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) has turned to cheap but polluting coal to boost electricity generation. 
Vietnam's coal use in the five years to 2017 grew 75 percent, faster than any other country in the world, according to a research paper by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center on Vietnam. 
The country's current Power Development Plan (PDP 7) puts coal front and center to meet new demand.
While generation is set to double, PDP 7 forecast coal-fired generation would grow rapidly to 2030, with its share of the energy market rising from 33 percent to 56 percent.
But a change of emphasis that began in 2016 with a revised version of PDP 7 has started to embrace cheaper renewable energy, and analysts expect PDP 8, due later this year, to further adjust policy.
""One of Vietnam's priorities is to develop renewable energy sources to gradually reduce its reliance on traditional sources of electricity to protect the environment,"" Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Cao Quoc Hung said in a statement posted on the ministry's website earlier this month.
(GRAPHIC: Vietnam's changing power generation mix - https://tmsnrt.rs/2VOCz1K)
RENEWABLE WINDOW
Facing a rapid rise in pollution, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has started to offer incentives for renewables, which so far only play a marginal role in Vietnam's energy sector. 
According to a draft law planned for June, state-owned utility Vietnam Electricity (EVN), which distributes all of the country's power, will pay solar projects between 6.67 and 10.87 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
""There is very strong interest in solar due to the high level of feed-in-tariffs,"" said Dieter Billen of consultancy Roland Berger.
One of the first developers into Vietnam's solar sector has been Gulf Energy from neighboring Thailand, which this year has entered several long-term projects that will benefit from feed-in-tariffs.
Billen said there was also ""growing interest in wind power thanks to attractive feed-in tariffs"" of 8.5 cents per kWh for onshore and 9.8 cents per kWh for offshore facilities.
The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) in June will hold meetings in Vietnam's capital Hanoi, as it looks to drive growth in a new market.
Should government policy continue to support renewables and wind and solar become cheaper and better, Roland Berger's Billen said renewables could even challenge coal as Vietnam's biggest electricity source by 2030.
(GRAPHIC: Vietnam oil & coal imports - https://tmsnrt.rs/2LvIQeF)
COAL STILL KING
But whatever the long-term plans under PDP 8, Vietnam still needs quick fixes to meet demand.
""Vietnam is a country in the midst of massive economic growth, so they will need to expand their power capacity as fast as possible at manageable costs,"" said Sierra Vista's Markey, who sees projects already in the pipeline adding an extra 2.7 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity by 2020 to the 15 GW of coal-fired power already in place.
Power consumption hit a record 36,000 MW this month, close to the maximum available capacity, according to government data, while the government this week asked consumers not to set air-conditioners too low to help avoid blackouts.
The World Bank has said Vietnam needs to invest up to $150 billion by 2030, almost twice the $80 billion already spent on its power sector since 2010.
While Vietnam may struggle to finance the energy growth it needs and corruption remains a problem, businesses are anxious to enter the market. 
Germany's Siemens, one of the world's biggest makers of gas-fired power turbines, in April signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government that outlines future collaboration.
Gregor Frank, Siemens' Vice President for Large Gas Packages and Solution Businesses in Asia/Pacific, said the company was in ""early development and financing of equity or debt"" for large power projects.
In one of the country's most recent large energy deals, a consortium around Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) in April approved a $2-billion loan for a coal-fired power plant in Vietnam.
Sabyasachi Mishra, head of mineral sales at commodities trader Tata International expects Vietnam's annual coal imports to grow from 20 million to 30 million tonnes ""in the next one year or so"", particularly with domestic reserves in decline.
In the first four months of this year, Vietnam's coal imports more than doubled from a year earlier to 13.34 million tonnes, according to Vietnam customs data.
Markey said imports are forecast to peak at 80 million to 110 million tonnes between 2030 and 2040, against current demand of 63 million tonnes.
Such a surge would make Vietnam one of the last boom markets for what many otherwise see as a sunset industry.

6,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 03:12AM ET</span>",A pollution crackdown compounds slowdown woes in China's heartland,"By David Stanway, Philip Wen and Stella Qiu
ANYANG/SANGPO, China (Reuters) - For years, China's industrial heartland has been cloaked in smog, its waterways choked with pollution pumped from enormous clusters of factories churning out the mountains of cement and steel needed to build the Chinese economy.
Aiming to tackle what has become a huge public health problem, the authorities have cracked down on polluting industries, targeting provinces like Henan, which has a population of 100 million people and hundreds of factory towns.
According to interviews with factory and business owners, and consumers and workers across Henan, that crackdown - conducted with often heavy-handed local enforcement - is crippling the economies of towns and cities that depend on polluting industries.
Manufacturers across Henan have been particularly hard hit by the new environmental regulations, compounding the pressures the province faces from China's slowing economy and a grinding trade war with the United States.
It also highlights the trade-off China faces between providing a healthier environment for its citizens and maintaining economic growth in a province whose climb from poverty has lagged that of coastal regions.
China does not provide statistics on the costs of the environmental crackdown, but it has said that short-term pain will lead to long-term growth through an economic ""upgrade"".
The information office of the State Council, China's cabinet, did not respond to a faxed request for comment on the economic effects of the new restrictions.
It's difficult to get a full picture of Henan's economy from unreliable official figures, as it is for the whole country. Henan's official growth rate was 7.6% in 2018, higher than the national rate and down 0.2 of a percentage point from 2017. 
But the interviews conducted by Reuters across Henan suggest consumers are spending less, cities are struggling to retool their economies and the pollution crackdown is hurting businesses and employment. 
(Graphic: Henan's polluted industrial cities - https://tmsnrt.rs/2E8Nedx)
STEEL TOWN PAIN
The steel-producing center of Anyang, which has long had some of the worst air in China, is one place that has been hit hard by the anti-pollution campaign. 
The city of more than 5 million people, dominated by the infrastructure and insignia of the state-owned Anyang Iron and Steel Group, has forced local industry to upgrade equipment and curb pollution, and shut down companies that were unwilling or unable to comply.
Li Huifeng, president of Baoshun High-Tech Corporation, a coking coal company founded by his parents in 1983, said the cost of compliance had been painful.
Baoshun's huge plant, built in the hills in the west of Anyang, was forced to implement production cuts last winter even though it had installed low-emissions equipment that exceeded required standards.
""Last year, business was really good but this year it is full of uncertainties,"" said Li. He added that new efficiency guidelines were likely to result in the closure of many producers of coking coal, which is used in steel production. 
Li Xianzhong, the owner of the Xinyuan Steel Mill in Anyang's western outskirts, said he was facing curbs on production as well as spiraling costs because of the new environmental regulations.
According to industry estimates, environmental costs per ton of steel produced have risen to around 150 yuan per ton, up from less than 50 yuan per ton when the war on pollution was launched in 2014.
""All this equipment needs a lot of capital, and after you've invested, the operation costs are also higher,"" said Li. ""If you don't meet the standards, you aren't allowed to operate.""
Near the sprawling Anyang steel plant in the city center, residents and workers complained that the new environmental inspection rules had made it harder to make a living.
Many small workshops, which often use small metalworking furnaces, have also been targeted.
""Before we would just give them a pack of cigarettes or treat them to a meal and you'd then be fine for a year, but now it's no use,"" said a bicycle repairman, identifying himself by his surname Zhang, whose workshop near the plant was shut by inspectors.
Over the past years, Anyang has tried encouraging new and cleaner forms of economic growth. It has shut hundreds of small polluters in sectors like ceramics and cement, and tried to attract industries like solar panels and electric vehicles by offering incentives and building sprawling new industrial parks. 
However, it has struggled to compete with numerous Chinese cities making similar bets, especially as China's economy slows.
And the results of the anti-pollution efforts have been mixed. 
Steel still accounts for more than half of Anyang's economy – unchanged from a decade ago – and the environment is still bad. The taste of brimstone hangs in the air, and the fairy lights festooned on hundreds of cranes on the city's skyline could only be dimly seen during a recent visit.
Part of the problem, according to Liu Bingjiang, who heads the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's air pollution office, is that smog is also blowing in from neighboring industrial regions, undermining local cleanup efforts.
""All these measures, all these plans are in place, but it still can't solve the smog,"" said Li, the steel mill owner.
SHUTTING DOWN THE BOOTMAKERS
The anti-pollution campaign is also hitting much smaller industrial centers.
Sangpo, a dusty two-street village in northeast Henan, used to live off scores of sheepskin processing factories cranking out winter boots modeled on UGG, the American brand with Australian roots.
While the industry was the main employer in the village, that came with a heavy environmental cost: treating the raw sheepskin consumed copious amounts of water and contaminated the local water supply.
Last July, the government moved to close most of the factories, sending dozens of police cars into Sangpo with sirens wailing to enforce the shutdown.
Government inspectors were installed to keep watch at each factory to ensure compliance with the order. Three factory owners were arrested for violating environmental regulations.
During a visit to Sangpo by Reuters, most factories were idle during what should have been peak production season. Hundreds of workers had left town in search of work elsewhere, leaving behind shuttered shopfronts and deserted roads.
""The village is at a tipping point,"" said a former factory owner who only wanted to be identified by his surname, Ding. Most businesses were mostly ""more dead than alive,"" he added. 
Before the factories were shut, the village of 6,500 people, mainly from the Hui Muslim minority, had been punching well above its weight. 
It achieved national recognition as a thriving model of e-commerce, winning glowing write-ups in national newspapers after it was named in 2015 by the tech giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) as central China's very first ""Taobao village"" – a designation for top rural sellers on the company's internet retailing platform.
But that all changed last year as China's pollution crackdown intensified. The top county-level official, factory owners said, held a town hall meeting and threatened to shut everyone down permanently. A deal was made for 19 of the 135 factories to remain. 
Those wanting to stay open agreed to upgrade their businesses and invest in equipment to ensure they met water treatment standards. Factories that opted out were shut, their boilers and processing equipment destroyed. 
The government of Mengzhou, which oversees Sangpo, declined to comment when reached by phone. But Mengzhou's mayor said last year that the crackdown was necessary and in accordance with the popular will, according to a statement on the Mengzhou government website. 
Sangpo village's party chief declined to comment when reached via the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Calls to his cellphone went unanswered.
The county government's plan is to corral remaining factories into a new industrial zone by the end of the year. But remaining business owners are worried about the slow pace of construction and fear they will be forced to shut.
Ding, the former factory owner, said business owners didn't expect the crackdown – which has also discouraged lending from banks - to be so harsh.

""Everyone in the village was moaning and sighing but no one thought it would be this extreme,"" Ding said.  ""We are at our wits' end.""

Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been keeping most investors on tenterhooks, but not Tiffany Hsiao of the more than $30 billion Matthews Asia.
Hsiao positioned her fund for a “self-sufficient” China years before the spat escalated, anticipating the mainland’s rise would permanently damage trust between the world’s two biggest economies, the stock picker said. Her top bets include greater Chinese chipmakers, software firms and biotechnology companies.
Investment in promising local players in industries such as semiconductors “was our strategy and we were well-positioned more than five years ago,"" Hsiao, the San Francisco-based portfolio manager of a fund of small-cap stocks, said in an interview. ""Now the companies that we invest in are really benefiting from the escalation in the trade war.""
Last week, the U.S. banned Huawei Technologies Co. from purchasing technology from American companies. It’s also considering prohibiting five other firms from buying U.S. components, people familiar with the matter said earlier.
These moves will encourage Huawei and others to localize their supply chains, according to Hsiao. Companies in homegrown industries will prosper as “China strikes to domestically source,” she said.
‘Domestic Champions’
Chinese firms can easily tap “up-and-coming domestic champions” if U.S. suppliers aren’t an option, Taiwan-born Hsiao said. Semiconductors, software and biotechnology are the ""next trillion dollar industries coming out of China,"" she said.
Hsiao’s China Small Companies Fund counts Taiwan-listed analog chipmaker Silergy Corp. as its biggest holding, making up 6.8% of assets at the end of April, according to the fund’s latest fact-sheet. The stock has more than doubled since the start of 2014, beating a return of about 20% for Taiwan’s benchmark Taiex index.
The fund owns companies including Kingdee International Software Group Co. and China Youzan Ltd. as software investments. In biotechnology, it held stocks such as Hong Kong-listed Genscript Biotech Corp. and Innovent Biologics Inc. as of December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Manager Award
Hsiao’s fund, which had $61.4 million in assets at the end of April, is beating 71% of peers over the past five years, posting an average annual return of just under 8%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last August, she was ranked top female fund manager in the U.S. by Citywire in terms of risk-adjusted returns over the previous three years.
However, like many investors, Hsiao was buffeted by the sell-off in Chinese stocks last year. Her fund posted a loss of about 18%, versus a return of about minus 20% for her benchmark, the MSCI China Small Cap Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“In periods where the markets have positive returns, that’s when we really shine,” Hsiao said. The “downward correlation is still higher"" as investors tend to lose appetite for smaller shares during market downturns, she said.
China is now the world’s biggest small-cap market but there isn’t enough capital coming to the asset class, as most investors still think of emerging-market investing as limited to only large-cap firms, Hsiao said.
Matthews Asia, founded by Paul Matthews in 1991, is a U.S.-based firm dedicated to investing in Asia. It had $31 billion in assets under management as of April 30, according to its website.

9,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 23, 2019 11:30PM ET</span>",China’s Brightest Are the Trade War’s Latest Casualties,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It's college graduation season in China and the timing couldn't be much worse for the record-breaking 8.34 million students emerging from university this year. A slowing economy, hobbled further by the trade war, has produced the worst Chinese job market since at least 2015. Among the hardest hit will be the aspiring white-collar workers just now throwing off their caps and gowns. Applicants far outnumber jobs in big cities and salary expectations simply aren’t being met.
In recent days, state media has warned of a ""very complicated and severe situation."" That’s an understatement. For a government that derives legitimacy from its ability to deliver prosperity, burgeoning graduate unemployment raises serious questions about just how long China can afford to wage a trade war with the U.S.
China has struggled to find satisfactory employment for an ever-expanding number of graduates since the late 1990s. At the time, the average level of higher education in China was far below most other developing countries. So the government massively increased spending on institutions of higher learning. Between 1998 and 2004, the number of undergraduates in China increased from 3.41 million to 13.33 million. And the trend continues. In 2018, 28.31 million students were enrolled in undergraduate programs in China.
That growth has brought undeniable benefits. More widespread higher education has improved social mobility and led to the development of thriving entrepreneurial clusters around universities in cities such as Beijing and Shenzhen, among other benefits.
Unfortunately, it’s also had drawbacks. Between 2000 and 2005, the unemployment rate among college graduates increased 9%, largely due to the poor quality of the education students received and a mismatch between curricula and the skills demanded by employers. Ten years later, the unemployment rate had moderated: Only 8 percent of graduates were unemployed six months after graduating. But of those who found jobs, fully one-quarter earned less than the average migrant laborer, underlining a continued skills mismatch. Chronic underemployment remains a persistent problem.
This year, the situation is even grimmer, with actual unemployment looming for many. During the first three months of 2019, the ratio of job vacancies to job seekers declined to 1.68, from 2.38 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Zhaopin.com, China's leading online job recruiter, reported that its number of job listings declined 7.6% during the first quarter, while applications increased 3%.
The slowing economy isn’t only impacting export-oriented factories. One recent survey of approximately 40 firms that ordinarily hire college graduates found that 80% wouldn't be increasing headcounts in 2019. Well-paying financial firms were prominent among them.
Meanwhile, even before the latest U.S. curbs on Huawei Technologies Co. raised the specter of a tech cold war, Chinese technology companies were drastically cutting back as well. In February, ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing Inc. announced it would slash around 15 percent of its workforce; online retailer JD.com is reportedly cutting around 12,000 jobs and revoking job offers. Indeed, accounts of rescinded offers to graduates and industry job cuts are rife on social media and in the mainstream press.
The bleak employment picture hasn’t yet driven graduates into the streets. Aside from grumbling on social media or settling for less-than-ideal jobs, many are opting to ditch the dream of working in one of China's big cities for lesser-paying careers in smaller metropolises, where local governments are subsidizing housing and other expenses for transplants. Others are going back to school: A record 2.9 million people took China's graduate school entrance exams in December, up 21% year-on-year.
Still, the government can’t count on their forbearance indefinitely: As jobseekers come to terms with their shrinking employment possibilities, they’re inevitably going to look for scapegoats. Authorities are responding with emergency measures, including refunds of unemployment insurance to companies that don't lay off workers, subsidies for entrepreneurs and, as of this week, a cabinet-level working group to address the employment crisis.
These steps may help cushion the blow of the trade war. And, in the long run, China will need a better-educated work force if it is to fulfill its ambitions to dominate the industries of the future.
But, if the government is serious about boosting the prospects of its graduates, it also needs to invest more in vocational and polytechnic education, while working to improve internships and others skills training programs that prepare China's graduates for the jobs that employers are actually offering. While China may not be able to control the course of the trade war, it can at least train its soldiers more effectively."
10,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 10:16PM ET</span>",U.S. regulator sees approval of Boeing 737 MAX to fly as soon as late June: sources,"By Allison Lampert and David Shepardson
MONTREAL/FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expects to approve Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jet to return to service as soon as late June, representatives of the U.S. air regulator informed members of the United Nations' aviation agency in a private briefing on Thursday, sources told Reuters. 
The target, if achieved, means U.S. airlines would likely not have to greatly extend costly cancellations of 737 MAX jets they have already put in place for the peak summer flying season, but the FAA representatives warned that there was no firm timetable to get the planes back in the air.
American Airlines Group Inc, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and United Airlines suspended 737 MAX flights into July and August after the FAA grounded Boeing's best-selling jet in March following two crashes in the space of five months that together killed 346 people.
FAA and Boeing officials privately briefed members of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) governing council in Montreal on the 737 MAX on Thursday, the same day that the FAA's acting administrator Dan Elwell met with international air regulators for eight hours in Fort Worth, Texas. 
Laying out a potential schedule for getting the 737 MAX back in the air in the United States goes further than the FAA's public statements so far. 
Elwell declined to answer questions about the private ICAO briefing. ""The last thing I want is to put a date out there and then to have anybody, either the FAA, or you or the public drive to the date instead of the end result or the process,"" he told Reuters at a briefing with reporters after the Fort Worth meeting, which he called ""constructive."" 
He repeated previous statements that the FAA will not approve the plane for flight until it has completed a safety analysis, with no set timetable.
The path to getting the 737 MAX back in the air outside the United States remains even more uncertain. Canada and Europe said on Wednesday they would bring back the grounded aircraft on their own terms, not the FAA's.
Shares of Boeing, the world's largest plane maker, pared earlier losses on Thursday to close down 0.6% at $350.55. The stock has fallen about 17 percent since the second crash, of an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March, wiping about $40 billion off its market value. 
BLOCKS TO RETURN 
The FAA has said it will not reverse its decision to ground the plane until it sees the findings of a multi-agency review of Boeing's plan to fix software on the 737 MAX which the plane maker has described as a common link in the two crashes.
Boeing said last week it had completed an update to the software, known as MCAS, which would stop erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that automatically turned down the noses of the two planes that crashed, despite pilot efforts to prevent it from doing so.
Boeing has yet to formally submit the fix to the FAA and has not set a date to do so.
""Once we have addressed the information requests from the FAA, we will be ready to schedule a certification test flight and submit final certification documentation,"" Boeing communications director Chaz Bickers said on Thursday.
Even after the FAA lifts its ban on 737 MAX flights, airlines will have to spend about 100 and 150 hours getting each aircraft ready to fly again after being put in storage, plus time for training pilots on the new software, officials from the three U.S. airlines that operate the 737 MAX told Reuters.
Southwest, American and United provided estimates to Reuters after discussing the process with Boeing in Miami earlier this week.
FAA associate administrator Ali Bahrami said on Thursday it could take up to a week to return the planes to service following approval, noting that some grounded 737 MAX planes have missed scheduled inspections during the grounding.
On top of that, each airline must train its pilots on the new software. 
Boeing has said that simulator training is not necessary for the 737 MAX, and is recommending a mandatory computer-based course that explains MCAS and could be completed at a pilot's home in about an hour, according to pilot unions. 
Elwell said on Thursday that ""no individual country stood up and said we need to have sim (simulator) training."" The FAA has made no decision yet on what type of pilot training will be required. Each airline will be responsible for developing its own training plan once the FAA lays down guidelines. 
Simulator training remains a ""possible option"" for Canadian Boeing 737 MAX pilots, but it is too early to say whether it would be mandatory, a Transport Canada official said on Thursday night after the meeting in Fort Worth.
""It would be premature not seeing what Boeing has fully proposed yet to determine if simulator training will in fact be included,"" said Nicholas Robinson, the regulator's director general, civil aviation, told reporters on a conference call.
If the FAA hits its target of approving the 737 MAX to fly by the end of June, airlines may still have to adjust their schedules for the busy summer travel season.
United has removed the MAX from its flight schedule through July 3, Southwest through Aug. 5 and American through Aug. 19. 

For Southwest and American, that has meant more than 100 daily flight cancellations during the summer travel season. Both have said they will start using the aircraft as spares if they are ready to fly before those dates.

(Reuters) -  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM) said on Thursday that the mutual fund company is cutting 120 jobs, or about 12% of its corporate workforce, with the step coming only days after the appointment of Trian Fund Management LP's Nelson Peltz and Ed Garden as directors.
Most of the job cuts will be coming from shared services like human resources or finance, a Legg Mason spokeswoman told Reuters.
The job cuts were reported earlier by Bloomberg.
On Monday, Legg Mason had raised the size of its board to 12 members with the appointments of Peltz and Garden.
It had been reported that Trian might push for changes at Legg Mason to boost returns. 
Trian will identify a third independent director to be nominated at Legg Mason's annual meeting of shareholders.
Legg Mason has been targeted by Trian for the second time in a decade. Peltz first set his sights on the Baltimore-based company 10 years ago and ended up being offered a seat on the board, which he held until late 2014.
As have other mutual fund firms, Legg Mason has been hit hard by investors' shifting tastes for less expensive index funds offered by larger firms, including Vanguard Group.

12,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 09:13PM ET</span>",Exclusive: JPMorgan cuts ties with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) has cut ties with Purdue Pharma LP over the OxyContin maker's alleged role in the U.S. opioid crisis, forcing it to find a new bank to manage cash and bill payments, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
The move makes JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, the most high-profile corporation known to have distanced itself from Purdue and its wealthy owners, the Sackler family, amid thousands of lawsuits alleging the company pushed addictive painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks.
JPMorgan's decision also underscores a drive among U.S. banks to reassess their relationships with clients and industries in response to controversy and political debates over matters such as immigration detention and mass shootings.
After JPMorgan informed Purdue in March that it had six months to find another bank, Purdue tapped Dallas-based regional bank Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Inc to handle its financial transactions and accounts, the sources said. 
JPMorgan told Purdue that reputational risks associated with the public backlash against the drugmaker informed its decision to cut business ties, the sources added. 
While not a lender to Purdue, JPMorgan's commercial bank managed the company's cash and bill payments, according to the sources. It is not clear how long JPMorgan served as Purdue's bank.
""Purdue is a streamlined organization with an exciting pipeline of new medicines and significant cash reserves,"" the company said in a statement. ""The company has multiple banking relationships and will not have any interruption to its banking and financial service needs.""
JPMorgan and Comerica declined to comment.
Purdue faces roughly 2,000 lawsuits accusing the Stamford, Connecticut-based company, and increasingly the Sacklers, of aggressively marketing prescription opioids while misleading prescribers and consumers about risks from their prolonged use. 
U.S. states, counties and cities are seeking billions of dollars in damages to address harm from opioids. Nearly 400,000 people have died after overdosing on opioids between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half the deaths resulted from prescription painkillers. 
Purdue denies it contributed to the U.S. opioid crisis, pointing to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals of labels for the company's drugs that carried warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. Purdue and its family owners argue that heroin and fentanyl are currently more significant culprits in the opioid epidemic.
However, health experts have said many people turn to those drugs after first getting hooked on prescription painkillers.
In March, Purdue and the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with the state of Oklahoma, which on Tuesday is set to take two other drugmakers to trial over claims they also helped fuel the opioid epidemic. Dozens of other states have lawsuits pending against Purdue, and in some instances the Sacklers, who made a financial contribution to the Oklahoma settlement even though they were not defendants in the case.
A North Dakota judge earlier this month dismissed that state's case against Purdue. 
Purdue Chief Executive Officer Craig Landau in March said a bankruptcy filing remained an option for the company to address potential liabilities from widespread litigation.
LATEST TO SHUN
Various museums, universities and other nonprofits are now shunning donations or reassessing their relationships with the Sackler family, which has a long history of philanthropy. 
In New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has a wing named for the Sacklers, and the American Museum of Natural History, said earlier this month they had ceased accepting donations from the family.
For JPMorgan, dropping Purdue is the latest in a series of moves aimed at steering clear of political lightning rods. In January, the bank said it would stop financing operators of private prisons, which have become the target of protests over their role detaining undocumented immigrants. 
Its peers have made similar moves. In March,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's CEO at the time, Tim Sloan, told a congressional panel the bank was exiting relationships with private prison operators. 

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), meanwhile, last year placed restrictions on firearms sales for retailers doing business with the bank following the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. A Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executive said last year that the bank intended to avoid financing military-style firearms for civilians moving forward.

20,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 23, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Trump Says Huawei Could Become Part of Trade Deal With China,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that China’s Huawei Technologies Co., which was put on a blacklist earlier this month, could be part of a trade pact with the country.
“It’s possible that Huawei even would be included in some kind of a trade deal,” Trump told reporters at the White House, without providing details. “Huawei is something very dangerous.”
The Trump administration is seeking to choke off Beijing’s access to key technologies by limiting the sale of vital U.S. components to the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker over security concerns.
The U.S. had held off on blacklisting Huawei out of concern the move could disrupt trade negotiations with China and only took action after the last round of trade talks hit an impasse, according to people familiar with the matter. The decision to curtail the Shenzhen-based company’s access to American suppliers unfolded quickly once trade talks broke down, the people said.
The Commerce Department action last week requires American suppliers of Huawei, a crown jewel of Chinese manufacturing, to seek U.S. government permission to do business with the company.
The decision touched off a massive disruption in technology supply chains, hitting some of the biggest component-makers.  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc. told their employees they won’t provide products to Huawei until further notice.
Trade talks between Beijing and Washington deadlocked this month as Trump accused China of backing out of a deal that was taking shape with U.S. officials, saying China reneged on an agreement to enshrine a wide range of reforms in law.
Trump increased levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, prompting retaliation from Beijing. The U.S. has said it’s prepared to hit China with new tariffs even as Trump said he’ll meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at next month’s G-20 summit, an encounter that could prove pivotal."
21,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Boeing drops Embraer name from Brazil commercial jet division,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Thursday said that after taking over Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA's passenger jet unit, it will call the division Boeing Brasil - Commercial, dropping one of Brazil's most iconic company names. 
The name change comes after Boeing agreed to pay $4.2 billion to buy 80% of Embraer's operation making passenger jets with fewer than 150 seats. Embraer will retain a 20% stake. That division is still Embraer's most profitable and considered a gold standard of Brazilian engineering. 
Boeing has not made a decision yet about whether to rebrand the small and mid-sized planes, which currently carry the Embraer name followed by a model code.
The new corporate name underscores a realignment of the global aerospace industry in which two dominant manufacturers - Boeing and Airbus SE - strengthened their duopoly in the $150 billion jet market by absorbing weaker challengers.
After Airbus SE took a controlling stake in the CSeries division of Bombardier Inc, which competes directly with Embraer's commercial jets, it rebranded the planes Airbus A220, in line with the branding of other Airbus planes.
The twin takeovers effectively halted the aerospace ambitions of Canada and Brazil and left China as the main threat to the transatlantic duopoly, with Russia and Japan making slower inroads, analysts said.
The Embraer name holds special meaning in Brazil, evoking its founding in 1969 as a state-run company that grew into a national champion and was privatized in 1994. Embraer is short for Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica or Brazilian Aeronautics Company. 

After the deal with Boeing, Embraer will still exist as a company focused on executive jets and defense. The deal with Boeing has been approved by shareholders but is still waiting on regulatory approval.

1. Durable Goods on Tap
Durable goods orders will be the focus for the market before the bell.
The Commerce Department will report April orders for goods lasting three years or more at 8:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Durable goods orders are expected to have fallen 2% in April, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are predicted to have edged up 0.2%.
2.  Foot Locker  Profit Seen Rising
Athletic-wear retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) is the earnings report of note scheduled tomorrow as earnings season enters its fallow period.
The company will report quarterly results before the bell, with analysts looking for a profit of $1.61 per share and sales of about $2.1 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Quarterly comparable sale are expected to rise 5.7%, according to Briefing.com.
Last week, B. Riley upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, saying that the recent pullback in the stock made an attractive entry point for a best-in-class footwear retailer.
3. Rig Count Comes With Oil Looking at Weekly Loss
Oil took a beating today, falling nearly 6% as worries about a long-expended U.S.-China trade war combined with concerns about refinery activity to pressure the market.
American refineries have been uncharacteristically weak in their support of crude prices this year. Doing longer-than-expected plant maintenance and processing less crude than anticipated week after week, refinery owners have become a new source of frustration to oil bulls already reeling from stubbornly highly U.S. crude production.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped on Thursday as investors dumped shares of companies in growth and cyclical sectors, with energy and technology leading declines, on fears that the escalating U.S.-China trade war would stymie global economic growth.
Further fueling trade fears among investors, Beijing said that Washington needs to correct its ""wrong actions"" for trade talks to continue after the United States blacklisted Huawei Technology Co Ltd last week.
Among S&P 500 sectors, only utilities and real estate, both considered defensive areas, registered gains as investors moved to safe-haven assets such as Treasuries. Stocks pared losses in the last hour of trading, but Wall Street's major indexes all ended more than 1% lower.
""It looks less and less like there will be a near-term resolution to the trade war, and the market is obviously spooked on that,"" said Lamar Villere, partner and portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.
Shares of S&P 500 technology and industrial companies, two sectors that have been bellwethers of trade sentiment, fell 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively. Shares of S&P 500 companies in the cyclical financial and energy sectors also tumbled, with the 3.1% drop in energy shares leading losses among S&P 500 sectors.
A 5% plunge in oil prices in response to a dampened outlook for demand impeded energy shares, while a drop in 10-year Treasury yields, which hit their lowest level since October 2017, held back financial shares.
Adding to the downbeat mood in markets, data from IHS Markit showed U.S. manufacturing faltered in May, with new orders falling for the first time since August 2009.
""We're going to see a drift lower until there's a resolution of what's happening with China,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""If you're trading, it's not a bad idea to put yourself on the sidelines and sit it out.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 286.14 points, or 1.11%, to 25,490.47, the S&P 500 lost 34.03 points, or 1.19%, to 2,822.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 122.56 points, or 1.58%, to 7,628.28.
Stocks succumbed to selling pressure in May after Washington and Beijing engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs and other retaliatory measures, with the S&P 500 on track to post its first monthly decline since the December sell-off. 
Shares of NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP) tumbled 8.1%, the biggest percentage drop on the S&P 500, after the data storage equipment maker forecast current-quarter profit and revenue below Wall Street estimates.
L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB) shares jumped 12.8% after the owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.84-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 27 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 22 new highs and 189 new lows.

24,By Investing.com,"<span>May 23, 2019 04:32PM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Plunges on Trade, Growth Worries ","Investing.com - Stocks took a beating Thursday as investors worried that a U.S.-China trade war could drag on indefinitely and sap global growth.
The only good news was that the major indexes bounced off their lows in the last hour of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%. The S&P 500 slumped 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6%. At their lows, the Dow and S&P 500 had been off as much as 1.7% with the Nasdaq off 2.1%.
Stocks have succumbed to selling pressure in May after Washington and Beijing engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs and other retaliatory measures, with the S&P 500 on track to post its worst monthly decline since the December selloff.
Beijing said on Thursday Washington needs to correct its ""wrong actions"" for trade talks to continue after the United States blacklisted Huawei Technology last week.
In further evidence of the trade war hitting the U.S. economy, data from IHS Markit showed manufacturing growth measured its weakest pace of activity in nearly a decade and new orders fell for the first time since August 2009.
The Trump Administration outlined a $16-billion plan to help farmers offset the impact of the trade war on Thursday. Nonetheless, wheat prices, corn prices and soybean prices all fell.
The Dow was off as many as 448 points before bargain hunters started to buy across the market, cutting the day's losses to 286 points. The Dow finished the day looking at its fifth-straight weekly loss. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were looking at their third weekly losses in a row. The Dow is off 4.1% for May while the S&P is down 4.2% and the Nasdaq 5.77%. The Dow is is 5.4% below its 52-week high, reached in October. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are 4.6% and 6.7% below their 52-week highs, reached in April.
The selling was broad, with energy, industrial and technology shares taking the brunt of the selling pressure. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were two of the bigger drags on the Dow, along with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
In addition, oil prices fell nearly 6% in response to weak demand questions and related issues.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) each fell about 2.3%.
Interest rates fell and gold prices rose as many investors sought refuge from stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.296%, the lowest closing yield in two years.
Gold, meanwhile, rose $11.20, or 0.9%, to $1,285.40 an ounce and is up 0.3% on the year.
Among the days highs and lows:
L Brands (NYSE:LB),  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) were among the top performers in the S&P 500 on Thursday.
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), Hess (NYSE:HES) and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) were among the weakest performers.

25,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>","Best Buy keeps full-year view, warns of higher prices from more tariffs","(Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) on Thursday stuck to its full-year forecast due to the impact of the latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports and warned any new levies would increase prices for U.S. shoppers, sending its shares down as much as 5.4%.
The consumer electronics retailer's commentary on the impact of tariffs overshadowed its better-than-expected profit in the first quarter and solid second-quarter forecast. 
""The impact of tariffs at 25% (proposed to be enacted) will result in price increases and will be felt by U.S. consumers,"" outgoing Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly said in a conference call with analysts.
The world's largest retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc last week warned that its prices would increase due to higher tariffs, while Macy's Inc said higher levies were already hurting its furniture business. 
The proposed new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of goods from China includes higher levies on imports like smartphones and laptops and would likely result in higher retail prices. 
""In a maturing category like smartphones, which lacks a compelling reason for consumers to upgrade in the near-term, we expect to see volumes decline in response to higher prices,"" said Jason Benowitz, fund manager at Roosevelt Investment Group.
STRONG EARNINGS 
Gross profit margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter to 23.7%, as high margin services, such as ""Geek Squad"" that provides general tech support and advice on setting up smart homes resonate with customers.
An increasing share of Best Buy's sales also comes from online, where it has been investing more to beef up delivery and its ""click and collect"" business that helps shoppers buy products online and collect them later from the stores.
Domestic comparable online sales rose 14.5% to $1.31 billion, making up for 15.4% of total revenue in the quarter.
Excluding one-time items, Best Buy earned $1.02 per share in the first quarter ended May 4, ahead of analysts' average estimate of 86 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Best Buy forecast adjusted profit for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.95 to $1 per share, above Wall Street expectations of $0.96 per share. Its current quarter forecast for same-store sales too was largely above estimates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Thursday handed over the first of 1 million evidentiary documents to the lawyers of Roger Ng, a former Goldman Sachs banker facing criminal charges linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at the Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB. 
The U.S. Department of Justice handed over to Ng's lawyers a ""small subset"" of more than 1 million documents the government is relying on to prosecute the case, said Assistant United States Attorney Drew Rolle during a hearing at a Brooklyn federal court. 
The United States accused 46-year-old Ng last year of conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) handled. He was extradited on May 3 to New York from Kuala Lumpur, where he had been jailed since November.
Ng pleaded not guilty to the charges on May 6 and was released in exchange for a $20 million bond.
Prosecutors are working on how to best format and organize the remaining documents, which they will likely send to Ng’s lawyers on a rolling basis, Rolle said.
Prosecutors and Ng's lawyer, in a May 6 court document related to the case, had requested delaying the trial date for Ng because they believed plea negotiations ""are likely to result in a disposition of this case without trial.""
Government lawyers have said they hope to avoid a trial by reaching a plea deal though Ng's attorney.
“I’m not ruling anything out,” said Marc Agnifilo, Ng’s lawyer, to reporters after the hearing about a possible plea deal. “There is a full range of possibilities for a criminal defendant, and there are still options.”
Ng, who left Goldman Sachs in 2014, faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the three charges based on alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Malaysia's home minister wanted Ng to face criminal charges there first, but agreed to temporarily surrender him to the United States for 10 months, Malaysia's attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement.
The period may be extended, Thomas has said.
But that issue is for the U.S. and Malaysian governments to discuss, Agnifilo told reporters. 
“Given the complexity of the case, it’s going to require us to do a lot of work up front and as soon as possible,” Agnifilo said to reporters about the 10-month period.
Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Najib, who lost a general election last year, faces 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

34,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. airlines expect Boeing 737 MAX jets need up to 150 hours of work before flying again,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Once regulators approve Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX jets for flight, each aircraft will likely require between 100 and 150 hours of preparation before flying, officials from the three U.S. airlines that operate the MAX told Reuters.
The estimate, provided to Reuters by American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co officials, is the first indication of the time needed to bring the jets out of storage following a worldwide grounding in March spurred by deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. 
The preparations were discussed at a meeting between Boeing and MAX customers in Miami earlier this week, and include a list of items ranging from fluid changes and engine checks to uploading new 737 MAX software. The estimated time frame does not include pilot training, they said.
Southwest is the world's largest MAX operator with 34 jets, followed in the United States by American Airlines with 24 and United with 14. All three have dozens more on order, meant to service booming air travel demand.
Boeing did not comment on the airlines' MAX maintenance estimate, but spokesman Paul Bergman said the company's maintenance and engineering teams have been working with customers to determine how to efficiently stage work once regulators approve the fleet's return to service.
The process has included work with Boeing's supply chain to ensure key parts ""are available for current maintenance tasks and the fleet's transition from storage and preservation activities to operational flight,"" he said.
Airline officials stressed that jets would only be removed from storage once regulators approve Boeing's software update, meant to fix a system called MCAS that played a role in both crashes, which together killed 346 people.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Chief Dan Elwell, who is meeting with global regulators in Texas on Thursday, said on Wednesday there is no time table to approve the plane for flight.
Boeing has yet to formally submit the fix to the FAA.
Officials said it usually takes 80 hours to put one jet into storage. For removal, the process is reversed and requires additional maintenance work and testing. For the MAX, it will also include uploading and testing the software fix. 
PILOT TRAINING
The allotted 100 to 150 hours of jet preparation comes on top of the hours needed for pilot training. Regulators are still debating whether pilots should test the crash scenarios in a simulator, which would cost airlines more time and money than Boeing's proposed computer-based training. 
Boeing has said that simulator training is not necessary for the 737 MAX, and is recommending a mandatory computer-based audio course that explains MCAS and could be completed at a pilot's home in about an hour, according to pilot unions.
The planemaker has also offered supplemental training that includes a video on emergency checklists, though some regulators and pilots are pushing for either immediate or continuing simulator training.
Ultimately each airline will be responsible for developing its own training regime based on its different needs.
So far U.S. airlines have canceled MAX flights into July and August, taking a hit to revenues during the busy summer travel season, and will need to decide soon whether to extend cancellations given the uncertain regulatory timeline, officials said.
Southwest has parked its MAX jets at a facility in the California desert, while American has parked 14 of its 24 jets in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where it plans to prepare the jets for flight once regulators give the green light.
Boeing will also have to ready roughly 30 MAX jets that it is storing across the Seattle area, with wheels and engines wrapped in plastic, before delivering them to customers.

The planemaker is also storing MAX jets at a maintenance base in Texas. Deliveries were halted following the worldwide grounding.

36,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",Destination Milan: private equity firms spread wings to woo Italy clients,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Stephen Jewkes
LONDON/MILAN(Reuters) - Investment firms, including buyout fund EQT, are flocking to Milan to develop closer ties with Italy Inc, where cash-starved family-owned companies are increasingly seeking foreign capital to boost growth.
The search for real estate in the financial capital of the euro zone's third largest economy comes as uncertainty around Britain's departure from the European Union and lucrative tax incentives tempt Italian dealmakers living abroad to pack up and head home. 
EQT, the Nordic region's biggest private equity firm, will open an office in June in the heart of Milan, near the Duomo cathedral, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Similarly, London-based private equity firm THCP, which manages more than 1 billion euros of assets, is finalising plans to open a base in the city after the summer, to be led by partner Michele Prencipe, the sources said.
Alternative asset manager Hayfin Capital Management has also agreed to lease an office from June in the Brera district, boosting its European network which already includes London, Frankfurt and Paris among others, another source said.
EQT declined to comment while spokesmen at THCP and Hayfin confirmed the plans.
Milan started to emerge as a destination of choice for major private equity firms in the late Nineties, but after the boom years of 2005-2007 local teams were dramatically downsized, under pressure to cut costs during the financial crisis and with scarce opportunities for multi-billion euro deals. 
""Italy is one of our leading markets thanks to its large number of family-owned companies,"" said Astorg partner Lorenzo Zamboni who launched the fund's Italian office in September.
Paris-based Astorg - which focuses on mid-market investments and manages more than 8 billion euros of assets - clinched its first Italian deal in 2014 when it bought power transmission belts manufacturer Megadyne.
THCP - another mid-market investment firm which provides growth capital in exchange for minority stakes - has so far invested about 300 million euros in Italy and wants to use its Milan base to deploy more capital in the country. 
Founder and managing partner Mauro Moretti pointed to the large number of Italian companies which generate the bulk of their revenues abroad as a sweetspot for international investors.
""Their export-driven strategy is a unique and attractive feature,"" he said.
SILICON VALLEY OF BAD LOANS
Despite being active in Italy since 2015 when it announced plans to buy medical device firm Lima, EQT has so far managed its investments in the country from its Zurich and Munich offices. 
Now the Swedish firm, which is backed by the Wallenberg family via Investor AB, is looking to move three of its dealmakers to Milan this year, including managing director Federico Quitadamo who will oversee the Italian rollout, the sources said.
Credit-focused investors are also circling the Italian market, where local banks hold about 189 billion euros of soured loans.
""There is growing appetite for distressed deals in the country and no wonder investors are flocking to Milan,"" said a banker based in the city. ""Italy is the Silicon Valley of bad loans.""
Founded in 2009, Hayfin is one of Europe's leading alternative asset managers, investing in anything from non-performing loans and structured credit to real estate debt. It is actively growing its presence in Italy, eyeing a wide range of deals.
""We see attractive investment opportunities in both primary and secondary transactions and a growing role for private credit investors with patient and flexible capital,"" said managing director Stefano Questa.
""Our focus on Italy is not driven by near-term considerations, but instead is part of Hayfin's approach of building a sustainable, long-term presence in the major European markets.""
Italian banks have accelerated the sale of bad loans in the past two years, offloading debt with a gross value of 140 billion euros since 2017. Their focus is now shifting to 'unlikely to pay loans', which had a gross value of 83 billion euros in December.
Most credit investors in Italy tend to partner or take control of local debt servicing firms. U.S. hedge fund Elliott, for example, relies on its majority-owned Italian bank Credito Fondiario to manage the recovery of the non-performing loans it has bought.
But competition is fierce and investors want to stay close to local clients to prevail in auctions.
TAX PERKS
Generous tax incentives are also encouraging Italian investors to return to their homeland. 
An annual flat tax of 100,000 euros on all income from foreign investments, known as the non-domiciled tax regime, appeals to general partners of private equity and hedge funds whose compensation includes so-called carried interest (carry), which is a share of the funds' profits.
Algebris Chief Executive Davide Serra, who founded the London-based hedge fund in 2006, is among those who took advantage of the flat tax rate and moved back to Milan, a source familiar with the matter said.
Serra did not respond to requests for comment.
An existing 50% tax break for Italian workers returning from abroad has been hiked to 70% as part of the government's Growth Bill or Decreto Crescita.
The bill, which Parliament needs to approve by June 29, grants a more generous 90% tax break for five years to those moving to some Southern (NYSE:SO) regions. All incentives will be extended for a total of 10 years to those who buy properties in Italy or have children.
""If it goes through, this will be Europe's most attractive tax bill for country nationals living abroad,"" said Marco Cerrato, a partner at law firm Maisto e Associati which specialises in tax law from offices in Milan and London. 
""Most people relocating from cities like London are highly-skilled professionals who tend to bring business to Italy, open offices and recruit locally.""

50,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Clock ticking on efforts to find British Steel buyer,"By Maytaal Angel and Sangameswaran S
LONDON A(Reuters) - Time is of the essence if the UK authorities are to broker a rescue of British Steel after it collapsed into liquidation, putting 25,000 jobs at risk.
British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House has emerged as one potential bidder for the country's second largest steel producer, two sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The Financial Times reported that Chinese state-owned group Hesteel, which owns a steel plant in Serbia, and private equity fund Endless could also be bidders.
A buyer would need to be in place within 2-3 months at most as the business needs access to 400 to 500 million pounds of working capital and a cash injection in excess of 75 million pounds ($95 million), one of the sources said. 
Business minister Greg Clark said the government had been in talks with potential buyers of British Steel while the opposition Labour Party and trade unions have called for the steelmaker to be nationalized. 
Based in Scunthorpe, northern England, British Steel employs around 5,000 people directly, while 20,000 more depend on its supply chain. It is owned by investment firm Greybull Capital, former owners of collapsed airline Monarch.
Despite going into forced liquidation on Wednesday, staff have been kept on and operations maintained, with the UK's Official Receiver granted an indemnity which allows it access to government funds to keep the business running for now.
There are practical reasons for this as it would facilitate a rescue but the cash crunch could be felt by suppliers as all of British Steel's lenders are in the process of pulling out, the source said.
British Steel produces steel from scratch in its blast furnace in Scunthorpe. Blast furnaces cannot easily be turned on or off, but need to be continually supplied with raw materials to keep their temperature steady. 
""Electricity, gas and oxygen, these things you don't stock, if suppliers decide to stop they (British Steel) close. Some suppliers need to be paid every day, its a very difficult situation,"" the source said.
""We're going to see announcements from these companies explaining that they have to make people redundant,"" he said, adding the government would be looking to find a solution within weeks.
Hargreaves Services, a materials services firm, has warned it could take a pretax profit hit of 1.3 million pounds in its next full year if British Steel ceases to trade. Around 170 jobs at the firm would be at risk. 
On the customer side, Network Rail, which buys about 100,000 tonnes of rail a year from British Steel, told Reuters its contingency plans include stockpiling rail, reallocating stock and servicing rail to re-use it. 
Another British Steel customer said it was looking into new supply sources should the steelmaker fail. 
TRICKY OPERATION
Liberty House, one of the world's largest privately owned industrial groups and Europe's third largest steel producer, has expanded rapidly in recent years, snapping up distressed steel and aluminum assets around the world since.
""Gupta is showing interest (but) to make it feasible you need a pool of banks supporting the business,"" said the source.
He explained the government was keen to put money into the business so long as the funds were structured in such a way that a private buyer does not benefit from them should the steelmaker fold for good.
Liberty House declined comment.
According to pollster YouGov, 46 percent of Britons say British Steel should be nationalized, 18 percent say it should not, while 36 percent say they do not know. 
Greybull Capital, which specializes in trying to turn around distressed businesses, paid former British Steel owners Tata Steel a nominal one pound for the business three years ago. 
Jon Bolton, director of global steel development at Liberty House, was formerly director at Tata Steel Long Products Europe - the business sold to Greybull and renamed British Steel. 
British Steel had asked the government for a 75 million pound loan this month, later reducing its demand to 30 million pounds. It had already secured a government loan of around 120 million pounds ($154 million) to cover its carbon taxes.
Having turned a profit in 2017, British Steel cut around 400 jobs last year, blaming factors such as the weak pound and uncertainties surrounding Brexit, which it said hammered its order book.
Making a profit in steel is particularly difficult in Britain, where steelmakers pay some of the highest green taxes and energy costs in the world, as well as facing high labor costs and business rates. 
The collapse of British Steel has put Greybull in the spotlight. Known for buying up distressed assets on the cheap, its record has been patchy, with four of the 10 companies it bought since 2010 placed into administration. 
British Steel also operates a business in France producing rail, and a wire and processing unit in the Netherlands.

PARIS (Reuters) - Hungary's foreign minister on Thursday accused major Western European nations of ""hypocrisy"" and ""hysteria"" for criticizing central European countries' business dealings with China, and defended Hungary's use of Huawei 5G mobile phone technology.
Sixteen central and eastern European countries, including 11 European Union members, held a summit with China in April during which it pledged to increase trade and provide more support for big cross-border infrastructure projects.
The area is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
France and Germany oppose such independent moves, which they fear might make Europe appear disunited at a time when the EU is trying to forge a more defensive strategy towards China.
On Tuesday, speaking to reporters in Paris, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire criticized ""negotiations of 16 states from the east with China in parallel to negotiations that the EU is leading with China"".
But Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto rejected such criticism, saying Germany and France do far more business with China than the central European states, and often negotiate directly with Beijing.
""There is such a bad hypocrisy in the European Union when it comes to China,"" Szijjarto told Reuters on the sidelines of an OECD meeting in Paris. ""The 11 central and eastern European member states ... represent 9.9 percent of EU trade with China.""
""When the German chancellor and French president meet China's leadership nobody thinks that's a problem,"" he said. ""Nobody raises a question about how it is possible that they sell 300 aircraft to China, which is a bigger deal than the (entire) trade represented by the 11 central European countries."" 
He said it was also unfair for Western European states to criticize Hungary for using technology from Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G mobile phone networks, when those networks were being built under license by German and British companies, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD).
The United States and some of its European allies are pushing countries to exclude Huawei technology from their infrastructure, arguing that the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker could pose a security threat. Huawei denies that its technology could be misused by the Chinese state. 
The Hungarian mobile phone licenses were ""signed by the biggest German and British telecommunications companies, and then the Germans, British and French accuse us of opening up our market to Huawei,"" Szijjarto said.

""When it comes to China it's a matter of competition. Instead of crying, instead of making hysteria and accusing central European countries, we should strengthen ourselves and be ready for the competition.""

FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration is meeting with international air regulators from around the world on Thursday to determine what is needed to return the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX to return it to service.
Senior FAA officials will give detailed descriptions of the findings to date from the two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia which occurred within five months of each other and killed a combined 346 people. The agency will summarize the status of three major ongoing reviews of the 737 MAX and give an update of the recertification process and shed light on Boeing's proposed revisions to its software and pilot training.
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said on Thursday he thought travelers in the United States and around the world would respect any eventual decision by the FAA to return the plane to service. ""They'll get back on the MAX and fly it again."" 
Boeing's 737 MAX is its fastest-selling line of planes ever, and there are now roughly 5,000 of the aircraft on order. The planemaker in April slowed production and said the two crashes had cost it at least $1 billion.
Boeing shares were down 1.7 percent at $346.85 at midday on Thursday.
Nearly 60 air regulators from 33 governmental agencies, including from China, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, France, Ethiopia, Indonesia and South Korea, are attending the meeting at an FAA office in Texas.
The agency came under criticism in March for failing to ground the Boeing 737 MAX as quickly as Europe, China and other countries.
One of Thursday's sessions is titled ""Data mapping to accidents: safety actions and changes to the 737 MAX training requirements.""
Elwell told reporters on Wednesday the FAA would share the agency's ""safety analysis that will form the basis for our return to service decision process.""
Some air regulators have said they will conduct independent reviews of the Boeing 737 MAX. Elwell was asked by a reporter on Wednesday if he would delay ungrounding the plane in order to have ""peace"" with other regulators.
""We have peace with other regulators,"" Elwell said. ""We’re talking to them constantly. You want to make this like, ‘We at war with the other countries over this.’ We’re not.""
The FAA is still asking Boeing questions about a proposed software upgrade and training revisions and has not decided whether to require simulator training. Elwell declined to provide a time frame for how soon the agency might approve the airplane's return to service or say if it was realistic that airlines could resume flights by August as some have suggested.
Elwell told CNBC it ""could definitely be a month, two months"" or even longer than that.
Also on Thursday, Boeing and the FAA will brief members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on the 737 MAX for the first time. 
The FAA will not unground the plane until it obtains the findings from a multi-agency Technical Advisory Board reviewing the software fix. It consists of experts not involved in any aspect of the Boeing 737 MAX certification.

Boeing said last week it had completed development of the software update on the 737 MAX to prevent erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system known as MCAS that is under scrutiny following the two disastrous nose-down crashes. It must still formally submit the upgrade for approval and conduct a certification flight before the FAA can act.

55,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>","U.S. government could stagger Fannie, Freddie privatization: regulator","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be returned to the private market at different times, especially if the government moves to float them on the public markets, the head of the U.S. housing finance regulator told Reuters in an interview.
It may be preferable to stagger that process due to the complexities involved in getting the government-backed firms, which have different business models, ready for private ownership, said Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. housing finance system. 
""I'm open to seeing what makes sense...that kind of sequencing hasn't been decided, but obviously if you tried to engineer them both at the same time, you’re depending on more things going right at the same time,"" he said. ""One may be ready before the other, it just depends.""
Fannie and Freddie have operated under government conservatorship since they were bailed out during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Washington has struggled for years to devise a plan to safely return the companies, which guarantee over half of the nation’s mortgages, to the private sector. 
The prospect of a phased privatization could present fresh challenges and risks for some shareholders in the firms, since the enterprises could enter the public markets under different economic conditions. 
The Trump administration, which is eager to make progress on housing finance reform, last month appointed Calabria, a libertarian economist who previously worked for Vice President Mike Pence, to lead the effort.
Calabria has outlined an ambitious course for removing the two firms from government control, which includes reviewing their business activities, shoring up their accounting, and raising billions in capital.
In a speech on Monday, Calabria said he hoped the companies could start to build capital next year by potentially retaining some profits, which are currently sent to the Treasury Department. But the pair would likely need other sources of capital, with a public offering of some kind being a likely option, he said.
Calabria told Reuters he had not yet determined exactly how much capital the firms would need. 
On Tuesday, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Donald Layton estimated his company would need $50 billion, while Fannie Mae would need $75 billion.
The Treasury Department currently holds warrants that represent nearly 80% of the two enterprises. But the two companies also have legacy common and preferred equity securities that trade on the ""pink sheets"" market, where companies that are not yet listed often trade. 
A number of hedge funds have built large stakes in both classes of stock and some have sued the government over their seizure in 2008.
Calabria told Reuters he saw some advantages to staggering the public offerings to avoid saturating the market.
""There's less risk of overwhelming the demand that's in the marketplace,"" he said. ""But again if they are both ready to go and you start to hear very large appetite, that this is something that the market could absorb at once, then that changes the dynamic.""
In the event of a staggered privatization, Calabria said he hoped any lag between the entities would not exceed six months.

Investigators seized documents and records related to the firm's dealings with 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), one of the sources said. 
In a late email to Reuters, Deloitte confirmed that the police sought the firm's assistance in the provision of records relating to 1MDB.
""Deloitte Malaysia is not the subject of the investigation and is cooperating fully with the authorities in their investigation,"" the firm said.
Authorities in at least six countries are investigating alleged graft and money laundering at 1MDB, set up by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. 
Najib, who was ousted in an election last year, is facing dozens of criminal charges over losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has consistently denied wrongdoing. 
U.S. prosecutors say about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
Deloitte has been under scrutiny for its role in auditing 1MDB's financial statements in 2013 and 2014. 
In January, Malaysia's securities regulator fined Deloitte 2.2 million ringgit ($524,746) for failing to report irregularities in relation to an Islamic bond issued by a 1MDB-linked company. 
After the U.S. Justice Department filed civil lawsuits in 2016 over 1MDB, Deloitte said the 1MDB finance statements it had audited should no longer be relied upon.
Deloitte was 1MDB's third auditor after the fund fired its earlier auditors, KPMG and Ernst & Young, authorities have said. 
It resigned as the fund's auditor in early 2016.

The S&P 500 fell 35 points or 1.2% by 9:44 AM ET (13:44 GMT), while the Dow lost 346 points or 1.3% and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was down 114 points or 1.5%. The Nasdaq has under-performed all week on fears that the tech sector will be hurt more than most as the U.S. tries to stop China attaining world leadership in technologies such as 5G.
China told Washington overnight to correct its ""wrong actions"" in order for trade talks to continue. The comments were in response to the U.S. blacklisting Chinese tech giant Huawei last week, a development that has led companies to drop its smartphones from their 5G offerings. That's on top of various governments signalling it will restrict Huawei's involvement in the rollout of 5G spectrum networks. The White House is looking at the possibility of blocking more Chinese companies from the American market, something that could trigger more equity sell-offs.

BT had said in December it planned to make changes to the way it decides management pay after some of its shareholders questioned Patterson's bonus for 2018-19.
Investors had also complained after BT gave a more than 1 million pound ($1.3 million) bonus to Patterson in 2017-18, during which time the company's stock tumbled 30%. 
""The (pay) committee and Gavin agreed that a reduction of the total bonus outcome by 50% would be the right thing to do and in the best interests of all stakeholders,"" BT said. 
Patterson's bonus for 2018-19 will now be 572,000 pounds compared with 1.3 million pounds a year earlier. His total salary for the year was 1.72 million pounds, BT's annual report showed. 
Patterson left BT at the end of January, handing over to Philip Jansen, a former Worldpay chief executive.
The telecoms giant had said a new leader was needed to restructure the company. 
Patterson, who ran BT for almost five years, announced 13,000 job cuts last year in an attempt to get to grips with a host of problems including intense competition, an underperforming IT services unit, a huge pension deficit and criticism of its broadband plans.
But a failure to hit a revenue target and a forecast for no growth in profit for the next couple of years sent its shares to six-year lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A company working to make open-source self-driving software reliable enough to be used in commercially available vehicles said it had hired a former German car boss as it seeks to expand its reach. 
Palo Alto, California-based Apex.AI has added Karl-Thomas Neumann, an industry veteran who in the past served as the chief executive of  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) and led Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's China business, to its board.
""Karl-Thomas is a great fit for us as we're trying to learn off what worked in the past and reach out to more industry players,"" Apex.AI co-founder Jan Becker told Reuters in an interview this week.
The U.S. firm is expanding to Europe, opening an office in Munich, Germany in July.
Founded by Becker and Dejan Pangercic, two longtime self-driving car engineers formerly at automotive technology supplier Bosch Corp, Apex.AI plans to make a safer and more reliable version of the so-called Robot Operating System, or ROS. 
That software is used by scores of labs and companies in their self-driving car and robotics efforts, including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The software is open source, meaning that anyone can adopt it and use it free of charge, but it has so far mainly been deployed in research settings. 
Apex.AI aims to create a robust, failproof version of the software that can be deployed by carmakers in later stage commercial applications to guarantee safety-critical driving functions.
It hopes to finish the software by the end of the year and submit it to German inspection firm TÜV for approval in early 2020. Once certified, the software could then be deployed by carmakers worldwide, Becker said.
The company wants to license the software and charge for support services, with the exact pricing model currently under discussion, Neumann said.
Apex.AI to date has raised $15.5 million in venture capital funding, including from the venture arms of Airbus SA and Toyota Motor Corp. Becker said the company was well-funded into 2020.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish tire maker Nokian Tyres expects its new U.S. factory in Tennessee to help it double its sales in North America, especially by expanding its all-season tire sales in the region, the company said on Thursday.
The company, which has previously concentrated mostly on winter tire sales in Russia and Europe, said the new facility would allow it to seek growth in the significantly larger all-season tire market in North America.
Two years ago Nokian, which currently has a large plant in Russia and a smaller one in Finland, announced an investment of $360 million in the new production facility in Dayton, Tennessee, set for startup in the latter half of this year.
""Our goal is to double our sales in North America within five years,"" the company's chief executive Hille Korhonen told reporters in Helsinki.
Last year, Nokian's North American sales amounted to 194.5 million euros ($217 million), a little over 12 percent of its total sales.
The new factory is expected to cut delivery times in North America to weeks and eliminate the need to hold large inventories, Mark Earl, Vice President in charge of Americas, said. 
""Our current 120 to 180 day lead time from our Russian factory to North America is difficult to manage,"" Earl said.
Previously the company sold only winter tyres in North America, mainly in Canada and some northern U.S. states, but has gradually ramped up its all-season tire sales. 
Earl said the total retail tire market amounted to 240 million units a year in the United States alone, with Nokian holding just a 1% share at the moment. 
""There is a lot of room in the market for a company like us,"" Earl said, adding the plan was to concentrate on larger tire sizes and models for premium cars.

75,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 23, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Modi Reigns Supreme. Now India's Economy Awaits,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If Narendra Modi’s 2014 popular mandate was India’s biggest in three decades, his 2019 re-election is an even bigger feat.
Votes are still being counted, but on current trends the Indian prime minister’s Bharatiya Janata Party will win a more impressive single-party majority in parliament than last time around.
It’s a remarkable demonstration of voters’ faith in Modi’s carefully crafted strongman image. What he has pulled off in the world’s biggest democracy could give some pointers even to U.S. President Donald Trump. That the Indian leader has cruised to victory amid agrarian distress, youth unemployment, high income inequality, anemic growth, a broken financial system and the promise of a basic income for 50 million of the country’s poorest families by the opposition Congress Party, makes the win all the more momentous.
In a U.K.-style parliamentary democracy, people voted for Modi as though he was their de facto president. He may well govern like one. The members of parliament that actually got elected won’t count for much anyway, given how heavily their campaign leaned on Modi’s charisma. As for the party and its ideology, the BJP’s identification with Modi is now complete. He has a clear five-year runaway to shape the national agenda, and his ministers will have to back him to the hilt.
Analysts will have many questions after this week’s euphoria in stock markets has calmed down. For one thing, the composition of the new economics team, a particularly weak point of the Modi administration’s first five years, will be keenly awaited. Institutions such as the central bank and the statistics department, which have seen their independence and credibility come under attack, will also be watched – for signs of repair or further degradation.
Investors will want to know if Modi still has an appetite for arbitrary action, such as his  overnight ban on 86 percent of the country’s cash. The state of the economy offers zero scope for more ill-conceived experimentation. Consumption is slowing because of poor wage growth in villages and unfavorable prices of food commodities. Private investment is expected only in select areas like road construction, and not in things like power and telecom. Shadow lenders are retreating, amplifying a funding crunch for India Inc.
Now that the elections are out of the way, the government’s own budget deficits will need more honest accounting. Big-ticket privatization, a missed opportunity of Modi’s first term, will need a determined push. Decimation of a credible opposition in parliament opens up the possibility of muscular action minus the usual constraints of a noisy democracy. The next five years will determine to what extent Modi uses the policy space, and what he makes of it.

Loup Ventures co-founder Gene Munster wrote in a note that Tesla will probably miss its 2019 delivery target range as sales shrink in China amid a trade war between the two countries. The analyst cut his estimate for Tesla’s full-year global car sales by about 10% to 310,000 vehicles, versus the minimum 360,000-unit target the manufacturer set in March. The shares are poised for their seventh day of losses and are down 27% over the past month.
“We are lowering our numbers as a precautionary measure related to two unknowns,” including China’s probable imposition of tariffs on Tesla car imports as well as other impediments such as new regulations on sales or a potential consumer boycott of U.S. goods, Munster said. Loup’s pessimism on the import fees is a “minority view,” discounting most investors’ expectation that Tesla will remain exempt because of its investment in a Chinese battery factory, he said.
Compounding woes for the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who earlier this week said that Tesla stock could plunge to as low as $10 in a worst-case scenario, held a private call with investors Wednesday in which he said the company is “seen more as a distressed credit and restructuring story.”
Tesla is likely to survive as the worldwide electric-vehicle market surges, Loup’s Munster said. Recent fund-raising gives the manufacturer a two-year cash cushion as long as deliveries exceed 300,000 a year through 2020, though the protective timeframe narrows if vehicle sales fall below that level, he said.

77,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>","Massmart warns on profit, names Walmart executive as new CEO","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African retailer Massmart on Thursday warned of lower headline earnings per share for the first half of the year and said that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) executive Mitchell Slape would become its new CEO.
Massmart, in which Walmart has a majority stake, said headline earnings per share for the six-months ended June might be at least 50% lower than the prior year, while operating profit before interest, depreciation, restructuring, non-trading items and taxation might be flat.
The trading statement sent Massmart's shares down more than 12% to a 10-year low. At 0949 GMT shares were down 10.05%. 
The new CEO Slape will take over from Guy Hayward who resigned in May, the South African retailer said.
Massmart, with presence in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, had said earlier in May that the timing of Hayward's exit was still to be confirmed but that he would remain in the company until later in the year for the handover.
Slape has been with Walmart since 1995 and has held several senior leadership positions across a range of retail formats and Walmart markets, including the United States, Japan, India and Mexico. 
Slape will join Massmart as it plans to add 47 new stores between 2019 and 2021, with about a third of the new space outside its home market, where it has been expanding slowly.
Retailers have found it tough to boost earnings in South Africa, where an increase in value-added tax, unemployment, coupled with higher fuel prices and utility costs have reduced consumers' spending power. 
On its trading update Massmart said: ""Current economic data and sentiment cause us to believe however, that most risks associated with the above estimates are likely to the downside.""
In the first 20 weeks of the 2019 financial year, Massmart's sales rose 6.1% to 33.5 billion rand, with comparable sales growth of 4.1%.
Slape will start from the first day of the month following the date of approval and grant of his intra-company transfer permit and visa to work in South Africa, Massmart said.

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is not considering the possibility of a merger with top shareholder  Renault  at the moment, and none of the nominees to the Japanese automaker's board are pressing to make it an issue now, an external director said on Thursday.
As Nissan ponders its future without former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who orchestrated its financial rescue two decades ago, French partner Renault SA (PA:RENA) has been quietly maneuvering for merger talks, sources at both automakers have previously told Reuters.
France's government has also weighed in, saying on Wednesday that the status quo was weakening the alliance and could not continue. 
But given Nissan's current focus on improving corporate governance and recovering from a run of poor results, Keiko Ihara, who has been overseeing efforts to overhaul governance, told Reuters in an interview that the issue of a merger was not on the table at the moment.
""We don't have time to feel any of the pressure which appears to be coming externally,"" she said. 
""We're not aware of any director nominee who wants to make this an official topic of discussion at the moment.""
Ihara, who also chairs a provisional council for an external nominations committee to be set up next month, said the process to find eventual successors to CEO Hiroto Saikawa and other executives would begin soon after the group is formed.
Saikawa, a protege of Ghosn, has come under pressure to lift Nissan's dismal operational performance just as Renault has been looking at ways to merge the two companies, a move opposed by Saikawa and some of his colleagues.
Ihara also said that Nissan has a lot of internal talent from which it can choose its next generation of executives after an exodus of top-level officials following the ouster of Ghosn.
Nissan is overhauling its board structure and the way it appoints top executives and determines their pay as it seeks to improve its corporate governance after it accused Ghosn of financial misconduct.
Ghosn denies all charges against him.
Last week, Nissan announced a list of 11 nominees for its expanded board of directors, which include Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard and CEO Thierry Bollore, to be voted on by shareholders next month.
It also decided that Saikawa would stay on as chief executive though Renault had earlier pushed for a change in Nissan's leadership.
""Once the nominations committee is up and running, it will start considering a succession plan,"" Ihara said. She said the provisional council believed there were ""dozens of people"" within the company who could eventually take over as CEO, chief operating officer or other management positions.

""Nissan is a global company so it has a wealth of people who have deep global experience and expertise,"" Ihara said.

Key Developments:
May Drops Plan for Vote on Brexit Bill (11:11 a.m.)
May’s key piece of Brexit legislation isn’t listed for debate in the first week of June, as had been planned.
The Leader of the House of Commons’ Twitter feed published the order of business for the first week back after the recess and the Brexit bill isn’t on it.
However, there’s still a plan to publish the bill in the week of June, government whip Mark Spencer told Parliament. May is discussing the text of the legislation with ministers, her spokesman told reporters on Thursday.
May had said it would go to a vote the first week of June, and after that ballot she would set out a timetable for her departure and the leadership race to replace her.
Duncan Smith Sees Her Replaced By Summer (10:20 a.m.)
Iain Duncan Smith, a Brexiteer and former Tory leader, said May’s successor could be in place before U.K. Parliament closes for its summer break - usually at the end of July.
“Politics is a nasty sometimes brutal, ghastly business... she has no confidence, not just within her party but in the cabinet too,” Duncan Smith told TalkRadio. “The best thing is to break away and find a new leader, someone who campaigned for Brexit and believes in Brexit in any form.”
There’s been a lot of speculation about when the new leader could be in place as the process for the leadership race takes a couple of months. The first step is for the parliamentary party to have bi-weekly ballots to whittle down the list of candidates to two. Then the final two go the 120,000 members to choose the winner.
When Will She Go? (9 a.m.)
The Times and Daily Mail report she could go on Friday, but that’s not confirmed and May’s office isn’t commenting. The election results aren’t published until Sunday night.
Another consideration is that May has agreed to meet the panel of rank-and-file lawmakers on Friday. They may decide to act then -- though so far they’ve shown reluctance to put the boot in.

83,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 05:53AM ET</span>","PC maker Lenovo books fourth-quarter profit surge, says production unaffected by trade war","By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tech giant Lenovo Group Ltd on Thursday reported a market-beating three-fold surge in quarterly profit helped by strong personal computer (PCs) sales, and said its production plans had not been affected by the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war.
Still investors, worried that the conflict was morphing into a technology cold war, dumped shares of Asian tech companies, with Lenovo's stock price falling as much as 6.3% to its lowest in nearly four months.
Dual-headquartered in China and the United States, the world's largest PC maker on Thursday said it is ""well poised to navigate the turbulence in the geopolitical and macro-economic environment"".
The United States has sought to address what it believes is imbalanced trade with China, unleashing waves of tit-for-tat import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods.
Lenovo said it was less exposed to the U.S. market than competitors and that most of its products are not subject to the new tariffs.
""We definitely don't want to see this situation,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing told Reuters in an interview. ""We've always said we wish the two governments can get the agreement as early as possible.""
Yang said Lenovo has contingency plans to shift production to its centers outside China - such as in India, Mexico, Hungary, Brazil and the United States - but so far has not made such adjustments. 
PC GROWTH
Lenovo's net profit in the fourth quarter ending March rose more than three fold to $118 million from a year prior when it suffered a writedown. The result compared with the $91.4 million average of seven analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
""The growth strategy of PC and Smart Device (PCSD) focusing on commercial, high-growth and premium segments has paid off in delivering record revenue for the fiscal year,"" Yang said in a statement.
PCSD revenue rose 10%, with PC shipments growing 9%. Overall revenue rose 10% to $11.71 billion, in line estimates.
The global PC shipments declined 4.6% during three months, showed data from consultancy Gartner.
For the full year, Lenovo swung to a profit of $597 million, from a loss of $189 million a year earlier, when it had written down $400 million due to U.S. tax reform.
Annual revenue rose to a record $51 billion, which Lenovo attributed mainly to record sales at its PCSD business, which accounts for three quarters of the total.
Lenovo's mobile business, which it has been trying to turn around, continued to lose money on an annual basis. Its nascent data center division also booked a loss but revenue grew 37%.

Going forward, Chief Operating Officer Gianfranco Lanci said he expects Lenovo's mobile business to maintain pre-tax profitability, and that the data center business would focus on growing profit rather than revenue.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Lawyers for Carlos Ghosn will ask a Japanese court to allow the former Nissan Motor boss one monitored visit with his wife after the Supreme Court upheld curbs on contact with his spouse while he is on bail, his legal team said on Thursday.
The top court on Monday rejected Ghosn's appeal of restrictions on meeting or communicating with his wife Carole, part of his $4.5 million bail as he awaits trial on financial misconduct charges.
Ghosn's lawyers have argued that the bail condition violates Japan's constitution and international law on family separations. They now plan to ask a court to approve one monitored visit with his wife.
""We will submit an application this week,"" defense lawyer Takashi Takano told Reuters. 
If the court agrees, Carole Ghosn would travel from France to meet her husband for a one hour meeting in the presence of his lawyers, Takano said.
Under the bail agreement that allowed Ghosn to walk out of jail on April 25, he cannot meet or otherwise communicate with his wife without prior permission. He has not received such permission, Takano said.
Ghosn's movements are also monitored and he is only allowed to access the internet from a computer at his lawyer's office. A record of that activity has to be submitted to the court. 
Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing ""backstabbing"" former colleagues of conspiring to oust him as Nissan chairman.
He has been indicted four times, twice on charges that he failed to disclose a portion of his earnings to authorities, and twice for aggravated breach of trust.
The latter included an allegation that he received $5 million in payments from an Nissan dealership in Oman after authorizing incentive payments to it from Nissan. 
Ghosn has denied all charges against him. He is expected to go on trial next year, Takano said.

Thomas Cook issued its third profit warning in less than a year last week, saying subdued demand had led to increased promotions and earlier discounting than usual. The profit warning led Citi to cut its price target for the stock to zero.
The company has put its airline up for sale and also agreed a 300 million pound ($379 million) bank facility to provide more liquidity for the 2019/20 winter season.
""The downgrade reflects the tight liquidity we expect TCG (Thomas Cook Group) to face toward the end of 2019 should it not sell its airline division or be able to draw on the planned GBP300 million senior secured facility,"" Fitch said as it cut Thomas Cook's rating to CCC+ from B.
""We expect EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) and profitability to be lower than our previous forecasts as the company faces lower bookings in its main markets, continuing fierce competition and Brexit uncertainty.""
S&P downgraded its rating on Thomas Cook to CCC+ from B-, citing risks from the soft market conditions and uncertainty over the sale price of the airline unit.
Last week Thomas Cook said it had received multiple bids to take over all or parts of its airline business. The company declined to comment on the credit ratings downgrades.
Shares in Thomas Cook were down 6% at 0854 GMT, with other travel and leisure stocks also lower.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares made it four days in the red in the last five on Thursday as concerns grew that the China-U.S. trade conflict was fast turning into a technology cold war between the world's two largest economies.
Asian stocks caved to a four-month low as the rhetoric between Beijing and Washington remained fierce while Europe's bourses also fell as Brexit worries and gloomy data from Germany and the euro zone added to the nerves.
U.S. stock futures also pointed to a weak start with the S&P 500 e-minis faltering 0.5%.
Investors worry that the U.S.-China trade dispute, which has already hurt global growth and business investment, could see a further sharp escalation with no signs of a resolution as yet.
Late Wednesday, Reuters reported the U.S. administration was considering Huawei-like sanctions on Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision over the country's treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority, according to a person briefed on the matter.
After the United States placed Huawei Technologies on a trade blacklist last week, British chip designer ARM has halted relations with Huawei in order to comply with the blockade.
Digging the knife in, the U.S. military said it sent two Navy ships through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday.
""It's tin hats on and battening down the hatches for a fair bit of volatility for the next few months,"" said Tony Cousins, Chief Executive of Pyrford International, the global equities arm of BMO Global Asset Management. 
""We are as defensively positioned as we could be,"" he said, adding it was impossible to predict what steps U.S. President Donald Trump was likely to take next in the trade war with China.
An increasing number of investors now seem to be hunkering down for prolonged period of trade conflict.
Analysts at Nomura warned in a note, ""Without a clear way forward during an intensifying 2020 U.S. presidential election, we see a rising risk that tariffs will remain in effect through end 2020.""
In response, Shanghai blue chips shed 1.7% to be near their lowest since February. An index of major telecoms firms fell 3.7% as suppliers to Huawei suffered. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its lowest in four months. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday it would be at least a month before the United States would enact proposed tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports as it studies the impact on American consumers.

Minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting out on Wednesday underlined its readiness to be patient on policy ""for some time"" given the uncertain global outlook.
The chance of a rate cut seemed to diminish as many Fed policy makers saw recent weakness in inflation as ""transitory"", though the latest escalation in the trade war means markets are still wagering on an eventual easing.
Sterling had troubles of its own as it hit a 4-1/2-month low of $1.2603 as it suffered its ninth drop in the last 10 days.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came under intense pressure after her latest Brexit gambit backfired and fueled calls for her to quit.
Prominent Brexit supporter Andrea Leadsom resigned from the government on Wednesday and with British media reporting May could announce her departure date as early as Friday the bets on a more hard Brexit replacement are rising.
""Uncertainty is the only clear certainty in the near term,"" said Westpac macro strategist Tim Riddell.
""The risk of a hard-Brexit replacement for May has increased the risks of a hard Brexit result or even a forced no-deal exit,"" he added. ""Such an event would likely force GBP lower, increase risks of assets sliding and BOE (Bank of England) taking counter action to support assets.""

The asset management division of UBS said in a note the UK currency would hit 97 pence, just short of parity against the euro. That would be its weakest since December 2008.
It also predicted it would fall to $1.15, its lowest since a flash crash in October 2016.
""Investors should not be complacent about the threat of a no-deal exit,"" said Dean Turner, UK economist at UBS Wealth Management.
In turn, a decision to remain in the bloc would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling. Turner said he believes the pound is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around $1.58.

Sterling was trading at 88.25 pence against the euro and $1.26 by 0907 GMT.

89,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chile's Codelco set for copper output hit as key mine goes underground,"By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Codelco's giant Chuquicamata mine is set for a 40% drop in production over the next two years, an internal forecast seen by Reuters shows, pointing to the sharp challenge facing the world's top copper miner as it scrambles to maintain output.
The giant open-pit mine, set to be the Chilean state-run miner's biggest by output this year, is undergoing a complex $5 billion-plus transformation into an underground shaft mine in a bid to extend the century-old prospect's lifespan.
Chile's President Sebastian Pinera is expected to formally cut the ribbon on the revamped copper mine, often referred to as 'Chuqui', in coming months.
This year, ores from the new project will be added to the existing open-pit operations, giving Chuqui overall production of 459,000 tonnes - its highest since 2010 - the previously unreported 2019 forecast shows. 
But as Codelco scales down and ultimately shutters open pit extraction next year, while the underground project still ramps up, output will drop sharply, the figures show - down 182,000 tonnes by 2021 versus 2019.
That will drive overall Codelco production down 4% by 2021, according to the long-term business development plan. That would be steeper were it not for a planned production hike at the miner's Radomiro Tomic prospect.
Codelco declined to comment on the forecast data, saying the numbers were confidential.
The changes at Chuqui underscore the risk to Codelco's global dominance amid a $39 billion overhaul of its key operations to try and counteract rapidly falling ore grades that are hitting top copper exporter Chile more broadly.
""We're going to see a lengthy process to bring production to a level similar to that of the pit,"" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of consultancy Plusmining. The above-ground 'pit' is the size of over 3,000 American football fields.
Guajardo projected a seven-year ""ramp up"" period. The internal presentation seen by Reuters shows production at Chuqui dropping sharply to 277,000 tonnes by 2021 before climbing back to a peak of 416,000 tonnes in 2024. 
Graphic: Codelco's Chuqui braces for drop (https://tmsnrt.rs/2ErDXNJ)
""SCISSOR HANDS""
Chuqui is also facing a battle with simmering worker tensions and technical delays, hampering prospects at the mine.
Plans for the underground project were drawn up early in the decade when copper prices were hitting all-time highs, then scaled back by chief executive Nelson Pizarro, known as ""scissor-hands"" for his focus on costs.
Copper prices are now being hit by a whipsawing trade standoff between the United States and China. They have fallen for five straight weeks and are near several-month lows.
""The challenge remains to ensure future viability, modifying the work culture and applying new work practices and technology,"" Pizarro told Reuters in a recent interview, adding Codelco needed to improve productivity without lifting costs. 
That could mean pain for Chuqui workers, with some 1,700 expected to lose their jobs in coming years, putting Codelco's powerful unions on edge.
A January negotiation round on the layoffs ended in an impasse and differences still loom large during an ongoing second round of talks with top unions. Some fear the conflict will provoke strikes, further hitting production.
Unions at Chuqui rejected on Sunday a management proposal for a quick end to contract negotiations.
""The old workers of Chuqui have benefits that are above the rest of the entire company and the cost is immense,"" said Gustavo Lagos, a Santiago-based professor at the mining center of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

MUTED START
The first extraction of copper ore from the underground mine, a major milestone for the project, was announced in April via a brief statement, a low-profile start sources at or close to the firm said was due to the tough environment at Chuqui.
An automated conveyor belt system to transport the extracted material to a concentrator plant will only be ready by the last quarter of 2019, according to Pizarro, forcing the firm to use slower trucks to move the ore.
With the lower output at Chuqui, Codelco's total copper production is expected to fall to 1.66 million tonnes in 2021, from the 1.73 million expected this year, the firm's internal forecast shows. Only by 2027 would it again top 2019 levels.
The forecast also showed that Codelco's short-term estimate for the period 2019-2025 had slipped versus its outlook in 2018, though it had raised its longer term production estimate.
Barbara Mattos, an analyst at ratings agency Moody's, said the overhaul was nonetheless key for Codelco to support its levels of production and ensure ""the viability of the company as a relevant actor in the copper industry in the long term.""

90,By Investing.com,"<span>May 23, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Time for the Euro Zone to Call on Guardiola,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are in headlong retreat again on Tuesday on the back of business surveys that further stoked fears that the continent will be caught up in a worsening trade war between the U.S. and China.
The ‘flash’ reading for IHS Markit’s Eurozone purchasing managers index for manufacturing in May fell to 47.7 from 47.9 in April, disappointing hopes of an increase. The index had fallen for eight straight months before turning up fractionally in April, fostering hopes that the worst of the slowdown was over.
The Eurozone services PMI also indicated that growth slowed in May, although statistical quirks led to the composite PMI actually rising to 51.6 from 51.5 in April.
By 4.30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 was down 3.4 points, or 0.9% at 375.80. The German Dax and the French CAC 40 were both down 1.6%, despite the French PMI rising more strongly than expected. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 1.1%.
“The German manufacturing malaise is now increasingly being reflected in job losses in the sector,” said Nordea analyst Jan van Gerich via Twitter. “Services employment is still clearly in growth territory, but for how long remains to be seen.”
Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to EY’s ITEM Club, noted that business activity was at its weakest since November 2013, with both manufacturing and services across the currency bloc “running close to stagnation”.
The weakness in the euro zone’s engine room was corroborated by another drop in Germany’s ifo Business Climate index, which also fell for the eighth time in nine months.
“The German economy is losing more steam,” ifo said. “Companies are less satisfied with their current situation. The faint optimism for the coming months, seen in March, has again evaporated.”
Evidently, there is only one solution for the European economy, and that is to put Pep Guardiola in charge of it.
The Spanish soccer coach, who has just burnished his already stellar reputation by winning all three of England’s domestic club competitions with Manchester City in the 2018/9 season, is reportedly on the verge of a move to Italy’s Juventus (MI:JUVE). The club’s shares have risen 8% since the news first broke on Wednesday."

By 0710 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 had dropped 0.8%, with Germany's traditionally trade-sensitive DAX down a full percentage point.
That tracked a slide in Asian shares to four-month lows, as investors worried the U.S.-China trade feud was fast turning into a technology-focused cold war.
European auto and mining sector indexes shed 2.80% and 1.04% respectively.
British chip designer ARM was the latest to suspend ties with net gear and phone maker Huawei, joining a list of companies that are complying with a U.S. blockade of the Chinese firm. The technology sector also slipped 1.25%.
London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.5% with Brexit-sensitive homebuilders among the worst hit.
The pound hovered near four-month lows as a key ally resigned from May's cabinet late on Wednesday, fuelling calls for the Prime Minister to resign. A report from The Times said May is expected to announce her departure from office on Friday.
The new attempt to oust the prime minister comes as voters head to the polling booths for the European elections, with May's ruling Conservative party facing a big defeat.

95,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 23, 2019 02:20AM ET</span>","Stocks, U.S. Futures Drop as Trade Worries Deepen: Markets Wrap","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. and European futures tracked a slide in Asian stocks on Thursday as worries over U.S.-China tensions grew. India bucked the trend, with equities there soaring as election results showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to win a majority on his own.
Shares fell from Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has now dropped 6% since President Donald Trump pledged to ramp up tariffs on China earlier this month, giving up about half its gains for the year. S&P 500 futures and European contracts indicated losses will continue when markets open. The yuan remained under pressure Thursday after China’s flagship People’s Daily published two commentaries assailing American moves to curb Chinese companies. Treasuries held recent gains. The pound extended losses amid an escalating Brexit crisis.
In India, shares hit a record high and the rupee climbed as counting pointed to Modi winning another term, with his Bharatiya Janata Party surging to a commanding lead.
On the U.S.-China front, economists are turning more pessimistic.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). now sees higher odds of a U.S.-China stalemate, and Nomura Holdings Inc. has shifted to forecasting a full-blown escalation of tariffs. Treasuries continue to benefit from haven demand, with 10-year yields near their lows for the year.
“We don’t think that there is an overnight solution,” said James Johnstone, co-head of emerging and frontier markets at RWC Partners LLC. “The accommodation of China as a rising power is something that the Americans and the West have been contemplating for a long time. This will be a 20-30 year accommodation.”
China’s yuan dipped in onshore trading even after the People’s Bank of China set its daily fixing for the yuan at a stronger-than-expected level for a fourth straight day. The Aussie slipped, and Australian government bond yields plumbed fresh all-time lows.
Treasuries rallied on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting showed officials judged their patient approach to interest-rate changes would be appropriate “for some time.” Lack of faith in a speedy resolution to the trade conflict helped lead Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to cut its forecast for U.S. yields.
Elsewhere, Britain’s pound is trading near its January low as Theresa May’s premiership hangs by a thread amid a growing revolt over her Brexit handling. Crude oil fell below $61 a barrel after inventory data showcased supply concerns.

The company helps Chinese travellers to look for destination and sight-seeing recommendations. It is often known as the Chinese version of TripAdvisor.
According to a statement by Mafengwo, it plans to use the funds to develop artificial intelligence technology and improve user recommendations.
Since 2015, the company began letting its users book hotels through its website and has doubled transaction volumes annually over the past four years, Bloomberg reported.
The Bloomberg report also cited data from consultancy firm iResearch which estimated that China’s online travel sector is expected to grow 18% to CNY 988 billion ($143 billion) of transactions this year.
In 2018, Mafengwo was plagued by accusations of fake reviews on its platform, with reports suggesting that it used bots and hired writers to copy review content from competitors.
Mafengwo sued some of the disseminators and said the accusations were based on “distorted facts” and were part of “an organized attack.”"

The Japanese-based automaker said it is recalling the 2019 CR-V to replace steering wheel wire harnesses and supplemental restraint system cable reels after six unexpected driver air bag deployments that occurred without a crash. There are so far no reports of related crashes, the automaker said.
The recall includes 118,000 vehicles in the United States and 19,000 in Korea and Canada.
Metal burrs on the interior surface of the steering wheel may result in damage that could lead to a short circuit and overheating of components, Honda said.
The issue is separate from a series of recalls Honda has conducted over the last decade to replace more than 21 million defective Takata air bag inflators in about 12.9 million U.S. vehicles that Honda has said are responsible for 14 U.S. deaths.

Honda also said it was recalling 19,000 U.S. vehicles that may have had Takata inflator replacement kits that were improperly installed before May 2018.

The comment was made by spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun at the TSMC 2019 Technology Symposium in Taiwan's tech hub of Hsinchu.

In one incident, a U.S. State Department official said in a recent meeting with a South Korean counterpart that local telco LG Uplus Corp, which uses Huawei's equipment, should ""not be allowed to serve in sensitive areas in South Korea"", Chosun Ilbo reported. The official added Huawei needs be eventually driven out of the country, if not immediately.
LG Uplus shares dropped 6 percent in Thursday's morning trade, which compared to a 0.4 percent drop in the benchmark KOSPI.
""LG Uplus has not received any statements or requests from either South Korea’s foreign ministry or the United States regarding our use of Huawei equipment,"" a LG Uplus official told Reuters on Thursday.
Washington has been pressing its allies not to use equipment made by Huawei over concerns it could be used for espionage or cyberattacks, a concern that Huawei says is unfounded.
The anti-Huawei campaign intensified last week, when U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that effectively banned the use of Huawei equipment in U.S. telecom networks on national security grounds. Additionally, the Commerce Department put limits on the firm’s purchases of U.S. technology.
While South Korea is a U.S. ally, China is its biggest export market. China took in nearly a quarter of South Korea's total exports in the first four months of this year, according to South Korea government data.
The U.S. government has repeatedly sent the message to South Korea's Foreign Ministry through various diplomatic channels that using Huawei products could cause security problems, Chosun Ilbo reported, citing an unnamed diplomatic source in Seoul.
""The U.S. has stressed the importance of security for 5G equipment, and we are aware of the U.S.'s position,"" South Korea's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that Seoul and Washington have been in continued talks on this issue, but declining to elaborate.

The U.S. Embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Hopes of a trade deal between the U.S. and China happening in the near future faded after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview that a trip to Beijing to resume trade negotiations has not been scheduled yet.
The South China Morning Post reported that recent restrictions imposed on Huawei have led China to rethink its economic relationship with the U.S.
The report came after the U.S. reportedly asked South Korea not to use Huawei products over concerns that it could be used for cyberattacks.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Panasonic Corp (T:6752) announced on Thursday that it has suspended shipments of some components to the Chinese telecom giant.
“Panasonic has instructed employees to halt transactions with Huawei and its 68 affiliates covered by the U.S. ban,” the company said in a statement.

106,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 08:26PM ET</span>",Barrick's buyout offer for Acacia unit irks minority shareholders,"By Nichola Saminather and Barbara Lewis
(Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp's proposal to take full control of its Acacia Mining Plc unit to resolve a long-standing tax dispute with Tanzania has drawn the ire of Acacia's minority shareholders, who may have the ultimate vote on a deal. 
Barrick's offer values Acacia at $787 million, a near 11% discount to its Tuesday close and 42% below Barrick's own audited valuation of Acacia's assets in its 2018 annual report.
""Either their auditors are not doing their job properly and they should have taken an impairment at the 2018 year end, or this is a false statement. Which is it?” an Acacia shareholder, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Barrick spun off Acacia into a separate company in 2010, but owns 63.9% of the company.
Barrick's offer follows two years of wrangling over a $190 billion Tanzanian tax bill, which has since been reduced to $300 million. 
Even as Barrick has negotiated with the Tanzanian government to resolve the tax dispute on Acacia's behalf, relations between the two companies have soured. Acacia has blamed Barrick for being shut out of the talks, while Barrick has accused Acacia of failing to cooperate with its efforts.
Following Barrick's offer on Tuesday, Acacia said in a statement the government of Tanzania had refused to execute final agreements if Acacia is one of the counterparties.
Under UK rules, an offer for more than 30% of a company's shares requires approval by at least 50% of shareholders unrelated to the deal. But that requirement may be waived if over 50% of the target is held by one shareholder. Barrick did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.
One Barrick shareholder, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Acacia's minority shareholders appeared to have few other options than to accept the offer. 
""Take this deal or the company goes on being harassed by the Tanzanian government,"" the investor said, noting Acacia's minority shareholders may have a little leverage since Barrick ""can't do anything with the status quo either...Barrick can't sell to a third party, because nobody's going to buy Acacia without an agreement in place."" 
Shares of Acacia, which owns three mines in north-west Tanzania, opened down 8.4% in London but recovered to close 3% lower at 154.9 pence. 
Barrick shares closed 1.5% lower at C$16.01 in Toronto, broadly in line with the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index.
With much of the tax dispute stemming from the period when Barrick fully owned the Acacia assets, a deal by Barrick with the government of Tanzania to retake ownership ""feels like bare-faced cheek to us,"" analysts at Peel Hunt wrote in a note. 
Acacia's troubles in Tanzania began after President John Magufuli, nicknamed ""The Bulldozer,"" swept to power in 2015 pledging to secure a bigger share of resource wealth and cut corruption. 
The Tanzanian government accused the company of evading taxes for years by under-declaring exports, a claim Acacia has dismissed.
In February, weeks after Mark Bristow, known as a seasoned African operator, became chief executive of Barrick, the company outlined details of a deal with the Tanzanian government to settle the Acacia dispute, including a $300 million payment and a 50-50 split of economic benefits.
The news sent Acacia shares surging to their highest since October 2017, when an initial framework deal was announced, but they have since declined 42%, as a final agreement failed to materialize. 
Barrick has offered 0.153 of its own share for each Acacia share, which implies a total consideration of $285 million to the minority shareholders of Acacia.

A survey of 2,006 domestic tourists found that 31% said they were likely to spend more time on holiday in the UK this year, compared to just 8% who said they would spend less time.
Thomas Cook issued its third profit warning in less than a year last week, saying weak demand had led to increased promotional activity and earlier discounting than usual. 
It has struggled to recover from a disastrous summer last year when a heatwave in northern Europe - including Britain - dissuaded would-be travelers from booking lucrative last-minute deals, with many Britons instead opting to enjoy the sun while staying closer to home.
Thomas Cook and airlines such as easyJet (LON:EZJ) have said that uncertainty around Britain's decision to leave the European Union has contributed to a tougher environment.
The Barclays survey said that 18% cited concern over the impact that Brexit could have on foreign travel and family finances when opting for a staycation.
However, the main reasons for staycations were convenience, at 34%, and nostalgia, with 21% saying they wanted to visit places they have been before.
Over half of businesses surveyed also said that they had seen an increase in domestic tourism since 2017.

Out of 528 UK hospitality and leisure businesses, 55% had seen an increase in demand, while two in five said that bookings were being made further in advance.

FORT WORTH, Texas/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday he does not have a specific timetable to approve Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX for flight after two fatal crashes since October prompted the plane to be grounded worldwide.
The FAA is meeting with more than 30 international air regulators including China, the European Union, Brazil and Canada on Thursday to discuss a software fix and new pilot training that Boeing has been developing to ensure the jets are safe to fly.
""It's a constant give and take until it is exactly right,"" Deputy FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told reporters of the discussions with Boeing. ""It's taking as long as it takes to be right,"" he said, adding: ""I'm not tied to a timetable.""
The plane was grounded in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash just months after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which together killed 346 people.
American Airlines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have both canceled flights into August because of the 737 MAX grounding, while United Airlines has canceled flights into July.
Asked if it is realistic that the 737 MAX could be flying again by August, Elwell declined to be specific.
""If you said October I wouldn't even say that, only because we haven't finished determining exactly what the training requirements will be,"" Elwell said. ""If it takes a year to find everything we need to give us the confidence to lift the (grounding) order so be it.""
Elwell said he plans to share the FAA's ""safety analysis that will form the basis for our return to service decision process"" on Thursday. But he said the agency is still waiting for Boeing to formally submit the software upgrade for approval, and emphasized the FAA has not decided on the revised training requirements, including whether to require simulator training.
Global airlines that had rushed to buy the fuel-efficient, longer-range aircraft have since canceled flights and scrambled to cover routes that were previously flown by the MAX.
Elwell rejected any idea that he was trying to win consensus with international regulators over the path to re-approving the MAX at the meeting. ""We have to be the first to lift the order. We are the state of design,"" he said.
He said he would explain the FAA's thinking to international regulators but added: ""I'm not going to try to persuade anybody.""
At the same time, he also denied there was friction.
""We have peace with other regulators. We're talking to them constantly. You want to make this like, 'We at war with the other countries over this.' We're not,"" Elwell said.
Foreign regulators have signaled disagreements over measures to end the grounding, with Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau calling in April for pilots to receive simulator training for the MAX, rather than just computer courses.
Canada and Europe said on Wednesday they would bring back the grounded aircraft on their own terms if their specific concerns are not addressed.
""From our point of view, if we all work together and we all reach the same aim, fine. If we don't, we'll choose our own time to decide when the planes are safe to fly again,"" Canada's Garneau told Reuters in an interview. 
A spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency said on Wednesday that it would complete an additional independent design review of the plane once the FAA approves Boeing's proposed changes and establishes ""adequate training of Boeing MAX flight crews.""
Elwell told Congress last week the FAA is working closely with other civil aviation authorities ""to address specific concerns related to the 737 MAX.""

United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz said on Wednesday that FAA approval is only the first step, with public and employee confidence key to deciding when to fly its 14 MAX jets again.

110,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>",Explainer: China's rare earth supplies could be vital bargaining chip in U.S. trade war,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rare earth elements are used in a wide range of consumer products, from iPhones to electric car motors, as well as military jet engines, satellites and lasers.
Rising tensions between the United States and China have sparked concerns that Beijing could use its dominant position as a supplier of rare earths for leverage in the trade war between the two global economic powers.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS USED IN?
Rare earths are used in rechargeable batteries for electric and hybrid cars, advanced ceramics, computers, DVD players, wind turbines, catalysts in cars and oil refineries, monitors, televisions, lighting, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and glass polishing.
Several rare earth elements, such as neodymium and dysprosium, are critical to the motors used in electric vehicles. 
RARE EARTHS IN MILITARY EQUIPMENT
Some rare earth minerals are essential in military equipment such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, antimissile defense systems, satellites, as well as in lasers.
Lanthanum, for example, is needed to manufacture night vision devices.
The U.S. Defense Department accounts for about 1% of U.S. demand, which in turn accounts for about 9% of global demand for rare earths, according to a 2016 report from the congressional U.S. Government Accountability Office.
WHICH COMPANIES ARE MOST DEPENDENT ON CHINESE SUPPLIES?
Companies such as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc all make sophisticated missiles that use rare earths metals in their guidance systems, and sensors. Lockheed and BAE declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) uses rare earth elements in speakers, cameras and the so-called ""haptic"" engines that make its phones vibrate. The company says the elements are not available from traditional recyclers because they are used in such small amounts they cannot be recovered. 
Since 2010, the government and private industry have built up stockpiles of rare earths and components that use them, according to Eugene Gholz, a former senior Pentagon supply chain expert, who teaches at the University of Notre Dame.
Some suppliers have scaled back their use of such elements, he said.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS AND WHERE DO THEY OCCUR?
Rare earth metals are a group of 17 elements - lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium - that appear in low concentrations in the ground.
Although they are more abundant than their name implies, they are difficult and costly to mine and process cleanly. China hosts most of the world's processing capacity and supplied 80% of the rare earths imported by the United States from 2014 to 2017. In 2017, China accounted for 81% of the world's rare earth production, data from the U.S. Geological Survey showed.
Importers made limited efforts to reduce rare earth consumption and dependence on China after a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan in 2010. Japan accused China of halting rare earth supplies for political reasons, sparking recognition worldwide of the risks of dependence on one supplier. China denied it had halted supplies.
Few alternative suppliers were able to compete with China, which is home to 37% of global rare earths reserves.
California's Mountain Pass mine is the only operating U.S. rare earths facility. But MP Materials, owner of Mountain Pass, ships the roughly 50,000 tonnes of rare earth concentrate it extracts each year from California to China for processing. China has imposed a tariff of 25% on those imports during the trade war.
Australia's Lynas Corporation Ltd this week said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Texas-based Blue  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN) to build a rare earth processing facility in the United States.
Rare earths are also mined in India, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Estonia, Malaysia and Brazil.
HOW ARE RARE EARTHS AFFECTED BY U.S. TARIFFS?
So far, the U.S. government has exempted rare earths from tariffs on Chinese goods.
OPTIONS TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CHINESE IMPORTS
U.S. senators introduced legislation in May to encourage development of domestic supplies.
Recycling has also emerged as a potential source for rare earth minerals.

Nebraska-based Rare Earth Salts is taking old fluorescent light tubes and recycling them for their rare earth elements, which comprise about 20 percent of the bulb, according to the Association of Lamp and Mercury Recyclers.

112,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Guaido says Washington should help Venezuela keep U.S. refiner Citgo,"By Brian Ellsworth, Mayela Armas and Daniel Flynn
CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States should help Venezuela keep control over U.S. refiner Citgo by preventing its seizure by creditors seeking to collect on unpaid Venezuelan debts, opposition leader Juan Guaido said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. 
Venezuela's opposition is pushing to remove President Nicolas Maduro amid a catastrophic economic collapse that has created a humanitarian crisis. It also wants to protect overseas assets that it says will be crucial for a future economic recovery after Maduro leaves office.
Guaido, who invoked the constitution in January to assume the interim presidency after declaring Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud, said a U.S. executive order protecting Citgo from seizure was the best option to keep the refiner in Venezuelan hands.
""That would be ideal for Venezuela. It should be decided in a sovereign manner by the United States,"" he said at the headquarters of opposition party Popular Will in Caracas. ""We are looking to follow that path, given the institutional fragility of Venezuela, which is living through a dictatorship."" 
""Our objective is to protect the nation's assets, (which is necessary) because of irresponsible borrowing,"" said Guaido, who heads the opposition-run legislature. 
Houston-based Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, is the country's most important overseas asset. It is the eighth-largest U.S. refiner, with a 750,000 barrel-per-day refining network supplying 4% of America's fuel. 
The United States, along with nearly 50 countries around the world, calls Guaido Venezuela's legitimate leader and has thrown its support behind him in efforts to push Maduro from power.
Washington has levied several rounds of sanctions that have crippled Venezuela's capacity to borrow abroad and hobbled its vital oil industry by restricting crude sales to the United States. 
But the White House has not issued an executive order protecting Citgo from creditors. Washington carried out a similar measure for Iraqi assets following the U.S. invasion of that nation in 2003.
Venezuela's opposition this week hired veteran debt lawyer Lee Buchheit to help restructure its more than $150 billion in debts. In October, Buchheit co-authored a paper saying Venezuela needed a protective executive order to force debtholders reluctant to accept losses to the negotiating table.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Venezuela's Information Ministry and Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) did not respond to emails seeking comment.
SEEKING MILITARY SUPPORT
An ad-hoc board of PDVSA, made up of Guaido allies, made a $71 million interest payment this month on the company's 2020 bond, which is backed by Citgo shares.
The move was criticized by some opposition sympathizers on the grounds that Venezuela is likely to lose Citgo anyway. The same bond has a $913 million payment due in October that most believe the ad-hoc board will not have the resources to pay.
""When October comes, under the conditions of Maduro today, it will be difficult to pay,"" Guaido said in the interview. ""When October comes, we hope to be able to protect assets.""
Venezuela's inflation has topped 1 million percent, fueling malnutrition and disease. Millions of Venezuelans have fled what was once a bustling economy. 
Maduro, who blames the country's economic problems on U.S. sanctions, calls Guaido a puppet of the United States and has said he should ""face justice."" 
Guaido has called on the military to end the crisis by turning on Maduro and helping to create a transition government that can call free and fair elections. 
But the military has been slow to respond. 
A small group of officers, along with Guaido, led street protests on April 30, urging the armed forces to rise up against Maduro. But the effort collapsed when the bulk of Venezuela's military stood by the ruling Socialist Party. 
Guaido said change was being blocked by fear among military officers over taking the first step, as well as by the extensive presence of Cuban intelligence agents who conduct surveillance operations.
""What is preventing a transition? That there is a dictatorship, that there is persecution of military officers that does not allow for direct interaction between them,"" he said. ""Cuba's interference is notorious.""

Cuba has sent thousands of doctors to support Venezuela's health service. Venezuela's opposition, defecting military officers and Washington officials have also said Cuba provides intelligence services to prop up Maduro's administration. That is denied by the Venezuelan and Cuban governments.

113,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 05:44PM ET</span>",United CEO promises to rebook passengers concerned about 737 MAX,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Chief Executive Oscar Munoz promised on Wednesday to accommodate any passengers concerned about flying Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jets once regulators deem the aircraft safe to fly again.
United is the only one of the three U.S. MAX operators to make such an announcement so far. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest MAX operator, said on Wednesday discussions were still ongoing.
American Airlines Group Inc said on Wednesday ""customers can be assured that our pilots would never operate an unsafe aircraft,"" echoing other carriers' insistence that safety is paramount to putting the globally grounded jets back in the air. 
Still, following two fatal crashes of the MAX model within months, an Ethiopian Airlines jet in March after a Lion Air jet in October, Munoz said he wants customers to feel as comfortable as possible. 
""If people need any kind of adjustments we will absolutely rebook them,"" Munoz told reporters after the airline's annual shareholders' meeting.
Munoz said it was too soon to discuss whether Boeing would pick up the tab. None of the shareholders at the meeting questioned the company's MAX plans. United is in the midst of a growth plan that has fueled a 17% share rise over the past year.
Global regulators are meeting with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday to discuss Boeing's proposed software fix and training updates for the MAX, which has been grounded since mid-March.
The timing of regulatory approval is still unclear, and Munoz said that is only the first step, with independent analysis and public and employee confidence critical in the Chicago-based airline's strategy for eventually flying the jets again.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week showed U.S. fliers still value ticket prices over aircraft models when choosing flights, suggesting the crashes have had little impact on consumer sentiment. 
The No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, which trades under parent company United Continental Holdings Inc, operates 14 MAX jets and has dozens more on order.
United, American and Southwest together have canceled thousands of flights during the busy U.S. summer travel season and warned of hits to profits from the grounded MAX, which many airlines had rushed to buy thanks to the narrowbody's higher fuel-efficiency and longer range.
Still, Munoz said he was not concerned about the timetable for a return to service.

""We have to fly this aircraft for a long period of time, so a week, a month, whatever is not that important,"" Munoz said.

Federal Reserve policymakers said their patient approach to monetary policy action could continue for ""some time,"" even if the global economy improves, according to minutes of the Fed’s last meeting released today. That helped offset renewed trade jitters amid reports that Washington is set to impose restrictions on other major Chinese tech companies.

The White House move comes a day after the U.S. Commerce Department granted a 90-day license for U.S. mobile phone companies and internet broadband providers to work with Huawei to keep existing networks online and protect users from security risks.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underscored the fraught U.S.-China relations, confirming in a CNBC interview that the U.S. has no plans to go to Beijing to resume trade negotiations.

119,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 04:32PM ET</span>",Amazon shareholders reject facial recognition ban as concern grows in U.S. Congress,"By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said shareholders rejected proposals to curb and audit its facial recognition service on Wednesday, just as members of Congress indicated there was bipartisan support to one day regulate the technology.
In the past year Amazon has found itself at the center of a growing debate over the use of facial recognition by governments, with critics warning of false matches and arrests and proponents arguing it keeps the public safe. Law enforcement in Oregon and Florida have used Amazon's face and image ID service, known as Rekognition.
With support from civil liberties groups, two non-binding proposals on facial recognition made it to the ballot ahead of Amazon's shareholder meeting on Wednesday. The world's top online retailer and cloud computing company had tried to stop the votes, but it was effectively overruled by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The first proposal would have made the company stop offering facial recognition to governments unless its board determined sales did not violate civil liberties. A second would have requested a study by September of the extent to which Amazon's service harmed rights and privacy.
According to an Amazon spokeswoman, the resolutions failed by a wide margin. The vote breakdown will be disclosed at a later point in time.
Adding to shareholders' concerns was recent research that showed Amazon's technology struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears that a faulty technology would put innocent people behind bars.
Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law. It also added a web portal for people to report any abuse of the service https://pages.awscloud.com/rekognition-abuse.html.
The proposals faced an uphill battle. Amazon's board recommended against them, and Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive and founder, controls 16 percent of its stock and voting rights.
Still, critics of the technology believed the vote was beneficial.
""This shareholder intervention should serve as a wake-up call for the company to reckon with the real harms of face surveillance and to change course,"" said Shankar Narayan of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington state.
A key congressional committee also met on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to discuss the civil rights impact of all facial recognition technology, not only Amazon's. 
Responding to the shareholder vote, Democratic U.S. Representative Jimmy Gomez said, ""that just means that it's more important that Congress acts.""
Republican members of the committee expressed concern about U.S. citizens having their rights violated and their information shared with the likes of the FBI without elected officials' oversight. A second hearing on the topic is scheduled for June 4.
Any federal regulation would follow a major decision by San Francisco officials earlier this month to ban city personnel from using the technology. That contrasts with New York, Chicago and Detroit, where law enforcement have reportedly used facial recognition or acquired it with the hope of speeding up post-crime investigations.
Amazon is one of many facial recognition vendors, alongside France's Idemia, Japan's NEC Corp and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has repeatedly called for regulation and said https://reut.rs/2IygqgS it turned down sales for human rights concerns.
Mark Meadows, a Republican, said it was time to start legislating.

""You've now hit the sweet spot that brings progressives and conservatives together,"" he said.

121,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 03:42PM ET</span>","U.S. judge says Qualcomm violated antitrust law; appeal planned, shares plunge","By Sayanti Chakraborty and Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc illegally suppressed competition in the market for smartphone chips by threatening to cut off supplies and extracting excessive licensing fees, a U.S. judge ruled, a decision that could force the company to overhaul its business practices.
The decision issued late Tuesday night by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, caused Qualcomm shares to plunge 12.5 percent on Wednesday.
""Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition"" in parts of the chip market for years, harming rivals, smartphone makers, and consumers, Koh wrote in a 233-page decision.
She ordered the San Diego-based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices, without threatening to cut off supplies, and ordered that it be monitored for seven years to ensure its compliance.
Qualcomm said it will immediately ask Koh to put her decision on hold, and also seek a quick appeal to the federal appeals court in California.
""We strongly disagree with the judge's conclusions, her interpretation of the facts and her application of the law,"" general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement.
Koh's decision followed a 10-day non-jury trial in January, and is a victory for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has accused Qualcomm in 2017 of violating antitrust law.
The decision followed Qualcomm's April 16 settlement of a long-running legal battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), where Apple agreed once again to use Qualcomm chips in its iPhones, displacing  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). 
It is unclear whether the sanctions will be challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has taken a different view of the case than the FTC and emerged as an ally to Qualcomm.
On May 2, the Justice Department argued Koh should hold a hearing before placing sanctions on Qualcomm. Placing stringent conditions on the company would ""reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology,"" the agency said.
The courts are not required to defer to the Justice Department's recommendations. But ""the possibility certainly exists for Qualcomm to prevail upon appeal,"" given the government's ""somewhat schizophrenic"" approach to the case, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote.
The Justice Department was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.
UNDERMINING RIVALS
Koh said Qualcomm engaged in ""extensive"" anticompetitive conduct targeting more than one dozen original equipment manufacturers including Apple, BlackBerry, Huawei, Lenovo, LG, Motorola (NYSE:MSI), Samsung (KS:005930), and Sony, often by cutting off or threatening to cut off chip supplies or withholding technical support.
She also said Qualcomm's monopoly power in modem chips enabled the company to sustain ""unreasonably high"" royalty rates not justified by its contributions to the marketplace.
""With practices that result in exclusivity and eliminate opportunities to compete for OEM business, Qualcomm undermines rivals in every facet,"" she wrote.
She also found Qualcomm knew its licensing practices harmed competition ""yet continued anyway"" despite government investigations in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the European Union and the United States.
""This evidence of Qualcomm's intent confirms the court's conclusion that Qualcomm's practices cause anticompetitive harm because no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is doing,"" she wrote.
Koh also said testimony from some Qualcomm witnesses ""lacked credibility,"" faulting Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf and others for giving ""long, fast, and practiced narratives"" and saying company emails and notes contradicted his testimony.
Koh said Qualcomm cannot bundle patent licensing deals with its hardware, a practice regulators called ""no license, no chips."" That ruling could give chip customers more leverage in negotiations over patent terms and result in lower royalty rates for Qualcomm.
Koh also said Qualcomm must license its patents to rival chipmakers like MediaTek Inc.
Qualcomm argued during the trial that it achieved market dominance through technological leadership. The company began its licensing business in the 1980s and 1990s, decades before it began selling chips, and has charged broadly similar patent rates since then.
Qualcomm also argued that the FTC failed to show harm to competition, arguing that the chip industry is thriving and prices are declining.
The company's next move will likely be to request Koh's ruling is put on hold while the company seeks expedited review by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Qualcomm makes cellphone processors and modem chips, but generates most profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers.
""Qualcomm's customers and competitors will finally be able to negotiate licenses without the threat of having Qualcomm cut off their chip supply,"" FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in statement https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1522180/tatement_of_commissioner_chopra_ftc-qualcomm_5-22-19.pdf.
Rasgon, the Bernstein analyst, said Koh had indicated at trial she was leaning against Qualcomm, but some investors had hoped her views would be ""softened"" by the Apple settlement.

""Apparently not,"" Rasgon wrote.

122,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>","T-Mobile-Sprint deal would boost prices, hurt poorest U.S. consumers, experts say","By Diane Bartz and Sheila Dang
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concessions by T-Mobile US Inc to win U.S. government approval to buy Sprint Corp will likely lead to higher prices for the poorest Americans, many of whom use prepaid wireless plans, analysts and activists said.
The more expensive prepaid plans, used by people who lack the good credit to qualify for a cheaper postpaid plan means low-income users will have less access to the internet for job hunts and job applications, and for children to do homework, activists say. With postpaid, people pay with credit cards or monthly bank withdrawals. 
Cost matters. Pew Research Center found in 2015 that 48% of the people they polled had to cancel or shut off their cell phone service for at least a short time because they could not afford it.
T-Mobile and Sprint said on Monday they would sell Sprint's Boost Mobile business, which sells prepaid plans, and ensure that the divested company has access to a wireless network for six years. 
The offer was enough for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai to agree to support the proposed transaction, he said on Monday. The two other Republican commissioners indicated they would also back the deal, giving it the needed three votes out of five.
The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division staff has recommended the agency block the deal, leaving the decision up to political appointees.
Free Press, an advocacy group, urged the Justice Department to block the acquisition, saying it will exacerbate an existing ""affordability crisis"" that makes it hard for poorer people to get online, said its general counsel, Matt Wood. 
""People who rely on prepaid services won't see any benefits from the conditions the FCC is touting.""
Sprint and T-Mobile customers were likely to see weighted average prices rise a minimum of 4.2% for prepaid services and 4.8% for postpaid, satellite television provider Dish Network Corp, a critic of the deal, said in an FCC filing last year. Currently Boost offers four lines with unlimited data, talk and text for $100 per month.
Prepaid service is often favored by poorer people because there is no need to pass a credit check. 
Selling Boost Mobile, one of three brands that Sprint uses to provide prepaid wireless service, will do little to bring down market concentration in that market, said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson LLC.
Moffett put T-Mobile's prepaid market share at 41% and Sprint at 17%, giving them 58% if they were to merge without divestitures. It is not known how much of Sprint's market share comes from Boost.
Boost would rely on the combined company to provide spectrum and network access for at least six years.
Boost operates using Sprint’s spectrum and network. Under the companies' proposal, only the brand will be sold and it will remain dependent on Sprint for spectrum and network access.
If the spectrum to support Boost is divested, ""that would then qualify (Boost) as a real competitor and not be dependent on somebody else's network,"" said Roger Entner, a telecommunications analyst with Recon Analytics.
Entner argued that Boost has seen better days.
""Boost recently lost their distribution at  Target  (NYSE:TGT), and Best Buy is redoing the way it sells wireless. A huge part of Boost's distribution is either falling away or changing the way they do business, none of which are good signs for Boost,"" he added. 
Sprint would retain its Sprint brand prepaid business and Virgin Mobile, another prepaid brand. T-Mobile would keep Metro, its prepaid business.
Sprint's prepaid subscriber base had been shrinking but has turned around and has been growing for more than two years, with Boost expanding and Virgin Mobile losing subscribers, according to Sprint filings with the government.
Despite the Boost sale, the activist group Public Knowledge said the poor would pay more, especially after T-Mobile's 6-year commitment to Boost expires.
""The low-income and prepaid consumers who have turned to lower cost (providers) will likely be forced to pay higher prices post-merger as a combined T-Mobile/Sprint exercise their market power to raise wholesale prices,"" the group said in a statement.

Sprint shares fell nearly 9% to $6.58, while T-Mobile fell 1.2% to $76.21.

Citigroup cut its price target on Tesla to $191 from $238 and said it sees an increasing chance that Tesla shares will drop more than 80% on concerns about the company's hefty debt load and free cash flow, sending its share price 4.5% lower. Tesla shares, trading at just under $196, are down 41% this year, nearly 18% this month alone.
The bank outlined three potential scenarios for Tesla's stock: a 40% chance of a worst-case scenario slump to $36, a 55% chance of a moderate-bull-scenario rise to $253 and a 5% chance of best-case scenario rally to $760.
Morgan Stanley a day earlier cut its worst-case forecast on the electric car maker's share price to just $10, citing burdening debt loads and potential weaker demand from China. Robert W. Baird also was negative on the stock on Tuesday.
The increasing concerns about Tesla, which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter, come as its cash burn continues to outpace the growth required to eventually turn the electric motor vehicle company into a self-funded entity.
Acknowledging the burning hole its balance sheet, which many believe impairs its ability execute its growth plans, Tesla recently raised up to $2.3 billion in new capital.
Despite the flurry of bearish notes on the electric automaker, there are some on Wall Street who are wary of suggesting that the sun is setting on Tesla.
""In our view, this could set up for a short squeeze in the coming days/weeks/ months should deliveries, profits/losses, cash flow/burn come in even slightly better than draconian expectations, or should (CEO Elon) Musk introduce another business venture and/or longer-term financial target that once again gets bulls excited about the story,"" Merrill Lynch said."
126,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>","IBM, Cera Care to test self-driving car tech in elder homes","By Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) -  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and British start-up Cera Care plan a six-month pilot to test whether lidar laser sensors, used to help self-driving cars ""see"", can enable elderly people to stay in their homes for longer - without compromising privacy.
Lidar systems that work by using laser light pulses to render fine-grained images of surroundings, have typically been used to make high-resolution maps, catch speeding motorists and more recently help automated cars navigate through the streets.
If the pilot is successful, it could potentially open up a new market for lidar just as it falls out of favor with some automakers, including Nissan and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), who have called it expensive and unnecessary.
Jack Narcotta, a senior smart home analyst at Strategy Analytics, said lidar lasers were one of the more advanced solutions for elderly monitoring, but were still in the very early stages.
Even though lidar doesn't recognize faces, some consumers may be concerned about the amount of tracking and location data collected and the ability to see repeatable patterns, he said.
In the pilot, IBM Research UK and Cera Care plan to install lidar sensors in around 10-15 volunteer households in Britain from June, and see whether they can build up a detailed picture of a care client's daily routine and home environment using IBM's machine learning software.
Their aim is to alert caregivers to any possible deterioration in a person's physical and psychological health, such as changes in gait, or emergency situations such as a fall.
Ben Maruthappu, co-founder and CEO of Cera Care, hopes the technology will help the care system become more personalized even as the demand for care outgrows the number of careworkers on the front line.
""Technology like this can help us solve that gap between demand and supply because it means we can pinpoint when a careworker needs to be in a person's home,"" Maruthappu told Reuters. 
The world's population is aging rapidly, with those over 60 expected to more than double to 2 billion by 2050 from 900 million in 2015, according to the World Health Organization.
EMERGING FIELD
Lidar sensors have become a key element in self-driving systems from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo. But their use in the home remains an emerging field. 
Narcotta sees competition from the likes of 'Hive Link', a connected care service from a division of Centrica's British Gas, launched last December, that uses sensors and smart plugs to learn a person's routine and sends notifications to subscribers when it detects any unusual changes.
Nicola Palmarini, IBM's top research scientist for aging and longevity, says lidar - which doesn't recognize personal characteristics such as faces, age and gender - provides precise data without people feeling like they are being watched.
He believes they will only need one lidar sensor per room, potentially making it more scalable and reducing overall care costs if people can stay at home for longer.
Still, the technology comes with a high price-tag, with 3D sensors currently costing between $800 and $1,000 each, according to Palmarini. He expects the cost to fall over time. 
Aejaz Zahid, a director at assistroniX and expert on new technologies to help people age well, said one major benefit of lidar could be fall detection - a major pain point for health systems that researchers have struggled to crack with wearables.
Other firms looking at lidar's potential in the smart home include scanning technology maker Microvision that has launched a lidar sensor with a range of up to 10 metres with machine-learning capabilities.
Researchers are also examining the possibility of using lidar to give smart home devices ""vision"".

While there is some concern that prolonged staring into even Class I lasers - which use less power - may pose a risk to eyesight, IBM and Cera Care said they plan to trial lidar technology that has been certified as safe for domestic use.

127,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>",SEC sets dates for first phase of disputed exchange pricing plan,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will begin the first phase of a plan aimed at evaluating how stock exchange fees and incentives affect how brokers trade, even as several exchanges sue the regulator in an attempt to kill the experiment. 
Exchanges will have to start collecting data on how brokers route stock orders to the exchanges starting on July 1, through Dec. 31, according to a regulatory notice released late on Tuesday.
The SEC approved its so-called Transaction Fee Pilot in December, aimed at testing how the rebate payments paid by most exchanges to brokers for stock orders that others can trade against influences brokers' behavior. 
The payments added up to about $2.5 billion collectively last year and critics of the regime, which include some of the world's largest asset managers, say it may cause brokers to send customer orders to the exchanges that pay the most, even if those customer orders might get better results elsewhere.
The exchanges argue the rebates help attract liquidity, while also compensating brokers, especially market makers, for taking the risk of providing two-sided bid and ask prices for others to trade against. Without them, bid-ask spreads will widen out, making it more costly to trade, the exchanges have said. 
The pilot would in some cases ban the rebates altogether for some stocks and lower exchange transaction fees. 
In February, Nasdaq Inc, Cboe Global Markets and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE, which run 12 of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges currently operating, filed lawsuits against the regulator, calling the plan an exercise in government price-setting that would harm competition.
That led the SEC to temporarily stay part of the pilot program, which was recommended by a SEC-appointed committee of market experts as well as by the U.S. Treasury in a report in late 2017, until the legal challenge was heard.

But the SEC said the exchanges must still begin collecting the broker routing data needed to inform the experiment before it begins. That way if the courts find in favor of the regulator, it could start the pilot as soon as possible.

136,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 12:25PM ET</span>",SEC tells exchanges to better justify the fees they charge,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has told equities exchanges they must clearly describe and justify how they set their fees, including how they charge for market data and connectivity, potentially limiting future revenue growth. 
The exchanges must ""fully and fairly describe"" their proposed fees and show that they are reasonable, equitably allocated, not unfairly discriminatory, or an undue burden competition, as required by the Exchange Act, SEC staff said in guidance released late on Tuesday. 
The move was prompted by a years-long dispute over what many brokers and investors see as sky-rocketing costs for things like market data and connectivity to the exchanges, both of which are essential for trading, but are also major revenue drivers for most exchanges. 
Collectively, exchange operators including New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets, file hundreds of new fees or rebates, or changes to existing ones, with the SEC per year. Because the exchanges are considered self-regulatory organizations, the rule filings become immediately effective.
But last year the SEC increased its scrutiny of fee filings, putting a wide swath of them under review as part of a broader effort by the regulator under Chairman Jay Clayton to improve transparency around exchange pricing. 
The exchanges have appealed the decision and the fees are still in place, but the SEC guidance released Tuesday indicated the exchanges must do a better job justifying their fees or continue to have them temporarily suspended and put under review.
""Competition remains robust in the exchange industry and we will continue to work closely with our clients and the SEC to ensure transparency and fairness,"" Nasdaq spokesman Allan Schoenberg said in a statement.
In January a group of large Wall Street firms, including Virtu Financial,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp, said they plan to launch a new exchange that will offer ""lower pricing on market data, and connectivity and transaction fees."" 
The so-called Members Exchange said it plans to file its exchange application this year.
IEX Group, the only independent U.S. exchange currently operating, has also been a critic of its peers and called the SEC guidance ""a major milestone in bringing more transparency"" to the market. 

""We applaud the Commission's efforts to hold exchanges accountable for justifying the fees they charge for market data and connectivity - services where exchanges have rightly been criticized for exerting monopoly pricing power.""

137,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 12:14PM ET</span>","Gold miners must focus on returns, mergers to attract investment: Barrick CEO","By Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - Gold miners must focus on maximizing returns and more mergers to attract investors seeking to diversify after years of under-investing in mines, Barrick Gold's chief executive said on Wednesday.
""The industry is in decline and we have put ourselves in a very a tight spot because we haven't invested in exploration and our future,"" said Mark Bristow, who took the helm in January at Barrick after its takeover of Africa's Randgold (LON:RRS).
""The supply side of our industry is very tight.""
Gold miners have for years been accused of eroding profits through expensive deals but the takeovers of Randgold by Barrick and Goldcorp by  Newmont Mining  (NYSE:NEM) has spurred speculation about a pick up in long-dormant gold M&A.
Bristow said of the recent consolidation ""while (it) is important, we have got to become relevant.""
Barrick in March pulled its $18 billion offer for Newmont and agreed instead to form a joint venture in Nevada with its rival, ending a hostile takeover bid that sought to unite the world's two largest gold producers.
On Tuesday, Barrick offered to buyout the remaining 36.1% of shares it does not already own in London-listed Acacia Mining at a discount to its current share price.
Bristow declined to comment on the issue further.
The Nevada operation, which will be 61.5% owned by Barrick, will be reviewing mine plans and based on geological and geotechnical modeling will be reviewing mining methods and along with other assets in the miner's portfolio will be focusing the combined team on driving efficiency improvements, Bristow said.
""We have to be better we have to be more focused on returns if we going to attract investment around our industry,"" Bristow told delegates at a conference. 
""The world has never been more chaotic economically than it is today ... people are searching for alternative reserve currencies and gold will play a natural role as it has done."" 
Analysts say gold has recently failed to fully capitalize on its traditional role as a hedge against financial and political uncertainties with investors betting more on a run in riskier assets such as stocks. 
But analysts at Swiss bank Julius Baer said investors seeking safe havens would be lured into gold by expectations of a U.S. recession and a related cooling of global growth towards the end of next year.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi commercial court has accepted a filing by conglomerate AHAB to have its decade-long dispute with creditors resolved under the kingdom's new bankruptcy law, and rejected a demand to liquidate the company filed by two of its creditors, sources familiar with the matter said.
The bankruptcy filing was seen as a key test of Saudi Arabia's new law for handling insolvency disputes, which became effective last year as part of reforms aimed at making the country more investor friendly.
Following an appeal, the Dammam Commercial Court earlier this week reconsidered its previous rejection of AHAB's (Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Brothers) filing for a financial restructuring procedure and approved it, the sources said.
The financial restructuring is one of the procedures envisaged by the bankruptcy law introduced last year. 
The court also rejected a parallel application for liquidation of AHAB which was filed by two of its creditors, HSBC and Raiffeisen Bank, the sources said.
AHAB and HSBC declined to comment, while Raiffeisen Bank did not respond to a request for comment.
Creditors have been pursuing AHAB and Saad Group, another Saudi conglomerate, since they defaulted on about $22 billion in combined debt in 2009.
AHAB wanted to move the jurisdiction of its case under the bankruptcy law to avoid the risk of a disorganised liquidation.
Earlier this year it applied for a ""protective settlement procedure"" under the law. After that was rejected, it applied for the financial restructuring procedure.
The court is now expected to appoint a bankruptcy trustee who will collect and assess creditors' claims.
The International Bank Corporation (TIBC), a defaulted Bahraini bank which has nearly $3 billion in claims against AHAB, welcomed the court's decision to accept financial restructuring, saying this would provide clarity going forward.
""The appointed independent trustee may recognize the cost implications of continued legal challenges against TIBC's claims ... and review our claims objectively,"" a TIBC spokesman told Reuters. 
TIBC, now administered by Bahrain's central bank, raised money in international markets, transferring the funds to AHAB in what a Cayman Islands court last year called one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.
AHAB, which denies knowledge of the scheme, collapsed after TIBC defaulted on a foreign exchange deal with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in 2009.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division staff has recommended the agency block T-Mobile US Inc's $26 billion acquisition of smaller rival Sprint Corp, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
While Justice Department staff balked at the merger, the Federal Communications Commission indicated on Monday it had reached an agreement in principle with the companies to allow the deal after the companies agreed to sell Sprint's prepaid brand Boost Mobile.
The final decision on whether to allow two of the four nationwide wireless carriers to merge now lies with political appointees at the department, headed by antitrust division chief Makan Delrahim.
Sprint shares fell 4.2% at $6.92 while T-Mobile dipped nearly 1% at $76.49. 
The Justice Department, which often follows staff recommendations, is expected to make a final decision in about a month, the sources said.
Staff at the antitrust division, who remain in their jobs even when administrations change, have long been skeptical of the proposed merger, sources have told Reuters.
T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.
T-Mobile and the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.
One critic of the deal, Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, the nonprofit public interest group, said top brass in the Justice Department's antitrust division do not generally overrule the staff but they occasionally do.
""I'd be extremely surprised if the front office overruled this,"" added Kimmelman, a veteran of the Obama Justice Department.
A second antitrust expert, who declined to be identified, noted a previous deal during the Trump administration in which staff recommended filing a lawsuit to block the transaction but they were overruled.
AT&T and Verizon each have 34% of the U.S. wireless market, T-Mobile has 18% and Sprint has 12%, analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson said in a blog post this week. Smaller carrier make up the balance.
In discussions with the FCC, T-Mobile and Sprint also promised not to terminate a deal that would allow cable operator Altice USA Inc to offer mobile phone service later this year using Sprint's network.
Altice had urged the FCC to reject the deal because it was concerned it would be stopped from offering the phone service.
The companies also pledged that the merged company would build a ""world-leading"" 5G network, touted as the next generation of wireless service. They promised to give rural Americans robust 5G broadband and enhanced home broadband.
The FCC and Justice Department almost always agree publicly on merger reviews, and experts say they have not had a major review disagreement in four decades.
Now, state attorneys general and public utility commissions will review the deal, potentially pushing a closing to the third quarter of this year, a Citibank note said.

T-Mobile, which is about 63 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), has about 80 million customers. Sprint, about 84 percent owned by SoftBank Corp, has some 55 million customers.

Hit with a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7 billion) EU fine two years ago for unfairly promoting its own comparison shopping service, Google has since offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the measure appeared to be working.
""Now we are in a situation where in 75 percent of queries there would be at least one rival to Google in the shopping box and 40 percent of clicks would go to a merchant hosted by one of the rivals,"" Vestager told reporters on the sidelines of a Centre for European Reform event.
""This means we do not have a non-compliance case but at the same time also means that we keep monitoring monthly developments,"" she added.
British online shopping rival Kelkoo disputed Vestager's assessment.
""Overall, there has been no meaningful change in the number of users accessing comparison services other than Google's,"" Kelkoo Chief Executive Richard Stables said.
Open Internet Project, another Google competitor, voiced similar criticism last week.

""By putting these Google-powered Shopping Units at the top of every relevant results page, above more relevant comparison services, Google continues to reserve the important market for comparison shopping services to itself,"" it said in a statement.

146,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 09:33AM ET</span>","Citing Reuters report, health groups push tech firms to police tobacco marketing","By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - More than 100 public health and anti-tobacco organizations are calling on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, Twitter and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) to take ""swift action"" to curb advertising of tobacco products on their platforms.
The organizations' letter to the firms cited a recent Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philipmorris-ecigs-instagram-exclusiv/exclusive-philip-morris-suspends-social-media-campaign-after-reuters-exposes-young-influencers-idUSKCN1SH02K documenting how cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) has used young personalities on Instagram to sell a new ""heated tobacco"" product called IQOS. 
The groups said social media firms are not doing enough to regulate ""influencers"" on their platforms who are hired by companies to promote nicotine products.
No law specifically prevents online tobacco or e-cigarette marketing, but social media firms have policies limiting it. The health groups said in their letter that the use of online personalities creates a ""loophole"" in those policies and allows ""rampant marketing"" of tobacco and other nicotine products to youth. 
Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, are studying the issue ""to understand how we can improve,"" said spokeswoman Stephanie Otway.
The platforms currently ban brand advertising of tobacco products, Otway said. Their policies require any sponsored ""influencer"" posts that explicitly recommended buying tobacco products be restricted only to people over 18. 
But the same restriction would not apply to posts by paid influencers that depict tobacco products favorably without explicitly saying that people should buy them, Otway said.
In making policy for a billion users, the company has to draw lines between advertising, promotional posts and ""someone having an opinion,"" Otway said. 
Twitter spokeswoman Elizabeth Luke said the company prohibits “the promotion of tobacco products, accessories and brands worldwide” but declined to comment on whether that includes influencers paid to feature tobacco products on their accounts.
A Reuters review of Twitter policies shows that its tobacco promotion ban does not include such marketing posts by individuals. 
Reuters identified several Twitter posts over the last two years from influencers who posted photographs with IQOS devices or linked back to Instagram accounts promoting the product. Twitter did not comment on the posts identified by Reuters. 
Snap Inc did not respond to requests for comment. 
The more than 100 organizations from 48 countries that signed the letter https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/content/press_office/2019/2019_05_21_socialmarketing.pdf, which was sent to the companies Friday and publicly released Wednesday, included the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the Japan Society for Tobacco Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Reuters earlier this month documented how Philip Morris had used young social media influencers, including a 21-year-old woman in Russia, to promote its IQOS device. The company's internal marketing standards prohibit it from using youth-oriented celebrities or ""models who are or appear to be under the age of 25.""
Philip Morris said May 10 that it launched an internal investigation and suspended all ""product-related digital influencer actions globally"" after Reuters sought the company's comment on examples of Instagram posts and photographs depicting young, hip women advertising IQOS.
PHILIP MORRIS SUSPENDS MARKETING, THEN DEFENDS IT
All of the posts referenced in the Reuters report remained online as of Tuesday evening. In addition, Reuters has identified new examples of Instagram content featuring young people with the IQOS posted in the days since Philip Morris said it had suspended its influencer campaigns.
Several posts under the Instagram account @iqos_egypt over the past week have featured young men and women https://www.instagram.com/p/BxpAQf6n5JU/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link using the device at bars or cocktail events. Other posts from accounts using the IQOS name in Poland, Armenia, Italy and Iran over the last week also showed, trendy men and women using the devices.
Other posts emerged over the last week from a photographer who documented an IQOS-sponsored VIP lounge at an April music festival in Colombia.
A representative for an IQOS store in Sarno, Italy, said employees found the recent photos of women using IQOS elsewhere online and reposted them on the store's Instagram account. A representative of an IQOS-branded Instagram account in Armenia denied being paid by Philip Morris to promote the product.
Other Instagram account owners promoting IQOS did not respond to requests for comment. None of the influencers mentioned in the May 10 Reuters report responded to requests for comment on whether they had been asked to stop posting or remove posts marketing Philip Morris products.
Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the firm had ""directed that there should be no new posts"" by influencers. Sparrow did not respond to questions about whether the company had stopped paying influencers or attempted to remove existing posts.
Sparrow said some of the new posts ""seem to originate from third parties, not PMI, and in countries where we do not sell IQOS,"" noting Eqypt and Iran.
Sparrow defended the suspended marketing campaign as a vital way to inform adult cigarette smokers about safer options. He blasted the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids for ""trying to pressure us ... to effectively block these channels"" and ""in effect perpetuating the consumption of tobacco in its most harmful form: combustible cigarettes.""
Caroline Renzulli, a spokeswoman for the anti-tobacco campaign, called it ""laughable"" that Philip Morris used social media to market to adults.
Philip Morris International has licensed  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc to market the IQOS device in the United States beginning this summer. 
Altria, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, has previously said it has a policy of not advertising on social media. However, an online job posting from the company in March seeks a ""digital marketing specialist"" for the ""IQOS brand team."" The ideal candidate will develop marketing strategy for ""e-commerce, owned websites, social media and influencers.""
Altria spokesman David Sutton said the company has no plans to use social media influencers to market IQOS but did not respond to questions about the job posting mentioning an influencer strategy.
REGULATORY GRAY AREA
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month decided to allow U.S. sales of the IQOS device after a two-year review process in which Philip Morris repeatedly assured the regulator that it would warn young people away from the product.
Digital advertising of tobacco products remains a gray area for regulators globally. Tobacco advertising regulations in the United States and elsewhere were written before the rise of social media marketing. 
The FDA, however, can exert authority over the digital marketing of new devices it clears for sale. As a condition of allowing Philip Morris to sell the IQOS device, the agency requires the company to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches with online marketing.
Philip Morris, through Altria, is also required to submit information on any new U.S. advertising campaigns to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them.
A global treaty governing tobacco regulations, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization, urges countries worldwide to entirely ban tobacco advertising. A 2018 WHO report about tobacco promotion in entertainment and social media channels acknowledged the challenges of regulating it.

The ability to share posts, it found, has ""has blurred the lines between consumer and brand owner.""

Carriers in Japan, Taiwan and Britain stopped taking early orders for newer smartphone models from Huawei Technologies Co. on Wednesday or shelved plans to offer its handsets equipped for new fifth-generation wireless networks.
Trump’s move last week to put Huawei on an export blacklist amid a trade war with Beijing threatens to cut the tech company off from U.S. software and component suppliers. Telecom operators fear that could affect the functioning of its newest handsets as Huawei won’t get access to the most popular version of the Android mobile operating system developed by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google.
If the boycotts multiply, it would be a major blow to Shenzhen-based Huawei, which is trying to overtake Korea’s Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. as the world’s No.1 handset supplier this year after already leapfrogging Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Mobile phones and other devices in Huawei’s consumer business account for almost half of its revenue.
Over a billion smartphones are sold annually worldwide and many are bought wholesale by telecom operators who include them in their wireless subscription plans for a monthly fee, making them a vital sales channel.
Britain’s BT Group (LON:BT) Plc decided not to include Huawei phones in Britain’s first 5G network because of uncertainty over whether they could use Android, a spokesman for the carrier said.
“We’ve put the Huawei devices on pause until we’ve got a bit more information on that,” the head of BT’s consumer division Marc Allera told reporters ahead of the start of 5G services next week.
Rival  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc paused pre-orders for the Huawei Mate 20X (5G) in the U.K. as “a temporary measure while uncertainty exists regarding new Huawei 5G devices,” a spokesman said.
NTT Docomo Inc., Japan’s largest operator, said it stopped taking pre-orders for Huawei’s new P30 handset and KDDI Corp. delayed the introduction of the phone indefinitely, without elaborating. SoftBank Corp.’s YMobile announced a similar move, citing concerns over the availability of software updates. Taiwanese carrier Chunghwa Telecom Co. said it won’t procure new Huawei models.
Anxious Consumers
Huawei phones developed and certified by Google before May 16 will still get access to Google’s Play app store and its pre-loaded apps and services. Updates from Google will continue as they are transactions between Google and end users, not Google and Huawei.
However, Google won’t be allowed to work with Huawei on software bugs and other technical fixes. Instead, the Chinese firm will have to do this on its own, using the open-source version of Android.
Some owners of Huawei phones around the world took to social media to express concern over the potential impact on their handsets. Huawei’s marketing team assured customers their phones would continue to be safe and usable.
Should Google’s system no longer be available, “then the alternative option will naturally come out -- either from Huawei or someone else,” Abraham Liu, Huawei’s representative to the European Union institutions, said at an event in Brussels on Tuesday.
Europe is a vital market for Huawei’s consumer business because of its appetite for high-end phones. It’s also the region’s biggest supplier of mobile network equipment and has staked out a core role in rolling out 5G networks worth billions of euros. Huawei is already effectively barred from the U.S.
With U.S. allies under growing pressure to restrict Huawei, carriers have been reviewing their ties to the company and devising back-up plans in case of bans or supply disruption.
In the U.K., BT plans to remove Huawei from the core of its EE unit’s 4G network, while giving it a major role supplying 5G infrastructure.
The Trump blacklist “affects the devices more than it does the radio access network,” said BT’s Chief Technology Officer, Howard Watson. “There are also U.S. suppliers to Huawei radio access equipment. That’s something we’re monitoring very closely as well.”
A spokesman for Huawei in the U.K., commenting on the smartphone decision by BT’s mobile unit EE, said: “Our priority remains focusing on our customers and their requirements. We look forward to continuing our successful collaboration with EE.”

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) beat first-quarter estimates for same-store sales and profit on Wednesday, as the retailer's investments in same-day delivery and store revamps drew in more shoppers, sending its shares up more than 7%.
For the last couple of years, Target has been pouring money into services as it tries to better compete with online giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and brick-and-mortar rival Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
With customers increasingly expecting faster deliveries, Target's services such as Shipt, order pickup and drive-up allow shoppers to pull into a store and pick-up their orders within minutes of placing them through the mobile app or website.
These delivery options drove more than 25% of the better-than-expected 4.8% growth in same-store sales and over half of its 42% growth in comparable digital sales in the quarter.
""Throughout this year, we will continue to extend the reach of our same-day fulfillment options, strengthen our portfolio of owned and exclusive brands,"" Chief Executive officer Brian Cornell said in a statement.
Target's strategy to build on its pricing and digital plans and open smaller stores in college towns and urban areas helped store traffic rise 4.3% in the quarter.
""Its 1Q print was one of the strongest thus far this earnings season and one of best we've seen from Target in quite some time,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said.
The company's net earnings rose to $795 million, or $1.53 per share, in the first quarter ended May 4. Analysts on average were expecting it to earn $1.43 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The strong results was followed by a second-quarter adjusted profit forecast of $1.52 to $1.72 per share, which was largely above expectations.

Total revenue rose 5% to $17.63 billion in the quarter and topped expectations of $17.52 billion.

SINGAPORE/MANILA (Reuters) - Mobile phone retailers in some Asian countries are refusing to accept Huawei devices for trade-ins, as more consumers look to offload their device on worries Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suspending business with the Chinese firm will disrupt services.
Google has said it will comply with an order by U.S. President Donald Trump to stop supplying Huawei, meaning current owners of Huawei phones face being cut off from updates of the Android operating system from late August. New phones will lose access to popular apps such as YouTube and Chrome. 
Against this backdrop, some customers in Singapore and the Philippines have rushed to sell their Huawei phones, according to retailers and online marketplace data. 
But there are few takers.
""If we buy something that is useless, how are we going to sell it?,"" said Dylan On, a salesman at Wanying Pte Ltd, a Singapore retail and repair shop.
""It's not that Huawei is a bad product. It's a very good product. It's just that nobody wants to buy it now because of U.S. policy,"" he said, adding he was looking to sell existing Huawei stock online to overseas buyers in hopes they are less aware of current events. 
Huawei did not respond to a request for comment.
The company has said it is developing its own phone software and it can still use an ""open source"" version of Android that lacks access to Google apps. Huawei also went ahead with a new phone launch in Britain on Tuesday, even as the number of users trading in their devices rose in Asia.
Previously, about five people a day were looking to trade in their Huawei phones, but that has jumped to 20 in the last two days, said Zack, a salesman at Mobile Square (NYSE:SQ) in Singapore who declined to give his last name.
""Normally, you would see people wanting to trade their old phones as they want to replace them with new ones,"" he added. ""Now you're seeing people wanting to trade in the latest one.""
Carousell, Singapore's most popular online marketplace, said the number of Huawei phone sales more than doubled the day the U.S. order was announced. 
Huawei smartphones had a 14 percent share of the Singapore market last year, according to research firm Canalys.
PHILIPPINES
Mobile phone retailers in the Philippines are also staying away from Huawei products.
""We are no longer accepting Huawei phones. It will not be bought by our clients anymore,"" Hamida Norhamida, a saleswoman of new and used phones in Manila's Greenhills shopping center told Reuters, adding that she felt relieved to have sold off her stock of Huawei P30 Pro ahead of Google's Monday announcement. 
Another phone salesperson at Greenhills said she would only buy Huawei phones at a 50% discount. 
""Selling it will be a gamble,"" said the saleswoman, who would give her name only as Thelma.
But some see this as an opportunity to get a quality phone on the cheap. ""My immediate reaction was worry that my current Huawei could be worthless,"" Xin Yi, 24 year-old student from Singapore, told Reuters. ""But Google said current Huawei users will not be affected ... after that, I was relieved."" 
She added that she was now in the market for a new Huawei model at a marked-down price. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Japanese telcos KDDI Corp and SoftBank Corp's low-cost mobile brand Ymobile said they would delay the launch of Huawei P30 Lite smartphone which was due to go on sale on Friday.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - French supermarket groups Casino and Intermarche are being investigated by EU antitrust inspectors, the companies said on Wednesday, after EU regulators said they were looking into a potential breach of rules that prohibit cartels.
The European Commission said its antitrust inspectors raided the premises of two French grocery retailers earlier this week as part of a preliminary investigation. It did not identify the companies and said the move did not mean they were guilty. 
Casino said separately that Commission agents visited its Paris headquarters this week, but did not provide further details.
Le Figaro newspaper reported Intermarche's headquarters were also raided. The company told Reuters it ""confirms the European Commission's ongoing probe,"" but declined to give details.
""The Commission has concerns that two grocery retail companies may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive businesses practices,"" it said in a statement.
""The fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behavior nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself,"" it added.
There is no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anti-competitive conduct. Their duration depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of each case and the extent to which the companies concerned cooperate with the Commission.
Casino and Intermarche announced in 2014 a purchasing alliance in France that was dissolved last year when Casino and France's Auchan sealed a global buying deal.

France has seen a flurry of purchasing alliances in recent years as supermarkets battle to keep prices down to counter fierce competition from rivals offering prices at discounts and the looming shadow of U.S. internet giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

The U.S. government may blacklist up to five Chinese surveillance companies from purchasing U.S. software goods or components, according to reports that come just a few days after a similar curb on Huawei caused a sell-off of technology stocks. One of the companies named, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology (SZ:002415), fell as much as 10% in the Chinese trading session in response to the news.
Dow futures fell 5 points or 0.602% by 6:41 AM ET (10:41 GMT), while tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 13 points or 0.2% and S&P 500 futures was down 1 point or 0.1%
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) slumped 9% after a federal judge ruled the company had suppressed cellphone chip competition, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was down 0.3% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 1.9%, still suffering from a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note that laid out a ""bear case"" for the stock falling over 90% from its current level.
Retail companies will be in focus after a batch of disappointing earnings on Tuesday. Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) tumbled 10.2% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after its sales figures failed to meet expectations.
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) slumped 10% in premarket trade after cutting its outlook for the year on the back of a disappointing first quarter.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) is also expected to report before the open.
On the economic front, the Federal Reserve will release its meeting minutes from May 1, when it left interest rates unchanged.

158,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp supervisory board leaves room for elevator sale: sources,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board has left the door open for a potential sale of the group's elevator unit, which CEO Guido Kerkhoff prefers should be listed on the stock exchange, two people familiar with the matter said.
The board, which approved Kerkhoff's new turnaround plan on Tuesday, unanimously backed the planned initial public offering (IPO) of a minority stake in Elevator Technology (ET), Thyssenkrupp's most profitable unit.
But it asked Thyssenkrupp's management to also consider the most sensible economic options for ET, which has caught the eye of Finnish rival Kone, the people said, potentially leaving room for a sale.
Kerkhoff would have to review any offer for ET made by an outside party for the unit as part of his mandate, even though the listing is his plan A to raise cash and ease pressure on the group's stretched balance sheet, the people said.
A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) referred to Tuesday's statement saying the supervisory board had unanimously backed management's strategy.
Unlike an IPO, a sale of ET to a rival bears significant antitrust risks - a key concern for investors after Brussels blocked a planned steel joint venture with Tata Steel - which could delay a sale.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp rose as much as 10.9% last week after sources told Reuters that Kone was assessing the viability of a bid for ET.
Powerful labour leaders, who control half of Thyssenkrupp's 20-member supervisory board, support the IPO plans and are sceptical of a potential sale of ET, concerned it could lead to thousands of job cuts.
Boersen-Zeitung earlier reported that Thyssenkrupp would pursue a dual-track process for ET to keep options open, citing shareholder sources.

Kerkhoff's new strategy also includes 6,000 job cuts and a flexible approach to ownership of its individual business units, including plant engineering, car parts, steel, materials trading and shipbuilding.

160,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 06:32AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Behind Grindr's doomed hookup in China, a data misstep and scramble to make up","By Echo Wang and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Early last year, Grindr LLC's Chinese owner gave some Beijing-based engineers access to personal information of millions of Americans such as private messages and HIV status, according to eight former employees, prompting U.S. officials to ask it to sell the dating app for the gay community.
After taking full control of Grindr in January 2018, Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd stepped up management changes and consolidated operations to cut costs and expand operations in Asia, one former employee familiar with the decision said.
In the process, some of the company's engineers in Beijing got access to the Grindr database for several months, eight former employees said.
While it is known that data privacy concerns prompted the crackdown on Kunlun, interviews with over a dozen sources with knowledge of Grindr's operations, including the former employees, for the first time shed light on what the company actually did to draw U.S. ire and how it then tried to save its deal.
Reuters found no evidence that the app's database was misused. Nevertheless, the decision to give its engineers in Beijing access to Grindr's database proved to be a misstep for Kunlun, one of the largest Chinese mobile gaming companies.
In early 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies, started looking into the Grindr deal to see whether it raised any national security risks, one source close to the company said. 
Last September, it ordered Kunlun to restrict access of its Beijing-based engineers to Grindr's database, the source said.
Kunlun did not respond to requests for comment. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on behalf of CFIUS.
A Grindr spokeswoman said ""the privacy and security of our users' personal data is and always will be a top priority.""
DATA PRIVACY FOCUS
Two former national security officials said the acquisition heightened U.S. fears about the potential of data misuse at a time of tense China-U.S. relations. CFIUS has increased its focus on safety of personal data. In the last two years, it blocked Chinese companies from buying money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc and mobile marketing firm AppLovin.
Based in West Hollywood, California, Grindr is especially popular among gay men and has about 4.5 million daily active users. CFIUS likely worried that Grindr's database may include compromising information about personnel who work in areas such as military or intelligence and that it could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, the former officials said.
""CFIUS operates under the assumption that, whether through legal or political means, Chinese intelligence agencies could readily access information held by private Chinese companies if they wanted to,"" said Rod Hunter, an attorney at Baker & McKenzie LLP who managed CFIUS reviews during President George W. Bush's administration.
In a faxed statement to Reuters, China's foreign ministry said it was aware of the situation with Grindr and urged the United States to allow fair competition and not politicize economic issues. 
""The Chinese government always encourages Chinese companies to conduct economic and trade cooperation overseas in accordance with international rules and local laws,"" it said. 
GRINDR'S TAKEOVER
Kunlun first acquired 60% of Grindr in 2016 for $93 million, amid a wave of acquisitions of U.S. technology companies by Chinese firms. At the time CFIUS focused on traditional national security concerns, such as the use of technology for potential military applications, the former U.S. security officials said.
Submissions of deals to CFIUS for review were entirely voluntary then, and Kunlun did not think it needed to submit its purchase of Grindr because it was convinced the deal posed no national security risk, two sources close to the company said.
After that deal was completed Kunlun tasked engineers in Beijing to improve the app, former employees said. The team worked out of the second floor of Ming Yang International Center, Kunlun's 11-story headquarters east of the Palace Museum in Beijing, one former employee said. 
At first, they did not have access to Grindr's database, six former employees said. But that changed when Kunlun bought out the remainder of Grindr for $152 million, and the dating app’s founder and CEO, Joel Simkhai, left.
Kunlun shifted a significant portion of Grindr's operations to Beijing, seven former employees said. Some outside contractors ended their work, and most of Grindr's U.S. engineers were subsequently let go or resigned, they said.
Some U.S. employees who learned that the database access had been given to colleagues in China raised concerns about privacy with management, but they were told that they should not worry, two former employees said. 
CFIUS ORDER
About a month after CFIUS' September order, Kunlun told the panel the Beijing team's access to Grindr's database had been restricted, the source close to the company said. 
Grindr also hired a cyber forensic firm and a third-party auditor at CFIUS's behest to report on its compliance and to make sure the data was secure, the source said.
Kunlun started to operationally separate Grindr as well, making Grindr Beijing a different legal entity, transferring some Chinese employees from Kunlun to Grindr, and finding separate office space for Grindr in Beijing, former employees said. 
Reuters could not determine what triggered CFIUS' initial concerns about the Grindr deal, or whether Kunlun's steps were directly aimed at allaying the panel's fears.
By February, Kunlun had decided to shut down Grindr's Beijing office, parting ways with some of the roughly two dozen employees there, two former employees said.
It told them the decision was taken because of policy reasons and concerns about data privacy, they said.
In March, Reuters first reported that CFIUS had asked Kunlun to divest Grindr. 
Behind the scenes, the source close to the company said, Kunlun kept trying to salvage the Grindr deal until as recently as last week, when it said it would sell it by June next year.

Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison blamed a combination of higher costs, moves to stock more products on shelves and mistakes in pricing strategy for the ""unanticipated"" impact on profit.
Lowe's said net income rose to $1.05 billion, or $1.31 per share in the first quarter ended May 3, from $988 million, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain one-time items, the company earned $1.22 per share, missing the analysts' average estimate of $1.33 per share. 
Lowe's now expects 2019 earnings of $5.54 to $5.74 per share, down from a prior forecast of $6 to $6.10 per share.
On an adjusted basis the company said it expects earnings of $5.45 to $5.65 per share, below analysts' expectations of $6.05.

The company's same-store sale rose 3.5%, above expectations of a 3.15% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

162,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Huawei Woes Widen as Asian Carriers Begin Dropping Its Handsets,"(Bloomberg) -- Wireless operators in Asia have begun to drop Huawei mobile phones after the U.S. put the Chinese telecom-gear giant on a blacklist blocking it from buying vital American components.
NTT Docomo Inc., Japan’s largest operator, said Wednesday it stopped taking pre-orders for Huawei’s new P30 handset, while its rival KDDI Corp. said it would indefinitely delay introduction of the phone, without elaborating. SoftBank Corp.’s YMobile announced a similar move, saying it is looking into concerns over the availability of software updates. Taiwanese carrier Chunghwa Telecom Co. said it won’t procure new Huawei models.
The moves are a fresh blow for Huawei Technologies Co., the company that’s been accused by the U.S. of aiding China in espionage. A supply ban imposed by the Trump administration threatens to cut off Huawei from crucial U.S. software and semiconductors it needs to make its products. The restrictions also spill over to the Android operating system, hitting the manufacturer that recently surpassed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). as the world’s second-largest maker of smartphones.
A Huawei representative declined to comment. Docomo, KDDI and YMobile didn’t say whether they would halt service or sales of all Huawei products.
Flex Ltd., a U.S.-based supplier, said Wednesday that it has stopped shipments to the Shenzhen-based manufacturer until further notice. “We continue to take this situation very seriously,” it said in its statement, adding Flex will ensure it remains in compliance with U.S. and other applicable trade laws.
As for smartphones, the most urgent concern among users of Huawei handsets is related to Android, the most popular mobile operating system, a product of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). A spokesman for the Mountain View, California-based company said the technology giant will continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing Huawei models for the next 90 days.
“While we are complying with all US government requirements, services like Google Play and security from Google Play Protect will keep functioning on your existing Huawei device,” Google’s Android unit wrote on Twitter.
Some owners of Huawei phones around the world took to social media to express concern about whether the cut-off of suppliers would affect their handsets.
Assuring Customers
Huawei’s marketing team used social media on Tuesday assure customers their phones would continue to be safe and usable.
“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those which have been sold or still in stock globally,"" the company wrote on Twitter to fans in Nigeria.
In Japan, SoftBank is looking into how customers would be affected by the introduction of a Huawei handset, including whether the Android software it runs on will be updated, Maiko Tsuji, a spokeswoman for the company, said by phone.
Taipei-based carrier Chunghwa Telecom said it will continue to sell products it offers from Huawei, despite its halt in procurement, according to the statement Wednesday.

""Everything is under scrutiny: fixed and variable costs, material and personnel costs, investment projects, vertical integration and the product range,"" Dieter Zetsche said in a statement https:// ahead of Daimler's annual general meeting in Berlin. 
""Along with external factors, we are now also feeling the financial effects of the company's transformation,"" said Zetsche, who is set to hand control to 49-year-old Swede Ola Kaellenius on Wednesday.
Kaellenius said earlier this month that Daimler will cut development costs for new Mercedes-Benz cars by a significant amount by 2025 and will intensify alliances with rivals as a way to improve margins.
Kaellenius is working out details of the cost savings program.
Daimler is pushing to develop a raft of electric and hybrid cars so it can boast a carbon neutral car fleet by 2039.
The Stuttgart-based group said on Wednesday that it was aiming to limit the price of new car technologies for customers.
""To do so, we have to cut costs and increase efficiency throughout the company,"" Zetsche said.
He said Daimler, which confirmed its full-year targets, had a moderate start to the year.
""This was expected, but it doesn't make it any better. In particular, we cannot and will not be satisfied with the current level of profitability.""
Zetsche, an engineer nicknamed ""Dr. Z"" who joined the company in 1976, is due to become chairman of the supervisory board in 2021, following a standard two-year cooling off period.
Daimler's shareholders are also set to approve a new corporate structure to combine the car and van businesses as well as the truck and bus businesses in two independent entities.
The new corporate structure would allow the carmaker greater flexibility to list individual divisions.

Chief Executive Officer Martin Zielke told shareholders that the talks with Deutsche ""showed where we should possibly sharpen our strategy"".
""We will be able to say more about this in the autumn,"" Zielke said at the bank's annual general meeting.
Commerzbank, which is still partially owned by the state after a bailout, has been focused on cutting costs and digitizing its workflow.
Profit rose sharply in 2018 from a year earlier but Zielke said profit needs to improve further.
Earlier this year, Zielke embarked on talks to tie up with Deutsche Bank. But the talks collapsed after six weeks, with the banks citing risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
With Deutsche out of the picture, both Italy's UniCredit and Dutch  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) have expressed interest in Commerzbank, which is Germany's second-largest listed lender, sources have said.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stocks were slightly lower on Wednesday as investors sought safety in bonds, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc in muted trade amid renewed worries over the U.S.-China spat after reports Washington has another Chinese tech firm in its sights.
Relief over Washington's temporary relaxation of curbs against China's Huawei Technologies evaporated after reports that the White House is considering further sanctions on Chinese video surveillance firm Hikvision.
Fears of another blacklisting reinforced worries that U.S. President Donald Trump is looking beyond sealing a trade deal with China to a potentially bigger battle aimed at curbing Beijing's technology ambitions.
""I think the debate is just starting about what the implications of all this could be if it escalates. It's my biggest concern,"" said Simon Webber, lead portfolio manager on the global & international equities team at  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
The limits which were imposed on Huawei last week and eased on Monday had sent shivers through global semiconductor stocks as investors worried about disruption to suppliers of the world's No. 2 smartphone maker.
""If we get retaliation, if we start deconstructing supply chains, if we get countries asking whether they can rely on products and services overseas, then we'll have much more uncertainty and a much more worrying environment,"" said Webber.
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down slightly at 0905 GMT, as investors shunned assets considered risky in times of economic and political strife.
The reports rattled European and Asian stocks, with the euro-zone STOXXE down 0.1%. 
London's FTSE 100 blue chips bucked the trend, rising 0.4% as sterling fell amid renewed worries about the country's messy exit from the European Union.
The Chinese markets, which have endured a volatile few months, were on the backfoot. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.5%.
The threat dampened Australia's post-election optimism slightly, but stocks still hovered near the 11-year highs scaled on Monday.
""Some in the markets will continue to cling on to hopes of the United States and China reaching an agreement at the upcoming G20 meeting,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.
""But the ongoing trade conflict looks to be a protracted one, and its potentially negative impact on various economies is becoming a running concern.""
Leaders from G20 nations are scheduled to gather for a summit in Japan at the end of June.
Australia's stocks index is the only major global bourse to notch up gains since Trump ramped up his battle with Beijing on May 6, largely due to the election euphoria, while South Korea's KOSPI is the biggest loser.

167,By Investing.com,"<span>May 22, 2019 05:03AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Engie, EDP Play Catch-Up in Energy's Big Growth Sector","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s electricity giants have had a hard time moving beyond fossil and nuclear fuels into renewables, but the continent’s climate policy agenda leaves them no choice.
That explains, in part, the announcement by France’s Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Portugal’s EDP (LS:EDP), two of Europe’s old-style legacy incumbents, to team up in the fast-growing sector of offshore wind.
The two said on Monday they intend to have up to 7 gigawatts of installed capacity – the equivalent of eight or nine old-style gas or coal-fired generation plants - operating by 2025, with another 5 to 10 gigawatts at an advanced stage of development. They have cooperated at a project level already since 2013, and already have 5.5 GW in construction or under development, but that is still a hefty expansion plan.
The logic of the deal seems clear enough, although it may be a slow burner in terms of value creation. EDP’s stock rose 1% on Tuesday and is up another 0.2% today. Engie’s would have been up a similar amount had it not gone ex-dividend.
Europe’s bourses are in mixed spirits Wednesday, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.1%, while Germany’s Dax is flat and the U.K. FTSE 100 up 0.4% largely due to sterling weakness.
Their aim is to become the second-largest wind farm developers in the world behind Denmark’s Oersted (CO:ORSTED), and leap-frogging Spain’s  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE). Orsted has been one of the biggest stock market successes in Europe of recent years, up more than 125% since its IPO in June 2016, skilfully exploiting a sector where government subsidies and market dynamics are in constant flux.
Iberdrola has needed longer to take off but its stock has risen 35% since October. Conspicuously, both of those stocks have been immune to the general increase in market volatility in the last eight months.
Both EDP and Engie could do with a little bit of Orsted/Iberdrola magic.
EDP is looking to move beyond the collapse of a takeover attempt by China Three Gorges, a state-controlled generator. Its stock lost some 15% from the start of April as that episode unravelled.
Engie investors, meanwhile, have yet to buy into CEO Isabelle Kocher’s plans to streamline the sprawling business, although she made a promising start in February by promising to get out of 20 of its 70 markets. It has a headache with its investment in the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has landed it in the U.S. administration’s crosshairs. The U.S. confirmed on Monday that it is preparing new sanctions against the Russian-controlled pipeline, in which Engie has a 10% stake."

Yuan Renguo, a former official of the world's largest listed alcohol firm, with market capitalization of 1.12 trillion yuan ($162.3 billion), has been expelled from the party and removed from all posts, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on its website.
Yuan ""severely violated political discipline and political rules, and used dealership qualification of the Moutai liquor as tools of strings pulling and exchange of interests,"" it said in a statement.
He took exceptionally large bribes and ran illegal for-profit business, it added, among other accusations.
Since taking office more than five years ago, President Xi Jinping has waged war on graft at all levels of the ruling party, pledging that the fight will continue until corruption is impossible and unimaginable for officials.
Moutai, which sells its fiery Feitian 53 baijiu for close to $250 per bottle, is often served at official banquets and business dinners, as China's burgeoning middle-class builds an appetite for more expensive drinks.
The brand has close ties with Chinese politics and culture, drawing on its long history as the national liquor of choice and was once hailed as helping the Red Army survive the tortuous Long March of the 1930s.
In March, the firm posted its second consecutive double-digit annual profit growth, racking up 35.2 billion yuan ($5.22 billion) in full-year net profit for 2018, up from 27.08 billion a year earlier.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A probe by the investigations unit of India's antitrust body has found that  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) abused its dominant position as a supplier of genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds in the country, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2016 ordered the unit to carry out the probe after India's farm ministry and some local seed companies complained that Monsanto was charging unreasonably high royalty fees for its GM technology.
The investigation unit's report will now be reviewed by senior members of the CCI. The watchdog has powers to impose a penalty of up to 10% of the company's relevant turnover in the past three financial years if it agrees with the report's findings. 
The CCI did not respond to Reuters queries. 
An Indian spokesperson for Monsanto also did not respond. Monsanto was acquired by German pharmaceutical and chemical maker  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) in a $63 billion deal last year. 
Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India)(MMB), a joint venture with India's Mahyco, licenses a gene that produces its own pesticide to a number of local seed companies, in lieu of royalties and an upfront payment. MMB commands more than 90% of the cotton market.
The CCI investigation unit's probe found that Monsanto abused its dominant position in the market to hurt rivals, and that the royalty it charged was unfair, the sources said.
""The company's agreements with seed companies were anti-competitive,"" said one of the sources aware of the probe's results.
A second source familiar with the CCI's findings said the watchdog had found MMB had abused its dominant position and set its ""trait fees"", or royalties, to extract maximum profits from captive customers.
Monsanto launched the GM cotton variety in India in 2002 despite opposition from critics who questioned the safety of genetically-modified crops. It has been locked in a battle with Indian seed makers, including Nuziveedu Seeds, which is one of the complainants at the CCI.

India's farm ministry has slashed royalties that local seed companies pay to Monsanto. After a spate of unfavorable government orders and a tussle over royalty payments, Monsanto in 2016 withdrew an application seeking approval for its next generation of GM cotton seeds in India. [.nL3N20Y2JJ]

170,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",China's big three airlines seek Boeing compensation over 737 MAX grounding,"By Stella Qiu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's three biggest airlines have asked U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to compensate them for losses caused by the grounding and delayed deliveries of 737 MAX jets, just as regulators gather to discuss design changes for the troubled aircraft.
The triple compensation requests come at a sensitive time in Sino-U.S. relations, with a string of tit-for-tat import tariffs culminating in Washington accusing Beijing of backtracking on almost all aspects of a proposed trade deal.
The U.S. administration's latest tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports - and hints of more - has prompted fear that China could retaliate against U.S. companies.
On Wednesday, Air China Ltd and China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co Ltd told Reuters the pair have added their voices to a compensation request from China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd announced a day earlier.
The latest requests were first reported by Chinese state TV.
China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX two months ago after a crash in Ethiopia killed 157 people in March, in the second such incident for Boeing's newest aircraft.
""China has grounded 96 aircraft, which is about 4 percent of its airplanes. The grounding causes huge losses for Chinese airlines,"" China aviation expert Li Xiaojin told Reuters.
Daily losses are likely to be at least 100,000 yuan ($14,469.90) per aircraft for each airline, Li estimated.
""The potential costs are huge too. Slower growth in passenger volume across China's major airports for March and April was largely due to the grounding of 737 MAX jets, according to my calculations,"" Li said.
China's state-asset regulator put the number of 737 MAX jets operated by the three biggest Chinese carriers at 53.
Outside of China, carriers that have requested compensation include Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, Ryanair and Flydubai.
COORDINATED EFFORT
Bloomberg last week reported the big Chinese airlines were considering teaming up to seek compensation. On Tuesday, state newspaper People's Daily said China Eastern had not communicated with the other carriers on the topic before making its request. China Eastern confirmed the content of that report to Reuters.
On Wednesday, however, widely read tabloid Global Times reported that the action appeared to be a ""concerted effort"".
""China seems to be ready now to put more pressure on Boeing as the company happens to have a genuine safety issue, and the trade friction between the U.S. and China started to go into a downward spiral,"" Global Times quoted Shen Yuxin, a partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, as saying.
The latest compensation requests also come a day before the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration hosts global regulators in Dallas to review 737 MAX software and training proposals from Boeing before regulators decide whether to end the grounding.
China and the European Union each have their own aerospace industries and so are likely to determine their own conditions for allowing 737 MAX flights to resume, analysts said.
The International Air Transport Association has also convened a meeting of airlines with grounded 737 MAX jets on Thursday in Montreal.

174,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 01:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Walmart to make first direct pitch to big corporate ad buyers at New York event,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc will meet large consumer goods companies and advertising firms for the first time in New York next week to pitch its advertising business, as the world's largest retailer aims to rev up its website and stores as a platform for other companies to reach customers.
The event marks Walmart's first effort to grow its nascent advertising business and heralds the retailer's rising challenge to online ad leaders Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
The event, called ""5260,"" is named after a Walmart store near the retailer's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, which is known for being a test lab for retail innovation, Walmart told Reuters.
It is likely to be attended by hundreds of companies ranging from Procter & Gamble,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and Coca Cola to Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT),  Glaxosmithkline  (LON:GSK) and NBC Universal, multiple sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The country's top marketing and advertising firms are also likely to be in attendance, the sources, who did not wish to be named, added. 
Walmart declined to name the attendees. 
Walmart's pitch will be simple: encourage some of the biggest advertisers to shift their spending to Walmart and away from rivals like Google, Facebook Inc and Amazon. And Walmart says that its massive customer base and data on what shoppers purchase give it a compelling edge. 
As consumer behavior has shifted, a growing number of shoppers now begin their product searches on Amazon instead of Google, forcing companies to move their ad budgets to Amazon - a significant change that bodes well for Walmart.
Walmart heralded its ambitions at its shareholder meeting last year when Chief Executive Doug McMillon said, ""We have a tiny ad business. ... It could be bigger."" 
Since then, Walmart has bought its website advertising in-house, consolidated ad sales for its stores and website under the Walmart Media Group and acquired a startup called Polymorph Labs to boost the business. 
The move could help Walmart shore up sales and margins at a time when revenue is likely to come under stress from tariffs on Chinese imports, and margins are under pressure from its billions of dollars in e-commerce investments. 
Stefanie Jay, vice president and general manager of Walmart Media Group, told Reuters the company's ""core differentiator"" is that its ad offerings are informed not just by online purchase behavior and intent but also by data on what people are buying in stores before and after they see an ad, something its online rivals are unable to see. 
Eighty-seven percent of shopping in the United States still happens in stores, she said.
Over 300 million customers visit Walmart's stores every month, and over 300 million shopped with Walmart online as recently as January, drawing in more shoppers than Amazon, Google and Facebook, according to research firms. 
""Advertisers are always looking for that complete picture to better understand where they should spend their ad dollars,"" Jay said. 
Walmart's ad offerings will include sponsored search and display ads, which drive awareness and engagement. Jay said Walmart will add video ads this year. 
Along with Jay, other senior Walmart executives attending the event include Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer; Janey Whiteside, chief customer officer; and Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food for Walmart U.S. 
The opportunity for Walmart will be capitalizing on the share Google is losing, consultants said. Although spending on Google search ads continues to grow and is expected to be up 17% this year to $40 billion, Google’s market share is expected to slip to 71% by 2020 as Amazon grows, according to research firm Marketer. 
Even so, Walmart faces an uphill task.
Beyond search ads, Amazon offers display ads, TV-like ads in live sports telecasts and targeted ads to people as they travel around the web. 
Amazon's global digital ad revenue is expected to rise by more than 52% in 2019 to reach $14.03 billion, according to eMarketer. Pivotal Research estimates it will reach $38 billion by 2023.
In the United States, Amazon is the third-largest digital ad publisher behind Google and Facebook, which combined control about 60% of U.S. online ad spending. Amazon’s share is 5.5 percent.

175,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",India stocks to climb a bit more if Modi wins decisively: Reuters poll,"By Indradip Ghosh and Vivek Mishra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares will reach a new record high by end-year, a Reuters poll of strategists showed, building on an election-driven rally in which investors have bet the ruling party will retain power and continue current economic policies.
The BSE Sensex index rose by its biggest amount in one day since September 2013 on Monday after exit polls showed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will retain power for a second consecutive term.
Final results are due on Thursday.
Having gained 8% so far this year, the index is forecast to add another 2.6% by end-2019, touching an all time high of 40,000 from Tuesday's close of 38,969, the poll of nearly 50 strategists taken May 14-21 showed.
All but one of the equity strategists who answered an additional question said they have factored in either the BJP winning a majority or a victory of the BJP-led NDA in to their forecasts.
""I feel a stable government and more policy action to come will definitely give a boost to the economy and that will act positive for the market,"" said B.V. Rudramurthy, managing director at Vachana Investments.
Still, the predicted rise is much smaller than the 15% percent stock market surge in the first six months after Modi came to power in 2014, suggesting some investors are less optimistic about the NDA administration than they were then. 
The benchmark index is forecast to hit another fresh high of 42,250 by end-2020. Similar gains are predicted for the broader NSE index.
The overall optimism among investors lines up with a separate Reuters poll of mostly financial sector economists conducted last month, which concluded that the BJP winning a majority or a BJP-led NDA government would be best for the economy.
""As per the exit polls, NDA led by BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is likely to easily cross the half-way mark. Markets will heave a big sigh of relief as it favors continuity and familiarity in terms of roll-out of policies,"" said Ajay Bodke, CEO at Prabhudas Lilladher.
The Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates twice before the elections. Like most major central banks, it is not expected to tighten policy any time soon, another factor that has kept share prices around the world well-bid this year. 
However, not all respondents were optimistic. 
Nearly one in three contributors forecast the index to decline from the current level by end of this year, including four participants predicting a correction - a decline of 10% or more.
""We do expect weakness in global equities throughout the rest of the year as the global economy disappoints,"" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.
""For India, especially with the recent rally, they (stocks) look extremely stretched...It is one of the reasons to think the rally probably can't continue for much longer.""
Shah has predicted a decline of nearly 12% by end-2019 with one of the most pessimistic calls at 34,250.
Although stocks have risen about 65% since Modi first took office in 2014, that was significantly less compared to the previous two terms of the Congress party led UPA (United Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Alliance) between 2004-2014.
The reason for lagging was largely due to weak corporate earnings, which fell about 4% annually during Modi's tenure after gaining nearly 12% under the prior government.
This is also reflected by a higher average price-to-earnings ratio and lower dividend yield under Modi's tenure. 
""At present stocks are defying gravity. With the price-to-earnings ratio at an historic high of 28, the market is too expensive. My fear is if earnings don't pick up soon, the chances of a correction are high,"" said Milind Vasudev, senior equity analyst at Arihant Capital Markets.

China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.2%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.6%.
Overnight, Wall Street ended higher after the U.S. Commerce Department said it would temporarily lift restrictions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei. 
Tensions between the U.S. and China remained high despite the move, after Cui Tiankai, Chinese ambassador to the U.S., said in an interview with Fox News that Washington “changes its mind so often” in trade talks.
“If we review the process of trade talks between us over the last year or so, it is quite clear it is the U.S. side that, more than once, changed its mind overnight, and broke the tentative deal already reached,” said Cui, adding that the “door is still open” for further talks. 
He also said U.S. sanctions on Huawei “are without any foundation and evidence” and are “politically motivated.” 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.4% as data showed a pickup in business sentiment for the first time in the past seven months. South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed at 2,060.28.

The stock fell as much 9.6% before recovering to be 6.2% lower as of 9:50 a.m. in Shenzhen. The White House will make a final decision in coming weeks on whether to limit exports of U.S. components to Hikvision, as it’s done with Huawei Technologies Co., the Times reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Such a move would escalate tensions with China and raise questions about whether the U.S. is going after more of the country’s technology champions.
Hikvision has grown into a surveillance giant, selling its cameras around the world after cashing in on China’s obsession with monitoring its citizens. Its devices use artificial intelligence, enabling them to conduct facial recognition on a vast scale. That’s helped it build a dominant position in a market that BIS Research says was worth $32 billion in 2017 and will grow 16% a year by 2023.
Hikvision doesn’t have a global counterpart close to its scale and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., its closest Chinese rival, is about a sixth of its size.
Hikvision is a constituent of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index and is among Shenzhen stocks most owned by overseas investors. Dahua, which dropped as much 9.2% Wednesday, also features on the widely-followed regional benchmark.

180,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",Brazil lower house votes to allow foreign airlines in domestic market,"By Maria Carolina Marcello and Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's lower house of Congress voted on Tuesday to allow foreign-controlled airlines to operate domestic flights in Latin America's largest economy, opening the door to more competition in an increasingly concentrated market. 
The chamber approved the original text of a decree issued by former President Michel Temer in December that removed the 20% limit on foreign ownership of Brazilian airlines. 
However, debates continued into the night, with voting scheduled to tweak the final language of the bill that will be sent to the Senate. The upper chamber is expected to pass the measure, which would then go into effect immediately.
The removal of the restriction could lure a foreign carrier eager to jumpstart its presence in the domestic market, or open the door for foreign airlines to dramatically increase their existing stakes in the big three Brazilian carriers.
Air travel within Brazil has become more concentrated, with three carriers now controlling 92% of the flights, according to the civil aviation regulator ANAC. 
Brazil's No. 4 airline, Avianca Brasil, has lost market share in recent weeks as it gave up all but six of its planes during a court-run bankruptcy reorganization. 
Avianca Brasil's crisis has set off an intense fight over who will inherit the carrier's routes, including a profitable shuttle between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. 
So far, Brazil's three largest airlines - Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, LATAM Airlines Group and Azul SA - have fought for the routes. 
A foreign player could potentially bid on Avianca Brasil's routes at an upcoming auction — which Brazil's antitrust regulator CADE has already called the best outcome. 
Currently, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) owns 9.4% of Gol, the leader in domestic flights in Brazil. Qatar Airways owns 10% of LATAM, Brazil's No. 2 domestic airline. United Airlines owns 8% of third-place Azul.
Spanish airline company Globalia, best known for its Air Europa brand, is ""exploring"" operating in Brazil, according to the agenda of a meeting to be held by ANAC on Wednesday. On Saturday, Brazil's infrastructure minister said the company would create a subsidiary in Brazil.

Adriana Simoes, a Brazilian aviation lawyer with the Mattos Filho law firm, said the approval was ""excellent news"" that had been long awaited by the industry. But foreign investors, she said, were still awaiting more clarity on how the law would be implemented.

181,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",Top Miner BHP Sees an End to the Era of Coal,"(Bloomberg) -- BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, sees the outlook for thermal coal as challenged and won’t add production as it prioritizes growth in commodities tied to the shift to renewable energy and electric transport.
There’s the prospect that the material will be “phased out, potentially sooner than expected,” Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven said in an investor presentation on Wednesday. The Melbourne-based producer has “no appetite for growth in energy coal regardless of asset attractiveness,” he said.
BHP follows its biggest competitors  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc in questioning the future role of coal used for power generation, as investors press for more action to tackle climate change and tighten restrictions on holding companies that produce the fuel. Rio sold its final coal mines last year, while Glencore said in March it would seek to limit production.
At BHP’s thermal coal mine in Australia and the Cerrejon operation in Colombia, where it has a third-share, the producer will focus on “maximizing value to shareholders, whether we are long-term owners or not,” Beaven told investors in a separate speech. While thermal coal will remain a large market, the company expects demand “to plateau and then decline,” he said.
The producer is also unlikely to add major capacity in iron ore or metallurgical coal, according to Beaven, seen as a leading contender to succeed Andrew Mackenzie as CEO. BHP will instead boost options in commodities with a more favorable exposure to the growth of energy demand and renewable power, the shift to electric vehicles and increasing food consumption, Beaven said.
‘We Need More’
“We have options in copper and oil, but we need more, and we are interested in adding more nickel sulphide resource to our portfolio,” he said. “We do not need to do M&A, but we never discount it as a way to acquire great resource bases, especially early in the life of a project.”
BHP continues to see potash as a valuable long-term option, and regards its Jansen project in Canada as a potential high-margin, long-life asset, he said.
The potash market currently has excess supply, but will likely require additional capacity from Jansen’s initial stage, likely to cost as much as a further $5.7 billion, by the middle of next decade, Beaven said. Jansen will need about five years from a decision to sanction the investment to be fully commissioned for production, according to the presentation.
BHP said last week it would retain its Nickel West operation in Western Australia for exposure to growth in electric vehicle battery markets, though sees related metals like lithium and cobalt as less attractive, Beaven said.

183,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 07:28PM ET</span>",Nordstrom cuts 2019 forecast after quarterly results miss big,"(Reuters) -  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) on Tuesday cut its forecast for full-year sales and profit after reporting weaker than expected first-quarter results that were hurt by the roll out of a new loyalty program and slow sales of full-priced women's clothing. 
Shares of the department store operator tanked more than 9% in post-market trading.
The Seattle-based retailer, which sells everything from apparel and footwear to home decor, saw sales at its full-price and off-price businesses fall online and in its stores, hurt by an unsuccessful roll out of its ""Nordy Club"" loyalty program, reduced digital marketing and products that did not resonate as well with shoppers as the company had hoped. 
Co-president Erik Nordstrom said on a post-earnings conference call the company stopped sending rewards ""notes"" to its loyalty customers by mail in an attempt to get the program online and reach customers faster. That shift caused a reduction in foot traffic at all of its stores, the executive said, as many customers rely on receiving these rewards by mail.
""We're making the changes we believe are necessary to drive our top line as we continue our aggressive focus on expenses,"" Nordstrom said.
Even still, analysts remained concerned.
""While challenges to the full-line business are, at least in part, to be expected, the deterioration at the off-price division is more troubling,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.
The company also said trends from the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter and that it had to ramp up promotions in order to clear excess inventory from its winter collection.
Nordstrom, like other brick-and-mortar retailers, has fought to react to consumers moving toward fast-fashion brands and online sites like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rather than visiting malls.
Nordstrom has invested heavily in its Nordstrom Rack stores that sell off-price merchandise in the United States and Canada. Its Nordstrom Local stores are also a point of pride, where shoppers can consult personal stylists for fashion, have their clothes altered and more. 
The company, which said it was on track to open its first women's store in New York this October, now expects 2019 net sales between a 2% fall to flat, compared with its previous projection of a 1% to 2% rise.
The company expects 2019 profit between $3.25 per share and $3.65 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $3.65 per share to $3.90 per share.
Total revenue for the first quarter, ended May 4, fell 3.3% to $3.44 billion, short of analysts' estimates of $3.58 billion, according to IBES Refinitiv data. 
Nordstrom earned 23 cents per share in the quarter, short of analysts' estimates by 20 cents.
Earlier on Tuesday, retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc's same-store sales fell more than expected in the first quarter and its net loss nearly doubled after the retailer exited its appliance and in-store furniture businesses, sending shares down 10%. 
Kohl's Corp on Tuesday slashed its full-year profit forecast after missing estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit, sending shares down 11%.

184,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>",U.S.-China Trade Clash Has Now Gone Global,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The impact of the U.S.-China trade spat is no longer limited to just the two countries. The Trump administration’s latest move – seeking to limit access to American suppliers for the Chinese telecom manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co. – may force many businesses worldwide to reconsider their own dependence on supply chains that go through China, and consumers their reliance on Chinese phones. The more they try to insulate themselves from similar future actions, the more global this trade conflict will become and the greater the likelihood it will end up re-aligning global economic relationships.
It remains an open question whether the dueling tariffs will be a permanent feature of a more fragmented and protectionist global system or, instead, just part of a journey to still-free but fairer trade. What’s clear already is that there’s limited likelihood of going back to the way things were.
The initial set of restrictions imposed by Washington on Beijing showed that China cannot take for granted unfettered access to U.S. markets to sell its goods and services; nor could it continue to easily force American companies doing business in China to transfer their technological knowhow. The most recent restrictions send a broader message to companies and households worldwide – that this tit-for-tat process affects far more than Chinese access to the U.S. and U.S. access to China.
By placing a big question mark over the ability of Chinese companies to remain up to date on U.S.-sourced technologies that are key to full functionality, the latest U.S. announcements risk dampening the sale of Chinese goods and services worldwide. (And all the more reason, as I argued last week, for Beijing to resist its bad habits that tend to surface under stress.)
In the face of higher uncertainty, it’s not unusual for both consumers and producers to try to protect themselves from the variables in play, including through greater diversification. In the current circumstances, that means companies moving supply chains away from China and consumers opting for products whose functionality over time does not depend on close coordination between U.S. and Chinese firms.
Initially, consumers and producers might have been unpleasantly surprised by operational concerns raised by the Huawei restrictions, but now they’re likely to be more skeptical and risk averse. This is particularly true because the world is realizing that the current trade tensions are a symptom not only of economic issues but also of national security concerns. With each measure and each retaliation, we are seeing the further weaponization of economic and financial tools.
The deepening divide, coupled with the adjustments that producers and consumers will make after the Huawei restrictions, means that a short-term deal between the U.S. and China – if reached – could not bring about a return to the status quo ante. The best that China can realistically hope for at this stage is a series of cease-fires that avoid serious damage to its economic growth, financial stability and broader development process."

187,By Investing.com,"<span>May 21, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1.  Target  , Lowe’s to Report
Target (NYSE:TGT) continues the week of retail earnings tomorrow with its report before trading opens. The discount retail chain is expected to report a profit of $1.43 per share for the quarter on sales of about $17.5 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Investing.com. Comparable-store sales are predicted to rise 4% for the period, according to Briefing.com.
Morgan Stanley upgraded shares of Target to equal weight from underweight yesterday, reiterating its price target of $67 and calling the company a “retail survivor”.
Following  Home Depot  's (NYSE:HD) better-than-expected results today, archrival Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) will weigh in tomorrow morning. Analysts expect that the home improvement retailer earned $1.33 per share, with sales coming in at about $17.7 billion.
2. FOMC Minutes Coming
The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
The FOMC held interest rates steady at the start of the month, as expected, but investors will want to see any differing views on the path of rates later this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was pretty blunt at his post-meeting press conference, saying there’s no case for a hike or a cut.
“We do think our policy stance is appropriate right now,” Powell said. “We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.”
Along with parsing the minutes for any dissent to that view, the market will be focused on more details on economic projections and the Fed balance sheet.
Right now, fed funds futures are pricing in about a 65% chance that rates will be lower after the final meeting of the year in December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
3. Analysts Unsure on Oil Inventories
Oil prices aren’t the only thing struggling for direction in the crude market. Analysts are having a tough time predicting what’s going to happen with oil inventories tomorrow.
The Energy Information Administration will report the weekly crude, gasoline and distillate stockpile numbers at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). Estimates for oil inventories have been bouncing around. The Investing.com consensus currently calls for a drop of 600,000 barrels of crude, down from a drawdown of more than 2 million barrels earlier in the day.
Other estimates have been calling for a build by as much as 3 million barrels. Inventories tend to fall as the U.S. moves into the summer months and the peak driving season, but near-record oil production is making the market wary.
The American Petroleum Institute reported a rise of 2.4 million barrels of crude in its estimate out late today."
188,By Investing.com,"<span>May 21, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Closes Higher as U.S. Temporarily Eases Huawei Restrictions,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks bounced back on Tuesday from a slump a day earlier, led by tech stocks after the U.S. temporarily eased some of the restrictions on China's Huawei.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.77%, the S&P 500 added 0.85%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.08%.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday granted a 90-day license for U.S. mobile phone companies and internet broadband providers to work with Huawei to keep existing networks online and protect users from security risks.
Following the move, chip stocks, which were particularly vulnerable to the U.S. ban on Huawei, rallied 2%, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) clawing back some recent losses. Intel rose 2.1%. Qualcomm added 1.5%.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also ended the day 0.85% higher after reversing its decision from a day earlier to stop providing Huawei with software updates.
Beyond trade, investors also digested mixed quarterly earnings.
Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) reported a miss on the top and bottom lines and also reported comparable-store sales that fell short of expectations, sending its shares more than 12% lower.
JC Penney (NYSE:JCP), meanwhile, reported a wider-than-expected loss and drop in same-store sales, while revenue also missed expectations. Its shares slumped more than 7%.
After hours, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) said it missed revenue and earnings estimates for the first quarter and cut its guidance for the year. Shares fell more than 8%.
But auto parts retailer AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) boosted the broader retail sector, rising more than 5% after topping expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) ended the day 1% higher.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, also paved the way for gains in the broader market despite a modest fall in U.S. oil prices as concerns that a prolonged trade war between the U.S. and China could hurt global oil demand offset ongoing U.S.-Iran tensions and expectations for OPEC to stick with production cuts.
In other company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed off 0.1% after shares had fallen to as low as $196.04. Morgan Stanley cutting its worst-case forecast on the electric car maker's share price to just $10, citing concerns about the company’s hefty debt levels and potential weaker demand from China.
Tesla also announced it was slashing the sticker price for its Model S and Model X vehicles for the third time in about three months, the news site Electrek reported.
On the economic front, U.S. existing home sales fell for a second-straight month in April as the supply of lower-priced housing continued to weigh.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
AutoZone (NYSE:AZO),  DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

189,By Investing.com,"<span>May 21, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Nordstrom Shares Slump on Earnings Miss ,"Investing.com - Shares of department-store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell nearly 9% postmarket after the company missed on earnings and revenue for the fiscal first quarter. Nordstrom cut its guidance as well.
Nordstrom had expected to earn $3.65 to $3.90 a share for the year. The new guidance is $3.25 to $3.65. Revenue growth is projected at down 2% to flat. The prior guidance had been up 1% to 2%.
For the quarter, Nordstrom earned 23 cents a share, missing the estimate of analysts polled by Investing.com of 43 cents. Revenue was $3.44 billion, off 3.3% from a year ago. The Investing.com estimate was $3.57 billion.
The company said its biggest problem was a 5.1% decline in sales of full-price merchandise. Digital sales jumped 7% year over year. The company also said it struggled with a number of execution issues, including a big one with its enhanced loyalty program.
Nordstrom shares were up 1.12% to $37.89 in regular trading. But they're down 18.8% this year based on the Tuesday close. They hit a 52-week low of $36.37 on Friday. That's off 44.2% from a 52-week high of $67.75 reached in early November. If the market reaction to the earnings report holds on Wednesday, the shares could hit a new 52-week low and reach levels not seen since 2011. The consensus target on the stock is $46.94, but analysts will likely cut their targets in the next few days.
Like many old-line department store chains, Nordstrom has been battered by the rise of digital shopping. It has invested millions in making shopping easy on its website and has results to show for it. Not only did digital sales rise 7% year ove year, but it now represents 31% of total sales, up from 28% a year ago.
Nordstrom defines its digital business as ""online sales and digitally assisted store sales which include Buy Online, Pick Up in Store ('BOPUS'), Ship to Store and Style Board, a digital selling tool.""
But the traditional full-price business is suffering badly and even its widely-admired off-rack business didn't have a strong quarter, with sales off 0.6%. Its gross profit margin fell to 33.5% in the quarter, down from 34.1% a year ago.
Nonetheless, the company was able to buy back 4.1 million shares for about $186 million. Its profit margin for earnings before interest and income taxes fell to 2.4% from 4.4%.
Nordstrom still plans to open what it calls its flagship store, a seven-story, 320,000-square operation, on West 57th Street in New York City on Oct. 24.."

“We see both markets and currencies trading at very cheap levels,"" said Ed Kuczma, BlackRock’s portfolio manager, who oversees $1.9 billion in the company’s Latin American equity funds. “The weakness we’re seeing right now creates long-term opportunities, as companies will take advantage of the weak growth to right-size their operating structure,” Kuczma said by phone.
Brazil’s benchmark equity Ibovespa index has fallen 2.7% so far this month, as noise from domestic politics has added to weaker-than-expected economic growth. “Between now and the pension reform’s approval, there should be volatility,” Kuczma said. “And we’re looking for opportunities to increase the overweight in Brazil.”
BlackRock expects a positive outcome for the social security reform, seeing final savings from the bill totaling between 500-700 billion reais in ten years. It also sees the reform’s approval by Brazil’s lower house taking place in last quarter of the year, according to Kuczma.
“The big question in Brazil is the pension reform: the size of the savings and when it actually will be approved,” Kuczma said. “It should unlock a lot of value.”
Among Brazilian stocks, Kuczma currently favors banks -- which started to resume lending -- and homebuilders. “Homebuilders came out of a challenging period. Inflation has come down and we also saw a very strong season for launches in the first quarter,” he said. The valuation of retailers, however, is “a little stretched,” he added.
Kuczma also has a small overweight in Argentina, where he likes Information Technology companies and banks. While MSCI Argentina Index is down 0.3% this year, he expects the country’s addition to the MSCI’s equity index of developing nations to be supportive.
“With the inclusion, you’ll start to see more flows to the equity market there,” he said.
BlackRock is more neutral on Mexico, given the impact of a disappointing growth outlook on valuations. “Some investors have been hesitant to put their money to work in Mexico,” Kuczma said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Brazil farmer defaults burn soy traders betting on barter,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A spate of farmer defaults in Brazil's top grain-producing state is creating headaches for global traders who are among their main creditors and posing challenges to the widespread use of barter in the world's largest soybean exporter.
The battles in Mato Grosso bankruptcy courts pit farmers against international trading houses, such as France's Louis Dreyfus Corp (LDC) and U.S.-based Bunge Ltd, which have been lending aggressively to producers through Brazil's unique barter system to protect profit margins from newer traders in China.
The scale of Brazilian farmer bankruptcies are a far cry from the plight of their U.S. peers, who have struggled recently with extreme weather and a trade war with China.
Still, the cases reveal the risks in Brazil of poor farm management, a weak economy and an ambiguous bankruptcy code, which have spelled trouble for traders despite a soy boom fed by U.S.-China trade tensions.
Trading firms have been stymied to find that farmers they lent to as individuals are often able to seek bankruptcy protection as if they were corporations - making it harder to recover millions of dollars of soybeans under contract.
Judiney de Souza, the chief executive of Amaggi, Brazil's biggest domestically owned trader, said the recent wave of farmer bankruptcies in Mato Grosso is ""a cause for concern.""
""When the courts grant bankruptcy protection without observing the legal requirements, this puts our credit analysis at risk,"" Souza said.
Amaggi said it has fought to seize almost 24,000 tonnes of soybeans from one farmer, Zeca Viana, whose obligations to the trader were among 312 million reais ($76 million) of debt on which he defaulted this year.
""My main concern is lack of credit to finance the coming crop,"" said Viana, a former state lawmaker who blamed his fate on costly expansions, bad weather and political distractions. He is now struggling to sell his beans due to disputes with major trading firms.
Viana's lawyer Euclides Ribeiro, who represents more than a half dozen major Mato Grosso farmers who filed for bankruptcy protection in the past few years, said the traders' claims must be weighed against those of other creditors in court.
LDC also resorted to courts to seize nearly 12,000 tonnes of soybeans from Viana, worth about $5 million, according to LDC lawyer Thiago Gerbasi. He said the firm had paid for Viana's beans in 2018 through a fertilizer-for-grain barter arrangement.
If traders keep getting stiffed on contracts of that kind, they warn they will become more stringent about new deals, pinching a key source of credit for farmers in the world's second-largest soy producer.
BARTER BOOM
In Brazil's longstanding barter system, traders finance farmers' seeds, fertilizer and other inputs early in the season to guarantee delivery of grains at harvest time. 
A response to decades of scarce bank loans, barter took off in recent years as traders sought ways to lock in and profit from relationships with farmers in the face of new rivals sourcing beans in Brazil. 
""With more players competing for the soy, origination margins got slim and traders moved to sell farm inputs as a way to grab margins from other business segments,"" said a person at Cargill Inc who asked for anonymity to speak freely. 
Cargill declined to comment. 
Barter arrangements with global traders and agrochemical firms surged six-fold in five seasons to around a third of Mato Grosso farmers' financing for the latest crop, according agricultural research group Imea.
Imea researchers also attributed the recent rise in barter to tighter lending by private-sector banks in a recent downturn, along with a reduction in public-sector farm loans as government budgets have tightened.
The default rate on farm loans more than doubled in five years to average 2.8 percent last year, according to Brazil's central bank, even as defaults in the broader economy fell to a multi-year low. 
New agribusiness bankruptcy filings in the state of Mato Grosso rose to nine last year - the highest annual tally since 2015, according to credit services firm Serasa. 
'BANKRUPTCY INDUSTRY'
As traders became more exposed to farmers' credit risk, they learned the hard way that their contracts with farm owners could be suspended by slow-moving corporate bankruptcy courts.
Many farmers pay taxes as individuals rather than as companies, but their lawyers argue that they operate as businesses, giving them the right to the same orderly in-court reorganization as other firms.
Soy crushing group Abiove, whose members include the big four global trading firms, calls that a loophole created by the country's ""bankruptcy industry.""
""Abiove worries about the inappropriate use of bankruptcy protection by farmers. The cases have been rising steadily,"" said Abiove President André Nassar.
While local judges often accept farmers' bankruptcy filings in Mato Grosso, state appeals courts have thrown out several cases on the grounds that farmers were not registered as firms. Federal courts have not issued a ruling to settle the matter.
That has created a cloud of legal uncertainty for traders trying to gauge risk for their barter business.
Roberto Marcon, director of origination at Bunge in Brazil, said trading companies are reconsidering the guarantees they require from farmers in exchange for credit.
""Trading companies are not banks. They give funding or farm inputs and want the grains back,"" said Amaggi's Souza.

195,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",Wall Street Rules' Chief Architect Says the Fed Is Blowing It,"(Bloomberg) -- The “alpha dog” regulator who spearheaded Washington’s effort to write new rules for Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis said his successors are making a mess of the road map he left for them.
Former Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo, speaking at an event in Washington on Tuesday, said the agency is engaging in “low-intensity deregulation” that is sometimes easy to miss even as it weakens the banking system’s resiliency. He cited the Fed’s changes to stress testing -- backing off some key requirements while making the process more transparent -- as a prime example of steps to undermine the proposals he laid out as he left the central bank in 2017.
Last year, the Fed proposed integrating Wall Street’s everyday capital demands with each bank’s stress-test results, an idea Tarullo had worked on as far back as 2016. But he told an audience at the Americans for Financial Reform event that the agency’s intent -- “buried in a footnote” -- to discard leverage limits from the new calculations “could result in effectively lowered capital requirements for some of the biggest banks.”
“Capital requirements for the largest banks should be going up, not down,” Tarullo said, countering the view of Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles, who has said bank capital levels are about right. “Looser bank regulation is always a great temptation. More lending today produces higher growth in the short-term, even if that additional lending is not sustainable.”
Tarullo, who is now teaching at Harvard Law School, also said the Fed’s recent moves to give away more information on the stress tests provides smart bankers “most of what they need” to reverse-engineer the central bank’s models. That allows Wall Street banks to “find clever ways to reshape their assets so as to reduce capital requirements without reducing the riskiness of the assets.”

197,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>",Former Tesla bull makes $10 worst case call on China worries,"By Tanvi Mehta and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - One of Tesla's former biggest supporters on Wall Street said on Tuesday the electric carmaker's shares could fall to $10 from nearly $200 now, if tensions with China escalate and sap demand for its cars.
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) edged down, heading for their fifth straight session of losses, and bonds weakened, after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas outlined his worst case scenario. 
Jonas forecast the shares could be worth $10 to $391, with a price target of $230, a wide range that underscores the confusion and risks about Tesla's future. 
The company is facing signs of dragging demand as rivals step up electric efforts, as well as issues related to cash flow and manufacturing, its outlook in China and its eccentric, charismatic Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk.
""Tesla has grown too big relative to near-term demand, putting great strain on the fundamentals,"" wrote Jonas, rated a five-star analyst by Refinitiv for the accuracy of his forecasting on the company. 
The company's stock, which has almost halved in value since last August, was down another 3% at $199. In the last 10 days, it has gained only once, when the company boosted prices of its Model 3 sedan last week.
It is building a factory in China to produce its Model 3 electric vehicles in the world's largest auto market and to escape a rise in tariffs on cars imported from the United States.
Another brokerage, Baird, cut its price target for the company to $340 from $400, saying concerns over demand, credibility and noise around the company have kept incremental buyers out of the market.
""The departure of key executives, price discounting, and extraordinary cost-cutting efforts add to the narrative of a company facing real potential stress,"" Morgan Stanley's Jonas said.
An early backer of Tesla, Jonas in 2011 set a price target of $70 on the stock when it was trading around $23, a year after its IPO at $17 apiece. In 2017, he said the Tesla Network alone, Musk's plan for a robotaxi fleet, was worth $76 a share.
His bear case doesn't ascribe any value to robocabs but if the plan works, Jonas, who was once criticized in a New York Times article for being a cheerleader for Tesla, has a bull-case price target of $391.
The market action follows hot on the heels of a $2.7 billion fundraising round by the company two weeks ago that was oversubscribed, but has done little to settle the nerves of holders of Tesla's existing debt.
Its $1.8 billion high-yield bond due in 2025 with a 5.3% coupon weakened for a third straight day in European trading, with its price edging below 82 cents on the dollar and the yield up to 9.16% after touching a record high 9.25% overnight. 
The spread of its yield over Treasury securities, a gauge of the added compensation demanded by investors for holding Tesla rather than safer government debt, widened to nearly 693 basis points. 
By comparison, the average spread on corporate bonds rated ""B"" - roughly the same as ""B-"" rated Tesla - is 442 basis points, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofAML bond index data.
It was also among Wall Street's more heavily shorted stocks, with about a fifth of its float on the line. 
""FAANG stocks continue to dominate the list of most shorted U.S. equities ... but Tesla continues to hold the number 1 or number 2 spot since 2016,"" according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.
Of 31 analysts who cover the stock, 10 now recommend buying Tesla shares, nine are neutral and 12 recommend selling, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The median price target is $250.19, a fifth above the current market.

While cutting their price target, Baird analysts reiterated their outperform rating, saying Tesla was ""positioned to outperform over the long run, as it increases profitability, generates free cash flow and ramps up production of innovating products"".

198,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>","UK business group condemns Labour nationalization plans, Brexit delay","LONDON (Reuters) - Plans by Britain's opposition Labour Party to nationalize utilities including the country's electricity grid will damage investment as well as hurting many small shareholders, one of the country's main business groups warned on Tuesday.
Last week, Labour published plans to renationalize the country's 60-billion-pound ($77 billion) energy networks, taking companies such as  National Grid  (LON:NG), Scottish Power and SSE (LON:SSE) into public ownership.
Utilities warned this would damage investment, and on Tuesday the Confederation of British Industry's president, John Allan, said he feared the impact would spread beyond the businesses directly affected.
""Labour's proposals are not just a threat to these industries but to investment in our country at a time when it's most needed, and above all to that essential partnership between business and government,"" he told the CBI's annual dinner.
Business investment fell every quarter last year due to uncertainty about how Britain will leave the European Union, and most economists think it will be lackluster again in 2019.
However, Labour's would-be finance minister, John McDonnell, said the CBI was engaged in ""disappointing scaremongering"".
""Across the world, public ownership of basic utilities such as water and energy are a normal part of the 'essential partnership' between business and government, providing affordable and reliable services. It is time the CBI caught up,"" he said.
The CBI also criticized politicians for failing to have agreed on a plan for Brexit over the past year, and called on parliament to back the latest version of an exit deal unveiled by Prime Minister Theresa May earlier on Tuesday.
""Parliament must seize that opportunity. If not, the uncertainty will become far more acute,"" Allan said.
""It's not for business leaders to tell politicians when to trigger democratic events. But be in no doubt political failure today means economic failure tomorrow,"" he added.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party could not back May's new offer, calling it ""largely a rehash of the government's position"", and leading Conservative euro skeptics have also said they will vote against it next month.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co's mechanics union said on Tuesday its members had overwhelmingly voted to ratify a tentative contract agreement with the airline, ending seven years of labor negotiations fraught with legal disputes and flight disruptions.
The agreement came a day after rival U.S. carrier American Airlines Group Inc said it was filing a lawsuit against its own mechanics alleging an illegal slowdown aimed at disrupting operations to improve their position in labor talks, which began in 2015.
Analysts have highlighted labor issues as a main concern for airlines this year.
Mechanics at both American and Southwest have complained that the airlines are moving to outsource maintenance work that has traditionally been done in-house. 
In a statement on its website, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which represents around 2,500 Southwest mechanics, said about 95 percent of its members had voted to accept the labor agreement.
Separately on Tuesday, American Airlines' mechanics association said it was ""ready and willing"" to negotiate a fair contract.

""We would much prefer to be at the negotiating table than in a legal battle brought on by American,"" the TWU-IAM Association said in a statement.

The official said that while European nations probably won’t impose an outright legal ban on Huawei, the U.S. anticipates that many nations will effectively bar the company’s equipment from their next-generation telecom networks. The official asked not to be identified discussing private discussions.
Such moves would represent a victory for the Trump administration, which has warned against the use of Huawei in 5G systems and has opened its own campaign to blacklist the company and limit its access to American suppliers over security concerns. The official declined to name specific countries prepared to change their position.
In April, Bloomberg News reported that the U.K. is set to toughen the rules under which Huawei operates there, while stopping short of an outright ban.
The Trump administration held off on blacklisting Huawei out of concern the move could disrupt trade negotiations with China and took action only after the last round of talks hit an impasse, according to people familiar with the matter.
Officials including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and his team have repeatedly warned that the U.S. may limit intelligence-sharing with countries that use Huawei equipment for fear that China’s government could use the hardware to gain access to secret information. Huawei has rejected such assertions.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG truck brand Scania said on Tuesday it will invest 1.4 billion reais ($344.14 million) to modernize its Brazilian factory in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial city near Sao Paulo.
The investment in the historic center of Brazil's auto industry follows Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's decision to exit the heavy truck business in South America and shut down its plant in the same city, which could benefit the remaining players in the sector.
During the first four months of 2019, sales of Scania heavy trucks increased 31% compared to the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by local automakers association Anfavea.
The investment comes at a time when the state of Sao Paulo, which long dominated the Brazilian auto industry, has seen auto companies set up factories elsewhere, lured by tax incentives. 
Earlier this year, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) threatened big cuts in its Sao Paulo factories. That prompted state governor Joao Doria to negotiate aggressively, ending in the launch of a new incentive package for auto makers in the state. GM then decided to invest $2.7 billion to take advantage of the tax program.
The new Scania investment will start in 2021 and end in 2024, following its 2016 to 2020 investments, which total 2.6 billion reais, the company said in a joint statement with the Sao Paulo state government.
Scania's latest financial commitment is aimed at overhauling its assembly line, as well as introducing a new generation of trucks in Latin America.
The Swedish company is among the largest truck firms in Brazil, behind Mercedes-Benz and Volvo.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Democratic U.S. senators on Tuesday questioned a decision by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's U.S. unit to delay a union election for workers at its Tennessee assembly plant.
Earlier this month, the largest German automaker won its bid to put off a union vote for 1,700 workers at the Chattanooga plant until its challenge to a smaller United Auto Workers bargaining unit at the factory is settled.
The National Labor Relations Board, in a 2-1 decision on May 3, granted Volkswagen's motion to stay an election petition filed by some of its workers last month.
Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Sherrod Brown of Ohio wrote to Scott Keogh, president of Volkswagen Group of America, on Tuesday, expressing ""deep concern with delays"" to the vote.
""We urge you to immediately drop any efforts to oppose or postpone the election,"" the said.
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg urged VW to allow a vote of its workers: ""Volkswagen should stop obstructing the rights of Chattanooga workers to vote and have a union – enough is enough.""
Volkswagen spokesman Mark Clothier confirmed the company had received the letter and would respond. 
""We respect the decision of our team and their right to decide on representation. We have taken a neutral position on the issue and will continue to do so,"" Clothier said.
In December 2015, 160 skilled trade maintenance workers voted to unionize and affiliate with the UAW, the union said. 
VW declined to bargain with the union, saying the unit needed to include both skilled trade maintenance workers and production workers.
Volkswagen has stated it is neutral on workers joining a union but the senators said its ""actions suggest otherwise.""
VW began production in 2011 at the plant, which builds the Passat car and the Atlas SUV. In January, VW said it was investing $800 million to build a new electric vehicle in Tennessee and add 1,000 jobs at the Chattanooga plant that will begin EV production in 2022.
The senators ""have heard that facility supervisors in Chattanooga are engaging in direct anti-union conversations with workers in the workplace, including pulling workers off the production line to ask if they support the union,"" they said.
In February 2014, workers at the plant narrowly voted against union representation, which had been seen as organized labor's best chance to expand in the U.S. South.

UAW membership has plummeted 75 percent since 1979 and now stands at about 396,000. The UAW has failed for two decades to organize foreign automaker plants in the United States.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp was accused on Tuesday in 25 new lawsuits and regulatory charges of condoning sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliating against employees who speak up.
The cases announced by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the labor group Fight for $15, and the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund cover alleged misconduct at McDonald's locations in 20 U.S. cities, including groping, indecent exposure, propositions for sex, and lewd comments.
McDonald's is one of the world's most recognizable brands, and the cases make the fast-food chain a primary target of a campaign to extend the #MeToo movement, which sprung from sexual harassment cases in Hollywood, to the workplace.
The Chicago-based company said it has more than 14,000 locations in the United States with some 850,000 workers.
More than 90 percent of the locations are franchised, and McDonald's has long maintained it should not be liable for how employees in franchised restaurants behave.
Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said his company has improved and more clearly defined its harassment policies, has trained most franchise owners, and will be training front-line employees and setting up a complaint hotline.
""McDonald's is sending a clear message that we are committed to creating and sustaining a culture of trust where employees feel safe, valued and respected,"" Easterbrook wrote in letters this week to Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth and ""Top Chef"" host Padma Lakshmi, who supports the workers' cause.
The 25 cases include three new lawsuits, two by workers who previously filed charges, and charges filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
McDonald's has faced more than 50 such charges and lawsuits in the last three years, the ACLU said. Last September, McDonald's workers in 10 cities staged a one-day strike to protest alleged sexual harassment.
Jamelia Fairley, a single mother who makes $9.60 an hour at a corporate-owned McDonald's in Sanford, Florida, told reporters she went to the EEOC after a co-worker began groping her, rubbing against her and saying he could ""give me a ride.""
She said that after she reported the harassment, McDonald's transferred but did not fire her harasser, while her boss cut her weekly hours to seven from 25,
""Trying to raise a 2-year old on $67 a week is, well, I can't do it,"" Fairley said.
Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time's Up fund, which is part of the National Women's Law Center, said having to put up with workplace harassment should not be a cost of making a living.

""For McDonald's, time is past up,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog has proposed fining KPMG 12.5 million pounds ($16 million) for errors in checking whether BNY Mellon bank was complying with rules for safeguarding client assets.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it has asked an independent disciplinary tribunal on Tuesday to levy the fine, a record for the watchdog if confirmed.
KPMG and one of its partners admitted to serious failings last September, and tribunal hearing was limited to sanctions.
KPMG said it accepts and regrets that some of its work for BNY Mellon's London branch in the year ended December 2011 did not fully reflect all aspects of official guidance from the FRC.
""We are committed to cooperating with our regulator to bring these historic cases to conclusion as swiftly as possible,"" KPMG said on Tuesday.
""However, in this instance we could not agree with the FRC on the level of appropriate sanctions, which will now be determined by an independent tribunal,"" KPMG added.
The FRC has been asking for higher fines after accusations from lawmakers of being too cosy with big accounting firms like KPMG.
An independent report from former judge Christopher Clark in 2017 said KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC, known collectively as the Big Four, should be hit with fines of 10 million pounds or more for serious incompetence.
PwC was later fined a record 10 million pounds by the FRC over its audit of collapsed retailer BHS, a sum cut to 6.5 million pounds after the accounting firm agreed to settle early.
KPMG is still being investigated by the FRC over its audit of collapsed construction company Carillion that, along with the collapse of BHS, led to radical reforms being proposed for the audit sector.

The law is at the center of a criminal probe and demands by investors who have accused Slovenia's central bank of wrongly causing them losses when the 3.2 billion euro ($3.6 billion) lifeline was extended to the country's financial industry.
Lawmakers approved the draft in the first of three readings Tuesday. While they said that it requires some changes, the assembly agreed that the central bank should be responsible for paying compensation if courts rule in favor of investors who have incurred losses during the rescue, a so-called ""bail-in"". The ECB and central bank say it is the government that should pay.
""There are severe concerns about the credibility of the bail-in regime, as well as central bank independence,"" Markus Ferber, a German member of European Parliament, wrote in an email. Ferber made the comment after he expressed his concerns in a letter to European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis.
While Slovenia, a nation of 2 million people, is one of the smallest EU members, the draft law may have far reaching consequences for the euro area.
If approved, it could set a precedent that may undermine countries' efforts to make investors share the burden of financial-sector rescues. It also risks depleting the central bank reserves of euro-area members, thereby having implications for the single-currency zone as a whole.
The banking rescue, which was approved by the European Commission and the ECB, wrote off 963 million euros in bonds and stocks of Slovenia's state-owned lenders so that investors would share some of the burden with taxpayers, who footed the rest of the bill."

LONDON (Reuters) - Metro Bank escaped a potential investor challenge at its annual meeting on Tuesday, but there were sizeable votes against several of its most senior directors.
The bank, which was set up nine years ago to take on Britain's established lenders, disclosed in January it had under-reported the risk on its loan book, which hit its capital and shares and put its management under pressure.
Ahead of the annual meeting, Legal & General Investment Management and Royal London Asset Management had both said they would vote against key directors. Shareholder advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS had urged investors to block or withhold support on several resolutions.
But despite this opposition, chairman and founder Vernon Hill has retained the support of a close-knit group of private shareholders in the United States. 
At the annual meeting, the re-election of Hill was opposed by more than 12% of investors who voted, while CEO Craig Donaldson was opposed by just over 10%.
Metro's pay report was opposed by 21% of investors who voted, while 28% voted against the re-appointment of board directors Stuart Bernau and Eugene Lockhart.
The bank's loan book error had wiped more than 1.5 billion pounds off the company's market value and forced it into an early 375 million pound fundraising.
Some customers also pulled their money out of the bank, although Metro said last week the situation had stabilized and the Bank of England said the lender remained robust.
The crisis has been the first major test for Metro Bank since its launch in 2010 to try to shake up Britain's banking market and which unusually focuses on rolling out brick and mortar branches.
In opening remarks at the meeting, Hill and Donaldson said the bank would adapt its strategy by slowing its growth and cutting more costs, but defended the bank's business model.
""The last few months have been somewhat of a challenge for us. We’ve had a few ups and downs but our model remains strong,"" Hill said.
John Cronin, analyst at Goodbody, had commented ahead of the meeting: ""To be fair, the founder and CEO were clearly instrumental in Metro's successful 375 million pound placing last week.
""The U.S. shareholders are particularly supportive of the chairman and the strength of their collective vote will outweigh the dissenters in my opinion.""

215,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Britain's Big Four accountants could gain reprieve from audit reform,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's business ministry will consult further on sweeping reforms of the audit market, it told Reuters, stopping short of legislation demanded by lawmakers.
Last month the Competition and Markets Authority proposed some of the biggest reforms to auditing globally since the aftermath of the Enron scandal, recommending new laws to force the so-called Big Four firms to separate their audit and consulting arms and requiring most listed companies to be audited by two different firms.
Business minister Greg Clark had told parliament he would bring forward the legislation needed to implement the reforms before the end of this year, though a slot was needed in parliament's Brexit-clogged calendar.
Now the ministry has told Reuters that, while still committed to reforming the industry, it plans to consult further before considering any new laws.
""We will publicly consult on any proposed changes,"" it told Reuters.
The reforms involve major change for the Big Four of EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC in Britain and come in the wake of the collapse of companies including construction group Carillion and retailer BHS, where auditors were criticised for not spotting looming problems. 
The big accounting firms have lobbied strongly against the proposals, arguing they won't necessarily raise audit standards.
Now it looks like they will either have more time to influence the new rules or possibly not face any new legislation at all.
With Britain's departure from the European Union clogging up parliament, the ministry might ask the sector to change its practices voluntarily, industry officials said.
""With the legislative focus on Brexit, the government could seek undertakings from the Big Four to voluntarily adopt some of its preferred measures rather than wait for a slot in the parliamentary calendar to become available,"" said Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW professional accounting body.
A Big Four source said they now expect the government to look at voluntary changes because legislation could take until 2021 to come into effect, with a general election also likely between now and then. 
FUDGE FEARS
Parliament's business committee has said it wants change fast and its members could view voluntary changes instead of legislation as a fudge. 
""I hope the government will rise to this challenge and resist the urge to kick audit reforms into the long grass,"" the committee's chair, Rachel Reeves, told Reuters
KPMG's UK arm, which audited Carillion, announced last week that there will be more separate performance management and governance of the audit business from June -- steps that fall short of the full operational split proposed by the CMA.
KPMG said it was looking closely at how it might introduce further measures in coming months. PwC, which audited BHS, said it was also taking steps to strengthen its governance and enhance audit quality.
EY declined to comment and Deloitte had no immediate comment on whether it would take pre-emptive action.
The government could also ask the Big Four to voluntarily divest a number of their audits, ICAEW's Izza said, making room for smaller accounting firms such as BDO, Grant Thornton and Mazars to pick up more book-keeping work among blue-chip clients.

The Big Four source said that voluntarily agreeing not to take on audits could be in breach of European Union competition law.

219,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 12:23PM ET</span>","Home Depot same-store sales disappoint, warns of tariff impact","By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) on Tuesday blamed wet weather in February and a slump in lumber prices for its slowest growth in quarterly same-store sales in at least three years, while warning of a $1 billion impact from new tariffs on Chinese imports. 
Bad weather along with land and labor shortages have constrained builders' ability to construct new houses especially in the low-price segment, creating a supply glut for lumber, a key building material.
Home Depot said weak lumber prices hurt its first-quarter sales growth by $200 million and if prices do not improve for the rest of its fiscal year, it could dent overall sales by as much as another $600 million.
Lumber futures have fallen 28.6% since their 2019 highs in early February. The commodity made up nearly 8% of Home Depot's sales in the last fiscal year.
The unfavorable weather also led contractors to delay housing projects and prevented the company's do-it-yourself customers from working outdoors, further impacting demand for Home Depot's products in February. 
Same-store sales at the home improvement chain rose 2.5% in the quarter ended May 5, but missed expectations of a 4.2% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Still, Home Depot marginally beat overall net sales estimates as it services like credit lines and equipment rentals to rope in more big and frequent spending clients such as electricians, plumbers and builders.
In a conference call with analysts, Edward Decker, executive vice president of merchandising, said Washington's latest round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would raise annual cost of goods sold by about $1 billion. 
The company said it has already seen a $1 billion impact from U.S. tariffs enacted in 2018.
The impact, however, is manageable, Decker said, as it was less than 1% of total annual sales. In the last fiscal year, the company's net sales was $108.2 billion.
""We haven't worked through what we will do if the cost increase comes to us,"" outgoing Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé told Reuters, when asked if the company would raise its product prices. 
""Sometimes when we have cost increases, we pass it through in retail prices, sometimes we don't.""
The company's net income rose to $2.51 billion, or $2.27 per share, and beat analyst average estimate of $2.18 per share.

Net sales rose 5.7% to $26.38 billion, beating expectations of $26.36 billion.

221,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>","Who pays Trump's tariffs, China or U.S. customers and companies?","(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump says China pays the tariffs he has imposed on $250 billion of Chinese exports to the United States.
But that is not how tariffs work. China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by U.S.-registered firms to U.S. customs for the goods they import into the United States.
Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.
U.S. business executives and economists say U.S. consumers foot much of the bill through rising prices.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that ""both sides will suffer on this,"" contradicting the president.
The tariff bill is set to rise further. Trump this month directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to launch the process of imposing tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of goods from China. That includes products ranging from cellphones to baby pacifiers.
That would mean almost all imports from China would be subject to a 25 percent import tax.
U.S. COMPANIES SEE RISING CONSUMER PRICES
A growing number of U.S. companies has warned about the negative impact of the tariffs on U.S. consumers.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and 172 other footwear companies have urged Trump to remove footwear from a list of imports facing a proposed extra 25% tariff, warning the move could cost consumers an additional $7 billion a year.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest retailer, and department store chain Macy's Inc have warned that prices for shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on goods from China.
WHAT THE 'TARIFF MAN' SAYS
Trump, who has called himself the ""Tariff Man,"" has often repeated that China pays for U.S. tariffs on its goods.
""We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury — billions — from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in,"" he said on Jan. 24.
On May 5, he tweeted: ""For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.""
As well as imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump has also imposed a tax on global steel and aluminum imports and shipments of washing machines and solar panels.
HOW TARIFFS REALLY WORK
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects the tax on imports. The agency typically requires importers to pay duties within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs. 
Through May 1, Washington has assessed $23.7 billion in tariffs since early 2018, according to data from the CBP.
Total tariff revenue - including levies that pre-dated Trump - shot up by 89% in the first half of the current fiscal year starting Oct. 1, to a total of $34.7 billion, according to U.S. Treasury data.
Every item imported into the United States legally has a customs code. Importers are expected to check the tariffs and other taxes and duties due on the goods they bring in, calculate what they owe, and pay it.
U.S. Customs reviews payments and sends importers a fresh bill if it detects underpayment.
Importers also have to post payment guarantees, or import bonds, with customs. The costs of these bonds have risen with tariffs, an additional burden on U.S.-based firms importing goods from China. 
DO CHINESE SUPPLIERS BEAR THE COSTS OF U.S. TARIFFS?
Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of U.S. tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer U.S. importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher U.S. duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if U.S. importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China.
And outside of tariffs, the Trump administration's decision to add China's Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, to a trade blacklist, has hit that company hard.
But U.S.-based importers are managing the higher tax burden in a number of ways that hurt U.S. companies and customers more than China. 
Such strategies include accepting lower profit margins; cutting costs - including wages and jobs for U.S. workers; deferring any potential wage hikes, as well as passing on tariff costs through higher prices for U.S. consumers or companies.
Most importers use a mix of such tactics to spread the higher costs among suppliers and consumers or buyers.
HIGHER PRICES FOR TRACTORS, WASHING MACHINES
Higher duties on imports of metals and Chinese products, for example, increased Caterpillar's production costs by more than $100 million last year. In response, the heavy-duty equipment maker increased prices for its products.
Tractor manufacturer Deere & Co estimates a $100 million increase in its raw materials costs this year because of Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. Deere has cut costs and increased prices to protect its profits.
A Congressional Research Service report in February found that the tariffs boosted washing machine prices by as much as 12%, compared to January 2018, before tariffs took effect.
Steel and aluminum tariffs increased the price of steel products by nearly 9% last year, pushing up costs for steel users by $5.6 billion, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
U.S. companies and consumers paid $3 billion a month in additional taxes because of tariffs on Chinese goods and on aluminum and steel from around the globe, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University. Companies shouldered an additional $1.4 billion in costs related to lost efficiency in 2018, the study found.
WHAT DO COMPANIES IN CHINA PAY?
China has retaliated against U.S. tariffs by imposing its own tariffs on imports from the United States.
Most importers in China are Chinese. So in the same way the U.S. government collects import taxes on Chinese goods from U.S. importers, the Chinese government takes in taxes on U.S. goods from Chinese importers. 
As with tariffs in the United States, Chinese firms can seek to pass on the costs to U.S. exporters. Some U.S. interests have lost business, such as U.S. soy farmers.

Chinese buyers have cut billions of dollars of soybean purchases from the United States because China's tariffs have made U.S. supplies more expensive than beans from competitors such as Brazil.

223,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 11:35AM ET</span>","J.C. Penney sales fall short, net loss doubles; shares sink","By Melissa Fares and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Same-store sales fell more than expected at J.C. Penney Co Inc in the first quarter and its net loss nearly doubled after the retailer exited its appliance and in-store furniture businesses, sending shares down more than 9% on Tuesday.
The 117-year-old department store chain, which earlier this year said it was ditching major appliances like refrigerators and washing machines to focus on clothing, said that move cut comparable sales by 20 basis points.
Chief Executive Jill Soltau, on an earnings conference call, warned investors that Penney would likely take a further hit if U.S. President Donald Trump imposed additional tariffs on another $300 billion worth of imports from China.
""We do anticipate a more meaningful impact on both our private and national brands if the potential fourth tranche of tariffs does go into effect,"" said Soltau. 
Shares sank 9.6% to $1.04 in morning trading. Penney was the second biggest decliner among S&P 600 companies.
Washington's escalation of a 10-month trade war with Beijing by raising levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods had a minimal impact on the business thus far, Soltau said.
Soltau reassured investors the company had worked hard ""for the better part of the last several years"" to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers and would try to reduce any consequential impact.
Last week, Macy's Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc delivered a similar warning, alerting investors that prices for shoppers would rise due to higher tariffs on goods from China.
'WEAK OPERATOR'
Some analysts expressed concern about Penney's future prospects.
A key concern was whether the company ""will run out of time and capital to make the necessary changes,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in an analyst note. 
""JC Penney is a very weak operator in one of the toughest sectors of a highly competitive retail market in an era of more subdued demand from highly fickle consumers.""
Penney, which reiterated its previously issued financial forecast for the year, expects free cash flow to be positive for fiscal 2019. No details on the forecast were provided due to management transitions, the retailer said.
Analysts expect a loss of 77 cents per share, compared with a loss of 94 cents in 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Separately, rival Kohl's Corp slashed its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday after missing estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit, sending shares down 11%.
One of the oldest names in American retail, J.C. Penney has struggled to excite customers with its mid-priced clothing and has steadily lost out to fast-fashion brands and online shopping.
Penney has tried to strengthen its apparel business to compete with online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and off-price retailers like TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos Inc.
The Plano, Texas-based company has shut hundreds of stores over the years and revamped its locations to boost sales and revive profits. It has also identified inventory management as a top priority. 
Sales at stores open for at least 12 months fell 5.5% in the first quarter, its sixth straight quarterly drop. Analysts, on average, had expected a 4.21% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's net loss nearly doubled to $154 million, or 48 cents per share, in the three months ended May 4.
Excluding one-time items, the company lost 46 cents a share, more than the 38-cent loss analysts had expected.
Total revenue decreased 4.3% to $2.56 billion, in line with the average analyst estimate. 
The company said it hired Shawn Gensch as its chief customer officer. Gensch, hailing from Sprouts Farmers Market Inc, will oversee marketing strategies relating to areas including digital, advertising and customer research.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) said shareholders approved a $21 million pay package for Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault during the company's annual meeting on Tuesday.
A nonbinding resolution to endorse the executive compensation passed with a majority of votes cast, company Chairman Doug Steenland announced, adding that further details would be released later in the day.
Influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to vote against compensation packages for the insurer's top executives, arguing in recent reports that AIG's top executives get paid too much.
AIG's executive compensation has an ""unmitigated pay-for-performance misalignment,"" ISS said in a report on May 7.
""The company paid more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,"" Glass Lewis said in a report seen by Reuters that was distributed last month.
AIG's stock has declined 14.75 percent since Duperreault took charge in May 2017.
In the first quarter, AIG showed signs of improvement. It beat Wall Street expectations, with its general insurance business posting an underwriting profit for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.

Duperreault said at the time that he expected the company to record an underwriting profit for the full year.

Asked about the regulatory problems facing Huawei, he told investors: ""Perhaps there is long term opportunity but more than that, it's hard to say at this point.""
Analysts expect Nokia and its Swedish peer Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) to benefit from tensions between the United States and Huawei, the largest supplier of mobile network technology.
Nokia last month reported a surprise quarterly loss after it failed to supply 5G telecoms equipment in time. 
Suri acknowledged the company had been a little slow in getting 5G technology up and running, citing merging its own technology plans with those of acquired Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA) as a reason.
""We are late in 5G by a few weeks to a couple of months,"" Suri told the Finnish company's annual shareholder meeting.
Nokia said it has won one additional commercial 5G contract since it reported first quarter earnings in late April.
""We are winning deals and rolling out some of the world's first 5G networks,"" Suri said.
""We now have 37 5G commercial contracts - 20 with named customers including T-Mobile, AT&T (NYSE:T), STC, and Telia - and more than half of them include wider portfolio elements that our competitors cannot match,"" he added. 
Suri told investors he remained confident the company would reach its annual financial guidance. Nokia repeated in April its forecast for 2019 underlying diluted earnings per share of 25-29 euro cents, and non-IFRS operating margin of 9-12%.

Shares in Nokia were up 1.9 percent in late trading in Helsinki.

(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc on Tuesday agreed to buy Peloton Therapeutics Inc for $1.05 billion in cash, gaining access to the privately held company's lead kidney cancer drug candidate.
The acquisition can strengthen Merck's presence in the field of renal cell carcinoma and bolster its cancer drug portfolio. 
Merck's blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda was approved last month in the United States for treating renal cell cancer. 
""This is a classic bolt-on deal. Peloton has a drug that looks promising in renal cell carcinoma, and there's actually been a lot of success in the field in recent years,"" said Brad Loncar, who runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. 
Peloton expects to start studying its lead drug, a kidney cancer treatment code named as ""PT2977"", in a late-stage trial in the second half of this year. 
In an older mid-stage trial testing patients whose cancer had spread even after treatment with at least one therapy, 24% of patients treated with Peloton's drug showed an at least 30% shrinkage of targeted lesions.
Confident of its pipeline, Peloton was earlier looking to go public and had given a pricing range of $15 to $17 per share for its initial public offering last week.
At the upper limit of that range, the company would have been valued at $903.6 million, including underwriters' option and other outstanding shares. 
With the Merck deal now in place, Peloton shareholders would be eligible to receive a further $1.15 billion on achieving certain sales and regulatory milestones. 
""The deal announced today should also underscore the opportunity for other small and mid cap biotech names in the cancer biology space,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was financial adviser for Merck and Centerview Partners was to Peloton.

Turkish Airlines grounded all commercial flights by Boeing 737 Max models on March 13 until uncertainty over the safety of the aircraft was resolved, after an accident in Ethiopia killed 157 people in the second such crash for the model in recent months.
Turkish Airlines Chairman Ilker Ayci said on Tuesday he would meet Boeing's CEO on Friday to discuss the airline's pending orders from Boeing and its expectations for compensation for its losses, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.
""There are undoubtedly steps that we expect them to take, in light of our expectations or the sector's realities, to resolve our losses, capacity issues we are experiencing and frequency problems to a certain extent,"" Ayci was quoted as saying.
""They are taking these steps seriously since they are coming to visit directly at the highest level,"" Ayci said, adding that he expected the issue to be resolved by the end of the summer.
Several nations, including the United States, Singapore, Britain and Australia, suspended Boeing 737 Max flights in March after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, leaving the world's largest planemaker facing its worst crisis in years.
Several airlines have since asked for compensation from Boeing, including United, Ryanair, China Eastern Airlines, and Flydubai.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is hosting a meeting of global regulators in Dallas on Thursday to review software and training proposals from Boeing before deciding whether, and when, to end the two-month grounding.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) has attracted only tepid interest in plans for its latest multibillion-dollar debt sale, banking sources say, suggesting the kingdom is losing its appeal for some lenders.
International banks have flocked to join the efforts of the the Middle East's largest economy to reduce its reliance on oil and have continued to seek Saudi business despite Riyadh's relations with Western allies being tested by the murder last year of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The Saudi government has raised nearly $60 billion in global bonds since 2016, as well as a $16 billion international loan, with a string of state entities also joining the debt bonanza, including this year's $12 billion bond issue from oil giant Saudi Aramco.
Though banks have queued up for relatively low-earning Saudi sovereign bonds and loans in the expectation this would lead to more lucrative work, postponement of Aramco's planned stock market listing and a slow start to a slate of other planned privatizations have left some lenders disappointed. 
""Banks had been made a lot of promises, on the equity side mostly, and what is happening is just sovereign borrowing,"" said one banker with an international lender.
Having raised $11 billion through a syndicated five-year loan last year, PIF is in talks with international banks for an expected $8 billion offering to be paid back within one year from the sale of the sovereign fund's 70% stake in petrochemicals company SABIC to Aramco.
""Banks already participated in the (PIF) term loan, so they're hesitant to also participate in the bridge loan if it's not at commercial terms and more about relationship lending,"" said another banker who is familiar with the matter.
Some large banks, such as HSBC and Citi, will participate, the sources said, meaning the deal is likely to get done. But the waning interest indicates that Saudi Arabia may have to start paying higher rates for sovereign debt that is not a precursor to more profitable work. 
Last year sources said that PIF's $11 billion loan paid 75 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), the same rate paid by the government itself.
A group of 15 lenders took part in that deal, including European, Asian and U.S. banks.
LOW MARGINS
PIF's new loan is also expected to offer relatively low margins, with one source saying he expected it to be around 30 basis points above Libor, adding to the lack of enthusiasm. 
A PIF spokesman said the fund ""does not comment on rumours or speculation regarding transactions"".
He added that PIF's ""long-term funding strategy includes four sources of finance, including capital injections and asset transfers by the government, retained investment returns and loans and debt instruments"". 
Banks tend to establish or strengthen relationships with clients by providing relatively cheap financing in the hope of winning further business in areas such as trade finance or capital markets.
Saudi Arabia's economic reforms include privatizations, large infrastructure projects and the planned flotation of Aramco in a transaction expected to net $100 billion for the state and millions of dollars for arrangers.
However, Aramco's initial public offering has been postponed until 2021 and the other work expected has been slow to appear.
When Saudi Arabia started its borrowing spree, bankers said it was made clear in conversations that the government was asking them to lend cheaply in return for more profitable mandates further down the line.
Banks with large balance sheets and a strong presence in the Middle East, such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC, have been able to lend extensively at low margins but new borrowing requests from the Saudis are starting to fatigue medium-sized banks, the sources said.
""For some European banks, which have a very high cost of funding, this is a problem and they are feeling the pinch,"" one of the sources said.
The new PIF loan has also raised concern among potential lenders because it is unclear how the loan will be used because it is not tied to any specific investment or acquisition.
""There's no visibility in terms of deals and upcoming business,"" one of the sources said.

232,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 09:53AM ET</span>",Airbus pledges counter-punch to new Boeing mid-sized jet,"By Tim Hepher
TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus hinted on Tuesday at a price battle to counter a possible new Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft in the middle of the jet market, promising a ""left hook, right hook"" salvo from two of its well-established models.
U.S. planemaker Boeing is studying whether to launch a 220-270-seat jet wedged between traditional twin-aisle models like the Airbus A330 or its own 787, and the industry's bread-and-butter single-aisle models like the A320/321 and Boeing 737.
Airbus aims to defend that space with its own A330neo at the top end and the best-selling A321neo at the bottom - two models boasting new engines on older airframes. 
""Those programmes are both so mature that it gives Airbus pricing flexibility to address this middle-of-the-market segment,"" sales chief Christian Scherer said.
He promised what he described as a ""left-hook, right-hook approach"" to that part of the market, using the two Airbus jets, as airlines replace Boeing 757 and some larger 767 aircraft.
Boeing says its possible mid-market aircraft would be significantly more efficient than either Airbus model, but it is under pressure from airlines to develop it at the right price.
Boeing continues to promote the project behind the scenes while toning down public discussions as it focuses on resolving the crisis over its grounded 737 MAX, airline sources say.
The two giants are playing reverse roles at the top end of the $150 billion annual jet market, where Boeing's upcoming 406-seat 777X - a derivative of its 777 mini-jumbo with new engines - is up against the newer and slightly smaller A350-1000.
Scherer mocked the 777X as a ""re-engined Hummer"" hobbled by excess weight compared with the carbon A350. Boeing, which recently won a deal to sell the 777X to British Airways after a gap in sales, maintains it is the most efficient plane per seat.
Boeing has outsold the A350-1000 almost two to one with its 777X, but its order book is heavily dependent on Gulf carriers whose expansion plans look increasingly fragile, analysts say.
MARKET REASSURANCE
New operations chief Michael Schoellhorn said Airbus had launched studies on squeezing more efficiencies out of its core European factories and on whether it needed to buy in capabilities currently left with its suppliers.
Airbus is talking to Canada's Bombardier about a Belfast, Northern Ireland, wings plant that is up for sale. The plant makes wings for the 110-130-seat A220 jet programme that Bombardier sold to Airbus last year. Airbus announced plans to bump up the range of the jet to stimulate more sales.
As it ramps up production, Airbus also played down concerns that the aviation industry is reaching the top of its business cycle after a near decade-long expansion.
""The market remains quite positive"" and less dependent on economic cycles than before, Scherer said.
Airbus officials nonetheless voiced concerns over the impact of renewed trade tensions on demand.
Worries about a trade war between the United States and China have rattled financial markets this month. [MKTS/GLOB]
Last week, global airlines body IATA said it expected increasing trade tensions and higher costs would mean a cut in 2019 industry profit forecasts.
Airbus and Boeing have had a weak start to the year as concerns grow over the economy and as Boeing wrestles with the impact of the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner on orders.
Both have posted more cancellations than new business in the first four months of the year, with Boeing worst affected.
On Monday, Reuters reported Airbus had lost a bid to oust Boeing as sole provider of wide-body jets to Air New Zealand, with an announcement expected within days on a deal to buy Boeing 787s to replace part of its fleet. 
In an unexpected European breakthrough, China Airlines this month forged a deal paving the way for the Taiwan carrier to switch its single-aisle fleet to Airbus from the Boeing 737 MAX.

The deal to replace older 737s took years to complete and was originally drafted before the 737 MAX crisis.

The nation sold six billion euros ($6.7 billion) of 20-year securities, having received over 21 billion euros of orders from investors. The amount sold was at the top end of the four-to-six-billion-euro estimate provided by the Dutch Treasury beforehand.
Green sovereign bond issues have grown in popularity over the last few years after Poland became the first nation in 2016 to do so. France, Belgium and Ireland have also sold bonds that allocate the proceeds to environmentally-friendly causes, while Germany is weighing up a similar move as early as next year, according to reports.
“It is an encouraging sign for further sovereign green bond deals,” said Antoine Bouvet, an interest-rate strategist at Mizuho International Plc. “We expect France to conduct a syndicated tap of its green OAT, perhaps as early as June.”
The Dutch green bond offered a coupon of 0.5%, compared to a current yield of around 0.4% for conventional 20-year bonds. Dutch bonds have climbed this year to push benchmark 10-year yields toward zero as investors have bought haven assets amid stalling inflation and geopolitical risks.
A cumulative $580 billion of green bonds were sold through 2018, and another $170 billion to $180 billion are likely to be sold this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

235,By Business Insider,"<span>May 21, 2019 09:17AM ET</span>",MORGAN STANLEY: 3 trends will dictate the fate of global markets for the rest of the year. Here's how to profit from each one.,"Morgan Stanley's cross-asset strategists are convinced it's time to be defensive, but not yet flat-out bearish, on the  stock market.
For investors who buy into their outlook, this posture is intended to profit from whatever gains remain in this  bull market and still be adequately prepared for the next downturn.
They are specifically cautious about US stocks, and recommend that investors take risks more aggressively in other markets. The basis of this call is that their US cycle indicator of macro, corporate, and credit conditions is in ""downturn"" mode for the first time since 2007.
""'Downturn' historically sees worse-than-average returns for risk assets, but not necessarily immediate losses, at least for equities,"" Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley's chief cross-asset strategist, said in a recent note to clients.
Sheets laid out the three ""gaps"" that matter most for how markets will perform in the second half of the year, when this downturn could start materializing. He included investing recommendations for Morgan Stanley's views on how these trends will play out. All quotes below are attributed to Sheets.
The difference between the US economy's current output and its potential capacity — otherwise known as the output gap — is still wide enough that inflation is not a big headache for markets.
Instead, traders have priced in a so-called Goldilocks scenario in which the  Federal Reserve keeps interest rates steady and probably cuts them sometime during the next 12 months.
Morgan Stanley says the opposite scenario is more likely: They expect output to rise even closer to its potential, putting pressure on the Fed to make policy decisions that won't be palatable to stock-market investors.
""With US stocks expensive but US Treasuries offering higher real yields than other DM markets, we are underweight US equities, underweight US credit and overweight high-quality US bonds (Treasuries, agency mortgages).""
Morgan Stanley expects Europe and China to benefit from easier fiscal stimulus, putting their growth ahead of the US's. They prefer taking risk outside the US for this reason.
""Valuations on stocks outside the US look better, especially in Japan, where we think markets unappreciated the corporate reform story. We lower EM equities to 'equal-weight', and make Japan our most-preferred equity region.""
Many stock markets have rallied this year even though analysts have lowered their earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley said. The rallies have also happened at the expense of value stocks.
""Look for relative value in pricing disconnects: We like owning European value vs. growth and India and Brazil equities over Taiwan and Korea. We like China and Mexico rates."""

240,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Beyond Meat Wipeout Predicted by Kazakh Who Nailed Facebook IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- In the world of high finance, Erlan Abdikarimov is as small-time as they come. A 30-year-old stock analyst, he plies his trade in Kazakhstan, where he advises investors about local companies and initial public offerings in the U.S.
So when Abdikarimov came out last week with a dire warning on  Beyond Meat Inc ., predicting shares would plunge, no one on Wall Street took much notice. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), after all, is the hottest IPO the U.S. market has seen in more than a decade, having more than tripled since its May 1 debut. Who was this guy to throw cold water?
As it turns out, he’s a guy with something of a track record. Back in 2012, Abdikarimov came out with an aggressively bearish call on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) before its IPO, setting the lowest target of anyone surveyed by Bloomberg, and issuing a sell recommendation after shares started trading. That proved prescient as the stock tumbled 30% in its first year, briefly turning Abdikarimov into a bit of a star at the age of 24.
Now he’s waving clients off the maker of faux meat, which he sees as up against too much competition to be flying so high. The rally is “largely fueled by a speculative mood and not by a real assessment of the prospects,” said Abdikarimov, who cut the shares to hold. “As soon as the first wave of speculative buying is over, we will see a correction.”
Abdikarimov, who works in Almaty for Freedom Finance JSC, Kazakhstan’s biggest brokerage, is one of only two analysts who cover Beyond Meat at the moment. The other, Bernstein’s Alexia Howard, has an outperform rating on the stock and a target of $81.
At its current $86, the company is trading at about 59 times its 2018 earnings, after an IPO priced at $25. It made history with the strongest debut session since the financial crisis and was the best performing equity in the U.S. last week. Buyers have pilled in even as short interest sky-rocketed to 44% of free float, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Abdikarimov is sticking to his $28.40 target. “The stock’s current price implies some very optimistic assumptions,” he said.
The analyst acknowledges that he’s at a disadvantage in terms of a super-comprehensive assessment, having, for one thing, never tasted Beyond Meat’s veggie burgers. They’re not available in Kazakhstan, where the cuisine revolves around actual meat and people are quite skeptical of substitutes. However, he’s heard good things about the product. “My colleagues in Moscow who’ve had them said it really is hard to tell the difference.”
The fundamentals, though, have him predicting the company won’t be able to break even before 2025. A big factor is the competition, which is heating up, with giants like  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN). planning to launch meat-substitute products. Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) has introduced a plant-based burger in Europe and will roll it out in the U.S. this fall. Impossible Foods Inc. raised $300 million in its latest round, which values the company at $2 billion, according to Reuters.
In his five years with Freedom Finance, Abdikarimov has covered about 58 initial offerings. He has had hits and misses -- the latter, recently, with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)., whose post-IPO slides he didn’t see coming. He has buys on both but said he intends to revise them.
“Any IPO has its own speculative games. It could take from a few months to half a year or even a year from them to play out,” he said. Facebook, after all, came out of its rocky start nicely, having rallied about 390% since then."

Bayer last week admitted that Monsanto, which it acquired for $63 billion last year, had gathered non-public information as part of the campaign, which French media said sought to influence the public debate on pesticides and genetically modified products.
Bayer faces potentially heavy litigation costs from U.S. class-action lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim that its Roundup weedkiller, which contains glyphosate, causes cancer. Bayer disputes this.
In a Q&A document posted on its website on Tuesday, Bayer said U.S public relations and marketing agency FleishmanHillard, on behalf of Monsanto, had mapped stakeholders in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and United Kingdom as well as stakeholders related to EU institutions.
Sidley Austin will investigate how many stakeholders were included in those files and whether people from other countries could also be affected, Bayer said. 
The law firm would then contact affected people, most of them journalists, politicians and scientists, no later than by the end of the coming week. 
French prosecutors said they had opened an inquiry after newspaper Le Monde filed a complaint alleging that Monsanto had kept a file of 200 names in hopes of influencing their positions.
Bayer has ended its PR collaboration with FleishmanHillard, but continues to work with the firm on marketing projects. 

Bayer shares have shed more than 40 percent since a first adverse U.S. judgment on Roundup last August, leaving the company with a market capitalization smaller than the price it paid for Monsanto.

242,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Shareholder Activists May Target Pot Stocks Next,"(Bloomberg) -- An investor’s opposition to Canopy Growth Corp's (TO:WEED) acquisition of  Acreage Holdings Inc  (CSE:ACRGu) may signal a new trend for an industry that’s largely been free from shareholder activism.
Marcato Capital Management, which holds Acreage shares, has said it will vote against the deal because it undervalues the New York-based company. Marcato believes the value of pot firms will soar with U.S. legalization, so “it is highly imprudent for Acreage to sell itself today at the proposed valuation, with so much unlocked growth and value embedded in the company.’’
Acreage said the view is inconsistent with “the vast majority of shareholders.’’Still, it marks the first time an activist investor has waded into the cannabis industry and could be a sign of things to come, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kenneth Shea and Gopal Srinivasan.
Marcato’s opposition “may be a precursor of rising shareholder ire targeting cannabis companies that are perceived to not be acting in the best interest of all shareholders,’’ the analysts said in a recent note.
High valuations, unprofitable operations and insular ownership structures may prompt activists to get involved in the industry, the analysts said. Rising short interest in some pot stocks is the first indication of investor dissatisfaction, and has pressured companies like Aphria Inc. to make significant changes to their management teams and boards.
Peltz Hire
Some companies appear to be getting out ahead of this potential trend. Aurora Cannabis Inc. recently hired Nelson Peltz as a strategic adviser. Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP has a long history of agitating for change at consumer companies, including Procter & Gamble Co.,  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ). and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc.311044634
New York-based pot firm iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc. hasn’t come under pressure from activist investors – in fact, investment research firm Hedgeye Risk Management recently praised its corporate governance. But it’s still in the process of revamping its entire board to make it wholly independent by the end of the year, according to Chief Executive Officer Hadley Ford.
“There absolutely will be’’ a rise in shareholder activism, Ford said in an interview at a cannabis conference last week. “Think about it if you’re a U.S. investor: if a U.S. institution’s going to come off the sidelines and invest in cannabis, we want them to think about coming into us as the bellwether stock to have exposure to that business.’’
Some Baggage
It’s inevitable that an industry that was illegal until recently in many jurisdictions (and remains illegal in many more) comes with some baggage, said Dan Daviau, CEO of Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., the Canadian investment bank.
“If you were in this industry 10 years ago you were clearly breaking the law somewhere and you were probably a person of a reputation that didn’t mind breaking the law,’’ Daviau said in an interview. “But the industry is maturing incredibly quickly and I’m not saying you still won’t see the odd company step on a rake and hit their nose, but the propensity for that to happen has slowed down a lot.’’

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets gained on Tuesday, with chipmakers and companies exposed to Asia among the best performers, after Washington temporarily eased trade restrictions imposed last week on China's Huawei.
In Europe, the broader Euro STOXX 600 climbed 0.6%, extending gains earlier in the trading session, with Germany's DAX rising 1.1%, while France's CAC 40 added 0.6%.
At the close, China's Shanghai Composite index was up 1.23%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index ended 1.35% higher.
U.S. President Donald Trump's government added Huawei to a trade blacklist last week, escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. 
But Washington then allowed Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to purchase U.S.-made goods to maintain existing networks and provide software updates to existing Huawei handsets until Aug. 19.
""The Huawei extension is in some sense providing a relief rally as it eases the worst fears of market participants that we are drifting towards a fully fledged trade war,"" said Aberdeen Standard's head of global strategy, Andrew Milligan.
Chipmakers AMS, STMicroelectronics and Germany's Infineon added between 2% and 6%, while the tech sector rose 1.6% after losing almost 3% on Monday.
In London, heavyweights HSBC,  Prudential  (LON:PRU) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) boosted the blue-chip index as markets rose on hopes of an easing in the trade tensions.
In Asia, gains in heavyweight Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) helped South Korea's KOSPI stock index close up 0.3%.
The MSCI index of world shares, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1% after losses in the two previous days.
""Equity markets remain hostage to developments in the ongoing U.S.-China trade battle,"" said Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood.
""We still believe some kind of deal will eventually be reached - most likely at a Xi/Trump meeting at the G20 Summit in late June.""
In Germany, Daimler gained 1.1%, getting an additional boost after German newspaper Handelsblatt reported the company was looking to cut administration costs by 20%. Daimler declined to comment.
Italy's biggest phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) led gainers on the STOXX 600, rising 1.9%, after posting first-quarter earnings in line with expectations and confirming its guidance for the next three years.
Markets now await Wednesday's release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's May 1 meeting, looking for signals on future interest rates after Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that it was premature to ascertain the impact of trade and tariffs on the trajectory of monetary policy.
U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 0.6%.
POUND SLIPS
In currency markets, the British pound fell below $1.27 for the first time since mid-January, hit by dollar strength and expectations that Prime Minister Theresa May will fail to persuade cabinet colleagues to back an amended version of her Brexit withdrawal deal. 
The pound slipped 0.2% to $1.2688 while against the euro it was down 0.14% to a new four-month low of 87.88 pence,.
The U.S. dollar rose to 2-1/2 week highs, supported by some safe haven inflows, while Australia's top policymaker Philip Lowe said on Tuesday the central bank would consider the case for lower interest rates at its June policy meeting, pushing the Aussie dollar lower by half a percent to $0.6873.
Government bond yields in much of the euro zone stabilized above recent multi-year lows as investors remained cautious about selling fixed income against a backdrop of trade tensions and economic growth concerns.

245,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Trump's Huawei ban raises hopes for Chinese chip suppliers,"By Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Washington's blacklisting of technology giant Huawei has taken a toll on U.S. semiconductor shares, but China-listed firms have rallied as investors bet they can gain from Beijing's stepped-up efforts to build a homegrown supply chain.
Share price gains of little-known firms such as Shenzhen Fastprint Circuit Tech and Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology could be fleeting, analysts say, but Huawei's troubles could accelerate a long-term campaign in China to replace imported technologies.
Since the White House added Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a trade blacklist last week, several global companies have suspended business with the world's largest telecoms equipment maker. Citic Securities called the U.S. ban on Huawei ""a warning bell"" for China's chip industry, highlighting the importance of establishing independent supplies in the chip industry chain.
Rapidly escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions have also raised the stakes for Shanghai's Nasdaq-style technology board, which will be launched as soon as next month. The board is largely seen as part of President Xi Jinping's efforts to counter U.S. curbs on Chinese technology advancements.
U.S. President Donald Trump put Huawei on the U.S. ""Entity List"" last Wednesday, effectively banning U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese firm, triggering sharp falls in U.S. suppliers including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc.
But China's semiconductor sector has gained nearly 5% so far this week, bolstered by a burst of patriotic buying. The sector has far outperformed the broad index, which is down 1.7%.
Despite the rally, analysts say China still lags behind in the core technologies required for a self-reliant domestic semiconductor industry, and the market reaction reflects short-term investor optimism toward a complicated, long-term problem.
""Logically, it makes sense to bet on domestic substitution, but we don't see any change in fundamentals yet,"" said Reagan Li, fund manager at Shanghai V-Invest Co Ltd.
The U.S. ban on Huawei has roiled the global supply chain, ""potentially creating opportunities for China to re-establish industry order, but what matters is whether the companies have the ability to capitalize on it"". 
But such investor optimism is badly needed for China's semiconductor industry, under threat from the U.S.-China trade and which needs support from capital markets for funding. 
""Companies like us have been relying on U.S. equipment and technologies,"" Song Weicong, chairman of Shanghai Betone Semiconductor, told a financial conference last week. 
""If Trump orders bans, we will be greatly affected. The current Sino-U.S. trade war indeed impacts China's hi-tech development."" 
Many of China-listed companies in the sector make relatively simple components. 
According to a report from Everbright Securities, Chaozhou Three Circle (Group) Co Ltd and Will Semiconductor Co Ltd Shanghai, two companies whose share prices jumped, produce technology that could only ""partially replace"" that of U.S. suppliers.
The report adds that U.S. companies that manufacture critical products and software would be ""basically hard to replace with Chinese-made"" components.
Many Chinese firms making these critical components are unlisted. Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd, and Innotron Memory, for example, are commonly considered as China's largest and most advanced makers of memory.

Shanghai's Technology Innovation board will go some way to helping companies tap China's massive capital markets to fund expensive research for proprietary technologies. More than 100 tech start-ups, including chipmakers and robotic companies, have applied to list on the board, aiming to raise over $14 billion.

246,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>",U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,"By Brenda Goh and Karen Freifeld
SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China's Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world's largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.
The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world's two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.
The two countries increased import tariffs on each other's goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.
On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.
Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.
Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.
""The U.S. government's actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,"" Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.
The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei's supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.
The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.
CURRENCY FIRMS
China's yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.
Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.
President Xi Jinping's Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.
China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.
""Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,"" Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump's claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.
GOOGLE SUSPENSION
Huawei is currently on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.
The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm's smartphones that run on Google's Android operating system.
Monday's temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.
""Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone's best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,"" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.
The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.
APPLE PRAISE 
Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei's prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years. 
China was nevertheless still ""far behind"" the United States in technology, he said.
Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be ""hard to replace"".
Nearly 16 percent of Huawei's spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), analysts said.
Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm's devices to family members. 
""Apple has a good business ecosystem ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.""

U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said.

247,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",China rare earth firms' stocks soar on trade war speculation,"By Luoyan Liu and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in rare earth-related companies in China soared on Tuesday, a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a rare earth firm in southern China, sparking speculation the sector could be the next front in the Sino-U.S. trade war.
Xi on Monday visit JL MAG Rare-Earth Co Ltd in Jiangxi province, state media reported.
China accounted for 80% of the rare earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in high technology consumer electronics and military equipment, imported by the U.S. from 2014 to 2017.
So far, China's rare earths exports have been spared from recent tariffs by the United States, which has decided not to impose import duties on those and some other critical minerals from China as part of the trade war. 
Beijing, however, has raised tariffs on imports of U.S. rare earth metal ores from 10 percent to 25 percent from June 1, making it less economical to process the material in China.
Analysts said that Xi's visit might indicate China is considering using rare earths as a weapon in the trade war, which provided support for the shares of the Chinese firms.
""No question it's saber rattling,"" said Ryan Castilloux, managing director of Adamas Intelligence, a consultancy that tracks the rare earths market. ""I think China would be reluctant to cut off supplies to anyone just yet, but the optics are designed to send a clear message – we know your vulnerabilities."" 
Shares in JL MAG Rare-Earth Co Ltd surged the maximum limit of 10% on Monday following Xi's visit, and rose another 10% on Tuesday.
Shares in Innuovo Technology Co Ltd, a rare-earth permanent magnetic materials and products maker, also soared 10% to their highest since October 2017. The firm's shares have gained 54.7% so far in May.
Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material, Chengdu Galaxy Magnets Co Ltd and Jiangmen Kanhoo Industry Co Ltd rose by as much as 9%.
In Hong Kong, China Rare Earth Holdings Ltd soared more than 80%.
Asked if China would consider limiting rare earth exports to retaliate against the United States, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday that Xi's visit was normal and there was no need for over-interpretation.
Limiting rare earth exports to the United States would have an impact as U.S. consumption relies on China, said brokerage Pacific Securities.
However, RBC Capital Markets warned a Chinese ban could backfire by prompting the start up of rare earths production from other countries, breaking China's hold on the market.
""Should China hike prices for the U.S. or shut it out completely, it would simply speed up that process, leading to rapid development of alternative supplies,"" it said. ""Brazil, Vietnam, Russia, India and Australia currently stand out as key beneficiaries by having the world’s largest reserves and production.""

250,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 06:32AM ET</span>",Some major Deutsche Bank investors want chairman to go early: sources,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - At least three major investors in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) want Chairman Paul Achleitner to step down early amid discontent with the bank's turnaround, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
Achleitner, whose term expires in 2022, is due to face investors at the bank's annual general meeting on Thursday. 
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment, both on behalf of the bank and Achleitner. 
The sources did not want to identify the three investors, and while they do not have the power to push through management change on their own, their calls are a sign of the pressures facing Germany's biggest bank after years of failed turnarounds.
In recent years, Deutsche Bank has been plagued by failed regulatory tests, ratings downgrades, big fines and management reshuffles. It posted its first profit in four years in 2018.
Achleitner's record of installing executives and overseeing the lender has been chequered, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low on Monday, and again on Tuesday. They are down 36% since investors gathered for last year's shareholder meeting. 
The bank was already facing a potential rocky ride at this year's gathering after two advisory groups to shareholders - Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis - urged them to issue a vote of no confidence in management.
One small but vocal investor last month added to the meeting's agenda a vote to oust Achleitner because the bank ""remains trapped in an unbroken downward spiral"".
In response, the supervisory board last month said it had full confidence in Achleitner. Last year, a similar effort to force out the chairman garnered just 9.05% of the vote.
Achleitner, an Austrian financier who previously sat on the board of German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) and headed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in Germany, became Deutsche's chairman in 2012.

Bloomberg reported earlier on Tuesday there was increasing investor discontent with Achleitner.

252,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Self-driving trucks begin mail delivery test for U.S. Postal Service,"By Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday started a two-week test transporting mail across three Southwestern states using self-driving trucks, a step forward in the effort to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology for hauling freight.
San Diego-based startup TuSimple said its self-driving trucks will begin hauling mail between USPS facilities in Phoenix and Dallas to see how the nascent technology might improve delivery times and costs. A safety driver will sit behind the wheel to intervene if necessary and an engineer will ride in the passenger seat. 
If successful, it would mark an achievement for the autonomous driving industry and a possible solution to the driver shortage and regulatory constraints faced by freight haulers across the country. 
The pilot program involves five round trips, each totaling more than 2,100 miles (3,380 km) or around 45 hours of driving. It is unclear whether self-driving mail delivery will continue after the two-week pilot.
""The work with TuSimple is our first initiative in autonomous long-haul transportation,"" USPS spokeswoman Kim Frum said. ""We are conducting research and testing as part of our efforts to operate a future class of vehicles which will incorporate new technology."" 
TuSimple and the USPS declined to disclose the cost of the program, but Frum said no tax dollars were used and the agency relies on revenue from sales of postage and other products. TuSimple has raised $178 million in private financing, including from chipmaker Nvidia Corp and Chinese online media company Sina Corp.
The trucks will travel on major interstates and pass through Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.
""This run is really in the sweet spot of how we believe autonomous trucks will be used,"" said TuSimple Chief Product Officer Chuck Price. ""These long runs are beyond the range of a single human driver, which means today if they do this run they have to figure out how to cover it with multiple drivers in the vehicle.""
The goal is to eliminate the need for a driver, freeing shippers and freight-haulers from the constraints of a worsening driver shortage. The American Trucking Associations estimates a shortage of as many as 174,500 drivers by 2024, due to an aging workforce and the difficulty of attracting younger drivers.
A new safety law requiring truck drivers to electronically log their miles has further constrained how quickly and efficiently fleets can move goods.
TuSimple's tie-up with the USPS marks an achievement for the fledgling self-driving truck industry, and follows Swedish company Einride's entry into freight delivery using driverless electric trucks on a public road, announced last week.
The developments contrast with retrenching efforts by robotaxi companies such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) unit Cruise, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and startup Drive.ai, which have stumbled in building self-driving cars that can anticipate and respond to humans and navigate urban areas, an expensive and technologically challenging feat.

Price said self-driving trucks have advantages over passenger cars, including the relative ease of operating on interstates compared with city centers, which reduces mapping requirements and safety challenges involving pedestrians and bicyclists.

254,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>","Nike, Adidas Call Tariffs ‘Catastrophic’ in Letter to Trump","(Bloomberg) --  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE)., Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) and other footwear companies urged President Donald Trump to reconsider his tariffs on shoes made in China, saying the policy would be “catastrophic for our consumers, our companies and the American economy as a whole.”
In all, 173 companies signed an open letter to the president, dated Monday and posted on the industry trade association’s website. “On behalf of our hundreds of millions of footwear consumers and hundreds of thousands of employees, we ask that you immediately stop this action to increase their tax burden,” the group said.
The protest came as U.S.-China trade tensions escalate and Trump threatens to impose tariffs as high as 25% on Chinese goods -- including all types of footwear, from sneakers to sandals. While the industry has shifted production away from China in recent years because of rising wages, shifting trade policies and a desire to make more goods at home in the U.S. and Europe, the Asian country remains a shoe giant.
Adidas, for example, sourced about 18% of its 409 million pairs last year from China -- putting it third behind Vietnam, which made 42% of them, and Indonesia at 28%. Most production sites are run by independent manufacturing partners.
The German company made 3% of its shoes in Europe and the Americas, where it has set up two new “speed factories” that use robots to churn out high-end shoes in a single day rather than rely on the weeks or months needed to shuttle components among different suppliers. Still, the vast majority of Adidas’s sneakers, apparel and sports equipment gets made in Asia -- and probably will for a long time to come.
Tariffs are an especially touchy subject within the footwear industry because shoe companies already pay some of the highest duties in the U.S., thanks to longstanding tariffs that in some cases surpass 30%. And this isn’t the first time the industry is feeling the impact of Trump’s trade policies. The recent pivot toward Vietnam production was in part in anticipation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have allowed duty-fee exporting to the U.S. Then Trump exited those negotiations.
The U.S. shoe industry’s trade association, the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, estimates that the tariffs would cost U.S. customers an additional $7 billion per year. The companies said in their letter that those costs would disproportionately affect working-class individuals. “Your proposal to add tariffs on all imports from China is asking the American consumer to foot the bill,” the letter said. “It is time to bring this trade war to an end.”
Mnuchin, Ross, Kudlow
The letter was also sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow. It followed last week’s list from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office of about $300 billion worth of products that could see higher import duties, including all types of footwear. Trump will discuss the tariffs with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.
Trump has repeatedly stated that China would pay the tariffs -- something his critics say is misleading or wrong. Earlier this month, Kudlow said that “both sides” will pay.
“As an industry that faces a $3 billion duty bill every year, we can assure you that any increase in the cost of importing shoes has a direct impact on the American footwear consumer,” according to the letter.
That sentiment has been echoed around the industry. “We don’t make enough to absorb that,” said Michael Jeppesen, president of global operations for Wolverine World Wide Inc., which also signed the letter. “The only way it can is to be passed onto the consumer.”
Puma, Skechers
Still, the companies in the letter vary in their reliance on China. Nike, for example, made 26% of its apparel and 26% of its footwear in China in fiscal 2018. German company Puma SE sourced 24% of its products from China, compared with 32% from Vietnam. And while Skechers U.S.A. Inc. makes around 65% of its goods in China, not all of those products are imported to the U.S.
 Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA)., which also signed the letter, currently gets about 18% of its products from China -- down from 46% in 2013. The company’s goal is to lower that number to just 7% by 2023.

255,By Investing.com,"<span>May 21, 2019 04:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat - The Safe Haven That Is...Russia,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- As global growth slows and the world economy teeters on the verge of a new trade-led Cold War, it’s only natural for investors to think about safe havens. They may be surprised to find that the safest haven in European stock markets this year has been…Russia.
The RTS index is up 17.8% for the year-to-date, the best-performing major index in Europe, ahead of the German DAX with 14.7% and the Swiss SMI with 14.0% (the RTS is dollar-denominated index, so it’s not as if those gains have been achieved by ruble devalation). Even more surprising is that it's also the best perfomer on a three-year view, having risen 41% (the Euro Stoxx 600 is up 12% over the same period).
The RTS even managed to stay in the green on Monday, a day when stocks from Shanghai to Wall Street all tumbled more or less in sync at the prospect of the world’s two largest economies descending into an all-out trade war.
As a result, it's underperforming Tuesday - as havens often do on up-days - rising only 0.2% by mid-morning in Europe, compared to a 0.3% rise for the Euro Soxx 600 and a 0.5% rise for the FTSE. Germany's Dax was up 0.6%.
There is a simple explanation for this, and – unfortunately for investors – it’s one that suggests that outperformance may be hard to sustain. Russia’s stock market, like its economy in general, is driven by the oil price, despite endless promises over 19 years by President Vladimir Putin to diversify the economy. Past experience suggests that it will struggle to stay elevated if a trade war slows the global economy and crushes demand for oil.
Oil and gas groups, such as Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), Rosneft (MCX:ROSN) and Lukoil (MCX:LKOH), dominate the index, and as long as they can avoid egregious acts of value destruction (such as throttling Ukraine’s gas supplies to make a political point, or buying favored oligarchs out of companies such as TNK-BP) , they can hardly help but make money. Lukoil, the best run of the three, raised net profit 48% last year to over $9 billion.
As long as high oil prices support the ruble, that also raises the value of companies whose income streams are in rubles – most notably Sberbank (MCX:SBER), Europe’s largest bank, and internet company  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX).
Oil prices are riding high at the moment because Russia is – notionally – keeping production off the market in coordination with Saudi Arabia and OPEC to keep the market balanced. The risk of conflict between the U.S. and Iran is also helping.
However, Russia is visibly less committed to the deal than Saudi Arabia – its Energy Minister Alexander Novak distanced himself at the weekend from the Saudi position that there was a consensus in favor of extending the deal when it expires in June. Igor Sechin, the Rosneft CEO widely seen as the most powerful man in Russia after President Vladimir Putin, has argued that the whole strategy plays into U.S. hands by giving it a bigger share of the global oil market.
Those who have stuck with Russian stocks throughout the lean years since the annexation of Crimea have earned this moment in the sun. Extending it will still require a supreme balancing act from those who control the country's oil and gas taps."

LONDON (Reuters) - British Steel, the country's second largest steel producer, is on the brink of collapse unless the government agrees to provide an emergency 30 million pound ($38 million) loan by later on Tuesday, a source close to the situation said.
The steelmaker, owned by investment firm Greybull Capital, employs around 5,000 people, mostly in Scunthorpe, in the north of England, while 20,000 more depend on in its supply chain.
Greybull, which specializes in turning around distressed businesses, paid former owners Tata Steel a nominal one pound in 2016 for the loss-making company which they renamed British Steel.
British Steel had asked the British government for a 75 million pound loan but has since reduced its demand to 30 million pounds after Greybull agreed to put up more money, according to the source close to the negotiations.
If the loan is not approved by Tuesday afternoon, administrators EY could be appointed for British Steel as early as Wednesday, the source said.
""The UK steel industry is critical to our manufacturing base and is strategically important to UK industry. The government must intervene,"" said Gill Furniss, Labour's spokeswoman for steel.
""Administration would be devastating for the thousands of workers and their families who rely on this key industry in a part of the country which has not had enough support and investment from government over decades,"" Labour said.
If British Steel goes under it would mark the demise of one of the key parts of what was once a national champion of the British economy.
Unions demanded the government give the loan.
""They must now put their money where their mouth is,"" said Ross Murdoch, national officer for the GMB union for steelworkers.
""GMB calls on the Government and Greybull to redouble efforts to save this proud steelworks and the highly skilled jobs,"" Murdoch said.
A spokeswoman for Britain's business ministry declined to comment on the details of British Steel but said: ""We are in regular conversation with a wide range of companies.""
British Steel secured a government loan of around 120 million pounds ($154 million) in May to enable it to comply with the European Union's Emissions Trading System (ETS) rules.

The airline's move was first reported by domestic media, including the state-run People's Daily newspaper. The reports did not say what amount of compensation the airline is seeking. 
""The grounding of 737 MAX aircraft since March 11, 2019 has caused relatively big losses to China Eastern. With the passing of time, related losses will further expand,"" the paper cited the company as saying.
""At the same time, delayed deliveries of planes ordered by China Eastern also caused economic losses.""
An airline spokesman confirmed its comments in the People's Daily report to Reuters. 
China Eastern has 14 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, including those from subsidiary Shanghai Airlines. The aircraft have been mothballed according to aircraft maintenance standards, the People's Daily said. 
The company had not communicated with other carriers regarding compensation, it added.
A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment on China Eastern's move, saying it did not discuss conversations with its customers. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is hosting a meeting of global regulators in Dallas on Thursday to review software and training proposals from Boeing before deciding whether, and when, to end the two-month grounding.

China and the European Union each have their own aerospace industries and are likely to fix their own conditions for allowing 737 MAX flights to resume, analysts say.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.4% by 0745 GMT, with the trade-sensitive DAX outperforming after the U.S. Commerce Department said it would allow Huawei Technologies to purchase American-made goods.
The news came as a major relief to markets and lifted European chipmakers, which had tumbled after reports suggested they may pause shipments to the Chinese telecoms tech giant. The tech sector rose over 1% after losing almost 3% on Monday. 
Auto stocks were around 0.4 percent higher, with Daimler giving an additional boost after German newspaper Handelsblatt reported the company was looking to cut administration costs by 20%. 
The banking index, which closed at a more-than three-month low in the previous session, climbed 0.7% 
As earnings season nears its end, fewer companies are reporting. Italy's biggest phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) led gainers on the STOXX 600 after posting first-quarter earnings in-line with expectations and confirming its guidance for the next three years. 
Swiss hearing aid maker Sonova reported an increase in full-year sales, sending its shares up 4%.
Norsk Hydro rose 5.4% after Brazil gave the go ahead for the company's Alunorte alumina plant to reopen.
Struggling Spanish retailer DIA jumped 5% after reaching an eleventh-hour agreement to secure financing, staving off the imminent risk of having to start insolvency proceedings.
Defensive stocks - including real estate, utilities and telecoms - underperformed. 
But investors remained cautious as the sudden about-turn in China-U.S. talks over the last two weeks shattered confidence in a speedy truce to the trade war that has roiled financial markets for a year.
European equities have outperformed Wall Street since the tariff war re-intensified on May 9, with the STOXX 600 rising 0.4% but the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index losing almost 1% during the same period.

259,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>","China calls out big state firms, others on pollution violations amid slowing economy fears","SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has publicly accused dozens of firms, including some of its biggest state enterprises, of exceeding pollution limits and breaching monitoring standards, as concerns rise that the slowing economy is undermining a five-year war on pollution. 
In lists published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment over the past week, subsidiaries of state giants such as China Baowu Steel Group and the Aluminum Corporation of China were cited and fined for breaching emissions standards among other violations. 
China has been stepping up its supervision capabilities and has plugged thousands of factories into a real-time emissions monitoring system, but enforcement remains one of its biggest challenges.
The ministry has continued to warn that China's slowing economy had given some regions an excuse to ""loosen their grip"" on environmental protection. 
In the first quarter of this year, air quality in smog-prone northern regions fell compared to last year, and some regions also saw pollution readings in major lakes and rivers rise over the period. 
A notice published last Friday said as many as 82 Chinese enterprises exceeded wastewater emissions standards in the fourth quarter of 2018, including 44 sewage treatment plants and six wastewater treatment facilities. A unit of the Aluminum Corporation of China in Shanxi province was named as one of five ""serious offenders"".
It said the unit had exceeded emissions restrictions for a total of 92 days during the period. The firm did not respond to requests for comment. 
As well as being fined, the companies cited were told to restrict operations until problems were resolved. The biggest fine was meted out to a wastewater treatment plant in Liaoning province, which was ordered to pay 7.2 million yuan ($1.04 million). 
In a separate review of monitoring standards in the Yangtze river delta and the Fenwei plain regions, the ministry identified more than 300 firms for equipment quality violations and exceeding wastewater discharge restrictions. It found only 22 percent of equipment was of the required standard. 
The list included a special steel producing unit of Baosteel, China's biggest steelmaker. Baosteel did not respond to a request to comment.

260,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 03:58AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India watchdog probes allegations of anti-competitive conduct by Maruti - sources,"By Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust regulator is looking into allegations that Maruti Suzuki, the country's biggest car maker, resorted to anti-competitive practices by controlling how its dealers discounted cars, three people aware of the matter said.
Maruti, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, is a household name in India where it commands a 51 percent market share. It sold 1.73 million passenger vehicles in the year to March and has nearly 3,000 dealers in the country.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is looking into allegations that Maruti forces its dealers to limit the discounts they offer, effectively stifling competition among them and harming consumers who could have benefited from lower prices if dealers operated freely, the people told Reuters.
It was not clear over which period Maruti allegedly engaged in this conduct, but one of the people with direct knowledge of the case said the CCI has been reviewing the allegations for about 10 months. A final decision on whether there needs to be a full investigation has not been reached, the person added.
The sources declined to be identified as details of the case were not public. Maruti Suzuki and the CCI did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Automakers typically sell cars at wholesale prices to dealers, who sell them to customers at a higher retail price that includes their commissions. It is up to the dealer to offer discounts and take a lower profit margin, which they often do.
Car makers at times set a limit on discounts its dealers could offer to ensure there is no price war among them, two of the sources said, but Indian law says the practice, described as ""resale price maintenance"", is prohibited if it causes ""appreciable adverse effect on competition in India"".
SIMILAR TO HYUNDAI CASE
In 2017, South Korean firm Hyundai Motor Co's India unit was fined $12.5 million by CCI for antitrust violations including resale price maintenance. 
The CCI found Hyundai fixed the maximum amount of discount for its cars and restricted competition among dealers.
Hyundai was also penalizing dealers who breached the set discount controls, the CCI said at the time.
""The Maruti case is similar to Hyundai, it's a resale price maintenance issue,"" the person with knowledge of the case said. 
An appeals court overturned the fine on Hyundai last year, citing lack of evidence, but the CCI has challenged the ruling at India's Supreme Court. The case is still pending.
Karan Singh Chandhiok, a lawyer who represented Hyundai in the case, said the company had argued at the time that it was a smaller player with about a 14% market share and its alleged conduct could not hurt the broader passenger car market.
If the CCI finds merit in allegations against Maruti and launches a full probe, the case could be far stronger than the one against Hyundai as Maruti accounts for more than half of India's car market, an antitrust official told Reuters.
Car makers like Hyundai, Tata Motors and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp all sell cars in India, but Maruti has for decades been the dominant player. One of every two cars sold in India is a Maruti - the company which popularized small cars in the country with its Maruti 800 model.
""Maruti has the market power, if such a big player restricts discounts of dealers, customers are left with fewer options,"" said the antitrust official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.

261,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 03:55AM ET</span>",Japan auto lobby dismayed Trump declares some imports security threat,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's automakers' lobby said on Tuesday it was dismayed by President Donald Trump's declaration that some imported vehicles and parts posed a threat to U.S. national security, as the industry braces for a possible rise in U.S. tariffs. 
Trump made the unprecedented designation of foreign vehicles on Friday but delayed for up to six months a decision on whether to impose tariffs to allow for more time for trade talks with Japan and the European Union.
""We are dismayed to hear a message suggesting that our long-time contributions of investment and employment in the United States are not welcomed,"" said Akio Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.
""As chairman, I am deeply saddened by this decision,"" Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp, said in a statement.
Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars made by foreign automakers, a move which automakers have argued would ramp up car prices, curb the global competitiveness of U.S.-made vehicles and limit investment in the country, the world's No. 2 auto market.
The United States is a vital market for Toyota, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and other Japanese car makers. Autos and components are among the Asian country's biggest export products. 
Most of Japan's major automakers operate plants in the United States. At least half of the cars and trucks sold in the country by Japan's top three carmakers are made in the United States.
Major automakers have announced a slew of investments in the United States since Trump took office in January 2017 and put pressure on the industry to create more U.S. jobs. 
For its part, Toyota has pledged to invest almost $13 billion in the United States between 2017 and 2021 to boost manufacturing capacity and jobs.

This includes $1.6 billion for a vehicle assembly plant in Alabama jointly run with Mazda Motor Corp.

264,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 02:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: A delicate balance - Toyota took care to make offering to U.S. before China deals,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp last month announced two deals in China that were small in size but large in strategic planning.
The automaker said it would establish a green-tech research institute with Tsinghua University and provide state-owned BAIC Group's Foton unit with fuel-cell technology for buses. But before it could feel comfortable unveiling those plans, Toyota put in months of work to pledge fresh investment - in the United States.
The technology transfers represent gestures of goodwill to Beijing by the Japanese automaker, which wants to ""step on the accelerator in China"" as CEO Akio Toyoda told an internal management group, according to minutes of meetings on March 19 and April 23 viewed by Reuters.
Announcing U.S. investment first was a strategy Toyoda felt the company needed to pursue to avoid U.S. President Donald Trump's wrath, the minutes showed - providing a rare window into how it has sought to tread carefully as the United States and China battle for investment, jobs and influence in the global economy.
""For Toyota to operate globally, we need to strike a fine balance between China and the United States,"" the March 19 minutes quoted Toyoda as saying. ""It's imperative to avoid making enemies.""
According to the April 23 minutes, the Japanese automaker is making what one unnamed senior executive described as a ""significant move to steer its focus to China"" — a market where it is far behind industry leaders Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Toyota declined to comment on its internal meetings.
Its pivot to China - one that many other global automakers are also making - has been made easier by a thaw in ties between China and Japan but complicated by Trump's trade policies.
That includes the trade war between Washington and Beijing as well as threats from Trump to impose tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars made by foreign automakers. On Friday, Trump declared that some imported vehicles and parts pose a national security threat, although he delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs.
In response, Toyota issued one of its strongest messages on potential tariffs to date, calling the designation ""a major set-back for American consumers, workers and the auto industry"" and saying it sent the message ""our investments are not welcomed.""

Toyota has been at pains to show its commitment to the United States, and in the March 19 minutes Toyoda explained a fresh investment of $749 million in U.S. manufacturing capacity and jobs as ""an essential"" step before it could speed up efforts to expand in China.
Announcing the new investment on March 14, Toyota stressed the sum helped bump up a five-year investment pledge made in 2017 to almost $13 billion from $10 billion. The day following the announcement, Toyoda also spoke before the Economic Club of Washington, declaring: ""I love America"". 
""I just don't understand why we are called a national security threat and it pains my heart,"" Toyoda said in answer to a question after his speech. ""One thing I would promise, no matter what direction the discussion takes us is that Toyota will not leave America.""
Though many other automakers, including U.S. automakers, have announced investments in the United States since Trump came to power in 2017, the near $13 billion pledged by Toyota is the biggest amount by far.
Toyota would have pressed ahead with fresh U.S. investment even without its China plans, but there was much internal planning around how the announcements should be timed, company sources with knowledge of the matter said. The sources, who were not authorized to speak to media, declined to be identified.
In a further sign of Toyota's careful approach to relations with Washington, board member Ikuro Sugawara was dispatched in April to meet with U.S. Ambassador William Hagerty at the U.S. embassy in Tokyo to give him the heads up that the two China deals would be announced.
""I didn't think we needed to do that but the Ambassador commended our effort more than I had expected,"" the April 23 minutes quoted Sugawara, a former vice minister for trade, as saying.
The U.S. embassy in Tokyo declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting, saying only it was in regular contact with Toyota and many other Japanese firms about their plans to continue investing in the United States.
QUIET PIVOT TO CHINA 
For many automakers, the U.S. auto market is a key profit center that generates industry-wide sales of about 17 million vehicles annually. But China has rapidly grown in importance - with 28 million vehicles sold in 2018 - and is drawing new investment from global automakers eager to keep up with its heavy promotion of electric cars.
Toyota commands 14% of the U.S. market, but in China it had just 5.3% share last year and the 1.49 million vehicles it sold were less than half the volume sold by VW and GM.
It is aiming to lift sales 10% every year over the next five or six years - roughly equivalent to 3 million cars annually by the mid-2020s, according to a source at a Toyota parts supplier, who declined to be identified as he did not work for the automaker. 
Asked about Toyota's China ambitions, a company spokesman said China was an important market and the automaker was looking at strengthening its base there so that it could propel the business forward.
China has sometimes been a difficult market for Japanese companies due to historical reasons, with sales in 2012 taking a battering in the wake of diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.
But company sources say Toyota's pivot has gained steam on the back of an official visit to Japan in May last year by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, during which Toyoda accompanied Li on a tour of Toyota's facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido. 
Since then, Toyota has embarked on an expansion of its manufacturing muscle in China, with plans to add annual production capacity of 120,000 vehicles each at its Tianjin plant and at its Guangzhou plant. 
It is also expanding distribution networks and is sharing technology to promote goodwill among Chinese leaders, Toyota sources have said.
""We have full backing of the Chinese government, but we shouldn't take it for granted and must continue to make efforts consistently,"" the April 23 minutes quoted Toyoda as saying. 
In contrast to the automaker's efforts in the United States, Toyota is content to keep a relatively low profile with regards to its plans in China. Neither the Tianjin nor the Guangzhou plans were formally announced by Toyota. Investment amounts have also not been disclosed.
Last month a news conference for international media at the Shanghai auto show was canceled - a move that one company source said was the result of a warning by Toyoda to be circumspect when dealing with the media on the topics of tariff hikes or U.S. import quotas.

265,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 12:56AM ET</span>",Global chemical firms urged to source responsibly after lethal China blast: study,"By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A prominent Chinese environmental group has called on chemicals multinationals to stop ""cutting corners"" by outsourcing business to Chinese suppliers that violate safety regulations after an investigation into a deadly explosion at a factory in March.
In a new study, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) said it had identified global chemical producers among indirect buyers of products made at the Jiangsu Tianjiayi chemical plant, at Yancheng on China's eastern coast. The IPE is a non-governmental organization which has a close relationship with China's environment ministry.
The factory was shut for good after the March 21 blast. China's cabinet has set up a special team to investigate the incident and at least 26 people have already been detained. 
IPE's investigation named German conglomerate Merck among indirect buyers of Tianjiayi products, while Swiss chemicals firm Lonza previously confirmed Tianjiayi was one of its major suppliers.
Asked to comment on the IPE report, Merck called Tianjiayi a ""tier two supplier"" and said it was still assessing the situation. 
China's massive chemical sector plays a vital role in the supply of basic products widely used across the world, many of which are hazardous. Tianjiayi was a major manufacturer of products like 1,3-dinitrobenzene, used to make explosives, and M-phenylenediamine, a key polymer component.
But IPE said international firms had created a ""powerful engine for continued irresponsible operations around the country"" and they must ensure they buy only from factories that meet safety standards. 
Officials told Reuters that oversight failures were partly caused by the inability of regulators to keep up with the chemical sector's rapid growth, with demand soaring at home and overseas.
'LOOPHOLE'
Ma Jun, IPE's director, said China's economic slowdown had encouraged local authorities to allow non-compliant firms like Tianjiayi to resume operations, but improving enforcement wasn't the only issue. Data and information exist to allow multinational firms to make informed decisions about suppliers rather than focusing only on costs.
""We all recognize the real problem is not about someone being immoral, and more a dynamic that basically rewards those who cut corners,"" Ma told Reuters.
""Those who have gained the most from globalized outsourcing practices are basically taking advantage of a loophole instead of joining efforts to solve the problem,"" he added. 
The Ministry of Ecology and Environment did not respond immediately to a faxed request for comment on the IPE report. 
Also named in the IPE report as buyers of Tianjiayi goods were U.S. chemical conglomerate DuPont (NYSE:DWDP), Switzerland's Clariant and Germany's BASF.
The report said BASF and Clariant sourced Tianjiayi chemicals via China's Hifi Chemical Co., which has confirmed it was one of Tianjiayi's major customers. A Hifi sales official told Reuters that BASF and Clariant were among its clients. 
Clariant said it was still investigating but Tianjiayi was not a ""direct supplier"". BASF said, ""After an initial internal audit, we did not find Tianjiayi Chemical as the supplier to BASF in China.""
DuPont didn't immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, but IPE wrote in its report that it had been told by DuPont that the firm had ""no business relationship"" with Tianjiayi.
After the March accident, the Chenjiagang industrial park where Tianjiayi was located was found to be rife with violations and shut down. Jiangsu is now planning a wider crackdown to eliminate hundreds of small-scale chemical producers.
""Among the 400 chemical factories in this chemical industrial park and two others in adjacent regions, more than 300 had records of violations in our database,"" said Ma. IPE tracks corporate environmental violations nationwide in a database followed closely by the environment ministry. 
""If the brands continue only wanting to buy from the cheapest, then they become part of the problem,"" he added.

266,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 12:45AM ET</span>",HSBC plans more China tech jobs in push for market share,"By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC plans to add more than a 1,000 jobs this year at its technology development centers in China, as the Asia-focused lender seeks to bolster its presence in the world's second largest economy.
Europe's biggest bank by assets will boost headcount at its technology centers in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xi'an by 14% from a current 7,000-strong workforce, said HSBC Chief Information Officer Darryl West.
In recent years the London-based bank has spent $3 billion annually on its group technology operations which employ 40,000 people worldwide, and West said annual investments of $3-$3.5 billion are planned over the next few years.
Many global banks set up low-cost hubs in China and India more than a decade ago to maintain their complex worldwide information technology networks, but these centers have now become a core part of their operations. 
The centers develop and implement risk and fraud management technologies, as well as digital applications that make it easier for banks to attract customers and deliver faster and more secure services. 
HSBC's expansion plan in China, a key market for the bank, comes amid growing use of technology in the financial sector - from payments to transactions.
At stake is a bigger share of the billions of dollars worth of retail and corporate banking business in a major financial market with a growing customer base.
""There is a lot more we can do with technology in mainland China. The level of technology adoption and innovation in China is way ahead of other markets,"" West told reporters during a tour of HSBC's technology center in the southern city of Guangzhou last week. 
""We see mainland China as a tremendous source of talent, not just for the local market but our technology operations globally. We are hiring very aggressively here,"" he added.
RETAIL BANKING
About 30% of the work done at the Guangzhou center, the largest HSBC tech facility in China with more than 5,000 employees, is for the mainland market and that share is expected to grow over the next couple of years.
HSBC is also using China-based tech centers to develop banking products for its global network, such as the bank's U.K. mobile app which was developed in the northwestern city of Xi'an. 
Outside China, HSBC employs more than 10,000 people at technology centers in India, with the rest in countries such as Britain, Canada, Hong Kong and the United States.
HSBC has in recent years lifted investment in China, including the prosperous southern Pearl River Delta region. Mainland China and Hong Kong together accounted for nearly 40% of the bank's revenue in 2018. 
The bank will invest $15-$17 billion in the next three years in areas including technology and China, its Chief Executive John Flint said last year.
The limited physical presence of foreign banks in China compared to dominant domestic rivals has been a challenge.
HSBC's losses in retail banking and wealth management (RBWM) in mainland China widened to $200 million last year from $44 million in 2017. The bank aimed to reverse that with its investments in technology.

""Things like that, we see as very important for the next phase of our business growth ... once the major investments have gone in, RBWM will grow bigger and also profitable,"" said HSBC Greater China Chief Executive Helen Wong.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. summer air travel will hit a new record this year despite the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft after two fatal crashes, a group representing major airlines said on Tuesday.
Airlines for America, the trade group representing major U.S. carriers, said it expects 257.4 million passengers to travel on U.S. airlines between June 1 and Aug. 31, up 3.4 percent from last summer’s record 248.8 million passengers.
Airlines are adding 111,000 seats daily to accommodate the extra 93,000 passengers expected per day, the group said, in what it forecast will be the 10th consecutive summer of increases in the number of U.S. airline passengers.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines Group Inc have canceled flights because of the grounding of the 737 MAX into August, while United Airlines has canceled flights into early July. 
Southwest has canceled 160 daily flights through Aug. 5. It launched service to Hawaii earlier this year but has had to defer flying there from San Diego and Sacramento because of the MAX groundings.
American has canceled nearly 115 flights daily until Aug. 19, accounting for 2 percent of its summer flight capacity.
The U.S. Transportation Department said that July 2018 was the all-time busiest air travel month, with 75.8 million passengers.

The Federal Aviation Administration is meeting with aviation regulators from around the world in Texas on Thursday to update them on the various reviews of the 737 MAX. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has not yet formally submitted its software upgrade and training revisions to the FAA for approval or completed a certification flight.

269,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 09:33PM ET</span>","In inland Chinese province, property bubble haunts dreams of prosperity","By Yawen Chen, Stella Qiu and Philip Wen
ZHENGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Song Jingyi, a paralegal from a family of modest means in the central Chinese region of Henan, had long dreamed of buying a home of her own in Zhengzhou, the sprawling provincial capital of 10 million where she attended college.
But high prices, and hefty downpayment requirements, meant that dream stayed tantalizingly out of reach.
Zhengzhou's property market exploded in 2016, spurred on by Chinese government efforts to boost home ownership and consumer spending in interior provinces like Henan. 
While the resulting price surges were a new source of wealth for many in the city, they also excluded people like Song, who is 25 and has plans to marry her long-term boyfriend.
Last November, however, Song was presented with a tempting opportunity: a deal offered by a Chinese developer to circumvent the usual 30% downpayment on an apartment by borrowing the up-front payment itself.
The offer was a risky one for a developer - and a warning sign that the market in Zhengzhou was hitting a wall, caught up in China's slowest economic expansion in nearly three decades.
After two years of breakneck growth, property markets in provincial cities like Zhengzhou finally reached a turning point in late 2018. That has presented a policy challenge for the Chinese government, which has been attempting to spread wealth beyond the country's rich coastal regions to the interior.
It also illustrates how policymakers have struggled to grapple with a property market, the world's largest, that is crucial for growth yet prone to bubbles springing up in unlikely places - including the cities of Henan province.
Despite the warning signs, Song saw the mortgage offer as a golden opportunity to finally get into the Zhengzhou market. 
She paid one-third of the usual down payment as deposit on a two-bedroom flat on Zhengzhou's outskirts, where seemingly endless rows of blocks have proliferated in recent years.
However, Song soon noticed that prices were dropping at some developments - including one where a friend had bought a home.
She had longed for a taste of the middle class lifestyle her friends were flaunting with their apartments packed with consumer goods. But she also didn't want to buy into a bubble that looked set to pop. 
She decided to pull out, ultimately filing a lawsuit to get her deposit back.
""I felt that everyone around me had a house and I felt so much pressure from my peers,"" Song said. ""In many ways, that was an illusion of false prosperity.""
BACKWATER NO LONGER
Long a quiet provincial capital, Zhengzhou has thrived in recent years thanks to its position as a transport and logistics hub. Taiwan's Foxconn operates a factory in the city employing 230,000 people making Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones for the world. 
And, for two years, the property market boomed.
The skyline is packed with soaring office towers in a newly constructed business district. Flashy malls selling luxury goods jostle for space in the crowded city center. And freshly minted residential blocks stretch far into the suburbs.
Zhengzhou's property market took off when the Chinese government eased borrowing and credit restrictions in 2015 and 2016, setting off a nationwide home-buying frenzy.
Attracted by cheaper prices in interior provinces like Henan, buyers from across the country piled into Zhengzhou, many paying in full, in cash, to secure flats that often sold out within minutes. 
In September 2016, at a new Evergrande apartment complex, a couple in their 40s told Reuters, wiping away tears of disappointment, that they drove from a nearby city only to be told that everything had been sold.
And prices kept soaring.
In the upscale Beilonghu district, overlooking an artificial lake on Zhengzhou's northern fringe, rows of opulent villas decorated with the sweeping roofs of traditional imperial residences went for tens of millions of yuan, rivaling prices in Sydney on a per square foot basis.
But in September last year, the Zhengzhou property market deteriorated rapidly, according to sales agents. Unsold property inventory in Zhengzhou rose 26.5% last year, compared to a 26.9% decline in 2016 at the peak of the boom.
Nationally, property sales by floor area grew 1.3% in 2018 from a year earlier, down from an increase of 7.7% a year earlier. In Henan, the growth slowdown was more dramatic: down to 5.1% last year, from 17.8% in 2017. Henan's real estate investment fell for the first time in 2018. 
(Graphic: Henan's property bubble fear - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WIGSZJ)
While the slowing Chinese economy is a key factor in the slump, it is also the result of government efforts to curb rampant property speculation and clean up a chaotic and risky financial system - even as it tried to spur spending and home ownership in places like Henan.
China's housing ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
RIPPLE EFFECTS
The effects of the slowdown in Zhengzhou have been felt by people like Zhang Chenxuan, who has run an interior design business in the city for seven years. Since last year, his income has shrunk by 20-30% as orders from new home buyers fell, he said.
""Clients nowadays only want something practical and simple that saves money instead of going for the luxurious,"" Zhang said as he fitted out a client's new apartment with contemporary furniture and gray ceramic tiles.
""Eighty percent of my customers now complain that they are very poor, that they don't have the money for proper furnishings,"" he said.
Zhengzhou's government has eased some purchase restrictions and scrapped price caps for new developments to encourage developers to release inventory, local agents said. But so far, those measures, and similar ones in other cities, have done little to revive the market. 
The property slowdown has also been deeply felt in Xuchang, a city of about 4 million people south of Zhengzhou that is the world's wig-making capital. 
Like Zhengzhou, the city had been the scene of frantic property development and buying in recent years. To lure builders and buyers, the local government moved wig-making businesses to the city's fringes, spent tens of billions of yuan demolishing shantytown homes, and built a series of lakes and parks, including a gigantic ""Central Park"" modeled on the one in Manhattan. 
Those efforts attracted developers like Evergrande and Country Garden, who built vast complexes overlooking the park.
But the frenzy faded. Property consultancy Tonglitongcheng said in February that the city's housing stock had grown at such ""a horrifying rate"" that unsold inventory - totaling 9.7 million square meters by its estimates - would take about 55 months to clear.
Xu Boyun, 27, said his family, which owns three properties in Xuchang, was passing on buying a unit in another new development, despite the 20% discount offered to staff at the state-owned company where his parents work.
""It was a really good price but the market has cooled significantly and I've advised them there is not much room for another price spike,"" he said.
In some developments, prices have been slashed, infuriating those who bought in at higher prices.
In November, angry home owners stormed a Yango Group sales office after the company cut prices by 15% in one development, smashing scale models of the project, sales agents told Reuters.
While Yango hasn't cut prices further, it is now branding its apartments as ""cost effective"", and touting the market slump as a ""rare opportunity"" to buy.
It's unclear whether that will be enough to attract buyers to developments in provincial cities like Xuchang.
For Song, the paralegal, safer bets closer to cities like Beijing are a more attractive option for now.
In March, she said her boyfriend made a downpayment - a complete one - on a flat in Zhangjiakou, a ski resort near Beijing that will host some events for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.
Speculators were eyeing the town, she said, but prices were still just a sixth of the average in Beijing.

""Even if prices fall, how much lower do you think they can go?""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc has filed a lawsuit against two unions representing its mechanics, asking the court to halt what it called an illegal slowdown that it said on Monday threatened to disrupt U.S. summer travel. 
The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas federal court, accuses the mechanics unions of directing a slowdown aimed at disrupting operations to improve their position in labor talks, which began in 2015.
The unions did not immediately return a request for comment.
American, the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, said the mechanics' action had intensified in recent weeks after causing 650 flight cancellations and more than 1,500 maintenance delays since February.
""American estimates that, for each day that the slowdown continues into the summer, it will disrupt the travel plans of approximately 3,400 additional passengers per day,"" the airline said in the filing. 
American cut its 2019 profit forecast in April, blaming an estimated $350 million hit from the worldwide grounding in March of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes, forcing thousands of separate flight cancellations during its busiest travel season.
A prolonged MAX grounding coupled with mechanic-related disruption could further hurt profit, analysts said.
Shares of American closed 2.5 percent lower at $30.96 on Monday after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) warned of higher labor costs and downgraded the stock to ""equal-weight.""
American is also in contract talks with unions representing its flight attendants and pilots, whose contracts become amendable in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The airline said it has offered its mechanics unions Transport Workers Union of America and the International Association of Machinists an industry-leading proposal in all key respects, including pay and benefits.
The unions have complained that American is trying to outsource more maintenance jobs, a move American has indicated is necessary to cover increased wages.
Fort Worth, Texas-based American last year asked the National Mediation Board to help negotiate an agreement with the mechanics unions, but it said discussions were paused after the last session on April 25. Since then, it said union action had caused 14 flight cancellations per day, versus an average eight daily union-related cancellations previously. 

Low-cost rival Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co recently reached an agreement in principle with its mechanics union after the Federal Aviation Administration warned that their prolonged contract dispute could pose safety concerns.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG banker pleaded guilty on Monday to a U.S. charge that she helped launder money from a kickback scheme involving $2 billion in loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique.
Detelina Subeva, 37, pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering conspiracy before U.S. District Judge William Kuntz in Brooklyn, New York. Subeva is one of three Credit Suisse bankers charged by U.S. prosecutors in January with taking part in the scheme.
Credit Suisse has said that the defendants hid their contact from the bank.
Subeva, a Bulgarian citizen, said that in 2013 her boss, Andrew Pearse, told her he had received a $1 million kickback in connection with a $372 million loan to a Mozambican state-owned company. She said the kickback came from Privinvest, an Abu Dhabi-based company that contracted with Mozambican state-owned companies.
Subeva said Pearse transferred about $200,000 of the kickback to a her bank account.
""I agreed to accept and keep these monies knowing that they were the proceeds of illegal activity,"" Subeva said.
Subeva, who came to New York from London to face the charges voluntarily, was released on bail. There was no mention at the hearing of an agreement by Subeva to cooperate with prosecutors.
Subeva's lawyer declined to comment.
Pearse, who was head of Credit Suisse's Global Financing Group, is also charged in the case, along with another former Credit Suisse banker, Surjan Singh.
Both are fighting extradition to the United States from the United Kingdom. Their lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.
Seven people have been charged in the case, including former Privinvest head salesman Jean Boustani, who is in U.S. custody, and former Mozambique Finance Minister Manuel Chang, who is fighting extradition from South Africa.
Prosecutors say that between 2013 and 2016, Mozambican state-owned companies borrowed more than $2 billion through loans guaranteed by the government and arranged by Credit Suisse and another investment bank, which was not named.
Apart from Credit Suisse, the Russian lender VTB also arranged financing for Mozambique's state-owned companies.
Mozambique - one of the most indebted countries in the world - admitted in 2016 that it had guaranteed loans it had not disclosed. The revelation prompted foreign donors to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and a default on its sovereign debt.
U.S. prosecutors said at least $200 million was diverted to the defendants and other Mozambican government officials.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge said Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (NASDAQ:BBBY) must face a lawsuit claiming they sold linens that were falsely labeled ""100% Egyptian Cotton"" or ""100% Long-Staple Egyptian cotton"" despite being suspicious of their origin.
Monday's decision by U.S. District Judge Vincent Briccetti in White Plains, New York, addressed claims that consumers nationwide overpaid for mislabeled cotton produced by an Indian textile company, Welspun India Ltd.
Egyptian cotton often commands a premium price because of its prestige, and because its long fibers yield a finer, lighter, softer and more durable fabric.
In a 39-page decision, Briccetti said consumers may pursue breach of warranty and negligent misrepresentation claims against the retailers and a U.S. unit of Welspun, and fraud claims against the Welspun unit.
He dismissed fraud claims against the retailers because there was no ""strong inference of fraudulent intent."" New York and California consumers were allowed to sue the retailers under their respective states' consumer protection laws.
A lawyer for Welspun and Bed Bath & Beyond declined to comment. Walmart, Target and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The consumers' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
According to the complaint, the retailers sold Welspun's ""Egyptian"" cotton well into 2016 even though Target and Bed Bath & Beyond had known for several months, and Walmart had known as early as 2008, that the cotton was mislabeled.
The cotton was sold under the Fieldcrest, Royal Velvet, Better Homes and Gardens, Canopy, Crowning Touch and Perfect Touch brands, court papers show.
Target severed its ties to Welspun in August 2016, and Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling the linens in question later that year.
The litigation combined several lawsuits. It was reassigned to Briccetti after the original judge, Richard Sullivan, was promoted to the federal appeals court in Manhattan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc's $26 billion acquisition of rival Sprint Corp appeared to win the support of a majority of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday, in a significant step toward the deal's approval.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, came out in favor of the combination after the companies offered concessions, including selling Sprint's Boost Mobile prepaid cell service, as did FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican.
The five-member panel's third Republican, Mike O'Rielly, said he was ""inclined to support"" the proposed merger, even if he was not convinced of the need for all of the conditions announced by Pai.
Sprint shares initially surged 23.2% while T-Mobile shares rose 5.1%, but both pared gains to close at 18.8% and 3.9% higher respectively after a report from Bloomberg News said the Department of Justice, which also has to OK the deal, was leaning against approval. Bloomberg said the department was concerned the proposed remedies did not resolve antitrust concerns.
If the deal is completed, the number of U.S. wireless carriers would drop to three from four, with  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) leading the pack.
Some telecommunications experts have predicted that prices for cellphone service would rise as a result, and U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal agreed. 
""The FCC’s seeming abdication makes it even more important for the Department of Justice to step up to the plate to block this merger,"" the Democratic senator said in a statement. 
The commission is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats. 
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, tweeted her disapproval.
""We've seen this kind of consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,"" she wrote. ""It hasn't worked out well for consumers. But now the @FCC wants to bless the same kind of consolidation for wireless carriers. I have serious doubts.""
The FCC will not formally vote on the merger on Monday but will first draft an order it plans to circulate for approval in the coming weeks, said the two people briefed on the matter.
The FCC move boded well for the Justice Department to also approve the deal, Citi analysts said in a note. 
""While the two federal agencies have different standards of review that could lead to different outcomes, we believe the likelihood for some coordination between the agencies is encouraging for the approval prospects by the (Justice Department),"" the note said.
Reviews by state attorneys general and public utility commissions could push full approval back to the third quarter of this year, the Citi note said.
The FCC and Justice Department almost always agree publicly on merger reviews, and experts said on Monday the agencies have not had a major review disagreement in four decades. 
Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a law professor at Georgetown University, said a Justice Department challenge ""would represent a significant departure from longstanding practice."" 
CONCESSIONS 
In a filing with the FCC on Monday, the companies pledged to sell prepaid wireless provider Boost Mobile. 
The sale will include the brand name, any active accounts and dedicated Boost assets and staff but no wireless spectrum. The new Boost could buy network access from T-Mobile for at least six years.
The companies pledged they would not scrap a deal with Altice USA, the fourth-largest U.S. cable television company.
Altice has an agreement with Sprint that would allow it to start offering mobile phone service later this year, using Sprint's network.
One critic of the deal called the concession weak.
""I don't understand how the mere spinning off of one of three prepaid services would satisfy (Pai), given all the evidence in the record that post-paid (wireless) prices will go up,"" said Gigi Sohn, who held a senior FCC position during the Obama administration. ""I just think this is very weak tea.""
The Boost sale is aimed at resolving concerns that the deal would give the combined company 54% of the prepaid market, which generally includes those with poor credit who cannot pay with a credit card.
T-Mobile, which is about 63 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), also promised the new company would build a ""world-leading"" 5G network, which is supposed to be the next generation of wireless service. It promises to give rural Americans robust 5G broadband and enhance home broadband and could face hefty financial penalties if it did not meet expansion targets.
The FCC and Justice Department had been expected to make a decision in early June. They have been weighing a potential loss of competition and higher prices for consumers against the prospect of a more powerful No. 3 wireless carrier that can build a faster, better 5G network.

T-Mobile has about 80 million customers and Sprint has about 55 million customers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.33%, the S&P 500 fell 0.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite sank 1.46%.
Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google suspended business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services, adding credence to fears that other U.S. companies will follow suit and cut ties with the Chinese tech giant, deepening the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
Following the move from Google, Huawei will be immediately cut off from receiving Android system updates, stifling the tech giant's ambitions to rack up smartphone market share.
The fallout from the ban was seen in semiconductors as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid more than 4%, with Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:SWKS), Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) - all of whom count Huawei as a major customer - ending the day nursing deep losses.
The downside in semis was exacerbated by reports that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will not supply Huawei until further notice, Bloomberg reported.
With U.S. and China trade relations on the ropes, analysts offered up a bearish outlook on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), sending the iPhone maker's shares 3.13% lower. Apple was the worst Dow performer; Intel was second-worst.
HSBC downgraded its outlook on Apple, warning that if tariffs affect the tech giant's products imported into the U.S., the iPhone maker could be forced to raise prices, denting already weak demand for its pricey phones and lengthening the smartphone upgrade cycle.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were boosted by a rise in domestic oil prices after Saudi Arabia vowed to continue with production cuts despite numerous demands from Trump to rein in cuts.
In other news, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) bucked the broader trend lower after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai backed a merger between the two companies. But the merger could still be in trouble as the Justice Department is reportedly against the deal as it could harm competition. T-Mobile rose nearly 3.9%; Sprint jumped about 12.5%.

278,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 04:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google suspends some business with Huawei after Trump blacklist - source,"By Angela Moon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has suspended business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services except those publicly available via open source licensing, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday, in a blow to the Chinese technology company that the U.S. government has sought to blacklist around the world.
Holders of current Huawei smartphones with Google apps, however, will continue to be able to use and download app updates provided by Google, a Google spokesperson said, confirming earlier reporting by Reuters.
""We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,"" the Google spokesperson said. 
""For users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,"" the spokesperson said, without giving further details.
The suspension could hobble Huawei's smartphone business outside China as the tech giant will immediately lose access to updates to Google's Android operating system. Future versions of Huawei smartphones that run on Android will also lose access to popular services, including the Google Play Store and Gmail and YouTube apps.
""Huawei will only be able to use the public version of Android and will not be able to get access to proprietary apps and services from Google,"" the source said.
The Trump administration on Thursday added Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a trade blacklist, immediately enacting restrictions that will make it extremely difficult for the company to do business with U.S. counterparts.
On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it was considering scaling back restrictions on Huawei to ""prevent the interruption of existing network operations and equipment"". It was not immediately clear on Sunday whether Huawei's access to mobile software would be affected.
The extent to which Huawei will be hurt by the U.S. government's blacklist is not yet known as its global supply chain assesses the impact. Chip experts have questioned Huawei's ability to continue to operate without help from the United States. 
Details of the specific services affected by the suspension were still being discussed internally at Google, according to the source. Huawei attorneys are also studying the impact of the blacklist, a Huawei spokesman said on Friday. 
Huawei was not immediately reachable for further comment.
Chipmakers including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc have told their employees they will not supply critical software and components to Huawei until further notice, Bloomberg reported https://bloom.bg/2VLT5QK late on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comments on the Bloomberg report.
Representatives of the U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately comment. 
POPULAR APPS
Huawei will continue to have access to the version of the Android operating system available through the open source license, known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), that is available for free to anyone who wishes to use it. There are about 2.5 billion active Android devices worldwide, according to Google.
However, Google will stop providing Huawei with access, technical support and collaboration involving its proprietary apps and services going forward, the source said.
Huawei has said it has spent the last few years preparing a contingency plan by developing its own technology in case it is blocked from using Android. Some of this technology is already being used in products sold in China, the company has said.
In an interview with Reuters in March, Eric Xu, rotating chairman of Huawei, struck a defiant note in anticipation of retaliatory actions by U.S. companies. ""No matter what happens, the Android Community does not have any legal right to block any company from accessing its open-source license,"" he said.
Popular Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube and the Chrome browser that are available through Google's Play Store will disappear from future Huawei handsets as those services are not covered by the open source license and require a commercial agreement with Google.
But users of existing Huawei devices who have access to the Google Play Store will still be able to download app updates provided by Google. Apps such as Gmail are updated through the store, unlike operating system updates which are typically handled by phone manufacturers and telecoms carriers, which the blacklist could affect, the source said. 
The impact is expected to be minimal in the Chinese market. Most Google mobile apps are banned in China, where alternatives are offered by domestic competitors such as Tencent and Baidu.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the ministry had noticed the report and would look into it and pay attention to developments. 
""At the same time, China supports Chinese companies to use legal weapons to defend their legitimate rights,"" he added, but did not elaborate. 
Huawei's European business, its second-biggest market, could be hit as Huawei licenses these services from Google in Europe.

""Having those apps is critical for smartphone makers to stay competitive in regions like Europe,"" said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research, CCS Insight.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Monday as the White House's restrictions on Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd weighed on the technology sector and raised concerns that the move would further inflame trade tensions between the United States and China.
Since the White House added Huawei to a trade blacklist last week, several companies have moved to suspend business with the world's largest telecom equipment maker. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has moved to stop providing Huawei with access to its proprietary apps and services, Reuters reported on Sunday. Mobile phone parts producer Lumentum Holdings Inc also announced that it has discontinued shipments to Huawei.
Other chipmakers, including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM),  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will not supply the Chinese company until further notice, according to a Bloomberg report.
S&P 500 technology stocks dropped 2.2%, the largest percentage decline among the benchmark index's 11 major sectors. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which includes Huawei suppliers  Qualcomm Inc , Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Broadcom Inc, tumbled 4.6% to touch its lowest level in more than two months.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) slumped 3.8% to weigh most heavily on Wall Street's major indexes. The iPhone maker's shares were also pressured by a warning from HSBC that higher prices for the company's products following the latest increases in tariffs could have ""dire consequences"" on demand. 
""The political risk now has become a business risk,"" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. ""This could affect in a meaningful way earnings expectations for many tech names.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 165.87 points, or 0.64%, to 25,598.13, the S&P 500 lost 28.13 points, or 0.98%, to 2,831.4 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 135.89 points, or 1.74%, to 7,680.39.
After touching record highs at the beginning of May, Wall Street's main indexes have succumbed to selling pressure on mounting concerns about a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. The S&P 500 is on track to post its worst monthly decline since the December sell-off, trading nearly 4% off its all-time high. 
Among gainers, shares of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc rose after Federal Communication Commission Chairman Ajit Pai came out in favor of the merger of the two telecom companies. Sprint and T-Mobile shares pared gains, however, after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was leaning against approving the deal.
Still, Sprint shares were last up 15.9% while T-Mobile shares were 2.5% higher.
Dish Network Corp shares declined 6.0% after the company said it would buy broadcast satellite service assets from EchoStar Corp in an $800 million deal, though the shares pared losses in afternoon trading. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.00-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

""The proposed additional tariff of 25 percent on footwear would be catastrophic for our consumers, our companies, and the American economy as a whole,"" a group of 173 companies said in a letter https://fdra.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-Footwear-Tariff-Letter-1.pdf. 
Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% earlier this month, a move that is expected to raise prices on thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics
Trump is expected to impose 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping next month. 
""As an industry that faces a $3 billion duty bill every year, we can assure you that any increase in the cost of importing shoes has a direct impact on the American footwear consumer,"" the companies said. 
The letter was also sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow.
The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA) estimates the hike in tariff would add $7 billion in additional costs for customers every year. 
The companies noted that the tariffs on footwear average 11.3% and reach rates as high as 67.5%. Adding a 25% tax increase on top of these tariffs would mean Americans could pay a nearly 100% duty on their shoes, the companies said in the letter.
Last week, the world's largest retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc warned that its prices would increase due to higher tariffs on goods from China and that the levies were already hurting its furniture business.

Macy's also said that the tariffs enacted on May 10, does have some impact, particularly on its furniture business.

282,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Elliott Management opposes airline Azul on Avianca Brasil bankruptcy plan,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management is opposing a new plan by Brazilian airline Azul SA to purchase some of the routes operated by financially troubled rival Avianca Brasil for $145 million, according to a legal document seen by Reuters. 
Elliott, known in Latin America for forcing Argentina into bigger repayments on defaulted bonds, is Avianca Brasil's largest creditor by a wide margin, with claims totaling almost $490 million. 
Avianca Brasil filed for bankruptcy protection in December, setting off a dispute for its routes among Brazil's top three airlines. The fight underscores how the routes of Avianca Brasil, which is controlled by the same holding company as publicly traded Colombia-based Avianca Holdings SA, have become fiercely sought after despite the financial woes that sent it into bankruptcy protection. 
Behind the scenes, Elliott has used its dominance as a creditor to influence the dispute over the routes. Legal documents show that Elliott crafted the current bankruptcy reorganization plan, which Azul has countered with its own new proposal this month. 
Although the final verdict is in the hands of a judge, the hedge fund is asking the court to dismiss Azul's proposal and keep its own plan intact, which would benefit Azul's two larger Brazilian rivals: Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and LATAM Airlines Group. Gol and LATAM have signed agreements with Elliott to pay the hedge fund a combined $70 million. 
Elliott's influence in the bankruptcy process has raised questions among creditors regarding the origin of its loans, including by airport handling operator Swissport International AG, which Elliott now accuses of working to further Azul's agenda. 
Documents show Elliott has not lent money directly to Avianca Brasil, but instead to companies controlled by the same holding group, including a palm oil field in Colombia and a shipyard based in Rio de Janeiro. 
While Azul has previously accused Elliott of engaging in ""spurious"" deals meant to harm the competing airline's business, the hedge fund said in response that Azul's claims were ""clumsy - typical of someone frustrated with their own failure."" 
Avianca Brasil itself has yet to weigh in on Azul's plan and declined to comment on Monday. 
A union representing some of its aircraft workers, however, has endorsed Azul's plan as superior to Elliott's. The union carried out a strike over the weekend alleging that the airline has fallen behind in its payroll. 
Azul said in a statement on Monday that its plan offers Avianca Brasil's workers, clients and creditors a ""superior option"" to Elliott. 
""Elliott is against Azul's proposal because the hedge fund has already received payment, contrary to the thousands of workers of Avianca Brasil.""
Gol also opposes Azul's plan. LATAM has yet to give an opinion. 
TRADING ACCUSATIONS
Azul first made an offer to buy Avianca Brasil's routes back in March, offering $105 million and signing a tentative deal with the carrier. In particular, it wanted to break in to the lucrative Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro air shuttle business. 
But after Azul closed the preliminary deal, Elliott contacted rivals Gol and LATAM and obtained higher bids from them totaling $140 million.
At a creditors meeting in April, Elliott's plan was approved and a bankruptcy auction was scheduled, sidelining Azul. 
Earlier this month, Azul upped its bid to $145 million and asked a judge to approve its plan over Elliott's. That decision is still pending. 
The Elliott-Azul dispute has pulled in a third company, airport handling operator Swissport, which recently obtained an injunction that suspended the bankruptcy auction at the eleventh hour. 
Elliott said in its legal filing that Azul and Swissport International worked ""in apparent coordination"" to undermine the hedge fund and other creditors.

Swissport did not respond to a request for comment.

284,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>","Fannie, Freddie need to raise capital before privatization: FHFA's Calabria","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to build adequate capital as a critical step toward privatizing them, the head of their regulator said on Monday, more than a decade after the government took control of the U.S. finance agencies during a global credit crisis.
The Trump administration is pressing to release the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) from federal control, which went into effect in October 2008 in the wake of heavy losses that Fannie and Freddie suffered on home loans that soured during the subprime mortgages crisis.
""It was insufficient capital that triggered the conservatorship, and it's going to be sufficient capital that triggers an exit,"" said Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
Calabria was speaking at the Mortgage Bankers Association's annual National Secondary Market conference.
Proponents of privatization for the two firms say increasing the amount of money they have on hand is critical in case they face another financial crunch like the one over a decade ago. 
""As a regulator, my primary concern that the GSEs maintain capital levels commensurate with their risk profiles,"" Calabria said, adding they should eventually meet that same capital rules of big banks.
Calabria did not specify the levels of capital Fannie and Freddie should raise.
A privatizing plan including ways for Fannie and Freddie to raise capital is being worked on, Calabria said.
He said a housing finance reform plan would be finalized this fall with the goal for Fannie and Freddie to begin to raise capital in January 2020.
""So the path of out of conservatorships that we will establish for Fannie and Freddie is not going to be calendar dependent. It will be driven, first and foremost, by their ability to raise capital,"" he said in a prepared speech to the industry group.
Fannie and Freddie could increase capital by stopping remitting their profits to the government, Calabria said.
Under their conservatorships, the GSEs send their quarterly profits to the U.S. Treasury.

Calabria said he and others are studying other methods for Fannie and Freddie to raise capital ""such as a public offering of some kind.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - America's $6 trillion of commercial property markets show no signs a U.S. recession is on the way, with builders, lenders and buyers treading cautiously after a soft first quarter, an industry economist said on Monday.
By contrast, before the Great Recession of 2008, Federal Reserve data show that real estate owned to generate income for investors grew annually at 15 percent or more before a dramatic drop.
Calvin Schnure, senior vice president at the National Association Of Real Estate Investment Trusts trade group, said in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum online chat room that vacancy rates were low and building lagged market demand.
Here are excerpts from the chat:
Question: After an era of cheap money, shouldn't the commercial real estate sector be overheating and putting the long-running U.S. expansion at risk?
Answer: Commercial real estate markets are a good signal for the overall economy, as real estate is highly cyclical. Activity slowed a bit in the first quarter, and rent growth was soft. But we don't see the types of imbalances that typically precede downturns. New construction has been constrained, and vacancy rates are still low.
Q: What are you seeing in the real estate markets?
A: Recent activity is similar to the ebb and flow we often see in the economy. It makes sense, given all the global uncertainty last winter, that some people may have been hesitant to sign a deal. Developers are cautious, even with low debt interest rates. That's a good sign.
Q: Retail surely must be an exception, with hundreds of shopping malls shuttered?
A: It's important to distinguish between the haves and have-nots. Some malls are in high-income neighborhoods, and store space is still very much in demand. REITs tend to own the higher-quality malls. That doesn't mean they are immune to store closures, but they have been able to refill space quickly. REITs have maintained high occupancy rates at malls, at 94.2%.
Q: Which commercial real estate sectors are growing best?
A: The data-center REITs face lots of demand from cell communications and cloud storage. Same thing with cell tower REITs, and the industrial REITs that help ship the goods bought online. All the residential sectors (apartments, manufactured homes, single-family rentals) are robust.

289,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>",GM says most new vehicles to get over-the-air upgrade tech by 2023,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday most of its global models will be capable of over-the-air software upgrades by 2023, as the automaker rolls out new vehicle electrical systems designed to securely handle heavy data traffic and software downloads from the internet.
GM and other established automakers have been slow to catch up with electric automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has for years used smartphone-style over-the-air upgrade technology to change the function and feel of its vehicles overnight. Earlier this month, for example, Tesla responded to reports about its vehicles catching on fire by pushing out an over-the-air update for battery management software.
GM executives have said in the past that matching Tesla's use of over-the-air updates would require new vehicle electrical systems, and robust cybersecurity to assure that vehicles could not be tampered with by hackers. 
GM did not specify what vehicle systems and features would be open to over-the-air updates, but said the new system ""enables the adoption of functionality upgrades throughout the lifespan of the vehicle."" 
In 2016, GM President Mark Reuss, who at that time was head of global product development, said the company would not use over-the-air updates for safety-critical systems such as brakes.
The new GM electronic systems will be capable of handling up to 4.5 terabytes of data processing power per hour, five times the capability of current GM vehicles, the company said in a statement.

The new GM electrical systems will be launched on the 2020 Cadillac CT5 sedan, due to begin production later this year, GM said.

290,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Apple Slumps as Analysts Warn of U.S.-China Trade Turmoil ,"Investing.com -- Apple slumped on Monday, as Wall Street turned bearish on the iPhone maker in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to hike tariffs on imported products from Beijing.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 3% after HSBC downgraded its outlook on the company, warning that if tariffs affect Apple products imported into the U.S., the iPhone maker could be forced to raise prices, denting already weak demand for its pricey phones and lengthening the smartphone upgrade cycle.
The bank also outlined a risk in the Chinese market, noting that domestic consumers are accelerating the shift to smartphone substitutes by going to local brands with comparable functionality such as Huawei and Xiaomi.
The latest downgrade from HSBC echoed bearish recent notes from other banks, many of whom have also warned that Apple risks losing market share in China amid the hostile U.S.-China trade environment.
""We do not know yet if the retail price of the iPhone will increase in the U.S. However, we see the tariffs impacting Apple’s MacBook component costs,'' Rosenblatt Securities said.
Apple was the biggest loser among the 30 Dow  stocks and was responsible 43 points of the Dow's decline. It also contributed nearly 25 points to the Nasdaq-100 index's 1.4% decline. The shares are trading nearly 22% below their 52-week high of $233.47 reached on Oct. 3."

The move comes as British lawmakers and regulators are pushing to weaken the grip of PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG, the so-called Big Four accounting firms that dominate audits of top companies in Britain.
A Mazars spokesman confirmed that it would be conducting Goldman Sachs International's European audit, which is focused on activities in Britain and Germany. It referred all other questions to Goldman.
Mazars is the eighth-largest auditor by fee revenue in Britain but has struggled to win audit work for many large listed or multinational companies, which almost all use one of the Big Four. 
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs confirmed the Mazars appointment, which was first reported by the Financial Times.
The U.S.-headquartered bank said Mazars will start in 2021, while PwC will remain the company's group auditor.

Goldman is making the change as new European Union rules require listed companies as well as the European operations of a few major multinationals - which include Goldman Sachs - to appoint a new auditor every 20 years. Goldman has previously used PwC for its European operations.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is likely to approve T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint's (NYSE:S) merger after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said he would recommend approval of the deal. His endorsement makes the official approval over the next few days very likely.
Pai said he agreed to the $26.5 billion merger after the companies made a number of promises, including selling Sprint's Boost prepaid brand, a three-year buildout of the 5G network and a commitment not to raise prices while the network is being constructed.
The deal still needs to be voted on and must receive at least three approvals from the five-member agency.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it will eliminate about 10% of its global salaried workforce, cutting about 7,000 jobs by the end of August as part of its larger restructuring in a move that will save the No. 2 automaker $600 million annually.
Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said in an email to employees that the cuts include both voluntary buyouts and layoffs, and a spokesman added it freezes open positions as well. About 2,300 of the affected people are employed in the United States, the spokesman said.
""To succeed in our competitive industry, and position Ford to win in a fast-changing future, we must reduce bureaucracy, empower managers, speed decision making, focus on the most valuable work and cut costs,"" Hackett said in the email.
Ford has been restructuring its operations globally to improve profitability and speed product development, making or announcing cuts in Europe, South America and Russia. 
The automaker also has signed a deal with Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG to join forces on commercial vans and pickup trucks. The companies are also negotiating a broader alliance for electric and self-driving vehicle development.
U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed boosting auto sector employment, harshly criticizing automakers, especially General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) for cutting jobs, but has focused primarily on blue-collar cuts at factories rather than white-collar reductions. 
The White House did not immediately comment on Monday about Ford's salaried cuts.
Restructuring work continues in Europe, China, South America and the International Markets Group and the Dearborn, Michigan-based company expects to complete the process in those markets by the end of August, said Hackett, who has described 2019 as a year of transition for the company. 
Within the cuts, Hackett said it will eliminate close to 20% of upper-level managers, a move intended to reduce bureaucracy and speed up decision making. Before the redesign of its operations, Ford had up to 14 organizational layers, but that will be cut to nine by year-end, Hackett said.
Notification to North American employees will begin on Tuesday and the majority will be completed by May 24, he said. 

The Ford family are the controlling shareholders. Hackett said it would give those affected by the job cuts a few days to wrap up and say goodbye, emphasizing Ford's position as a family company. That stood in contrast to how GM handled layoffs earlier this year where employees were asked to leave immediately.

305,By Business Insider,"<span>May 20, 2019 09:36AM ET</span>","Uber's historic loss, Lyft's abysmal month, Pinterest's earnings disaster: Why the white-hot IPO market is full of duds","On the surface, the US initial-public-offering market is sizzling.
Jam-packed with big deals and filled with splashy names once only the stuff of venture capitalists' dreams, the  IPO market is incredibly active this year.
It's giving everyone from  investment banks to foreign investors multi-million-dollar paydays, and the average investor a chance to own a piece of young companies trying to  disrupt industries.
And the stakes are high. The 80 US-listed IPOs so far this year represent the heaviest volume since 2014, according to Dealogic data. They have contributed nearly 15% of the last decade's total IPO volume, the firm's analysis shows.
But under the hood, it's a different story. The volatile market has absorbed  flop after  flop, wiping out investor wealth and setting a grim tone for IPOs coming down the pipeline.
The disappointing performances in some cases can be attributed to the very quality of companies hitting the market, due to their unclear paths to  profitability and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, analysts and investment advisors told Markets Insider.
""We are seeing the end of a cycle,"" Tom Forte, a senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, told Markets Insider on Friday. ""At the end of a cycle, companies that want to go public during the cycle rush to go public. And, selectively, we are seeing that there are some investors out there who are willing to stomach today's losses for tomorrow's gains."" 
Quickly, a rundown on some of the IPO market's noteworthy disappointments:   Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s first month of trading reflected the second-worst for a large US-listed IPO on record with a 20.5% decline, per Dealogic. Only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s 21% drop in 2012 was worse. 
Lyft's biggest rival,  Uber (NYSE:UBER), was a disaster in its own right, posting the  largest first-day dollar loss of any domestic IPO going back to 1975. Its own pricing was reportedly influenced by  Lyft's poor stock-market showing following its own debut. 
The pair of newly public ride-hailing companies would naturally trade in a volatile fashion during a period of heightened market volatility, said Erin Gibbs, a portfolio manager at S&P Investment Advisory Services.
""I'm more hesitant of the riskier IPO market as we face increasing uncertainty over our own economy,"" Gibbs said in an email on Friday.
""I think investors tend to forget that the reason a company goes public is because it needs cash, whether to pay back private equity, pay debt or to grow, it needs capital. Companies don't go public to make investors wealthier. So I feel we should always be wary around the hype of any IPO.""
 Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), meanwhile, surged in its  April debut. Shares rose 30% during their first few weeks of trading before  crashing after its first quarterly report was underwhelming.
To be fair, the market has also ushered in smashing successes this year.
 Beyond Meat posted the best first-day performance of any US-listed IPO, by Dealogic's count, surging 163%. That was also the only time since the dot-com era that an IPO had a  first-day return greater than 100%, per UBS.
 Zoom, what has been  dubbed ""the profitable tech unicorn,"" has surged 38% since its April debut, and hit a record high Friday. And the  Nasdaq-listed Luckin Coffee, a China-based Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) competitor, rose 47% in its first day of trading on Friday. 
""We don't think the IPO market is a total failure,"" Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a Minneapolis- and New York-based venture capital firm that invests in frontier technology companies, said Friday in an email.
""Zoom has been a great success story.  PagerDuty has also performed well. We'll see how  Slack does soon, but it seems like it will go public at a valuation higher than its last private financing.""
Others say there's not much to glean from a few companies with an extremely limited trading history.
""The volatility of the markets at this time, and all of the short term trading, makes it difficult to predict short term moves, especially as it relates to issuers that have been trading for a short period of time like Pinterest, Uber, and Lyft,"" Scott Coyle, the cofounder and CEO of ClickIPO, an app that tracks initial public offerings, said Friday in an email.
""Over the long term, all 3 companies will be priced by the markets based on their financial performance metrics,"" he added.

The immediate result was the worst week of the year for the benchmark S&P 500. That weakness spilled over into Monday the following week, and then investors spent the next four days trying to claw their way back out of that tariff-sized hole.
As it stands now, US stocks are roughly 3% lower than they were before Trump reignited the trade war with a handful of tweets on May 5. That weakness has investors across Wall Street wondering if this is finally the headwind that could end the more than 10-year bull market.
Marko Kolanovic, the global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, is here to put their minds at ease. His base case for the trade war is that it will be resolved by year-end — a result that would surely give stocks a welcome boost.
Read more: We spoke with JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic, who can move markets with a single call. Here's where he said investors should be putting their money.
And he's certainly someone whose word should be heeded. After all, his calls were so accurate at one point that the entire market moved every time he wrote new research. No matter how you slice it, Kolanovic is one of Wall Street's foremost quant gurus.
His optimism stems from what he calls the ""Trump collar,"" which is the idea that the president only pushes the envelope on trade negotiations when stocks are strong, then makes concessions when the market sells off.
In other words, Kolanovic doesn't think Trump would ever let the market truly fail. He estimates that the furthest Trump would ever let the S&P 500 fall is 3-4% before taking steps to stem the selling.

As for where the S&P 500 will end the year, Kolanovic reaffirmed JPMorgan's target of 3,000. However, he says a successful trade-war resolution would push that up to 3,200 — or about 12% higher than current levels.
But a trade-war agreement alone won't get the market there. Kolanovic notes that there is also buying power lying dormant right now, waiting to be unleashed by the same machines that withdrew it initially. He says this is especially true since many investors pared risk exposure immediately after Trump's initial tweets.
""The reason for our stance is the very low positioning across virtually all types of equity investors, and so far limited technical damage by the recent increase in volatility,"" Kolanovic said in note late last week. ""Our base case was, and still is, that the trade war with China will get resolved this year, and we remain cautiously constructive."""
310,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 08:59AM ET</span>",Chips are down: Huawei U.S. blacklisting knocks semiconductor stocks,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. and European chipmakers fell sharply on Monday amid worries the Huawei Technologies suppliers may suspend shipments to the Chinese firm due to a U.S. crackdown.
The selling came after Nikkei Asian Review reported that Infineon had halted shipments to Huawei after Washington added the world's No. 2 smartphone maker to a trade blacklist last week, imposing restrictions that will make it difficult to do business with U.S. companies.
Reuters reported that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google had suspended some business with Huawei and Lumentum Holdings Inc, seen as a major supplier of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's face ID technology, said it had discontinued all shipments to Huawei.
European chipmaker STMicroelectronics fell 8% to the bottom of Paris' CAC 40, while Infineon Technologies dropped 4.5% on Frankfurt's DAX 30. AMS was down 11.5% at 1240 GMT.
The Nikkei report also said STMicro was set to have meetings this week to discuss whether to continue shipping to Huawei.
Germany's Infineon and France's STMicro, Europe's biggest chipmakers, had no immediate comment.
Lumentum fell 4.3% before the opening bell, while U.S chipmakers Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell between 3% to 5%. 
Even if companies can continue to sell components without being subject to U.S. restrictions, any disruption to Huawei's operations will have a knock-on effect on its suppliers, said Liberum analyst Janardan Menon.
""In coming months it can broadly be assumed that the Huawei portion of their (European chip suppliers') business will see quite a bit of weakness, if the U.S. government does not change its mind,"" he said.
The impact will not be uniform because the companies have different levels of exposure.
The selling was particularly amplified as investors exited bullish positions built up in the trade-sensitive sector in recent months as worries about the U.S.-China trade spat eased and companies forecast a recovery in smartphone demand in the second half of the year.

""With all of the semis commentary geared into a second-half recovery, a sizeable customer having supply issues could push that guidance out,"" said a trader.
AMS has almost doubled in value this year, while STM has risen almost 20%, outperforming the pan-European STOXX 600 index.

311,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Says Yen and Gold May Improve as Trade-War Hedges,"(Bloomberg) -- Traditional hedges gold and the yen have performed poorly since the beginning of the U.S.-China trade war, but that could now change given the more dovish monetary backdrop, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
A combination of a Federal Reserve that has stopped tightening policy and investor positioning that suggests the two assets are under-owned, could see their performance as hedges improve in 2019 and 2020, wrote strategists including John Normand in a note Friday. It’s premature to call for an end to trade tensions, which could last for years, so investors should explore the value of tactical hedges and strategic underweight positions, they argued.
“Although some markets like developed market equities have begun recovering from May’s trade war escalation, it’s premature to extrapolate stability,” they wrote. Summer activity could show a renewed slump in manufacturing, risk premia are not very apparent and positioning adjustments have been modest, they said.
The impact of the trade war on markets has been difficult for Wall Street strategists to predict. Normand’s own JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) says the S&P 500 Index end up anywhere from 2,550 to 3,200 (it closed just below 2,860 Friday). Morgan Stanley thinks the dispute could increase the potential of a recession. And numerous predictions in recent months that the dollar might decline have been stymied.
While tactical hedges can improve the returns of defensive positions, they require skill to time entry and exit points, JPMorgan argued. Though strategic underweights avoid the need for this “nimbleness”, they could end up hurt returns as and when trade tensions ebb, it said.
Since the trade war began last year, defensive trades that have generated positive absolute returns and attractive risk/reward ratios included U.S. versus international equities and Treasuries over emerging market local debt, the strategists wrote. The yen and gold, and owning Treasuries against U.S. stocks, have been poor hedges, they said.

The U.S. beverage giant had wanted to refranchise the unit as part of its global plan to divest its manufacturing and distribution assets to focus on main beverage business and boost margins.
""While we remain committed to the refranchising process, we believe it's in the best interests of all involved for Coca-Cola to continue to hold and operate CCBA,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.
The company said it has had discussions with a number of potential partners. Coca-Cola HBC and rival Coca-Cola European Partners were seen as potential buyers for the unit.

Coke in 2016 bought a majority stake in CCBA, the continent's largest soft drink bottler, with operations in a dozen markets including South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, from Anheuser-Busch InBev SA.
The company said it would reclassify its financial statements from second quarter in 2019 to include CCBA as part of its continuing operations.

314,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank staff flagged Trump, Kushner transactions for watchdog: NYTimes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anti-money laundering specialists at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) recommended in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving entities controlled by U.S. President Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial-crimes watchdog, the New York Times reported on Sunday.
The newspaper, citing five current and former Deutsche Bank employees, said executives at the German bank, which has lent billions of dollars to the Trump and Kushner companies, rejected their employees' advice and the reports were never filed with the government.
Deutsche Bank denied the report but shares in Germany's largest bank hit a new low on Monday, below a previous minimum set in December. Shares fell 2.8 percent at 6.65 euros. 
Trump rejected the report in a blast of early-morning tweets on Monday, saying he had little need for banks because he had so much cash on hand and denying that the money came from Russia. 
The compliance allegations are the latest in a wave of problems to beset the bank which faces investors at its annual meeting on Thursday.
The Times reported that the transactions, some of which involved Trump's now-defunct foundation, set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect illicit activity, according to the former bank employees. 
Compliance staff members who then reviewed the transactions prepared so-called suspicious activity reports that they believed should be sent to a unit of the Treasury Department that polices financial crimes, according to the newspaper.
Deutsche Bank responded with a denial of the report. 
""At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious,"" the bank said in a statement.
""Furthermore, the suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false.""
MOUNTING PROBLEMS 
Deutsche is facing a series of headaches.
Investors are calling on the bank to scale back its investment bank after talks to merge with a rival failed and amid a grim profit outlook. European regulators also fear Deutsche could fail U.S. stress tests. 
The Times reported the bank employees viewed the decision not to report the transactions as a result of a lax approach to money laundering laws. They said there was a pattern of bank executives rejecting reports to protect relationships with lucrative clients, according to the newspaper. 
One employee who reviewed some of the transactions said she was terminated last year after raising concerns about the bank's practices, the Times reported.
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization told Reuters ""the story is absolute nonsense."" ""We have no knowledge of any 'flagged' transactions with Deutsche Bank. In fact, we have no operating accounts with Deutsche Bank,"" she said.
The newspaper said a Kushner Cos spokeswoman called any allegations of relationships involving money laundering ""made up and totally false.""
Officials at Kushner Cos were not available to Reuters for independent comment. 
The Times said the nature of the transactions was not clear. At least some of them involved money flowing back and forth with overseas entities or individuals, which bank employees considered suspicious.
The report surfaces at a time when congressional and New York state authorities are investigating the relationship between Trump, his family and Deutsche Bank, and demanding documents related to any suspicious activity.
The president has sued in court in an attempt to block U.S. House of Representatives subpoenas for his financial records that were sent to Deutsche Bank,  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) and the accounting firm Mazars LLP.

Trump, a real estate developer and former reality television star, still owns the Trump Organization but has maintained that his sons are running the day-to-day operations while he is president.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets weakened on Monday as concerns mounted about an escalating fallout from a U.S. crackdown on China's Huawei Technologies.
Investors already on edge about an escalating U.S.-China trade dispute were further rattled after Beijing accused Washington of harboring ""extravagant expectations"" for a trade deal, underlining the gulf between the two sides.
Asian shares had managed to reverse some of last week's losses on Monday after Washington said it would lift tariffs in North America, and as investors cheered apparent wins by Conservative incumbent parties in elections in Australia and India. 
But the mood did not carry over to Europe, where weak corporate earnings added to the gloom.
The pan-European Euro STOXX 600 extended earlier losses and was down 1.06% by 1100 GMT - the index, down 3.5% in May, is on track for its first monthly loss in 2019. 
The German DAX slid 1.38%, while France's CAC 40 weakened 1.39%.
U.S. President Donald Trump's government added Huawei to a trade blacklist last week, imposing restrictions that will make it difficult to do business with U.S. companies.
The repercussions quickly became evident as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suspended some business with Huawei.
In Europe, chipmakers Infineon Technologies, AMS and STMicroelectronics dropped sharply, falling between 6% and 12% on growing fears of a disruption to the industry's global supply chain. 
""Market volatility continues to stem from announcements and interpretations of what is going on in trade disputes between the U.S. and its trading partners, but principally China,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. 
""China are unlikely to take Google's suspension of business with Huawei lying down.""
On the positive side, a U.S. decision on Friday to remove tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum prompted Canada's foreign minister to vow the quick ratification of a new North American trade agreement. 
The MSCI index of world shares, which tracks shares in 47 countries, slipped 0.14%, leaving it 3.9% below its 2019 highs. The sudden return of trade war jitters has sent the stock market's year-to-date rally into reverse.
U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures dropped 0.51%.
Prominent investor Jim Rogers, who co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum that he believed Washington and Beijing would soon announce a trade deal, although the current spat would not be the last time Trump tried to exploit the prospect of a trade war.
""These are negotiating tactics from Mr. Trump at the moment. What will happen is we will have some good news, the market will have a rally. It will probably be the last rally,"" he said. 
AUSSIE JUMPS
Oil prices briefly rallied after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that there was consensus among OPEC and allied oil producers to reduce inventories ""gently"".
Rising tensions in the Middle East have also supported oil prices in recent days. Trump on Sunday tweeted that a conflict with Tehran would be the ""official end"" of Iran.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd has decided to buy wide-body planes from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, people with direct knowledge of the matter said, ending an 18 month battle between the U.S. aircraft maker and European rival Airbus SE.
The carrier has been considering replacing eight Boeing 777-200ER aircraft in a deal worth over $2 billion at list prices, though carriers typically receive steep discounts. Air New Zealand already uses Boeing wide-bodies exclusively on long-haul flights, and Airbus single-aisle jets on shorter routes.
The final choices under consideration were the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, Air New Zealand Chief Financial Officer Jeff McDowall said in a video interview with the New Zealand Herald published on Saturday.
""They are both fantastic aircraft,"" McDowall said. ""Both produce a fantastic customer experience compared to the existing aircraft but also a lower cost and lower carbon emissions... We expect to make a decision soon, in the next month.""
Air New Zealand already operates 13 787-9 jets and has one more on order. The airline did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment. It will hold an annual investor briefing on May 27.
Boeing and Airbus declined to comment. The people with direct knowledge of the matter declined to be identified ahead of a public announcement.
Air New Zealand's chief executive, Christopher Luxon, last year told Reuters the larger Boeing 777X was also under consideration, and that the airline planned to use the new jets to begin longer routes such as Auckland to New York and Brazil.
In March, CFO McDowall in an analyst briefing said the airline would need fewer replacement jets in 2023 than initially anticipated due to changes in its flight network.
Air New Zealand began a two-year cost reduction program in March and deferred aircraft capital expenditure of about NZ$750 million ($490.1 million) as part of a business review.
A month earlier, it slashed domestic fares by as much as 50% in a shake-up of its pricing structure in response to a slackening travel market.

321,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2019 04:16AM ET</span>","StockBeat - Infineon, STMicro Fall as Huawei Ban Roils Chip Market","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- When the elephants fight, it’s the ants that get trampled.
Europe’s biggest chipmakers Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) – elephants in their own backyard – are getting a taste of life as an ant this morning as the trade dispute between China and the U.S. threatens to spiral out of control.
The two companies have been put in an awkward place by last week’s executive order from the U.S. effectively banning U.S. companies dealing directly with telecoms giant Huawei without a government license. Reports over the weekend suggested that companies from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) had already stopped selling to the Chinese giant.
According to a report by Japan’s Nikkei Asian Review, Germany’s Infineon has suspended sales to Huawei for fear of causing itself legal trouble in the U.S., while French-based STMicro (PA:STM) has scheduled meetings with the Chinese company for later this week to clarify its situation.
As of 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), Infineon was down 3.1%, while STMicro was down 3.8%, both at the bottom of their respective indexes. Germany’s Dax and the CAC 40 were both down a little less than 0.1%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 opened the week effectively flat at 381.60.
According to Nikkei, Infineon’s direct sales to Huawei are minimal – less than $100 million a year (compared to annual revenue of .7.94 billion euros. For STMicro, the direct impact would be larger as Huawei is one of its 10 biggest clients, according to regulatory filings cited by Reuters.
However, it isn’t just the direct effects that the two companies need to worry about. Restrictions on sales to China, the world’s biggest market for semiconductors, will create yet more overcapacity headaches for the industry outside China, putting more pressure on prices and margins.
It’s less than two months since Infineon was forced to cut its outlook for both revenue and profit this year due to “continued sluggishness in end markets”, while STMicro kept its guidance, but trimmed its planned capital expenditure.
Even if demand does pick up, the German company said it would only slowly feed through to the bottom line because global inventories are already at high levels. Huawei has been stockpiling for months to protect itself against being cut off from western suppliers, according to various reports."

323,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2019 03:50AM ET</span>",Biggest Nordic Money Managers Hoard Banks in Laundering Scandals,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest Nordic asset managers are either holding on to, or increasing, stakes in banks dragged down by vast money laundering scandals.
In a region where the concept of ethical investing is regularly held up as a goal, none of the big institutional investors contacted by Bloomberg said they would consider divesting shares of banks under investigation for laundering. A number have taken advantage of share-price declines to add to existing stakes.
At the top of the list is Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, which this month underlined its intention to remain a long-term investor in the Nordic banks caught up in dirty money affairs. The biggest pension funds in Denmark and Sweden have made similar statements. The funds Bloomberg spoke to said it was their intention to stay invested in order to take on a more activist role.
“Of course we take it very seriously,” said Eva Halvarsson, the chief executive officer of one of Sweden’s biggest pension funds, AP2. “We have shares in all the banks and are also cooperating with them in our role as asset managers. We follow the developments closely and have contacts at various levels.”
Staying Active
“It’s important that we wait and see how things develop,” she said. “But it’s of course in the cards for us to stay active and have a dialogue. They need to explain what they are doing about it and how they see their future.”
Danske A/S and  Swedbank  AB (ST:SWEDa) are being investigated in Europe and the U.S. amid allegations they handled billions of dollars in dirty money from the former Soviet Union via their Estonian units. Those who reportedly benefited from the transactions include convicted felon Paul Manafort and ousted Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, among others. Nordea Bank is also under investigation for laundering, though allegations against it are on a much smaller scale.
Preliminary charges have already been brought against a number of former Danske executives, including its ousted CEO, Thomas Borgen. Swedbank fired its CEO, Birgitte Bonnesen, amid allegations she misled the public about the severity of the bank’s laundering scandal. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that Danske may be facing a fine of about $1 billion in the U.S., and as much as $500 million from investor lawsuits against it.
“I have a great understanding for the complexity of it but of course the banks need to take it seriously in order to regain trust,” Halvarsson said.
ESG Investing
The pension industry’s commitment to scandal-hit banks may raise questions around the principles of responsible investing based on environmental, social and governance concerns. ESG investing guidelines aren’t standardized, making it hard to know what distinctions money managers are making. At the same time, there’s a school of thought that says staying invested in companies involved in unethical behavior is a better way to wield influence than divesting.
John Howchin, the secretary general of the Council on Ethics that sets guidelines for a number of Sweden’s AP pension funds, said “that’s the way we work,” in an interview. “We stay and work together with the companies, as long as we think it gives results.” He said that the ethics council has a global focus, while it’s up to the individual funds to take a stance on local investments.
In Norway, the CEO of the wealth fund, Yngve Slyngstad, says they “have a good dialogue” with the banks under investigation for money laundering. “Even so, we will remain long-term investors and it goes without saying that, as an investor in these banks, we have an expectation that the board will address these issues.”
Buying Banks
Some of the biggest funds in the Nordic region are adding to their stakes in the banks. ATP and PFA, Denmark’s two biggest pension firms with a combined portfolio of about $210 billion, have both bought up shares of  Danske Bank  since the scandal broke. Allan Polack, the CEO of PFA, points to the bank’s ability to make money as a key consideration. He says PFA is “very pleased” with Danske’s commitment to its dividend.
Analysts seem to agree. By far the majority of analysts covering Danske are advising clients to buy or hold on to the stock. Most recently,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded its recommendation on Danske to overweight.
Finland’s Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Co., which manages more than $50 billion, sold its Danske shares in 2018 but tripled its Swedbank stake. Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Co., another big Finnish fund, also added to its Swedbank holding.
Institutional investors have mostly stuck around as others have fled. Danske’s share price plunged almost 50% last year, while Swedbank is this year’s worst-performing financial stock in Europe, having lost roughly a quarter of its value. Nordea fell about 25% last year, broadly in line with the European financial stocks on average.
The declines have forced Danske and Swedbank to the bottom of the ladder when measuring market values of the six biggest Nordic banks. Nordea remains the region’s biggest. But DNB ASA of Norway, which has largely steered clear of laundering scandals, is now the second-biggest Nordic lender.
Sampo Oyj, Nordea’s biggest investor, says it’s time to look past the allegations, declaring that the “era of large scandals is over.” Sampo Chairman Bjorn Wahlroos, who also used to run the board of Nordea, said earlier this month he’s satisfied that the bank has in the meantime allocated as many resources to its anti-money laundering work “as is physically possible.”

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The fresh escalation in the long-running Sino-U.S. trade dispute prompted a sharp selloff in Chinese markets last week with the yuan and banking and tech stocks hit particularly hard though some sectors, like farming, managed to outperform.
The market rout came after U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports and Beijing retaliated with tariffs of its own. As result, the yuan is now off 2.5% so far this month.

A weaker currency and trade uncertainties have intensified outflows of foreign funds from the A-share market since April.
Foreign investors are a key part of the country's equities market, holding a total of 1.68 trillion yuan ($244.41 billion) worth of A-shares as of end-March, up from 1.15 trillion yuan at end-2018, according to latest PBOC data. 
As of May 17, foreign investors via the Stock Connect had sold about 36 billion yuan worth of mainland shares in May, snapping a five-month buying streak.

""If there is no resolution to the trade dispute, the banks may need to increase lending while trying to maintain asset quality especially after the weak April data,"" strategists at Jefferies said in a note. 
Chinese banks cut back new lending in April after a record first quarter that sparked fears of more bad loans, but analysts say the central bank will have to sustain policy support through the year.

China's information technology and telecommunications firms, which are heavily reliant on the global supply chain and hence seen as vulnerable to trade tensions, have seen a major correction since April.

Firms heavily exposed to overseas markets also saw their share prices sinking, in particular electronics firms. 
Chinese video surveillance products supplier Hangzhou Hikvision, which derived 30% of its 2018 revenue from overseas operations, tumbled about 25% from a 10-month high hit on April 2.

Shares in the social media and gaming giant remained on the back foot after it reported a miss on first-quarter revenue and signs of slowing growth in advertising sales, in its latest earnings report last Wednesday.
Sales growth was 16%, the slowest pace since it went public in 2004. Net income recorded a 17% rise, which was better than expected, but the figure was helped by a one-off gain of more than $1.5 billion from the expanding valuations of investments in finance and gaming companies.
The Hang Seng Index was down 0.6% amid news that Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has now suspended some business with Huawei and all Huawei-made phones will immediately lose access to updates to the Android operating system, the world’s most popular smartphone software.
The news sent Chinese and Hong Kong stocks lower as traders are increasingly concerned that the trade war would drag on and further impact the Chinese economy."
329,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 12:35AM ET</span>",Trade uncertainty darkens U.S. small caps outlook,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of smaller publicly listed U.S. companies have fallen more on recent U.S.-China trade tensions than larger corporations and could face an even rougher road as the year wears on unless the prospects for economic growth improve. 
Wall Street has been forecasting a return to growth for the S&P 600 index of small cap stocks in the second half of 2019, but an intensifying trade battle between the world's two biggest economies puts these hopes into doubt.
Because they depend less on overseas sales than bigger companies, some investors say small caps may be less vulnerable in a trade war situation. 
But if rising tariffs boost import prices to the extent that it slows U.S. economic growth, then smaller companies, which often have less financial cushion than big multinationals, could be badly hurt. And since many U.S. companies use overseas suppliers, tariff hikes could make imported goods too pricey. 
""Because they have more domestic sales it doesn't mean they're totally insulated,"" said Jill Carey Hall, U.S. strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). ""If we don't get a resolution on trade, you don't necessarily want to own small caps. They tend to fare more poorly in risk-off environments.""
Since U.S. President Donald Trump's May 5 tweets about raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% the S&P 600 has fallen 5.4% and the Russell 2000 small cap index has declined 4.9% compared with the benchmark S&P 500's 2.9% drop.
(GRAPHIC: Small caps vs S&P 500 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2LOW5Y3)
One problem is that companies depending on imports for inventory had no time to stock up in the days between Trump's tweet and the actual tariff hike, started May 10.
And if the United States fulfills its threat to slap 25% tariffs on another $300 billion of goods that China sells here, that would add to the pressure. 
Wall Street is already expecting a first-half earnings recession for the S&P 600 index of small cap stocks.
The average expectation is for a first-quarter earnings per share decline of 18% followed by a 9% second-quarter decline, according to I/B/E/S data collected by Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio. 
""This will be the worst reporting season for small caps since 2009,"" said Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis, referring to first-quarter results.
Looking forward, analysts expect third-quarter EPS growth of 6.9% for the S&P 600 and 23.3% growth for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv's Aurelio. 
But Wall Street may be too optimistic about the second half of the year, especially if the U.S.-China trade dispute is not resolved, according to DeSanctis, whose firm is predicting a prolonged trade battle.
""For small caps to pick up and resume their outperformance we need to see better trends in the economic data in the second half, which would lead to better earnings growth in the third and fourth quarter, which the Street is expecting,"" he said.
In fact, traders in the bond market and fed funds futures are making bets that imply the exact opposite - that U.S. economic growth will weaken.
""There's definitely a higher probability today that things aren't going to get better in the second half,"" said DeSanctis. 
For growth to improve, U.S. consumer spending needs to stay strong, according to DeSanctis, who says the consumer would need to offset weakness in capital spending arising from corporate uncertainty over international trade. 
To be sure, the labor market is still strong and wages are still growing. But that may not be enough. 
""That's important people do have money in their pocket to spend,"" said DeSanctis, but he said small caps would struggle if tariffs inflate the price of consumer goods. 

""If costs are really going to start to escalate, people are going to be far more concerned about their spending patterns,"" he said.

330,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>",Top U.S. Tech Companies Begin to Cut Off Vital Huawei Supplies,"(Bloomberg) -- Top U.S. corporations from chipmakers to Google have frozen the supply of critical software and components to Huawei Technologies Co., complying with a Trump administration crackdown that threatens to choke off China’s largest technology company.
Chipmakers including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.,  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX). and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc. have told their employees they will not supply Huawei till further notice, according to people familiar with their actions. And Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google cut off the supply of hardware and some software services to the Chinese giant, another person familiar said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters.
The moves, which had been anticipated, hamstring the world’s largest provider of networking gear and No. 2 smartphone vendor. The Trump administration on Friday blacklisted Huawei -- which it accuses of aiding Beijing in espionage -- and threatened to cut it off from the U.S. software and semiconductors it needs to make its products. Blocking the sale to Huawei of critical components could also disrupt the businesses of American chip giants like Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and retard the rollout of critical 5G wireless networks worldwide -- including in China. That in turn could hurt U.S. companies that are increasingly reliant on the world’s second largest economy for growth.
If fully implemented, the Trump administration action could have ripple effects across the global semiconductor industry. Intel is the main supplier of server chips to the Chinese company, Qualcomm provides it with processors and modems for many of its smartphones, Xilinx sells programmable chips used in networking and Broadcom is a supplier of switching chips, another key component in some types of networking machinery. Representatives for the chipmakers declined to comment.
Huawei “is heavily dependent on U.S. semiconductor products and would be seriously crippled without supply of key U.S. components,” said Ryan Koontz, an analyst with Rosenblatt Securities Inc. The U.S. ban “may cause China to delay its 5G network build until the ban is lifted, having an impact on many global component suppliers.”
The ban’s commencement walloped shares of Asian tech supply chain companies Monday. Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. was again the worst performer on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, while Luxshare Precision Industry Co. dived as much as 9.8% in Shenzhen.
To be sure, Huawei is said to have stockpiled enough chips and other vital components to keep its business running for at least three months. It’s been preparing for such an eventuality since at least the middle of 2018, hoarding components while designing its own chips, people familiar with the matter said. But its executives believe their company has become a bargaining chip in ongoing U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations, and that they will be able to resume buying from American suppliers if a trade deal is reached, they said.
The American companies’ moves are likely to escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing, elevating fears that President Donald Trump’s goal is to contain China, triggering a protracted cold war between the world’s biggest economies. In addition to a trade fight that has rattled global markets for months, the U.S. has pressured both allies and foes to avoid using Huawei for 5G networks that will form the backbone of the modern economy.
“The extreme scenario of Huawei’s telecom network unit failing would set China back many years and might even be viewed as an act of war by China,” Koontz wrote. “Such a failure would have massive global telecom market implications.”
The American clampdown also deals a direct blow to Huawei’s fast-growing mobile devices division. Huawei will only be able to access the public version of Google’s Android mobile operating system, the world’s most popular smartphone software. It won’t be able to offer proprietary apps and services from Maps and search to Gmail, said the person, who requested anonymity speaking about a private matter. That will severely curtail the sale of Huawei smartphones abroad, though it’s unclear when those apps -- which are popular mainly outside of China -- will become unavailable.
Huawei, the world’s largest smartphone brand after Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., was one of a select few global hardware partners to receive early access to the latest Android software and features from Google. Outside of China, those ties are critical for the search giant to spread its consumer apps and bolster its mobile ads business.
The Chinese company will still have access to app and security updates that come with the open-source version of Android. Reuters reported the move earlier. “We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,” a Google representative said, without elaborating.

331,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2019 12:25AM ET</span>",South Korea automakers' shares rise on hope of U.S. tariff exemption,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean automakers saw their shares rise on Monday on optimism they would be exempt from import tariffs on vehicles the United States deems a threat to national security, after the U.S. president said a revised trade deal could address concerns.
Hyundai Motor Co and affiliate Kia Motors Corp shares were both up nearly 3% in morning trade.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared some imported vehicles and vehicle parts posed a national security threat. But he delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose import tariffs to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.
He also said a U.S.-South Korea bilateral trade deal, revised last year and in which Seoul made auto sector concessions, ""could help to address the threatened impairment of national security"".
""We hope that Korea would not make the list of countries subject to tariffs, but it is premature to make a prediction,"" South Korea's finance minister, Hong Nam-ki, told reporters after a government meeting on Monday.
""The government will not lay back and will continue all-out efforts to persuade the United States not to put Korea on the list,"" Hong said.
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp, which said in March it would invest $13 billion in U.S. operations through 2021, called the U.S. declaration ""a major set-back for American consumers, workers and the auto industry"" and said it sent the message ""our investments are not welcomed"".
Toyota and Honda Motor Co Ltd shares were traded nearly flat on Monday. Nissan Motor Co Ltd saw its shares fall 1.6%.

Nissan exports roughly 31% of Japan-made cars to the United States compared with 22% at Toyota, Moody's estimated last year. Honda has the lowest ratio among the three, Moody's said.

The firm expects to withdraw its suspended shares on June 11, according to a statement to the exchange on Sunday. Shareholders have approved a plan to replace their holdings with stock in a special purpose vehicle that could allow them to cash-out if the company is able to re-float on a mainland exchange, although it warned that such a listing isn’t certain.
The unit of Hanergy Mobile Energy Holding Group Ltd., which hasn’t traded for four years, saw its shares plunge abruptly in May 2015 after a precipitous run-up that drew the attention of short sellers and the market regulator. Once the world’s biggest solar company with a value that topped  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)., its market cap peaked at about $40 billion before a one-day collapse erased almost half that amid questions over its finances, the revenue it derived from its parent and the trading patterns around its stock.
The firm became emblematic of the speculative froth that can plague Chinese stocks. The tale of its boom-and-bust included founder and former chairman Li Hejun, briefly China’s richest man, getting barred from serving as a director of any company in Hong Kong for eight years, after a court ruled he was involved in misconduct related to the running of the former solar giant. Li resigned from the Beijing-based parent’s board earlier this year.
Preparatory work on its mainland listing should be completed within six months after going private, the firm said in an email. The reorganization comes as Hanergy closed in on the Hong Kong exchange’s end-July deadline to resume shares, which the company said it would probably not be able to meet.

The Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component were down 0.8% and 2.1% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was also down 0.6%.
The fall in Chinese stocks came after CNBC reported that further trade talks between Beijing and Washington are now being put on hold.
The news came after U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration imposed sanctions on Chinese giant telecom company Huawei. U.S.-based firms are now required to have a license if they want to conduct business with the Chinese company.
On Sunday, Reuters reported that Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has now suspended some business with Huawei and all Huawei-made phones will immediately lose access to updates to the Android operating system, the world’s most popular smartphone software. Newer Huawei smartphones coming out in the future will lose access to the Google Play Store and Gmail app, according to the report.
The company’s chief executive officer and founder Ren Zhengfei said he does not expect the sanction to affect the company too much because it has been preparing for it since last year.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.4% after data showing that Japan's first quarter GDP came in at 2.1%, confounding expectations for a contraction of 0.2%. However, traders remained cautious as the expansion was mostly due to imports declining faster than exports, likely reflecting weak domestic demand.
South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.7% higher.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 climbed after a surprise election victory for incumbent Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

The U.S. has lobbed complaints about Chinese theft of technology as trade tensions mount between the world's two biggest economies. 
An op-ed article in the People's Daily targeted the Section 301 report Washington issued in March 2018, saying the authors fabricated the claim that China stole hundreds of billions of dollars worth of intellectual property from the U.S.
""If the report is based on imagined or selective data, it's a kind of science fiction novel,"" it said.
""Intellectual property rights should be a bridge for innovation and cooperation among countries. In the hands of the U.S. it has become a political tool, a weapon to contain other countries, and a veil for bullying the world.""
China has become a world leader in protecting intellectual property rights, it added.
""China has established a relatively thorough and high-standard legal system for intellectual property, and continuously strengthens the judicial protection of intellectual property,"" the article said.
Many foreign companies willingly engaged in technical cooperation and received generous returns, it added.
""Even if problems involving intellectual property emerge, these can be solved entirely through legal means.""
In January, U.S. federal prosecutors began investigating Chinese telecoms equipment provider Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly attempting to steal technology from American carrier T-Mobile US Inc.
Huawei has pleaded not guilty.

Last week, the U.S. commerce department put Huawei on its so-called ""Entity List"", which prevents U.S.-based companies from selling it components.

335,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",China's Former Top Securities Regulator Under Investigation,"(Bloomberg) -- Liu Shiyu, the former head of China’s securities regulator, is under investigation for suspected law violations and has turned himself in, authorities said on Sunday.
Liu, who remains a senior Communist Party official, is cooperating with the probe, according to a statement from China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. He was chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission for three years before being replaced in January by Yi Huiman.
Several financial regulators have been brought down in the past few years as President Xi Jinping’s administration kept up a crackdown on corruption. Last year, Yao Gang, the former vice chairman of the CSRC, was sentenced to 18 years in jail for taking bribes and insider trading. Xiang Junbo, the ex-chairman of China’s insurance regulator, was found to have taken bribes of 19.4 million yuan ($2.8 million). He pleaded guilty last year.
Early in his tenure at the CSRC, Liu vowed take on the ""crocodiles"" and ""barbarians"" of the market, presaging a clampdown on market manipulation. Under his watch, the regulator stepped up enforcement, sharply increasing the amount of fines it levied.
The CSRC also reduced a backlog of initial public offering applications during Liu’s time in charge. However, two high-profile projects -- China depositary receipts, which would allow global technology companies to issue shares in the country; and the London-Shanghai stock connect, a cross-listing program between China and the U.K. -- failed to materialize while he ran the watchdog.
Liu joined the Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s third-largest lender, in 2014. He had previously been a deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China. Before the PBOC, Liu worked at China Construction Bank Corp. and the nation’s economic reform commission. He holds a master’s degree from the economic management school of Tsinghua University in Beijing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is asking the federal government to investigate if a plan for new subway cars in New York City, designed by a Chinese state-owned firm, could pose a threat to national security.
The move comes after China's CRRC Corp Ltd <, the world's top passenger train maker, was slammed by U.S. lawmakers during a hearing on Thursday to limit its access to U.S. projects amid security fears.
It also comes at a time when the Trump administration has added China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a trade blacklist, citing security risks as the world's two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China's unfair trade practices.
CRRC, The Chinese state-owned company, which won a design contest for new subway cars, plans to install new technology in the New York subway system and government agencies must determine whether this poses any threat to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its commuters, Schumer said in a statement to Reuters.
""Given what we know about how cyberwarfare works, and recent attacks that have hit transportation and infrastructure hubs across the country, the Department of Commerce must... thoroughly check any proposals or work China's CRRC does on behalf of the New York subway system, including our signals, Wi-Fi and more,"" Schumer added.
The company has not won a contract in New York City, which has America's biggest transit system. However, it has won contracts for new subway cars in Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia.
CRRC has also launched a charm campaign in the United States as it seeks to secure a Washington D.C. metro car contract worth over $500 million, after roaring into the American passenger rail market by dramatically underbidding foreign rivals.
Concerns CRRC could soon set its sights on the much more lucrative U.S. freight market and use its railcars to spy on passengers have prompted a series of legislative proposals.

A bipartisan bill unveiled in the U.S. House recently, which mirrors one proposed in the Senate earlier this year, would prevent transit agencies from spending federal dollars on projects awarded to CRRC.

337,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2019 07:05PM ET</span>",Global dividends hit record in first quarter as companies shake off macro worries,"By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Companies around the world paid out a record amount of dividends in the first quarter, data showed on Monday, as they shrugged off worries about slowing economic and earnings growth.
Global dividends rose 7.8% in the first quarter to $263.3 billion, matching last year's growth and pushing the Janus Henderson global dividend index to an all-time high, according to a report by the asset manager on Monday.
The data shows the growing optimism of companies and helps explain equities' continued appeal in the face of global trade tensions and worries about a global economic slowdown.
The escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China has sent chills through global markets over the past few weeks, sending investors to safe-haven assets like government bonds.
""The growth rate is slightly higher than we're expecting for the year as a whole,"" said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at the asset manager.
""Given the volatility at the end of last year and all the concerns multiplying around the world with Brexit and the trade war, that's pretty positive.""
Janus Henderson expects a record $1.43 trillion in payments this year, up 4.2% in headline terms, the report said.
That's substantially lower from the 9.4% rise seen in 2018 and would be the slowest growth since 2016.
Still, that's significantly higher than government bond yields. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields were around 2.4%, while Germany's Bund yields headed back towards 2-1/2 year lows on Friday. 
World stocks markets have moved in step with higher dividend payouts over the past decade or so, Citi's global strategy team said in a recent note.
The bank said global stocks rose 7% per year since 2010, the same pace as global dividend growth.
Part of the reason for the big first quarter jump was special dividend payouts, from BHP Group , Akzo Nobel and Novartis among others, which offset the impact of the higher U.S. dollar, the Janus Henderson report said.
By sector, pharmaceutical companies offered the biggest payouts in the quarter, contributing $1 in every $8 paid globally due to special dividends from Novartis and Roche.
EMERGING FALLING
Emerging markets was the only area where companies cut their dividend payouts - by 6.1% to $16.2 billion and Asia Pacific saw the biggest growth of 14.7% to $18.1 billion, followed by the UK with 10.5% growth to $20.7 billion.
European, excluding UK, dividends have shown the slowest growth since 2009, increasing at one third of the pace of the rest of the world, but the first quarter total was still a record of $40 billion, the report said.
U.S. payouts rose 8.3% to a record $122.5 billion, with 90% of companies in the asset manager's index increasing their payouts and banks making the strongest contribution to growth.
U.S. banking dividends jumped by a quarter, adding $1.9 billion year-on-year, which Lofthouse said reflected the significant improvement in balance sheets and better economic growth.
Most North American companies pay dividends each quarter, unlike other parts of the world, which meant that the region accounted for three-fifths of the global first quarter total.

340,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",Modi’s jobs deficit: J&J’s largest India plant idle three years after completion,"By Zeba Siddiqui and Aditya Kalra
PENJERLA/NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - It was supposed to be Johnson & Johnson's biggest manufacturing plant in India. It was to eventually employ at least 1,500 people and help bring development to a rural area near Hyderabad in southern India.
Yet, three years after the U.S. healthcare company completed construction of production facilities for cosmetics and baby products on the 47-acre site, they stand idle.
Two sources familiar with J&J's operations in India and one state government official told Reuters production at the plant, at Penjerla in Telangana state, never began because of a slowing in the growth in demand for the products.
One of them said that demand didn’t rise as expected because of two shock policy moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a late 2016 ban on then circulating high-value currency notes, and the nationwide introduction of a goods and services tax (GST) in 2017.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) spokespeople in its Mumbai operations in India and at its global headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, declined to respond to a list of questions from Reuters.
Modi's office did not respond to a call and an email with questions.
Aimed at rooting out corruption and streamlining the tax system, the double whammy of ‘demonetization’ and GST – were two of Modi’s signature policy moves. But instead of encouraging economic activity as intended, they did the opposite, at least in 2016-2018, by sapping consumer demand, according to some economists. 
Many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, complained publicly – some in their financial statements - that they suffered a drop off in orders. The suspended J&J project stands as one of the most vivid examples of the impact on the broader investment picture.
In the first month after demonetization, some business surveys showed that sales of products such as shampoos and soap fell more than 20 percent.
Lack of jobs growth and a farm-income crisis because of low crop prices have hurt Modi in the current general election, according to several political strategists.
Still, Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are expected by many of the strategists to be in a position to get a second term – probably with support of some other parties - when votes are counted on Thursday, partly because of his strong stance on national security issues.
BIG INVESTMENTS, GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
A range of Modi's business policies, such as capping prices of medical devices, forcing tech companies to store more data locally and stricter e-commerce regulations have in the past two years hurt plans of American multinationals such as J&J, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart-owned Flipkart. 
The groundbreaking of the J&J facility in Penjerla, its third in the country, was carried out with much fanfare in 2014, attended by Telangana state’s Chief Minister Chandrashekar Rao, who hailed the foreign investment as a big win for local communities. A document dated April 2017 that lists products the company planned to make at the facility, submitted to the Telangana government and reviewed by Reuters, names baby oil, baby shampoo, baby lotion, baby hair oil, face wash and creams. 
Shaukat Ali, running a tea shop under a bamboo stall on barren land outside the plant, said local workers check in routinely for possible vacancies at the J&J site, but nothing has come up in years.
At the local pollution control board office, the member secretary Satyanarayana Reddy said the J&J plant had all the required approvals and he was not sure why it hadn’t started production.
“It is unusual for such a big plant to stay idle for so long,” he said. “But there is no problem from our side.”
Chandrasekhar Babu, an additional director at the Telangana industries department, said a J&J company official told him the plant hadn't started due to lack of demand.
GST and demonetization were two key reasons the plan didn’t kick off, one of the sources said, adding that lack of consumer demand since then dented company's plans.
The second source familiar with J&J's plans said the company miscalculated Indian market demand.
On a recent visit by a Reuters reporter to the J&J plant, plush, furnished conference rooms and cubicles sat inactive; M. Sairam, who said he was the site manager, told Reuters production areas with machines were idle too. 
PLANNED FURTHER EXPANSION 
Local officials had hoped the initial J&J plant would be only the beginning. After the groundbreaking in 2014, Pradeep Chandra, who was Telangana's special chief secretary of industries, told Business Today magazine that ""based on the extent of land (J&J) have acquired we believe that they are looking at much larger expansion here.""
Local media reports at the time said the J&J facility would employ some 1,500 people.
A J&J official, who was not identified by name, was reported subsequently in December 2016 in India's Business Standard assaying that the $85 million plant would be operational by 2018 after it had overcome procedural delays. The official was quoted as saying the company had earmarked an additional $100 million for expansion.
Vikas Srivastava, the managing director of J&J Consumer(India), who was at the 2014 groundbreaking, did not respond to calls for comment. 
Reuters also talked to two workers outside a sprawling Procter & Gamble facility making detergents and diapers, which is next to the J&J plant. They said they were part of the P&G plant's production team and the plant had been running below capacity. 
A P&G spokesperson denied that, saying the plant was ""operating at full capacity in line with our business plans"". ""India is a priority market for P&G globally and in recent quarters, P&G’s business in India has registered strong double-digit growth consistently,"" the company said. 
The weak rural economy, where most Indians work, has also hurt growth in sales of basic items such as detergents and shampoo in the past year. 
Hindustan  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) Ltd, an industry bellwether that would compete with the likes of J&J and P&G in some categories, said its volume growth shrank to 7 percent in the quarter ended March 31, down from double-digit growth in the previous five quarters. 

The company warned that the daily consumer goods segment in India was ""recession resistant ... not recession proof.""

(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies' founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei said on Saturday the growth of the Chinese tech giant ""may slow, but only slightly"" due to recent U.S. restrictions.
In remarks to the Japanese press and reported https://s.nikkei.com/2VMJSaT by Nikkei Asian Review, Ren reiterated that the Chinese telecom equipment maker has not violated any law. 
""It is expected that Huawei's growth may slow, but only slightly,"" Ren told Japanese media in his first official comments after the U.S. restrictions, adding that the company's annual revenue growth may undershoot 20%.
On Thursday, Washington put Huawei, one of China's biggest and most successful companies, on a trade blacklist that could make it extremely difficult for Huawei to do business with U.S. companies, a decision slammed by China, which said it will take steps to protect its companies.
The developments surrounding Huawei come at a time of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and amid concerns from the United States that Huawei's smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.
A similar U.S. ban on China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) had almost crippled business for the smaller Huawei rival early last year before the curb was lifted.
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it may soon scale back restrictions on Huawei.
Ren said the company was prepared for such a step and that Huawei would be ""fine"" even if U.S. smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other American suppliers would not sell chips to the company.
Huawei's chip arm HiSilicon said on Friday it has long been prepared for the scenario that it could be banned from purchasing U.S. chips and technology, and is able to ensure steady supply of most products.
The Huawei founder said that the company will not be taking instructions from the U.S. government. 
""We will not change our management at the request of the U.S. or accept monitoring, as ZTE has done,"" he said.
In January, U.S. prosecutors unsealed an indictment accusing the Chinese company of engaging in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and to move money out of the country via the international banking system.
Ren's daughter, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December in connection with the indictment. Meng, who was released on bail, remains in Vancouver, and is fighting extradition. She has maintained her innocence.

Ren has previously said his daughter's arrest was politically motivated.

Globalia owns the Air Europa carrier and companies in the tourism sector, including hotel operators and travel services such as Travelplan and Groundforce. 
The Brazilian minister said the decision by Globalia to start air transportation services in Brazil followed a regulatory change allowing foreign companies to control airliners in the country, something not previously possible.
""It is the first airline to decide to operate in Brazil after the new legislation. It will hire people locally and will increase competition in the sector,"" said Freitas in his tweet.
Grupo Globalia did not return a request for comment on Saturday. 

The new legislation allowing foreign ownership of air carriers still needs a final nod of approval from the Brazilian Congress, something expected to happen in the coming week.

Xiao's appointment came after the incumbent director of the State Administration for Market Regulation, Zhang Mao, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. 
Formerly the president of the Aluminium Corporation of China, Xiao was appointed head of the State-Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in 2016, presiding over an ambitious period of reform for China's state-owned sector.
China has sought to slim down its state sector with the aim of creating a smaller number of ""world-class"" firms capable of competing internationally, but analysts say the effort to create more flexible management and ownership structures has put SASAC's long-term future as a regulator in doubt.
The State Administration for Market Regulation was formed last year after a wide-ranging overhaul of government departments, and is responsible for areas such as intellectual property and market competition.

The criteria will apply by end-June to the Italian central bank's roughly 8 billion euros ($8.9 billion) in shareholdings and later be extended to its 1 billion euros in corporate bond holdings, the bank said in a statement posted on its web site.
The criteria exclude firms that do not adopt U.N. principles on human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.
The Bank of Italy is a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System, a global financial group which treats climate change as a threat to financial stability.
An independent adviser will help the Bank of Italy to spot the best-in-class companies in terms of environmental, social and governance standards, the bank said.
As a result of the new criteria, greenhouse gas emissions from companies within its portfolio will fall 23%, and energy and water consumption will drop 30% and 17% respectively.

The central bank did not give a timeframe for when the new investment criteria would apply to corporate bond holdings.

By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it may soon scale back restrictions on Huawei Technologies after this week's blacklisting would have made it nearly impossible for the Chinese company to service its existing customers. 
The Commerce Department, which had effectively halted Huawei's ability to buy American-made parts and components, is considering issuing a temporary general license to ""prevent the interruption of existing network operations and equipment,"" a spokeswoman said.
Potential beneficiaries of the license could, for example, include internet access and mobile phone service providers in thinly populated places such as Wyoming and eastern Oregon that purchased network equipment from Huawei in recent years.
In effect, the Commerce Department would allow Huawei to purchase U.S. goods so it can help existing customers maintain the reliability of networks and equipment, but the Chinese firm still would not be allowed to buy American parts and components to manufacture new products.
The potential rule roll back suggests changes to Huawei's supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences. 
The blacklisting, officially known as placing Huawei on the Commerce Department's entity list, was one or two efforts by the Trump administration this week allegedly made in an attempt to thwart national security risks. In an executive order, President Donald Trump also effectively barred the use of its equipment in U.S. telecom networks.
The United States believes Huawei's smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.
The latest Commerce move comes as China has struck a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the United States, suggesting talks between the world's two largest economies would be meaningless unless Washington changed course.
A spokesman for Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Out of $70 billion Huawei spent buying components in 2018, some $11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). If the Commerce Department issues the license, U.S. suppliers would still need separate licenses to conduct new business with Huawei, which would be extremely difficult to obtain, the spokeswoman said. 
The temporary general license would last for 90 days, she said, and would be posted in the Federal Register, just as the rule adding Huawei to the entity list will be published in the government publication on Tuesday.
""The goal is to prevent collateral harm on non-Huawei entities that use their equipment,"" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official.
The entity listing bans Huawei and 68 affiliates in 26 countries from buying American-made goods and technology without licenses that would likely be denied.
The entities list identifies companies believed to be involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.
In a final rule posted on Thursday, the government tied Huawei's entity listing to a criminal case pending against the company in Brooklyn, New York.
U.S. prosecutors unsealed the indictment in January accusing the company of engaging in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and to move money out of the country via the international banking system. 
Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the company's founder, was arrested in Canada in December in connection with the indictment, a move that has led to a three-way diplomatic crisis involving the U.S., China and Canada.
Meng, who was released on bail, remains in Vancouver, and is fighting extradition. She has maintained her innocence, and Huawei has entered a plea of not guilty in New York.

Trump injected other considerations into the criminal case after Meng's arrest when he told Reuters he would intervene if it helped close a trade deal.

The spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said the changes will ensure that the simulator experience is representative across different flight conditions and will improve the simulation of force loads on the manual trim wheel that helps control the airplane.
The comments came after the New York Times on Friday reported that Boeing recently discovered that the flight simulators airlines use to train pilots could not adequately replicate conditions that played a role in the 737 MAX crashes.
""Boeing is working closely with the device manufacturers and regulators on these changes and improvements, and to ensure that customer training is not disrupted,"" Johndroe said.
Although the simulators are not built by Boeing, the planemaker does provide the underlying information on which they are designed and built, the New York Times said.
The 737 MAX was grounded in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board just five months after a similar crash of a Lion Air flight of a 737 MAX killed 189 people.

On Thursday, Boeing said it had completed a software update for its 737 MAX jets and that is also submitting a plan on pilot training to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

347,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>","U.S. lifts tariffs on Canadian, Mexican metals in boost for trade pact","By David Lawder and Steve Scherer
WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The United States struck deals on Friday to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico, the three governments said, removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new North American trade pact.
The separate agreements, which will not impose U.S. quotas on Canadian and Mexican metals shipments, will also eliminate Mexican and Canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range of U.S. products, including pork, beef and bourbon.
The United States and Canada said their agreement will be implemented by Sunday afternoon, and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped steel and aluminum from China and other countries from entering the U.S. market via Canada.
President Donald Trump had imposed the global ""Section 232"" tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum in March 2018 on national security grounds, invoking a 1962 Cold War-era trade law.
Both Canada and Mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the United States, and challenged the tariffs before the World Trade Organization.
""This is just pure good news for Canadians,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters after announcing the deal to workers at Stelco Holdings Inc's steel mill in Hamilton, Ontario.
Stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news, while top U.S. steelmaker  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) fell 3.1 percent and U.S. Steel Corp, which had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs, fell 1.2 percent.
Spokesmen for U.S. Steel and Nucor, which had advocated for maintaining strong tariff protections, could not be reached for comment. 
TRADE DEAL VOTE
The metals tariffs were a major irritant for Canada and Mexico and had caused them to halt progress toward ratification the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trilateral trade deal to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. lawmakers with constituents suffering from Canadian and Mexican retaliation, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, also said they would not consider a USMCA vote with the tariffs in place.
After the deal, Grassley tweeted: ""Thank u Mr President for really helping the farmers of Iowa w this important step in USMCA. w lifting metal tariffs @realdonaldtrump just proved he can deliver on negotiations. China ought to take note/start dealing in good faith & take Pres Trump seriously.""
Trudeau said Canada would now work with the United States on the timing of USMCA ratification and said he was optimistic Canada would be ""be able to move forward well in the coming weeks"". 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said he would meet with Trudeau in Ottawa on May 30 to discuss ""advancing"" ratification.
Several U.S. Democrats applauded removal of the tariffs, but said USMCA was not yet ready for their support.
""When it comes to the new agreement, House Democrats continue to have a number of substantial concerns related to labor, environment, enforcement, and access to affordable medicines provisions. Those issues still need to be remedied,"" said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal.
Neal added that the deal does not address global steel overcapacity and criticized Trump's handling of trade negotiations with China, which deteriorated significantly in the last two weeks. 
Trump, speaking to realtors in Washington, called the pact ""a fantastic deal for our country"" and said Congress would hopefully approve the USMCA quickly. ""Then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will make our economy even more successful than it already is.""
Jesus Seade, Mexico's deputy foreign minister for North America, said the deal ""measurably increases the probability"" the USMCA will be approved before the U.S. Congress' summer break in August. Some U.S. lawmakers say passage would become more difficult after the recess due to budget battles expected in the fall and increased 2020 presidential campaign activity.
TRANSSHIPMENTS, SURGES
Trump's metals tariffs have been largely aimed at keeping excess production from China out of the U.S. market, and the deal includes a new monitoring mechanism aimed at preventing steel and aluminum from China and other countries from being transshipped through Canada and Mexico to the United States.
But the U.S. Trade Representative's office also said the deal allows it to reimpose tariffs in the event of ""surges"" in imports of specific steel products. If tariffs are reimposed, retaliation would be limited to the steel and aluminum sectors.
Carmakers, which have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher U.S. costs due to the tariffs, praised the deal and said it brought USMCA passage a big step closer.
""While many automakers already source the vast majority of their steel and aluminum domestically, tariffs drive those prices up which decreases investment and harms auto workers and ultimately consumers,"" said the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing most major brands including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corp Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and others.

The National Pork Producers Council, which says retaliatory tariffs have cost its members $12 per animal, or a total of $1.5 billion, also expressed relief at the end of ""a trade dispute that has placed enormous financial strain on American pork producers.""

348,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 07:40PM ET</span>",California utility in big 2015 gas leak had failed to probe leaks for decades,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - The California utility responsible for a massive, 4-month-long gas leak near Los Angeles in 2015 failed to investigate dozens of leaks over decades at the natural gas storage facility, according to a state report released on Friday.
The long-awaited report found that groundwater corroded a 7-inch well casing and made it to rupture, causing the leak. Because Southern (NYSE:SO) California Gas, a unit of  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE), had failed to investigate and analyze leaks since the 1970s, the consequences of such corrosion were not understood, leading to the 2015 incident, the report found.
The report was commissioned by two state regulatory agencies, the California Public Utilities Commission and the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, and conducted by a third party, Blade Energy Partners.
The agencies said the report would help inform their own investigations, which are expected to be completed this year. Those probes could ultimately result in penalties against the company, according to the CPUC.
More than 60 casing leaks occurred since the 1970s at the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility and were not investigated, the report found. Blade said it found integrity issues in 40 percent of the 124 storage wells it studied for the report.
SoCalGas, as the utility is known, said it was in compliance with natural gas storage regulations in place at the time. Updated well safety regulations since 2015 largely address the causes of the leak, the report said. 
""The leak was an industry changing event resulting in the development and implementation of enhanced safety regulations and practices,"" the utility said in a statement.
Beginning in October 2015, the faulty well spewed more than 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere until it was sealed 111 days later in February 2016. The leaked gas was enough to supply about 20 million U.S. homes for a day.
The incident sparked outcry and health worries in nearby communities, becoming a public relations nightmare for the utility. More than 8,000 households and two schools were relocated during the leak.
SoCalGas still faces 394 lawsuits including 48,500 plaintiffs.
State regulators limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into the Aliso Canyon facility and said the utility can only withdraw gas when other options are unavailable.
Many residents and government officials want SoCalGas to close the facility. 

State Senator Henry Stern, who represents communities surrounding Aliso Canyon, called the company ""careless"" and the report ""alarming.""

By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is your college-bound child a good credit risk?
Consider this very carefully before cosigning a private student loan.
Some 49% of private student loan cosigners over age 50 end up paying some of that debt, according to data released in May by the AARP Public Policy Institute. Half of them, mainly parents and grandparents of the borrowers, voluntarily do so to help out. But the rest pay only when the student defaults.
""Some people cosign and don't realize that they will be responsible ultimately if student borrower does not pay,"" said Lori Trawinski, director of banking and finance at the AARP Public Policy Institute.
The risks go beyond just having to pay bills. One missed payment will tank credit scores of both the borrower and cosigners. Miss more and you go into collections, which will damage all of your finances for years to come.
It is very easy for months to pass in default if the student is trying to hide what is going on, said Ken Ruggiero, president and chief executive of Ascent Funding, a private student lender based in San Diego.
""There is confusion about who owes the bill. Meanwhile, the calendar is ticking by,"" Ruggiero said.
LOAN OPTIONS
Private student loans make up about $120 billion of the $1.5 trillion in U.S. student loan debt, according to the AARP study. Almost all are cosigned loans, because students rarely have the credit history or income to qualify on their own. 
At College Ave Student Loans, which has issued $350 million in private loans, for instance, 96% of its undergraduate loans are cosigned.
Families typically turn to private loans to cover shortfalls after they exhaust the limits of federal loans for students as well as their savings.
Parents can also get federal Parent PLUS loans, which come with low interest rates, very few restrictions, and some income-based repayment options. But, according to AARP's data, more families turn to cosigning private loans in students' names.
""Both are pretty poor products in terms of protections and options,"" said Adam Minsky, an attorney who focuses on helping student loan borrowers in both Massachusetts and New York. That said, he recommends a Parent PLUS loan over cosigning a child's student loan.
Interest rates are a key factor. The 2018 rate for PLUS loans was 7.6%, while private loans vary. At Ascent, which has about $50 million in loans to date, variable rates range from 4.23% to 13.23% and fixed options range from 4.98% to 14.16%, depending on your credit history and other factors.
Even Ruggiero said of Parent PLUS loans: ""If you have bad credit, it's a screaming deal.""
Another point to consider before you sign a loan is consumer protection. Borrowers can discharge a federal loan in case of a disability or death, Minsky said. Private loans do not offer that option, and parents could be on the hook, even if their child passes away.
Cosigners can ask to be taken off a private loan if repayment is going well. But the process is not transparent or simple.
""Lenders have total discretion. Even if you meet requirements, they don't have to go through with it,"" said Minsky, who has rarely seen it happen. 
The easiest way to avoid bad loan choices is to pick a school the family can afford.

""We need people to not have to rely on debt to finance education, and we need more options that are cheaper,"" Minsky said.

U.S.-China trade relations soured following President Donald Trump's earlier decision this week to ban U.S. companies from using Huawei telecommunications technology. Beijing hit back, threatening to walk away from trade talks and accusing the U.S. of lacking a sincere desire to end the trade war,
""If there is no real concrete action by the United States, it will be meaningless for you to come and talk,"" said Taoran Notes, a social media account tied to the Economic Daily, a state-run newspaper. ""It is better to suspend the consultation completely and return to the normal working track.""

Baidu lost 18.14% on the week and have slumped 22.81% this month.
Tech stocks were also on the back foot as semis plunged, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), after the graphics chip maker's above-consensus earnings were offset by a lack of full-year guidance and a warning that data-center sales could remain weak. NVIDIA fell 2.28%.

356,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>","Exclusive: FBI targets Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, GE, Philips in Brazil graft case - sources","By Brad Brooks
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The U.S. FBI is investigating corporate giants Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and Philips for allegedly paying kickbacks as part of a scheme involving medical equipment sales in Brazil, two Brazilian investigators have told Reuters.
Brazilian prosecutors suspect the companies channeled illegal payoffs to government officials to secure contracts with public health programs across the South American country over the past two decades.
Brazilian authorities say more than 20 companies may have been part of a ""cartel"" that paid bribes and charged the government inflated prices for medical gear such as magnetic resonance imaging machines and prosthetics. 
The four multinational companies, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $600 billion at Thursday's market close, are the largest foreign enterprises to be investigated in an unprecedented anti-corruption push in Brazil in recent years.
Big U.S. and European companies found to have engaged in wrongdoing in Brazil could also face heavy fines and other punishment under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Since 1977, that law has made it illegal for American citizens, U.S. companies or foreign companies whose securities are listed in the United States to pay foreign officials to win business. 
Foreign companies are the latest targets of government corruption probes in Brazil. Over the past five years, prosecutors have uncovered pervasive graft in state institutions and private-sector companies seeking to do business with them. 
The sprawling investigations by prosecutors and federal police, including the famed ""Car Wash"" dragnet centered on Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras, have toppled business and political leaders across Latin America.
Authorities say plea-bargain testimonies obtained from suspects alerted them to other possible schemes, including alleged bribes paid by multinationals to obtain public contracts in Brazil. 
'CONSTANTLY SHARING' 
Brazilian federal prosecutor Marisa Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) confirmed in an interview with Reuters that U.S. authorities from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were assisting in the Brazilian medical equipment investigation she helps lead. 
In 2016, U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors jointly negotiated the world's largest-ever compliance penalty, a $3.5 billion fine against Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA for its part in the Car Wash scandal. 
""We are constantly sharing information with the FBI on this (medical equipment) case. They ask for documents and we send them, and they are assisting our investigation in return,"" Ferrari said. In addition, she said, ""We've received a lot of material from the Department of Justice and from the SEC."" 
She declined to name which companies U.S. law enforcement agencies were investigating.
Two Brazilian investigators with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed to Reuters that Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, GE, and Koninklijke Philips NV were being targeted by the FBI for alleged bribery in Brazil. The people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. side of the investigation. 
The FBI would not confirm or deny the existence of any investigations. The SEC, which also investigates FCPA allegations, said by email that it declined to comment. 
Boston-based GE declined to comment on any investigation related to its business in Brazil. It said in an emailed statement, ""We are committed to integrity, compliance and the rule of law in Brazil and every other country in which we do business."" 
Siemens, which is based in Munich, Germany, said in an emailed statement that the company ""is not aware of any FBI investigation of the company related to cartel activity in Brazil."" It said its policy is always to cooperate with law enforcement investigations when they occur. 
Amsterdam-based Philips confirmed in an email that it is under investigation in Brazil. In its 2018 annual report, Philips acknowledged that it ""has also received inquiries from certain US authorities in respect to this matter."" 
In its emailed response to Reuters, Philips said, ""It is not uncommon for US authorities to show an interest in these matters and it is too early to draw any conclusions."" 
New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson said in an emailed response on Friday that in an SEC filing last October it disclosed that the Department of Justice and the SEC ""have made preliminary inquiries to the company"" in regard to a raid by Brazilian federal police on its Sao Paulo offices last year, and that the company is cooperating. 
'TRULY MASSIVE' 
Ferrari, the Brazilian prosecutor, said the medical equipment investigation was in its early stages. Still, she said evidence points to widespread bribery and price gouging by firms looking to tap into Brazil's public healthcare system, one of the world's largest, serving 210 million people.
""Because the Brazilian government's health budget is so huge, this scheme is truly massive,"" Ferrari said. ""This first case is just a tiny sliver of what is to come."" 
In addition to paying kickbacks through intermediaries to secure contracts, some suppliers charged Brazil's government inflated prices - up to eight times the market price - to help cover the cost of their bribes, according to court filings and plea-bargain testimony secured by prosecutors. 
GE's former chief executive for Latin America, Daurio Speranzini, and 22 others were charged last year in the first case stemming from the alleged scheme. 
Prosecutors say that in that case, which focused on Rio de Janeiro state, Brazilian taxpayers were bilked out of at least 600 million reais ($149.38 million) between 2007 and 2018 through padded contracts awarded to crooked medical equipment suppliers.
Lawyers for Speranzini, who left GE in November, said by email that he is innocent.
GE said in a statement on Friday that ""allegations refer to a time period"" when Speranzini was not working for the firm. ""Based on our review, we believe there is no evidence of misconduct or any indication of GE being part of this cartel.""
However, prosecutors cite in court filings the plea-deal testimony of former Rio de Janeiro-state health secretary Cesar Romero as stating that GE was a member of the cartel, which he said was known by its members as the ""International Bidding Club.""
""In fact, from the analysis of evidence collected in wire tapping ... it was possible to see that Daurio Speranzini Junior continued to close spurious contracts with the government,"" prosecutors wrote in requesting the former GE executive's arrest last year. 
Prosecutors allege Speranzini first took part in the cartel as the head of the Philips Healthcare operation in Latin America from 2004 until the end of 2010. A whistleblower told Philips' compliance office about the fraud, and Speranzini was fired after an internal probe, according to the documents. 
He was hired by GE a few months after leaving Philips. Investigators say they have strong evidence that Speranzini continued with the scheme while at GE.

GE declined to comment on Speranzini's hiring or exit from the company.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Friday as continuing trade tensions pulled industrial and tech shares down, and the Dow capped a fourth straight week of losses in its longest weekly losing streak in three years.
While all three major U.S. indexes struggled for direction for much of the session, they turned decisively negative following a report from CNBC that U.S.-China trade negotiations have stalled. 
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq suffered their second successive weekly declines after U.S. stocks failed to fully recover from Monday's steep sell-off. 
""It is not unusual for stocks to weaken at the end of a week,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""The possibility of something weird happening over the weekend leads people to take money off the table as the week comes to a close."" 
China added fuel to the fire of the increasingly rancorous trade war with the United States, striking a more aggressive tone and suggesting further talks could be fruitless unless Washington changes course.
Elsewhere in the multi-front U.S. tariff war, President Donald Trump confirmed he would delay imposing imported auto tariffs by as much as six months, and agreed to lift metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
Trade headlines overshadowed upbeat economic data. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index jumped 5.3% in May to its highest reading in 15 years.
""After earnings season the market seems to shift to these macro factors that are difficult to predict and difficult to trade on,"" Tuz added. ""You see more whipsawing in the markets in this kind of environment.""
Tariff jitters also dragged on key industrial shares.
Farm equipment maker Deere & Co was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500, dipping 7.7% after cutting its full-year forecast.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co, Textron (NYSE:TXT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Fedex Corp all helped pull the industrial sector 1.1% lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 98.68 points, or 0.38%, to 25,764, the S&P 500 lost 16.79 points, or 0.58%, to 2,859.53 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 81.76 points, or 1.04%, to 7,816.29.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but utilities closed in the red, with industrials and energy seeing the largest percentage losses.
With 460 of S&P 500 companies having posted first-quarter results, 75.2% of which beat analyst expectations, the mostly upbeat first-quarter earnings season is nearly complete.
Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings growth of 1.4%, a significant turnaround from the 2% loss expected on April 1.
Active wear company  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA) gained 7.8% following JP Morgan's upgrade of the stock to ""overweight.""
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc slumped 13.5% after its first quarterly earnings report as a publicly-traded company. 
Shares of Luckin Coffee Inc jumped 19.9% as the Chinese challenger to  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) made its debut. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 101 new lows.

360,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 03:13PM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Tariffs could lead to markdowns in retail shares,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retailer stocks have moved from buoyant to bruised this year and the intensification of the U.S.-China trade war makes them especially vulnerable because consumer products would be targeted in the next round of threatened tariff increases. 
The potential impact of the trade dispute is likely to be a key issue next week when  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohl's and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) are due to report results.
Although it reported better-than-expected earnings, Macy's shares slipped this week after it said the latest tariffs on Chinese imports by Washington are hitting its furniture business and warned that additional tariffs would affect clothing and other areas.
Late last week, after Washington imposed a tariff rate increase to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered his trade chief to begin the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, which would subject about $300 billion worth of Chinese imports to tariffs. 
The proposed list of products subject to possible U.S. tariffs would cover nearly every consumer product such as clothing, shoes and lawnmowers. (Graphic: Value of US tariffs proposed and imposed May 15, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2W2ghcJ) 
The S&P 1500 Retailing index had been outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 this year as the market bounced back from a December selloff and optimism grew that the United States and China may soon come to a trade agreement. 
But the index has fallen more than the broader market in recent weeks as optimism on the trade front has eroded. Since April 30, the retailing index is down about 3.4%, compared with about a 2.5% decline in the S&P 500. 
""There's already been an impact. The question is how much more of an impact is it going to be. Combined with slugglish sales, it's not a good combination for sentiment in anything retail right now,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
Retailers have been struggling from the tightening grip of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and, more recently, investors have worried that wage pressures could become a bigger risk for the group. (Graphic: Retailers under pressure, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2WQpeD4) 
U.S. government data this week seemed to add to the concerns. U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in April as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and other goods.
The results from retailers in the coming days round out an earnings season that has been mostly better than expected. First-quarter S&P 500 earnings now are expected to have risen 1.4% from a year ago versus a 2.0% decline estimated at the start of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
That has eased worries that the S&P 500 would have a ""profit recession"" of at least two straight quarters of declining earnings this year, but the latest developments on the trade front only further cloud the earnings outlook for retailers and other companies. 
""It's the biggest macro wild card for the market,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Troy, Michigan.
So far, there has only been limited impact in the retail space from tariffs, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts. 
""We see food and discount retailers as largely insulated from the recent tariff increase to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese imports,"" they wrote in a note on Thursday.
In the event of additional tariffs, retailers may need to modestly raise prices - roughly 1% to 3% - to fully offset the gross profit impact from tariffs, they added.
At the very least, the tariffs add to complications for retailers.
""At the heart of it, it's a rising input cost,"" said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura Instinet in New York. 

""Personally, I don't think anyone has the ability to raise prices anymore. If the tariffs are maintained, depending on the degree of the cost inflation and their ability to push back, this can be anywhere from margin eroding to business destroying.""

361,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 02:48PM ET</span>",Trump declares some auto imports pose national security threat,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday declared that some imported vehicles and parts pose a national security threat but delayed a decision for as long as six months on whether to impose tariffs to allow for more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.
The unprecedented designation of foreign vehicles imported to the United States from some of its closest allies sparked anger from automakers, dealers and foreign governments after a White House document hinted it would seek voluntary export quotas on autos from U.S. trading partners.
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said on Twitter that ""we completely reject the notion that our car exports are a national security threat. The EU is prepared to negotiate a limited trade agreement (including) cars, but not WTO-illegal managed trade.""
World Trade Organization rules bar voluntary export restraints and the EU has repeatedly said it would not agree to any quotas on auto exports.
Trump's decision, at least for now, averts what was shaping up to be a new dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's trade disputes around the world, including a trade war with China.
The president had faced a Saturday deadline to make a decision on recommendations by the Commerce Department to protect the U.S. auto industry from imports on national security grounds and imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent.
Trump directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to pursue negotiations with the EU, Japan and any other country he deemed appropriate and report back within 180 days. If no deal is reached, Trump will decide by then ""whether and what further action needs to be taken.""
In a proclamation released Friday, Trump agreed with a Commerce Department study that found some imported cars and trucks are ""weakening our internal economy"" and threaten to harm national security, but it stopped short of naming specific vehicles or parts.
Automakers warned the tariffs cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.
A group representing major German and Asian automakers including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co, called the suggestion some auto imports are a national security risk ""absurd.""
The group added that ""no one in the industry has asked for tariffs or other ‘protection’ from the government.""
""The truth stands: imported autos and auto parts are simply not a national security threat,"" said Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association. ""Using this spurious claim as justification to force our trading partners into new negotiations will only create more uncertainty for America's entire auto industry.""
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), VW, Toyota and others, said the companies remained ""deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.""
The group said that since 2017 automakers have invested $22.8 billion in new and existing facilities in the United States, but ""increased auto tariffs threaten to undo this economic progress. At the end of the day, you can have tariffs or investment, but you can't have both.""
Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, criticized Trump's finding and said his ""petulant threats will only make it less likely our allies will work with us to confront our collective challenges with China and to fix real trade problems.""
A revised U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada signed in November effectively shields existing imports from the two nations to the United States from national security tariffs.
The auto tariffs face strong opposition in Congress, including from many prominent Republicans. The White House has refused to release the auto import study to Congress. 
Trump's proclamation said ""domestic conditions of competition must be improved by reducing imports"" and said a strong U.S. auto sector is vital to U.S. military superiority.
The reports cited statistics that U.S.-owned companies' share of the U.S. automobile market has declined from 67 percent, or 10.5 million units produced and sold in the United States, in 1985, to 22 percent, or 3.7 million units produced and sold in the United States, in 2017.
At the same time, the Commerce Department report stated that imports nearly doubled - from 4.6 million units to 8.3 million units.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Trump that ""successful negotiations could allow American-owned automobile producers to achieve long-term economic viability and increase R&D (research and development) spending to develop cutting-edge technologies that are critical to the defense industry.""
The report called the European Union and Japan ""protected foreign markets"" that ""impose significant barriers to automotive imports from the United States, severely disadvantaging American-owned producers.""

The United States also has barriers to imports, most notably a 25 percent tariff on pickup trucks from outside North America.

362,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",Wall Street Says Investors Are Missing Huge Huawei Trade Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- Global equity investors are likely underestimating what may be immense damage across a variety of industries triggered by the U.S.-China trade dispute, particularly involving the latest Huawei Technologies Co. escalation, Wall Street analysts say.
The Trump administration putting Huawei -- and dozens of its affiliates -- on an export blacklist means “the U.S. government has halted China’s 5G push,” and is transforming the trade war “into a digital one,” Sean Darby, Jefferies’s chief global equity strategist, wrote in a note. The move may have ramifications well beyond the tech sector as well, analysts at MKM wrote.
And a better-than-expected reading of a key U.S. sentiment index released on Friday is very likely masking the impact of higher tariffs, according to Michael McDonough, Bloomberg’s Chief Economist, Financial Products. The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index release was “calculated with responses mostly collected before the announced tariff increase and the final print will almost certainly be revised lower,” he said. There may be a “continued erosion in sentiment, which could throttle consumption and place a headwind on growth,” McDonough said.
Jefferies’s strategist Darby said that the progression from tariffs to direct actions against single Chinese companies and their inter-linked supply chains ""has a wide-ranging impact on profitability that investors will find difficult to quantify.”
The Huawei ban “holds back the development of 5G (the largest global capex project) and the growth of Internet-of-things,” he said. It also “completely disrupts the global tech supply chain. The macro and micro implications are immense.”
Darby noted that 5G provides a “huge advantage” for “everything from the use of autonomous vehicles to AI eco-systems,” while “enormous amounts of money” are also required to install fiber-optic and operating systems.
China has been a 5G technology leader, but Chinese companies have an Achilles heel -- their reliance on U.S. semiconductors and components with no alternatives, he said. Those include baseband chipsets for handsets, from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).; semiconductors for base stations, from  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX).; RF/power amplifier chipsets, from Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions Inc., Qorvo Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd. and Macom Technology Solutions Inc., and optical components, from Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Finisar Corp.
The Huawei blacklist “is a very important development and we suspect it has fallen through the cracks,” Cowen senior policy analyst Chris Krueger wrote in a note. He said that “a framework has now been put in place that could be extremely broad, disruptive, and restrictive.”
He sees the Commerce Department’s license process as “likely to take some time,” and suspects “nearly all requests will be denied.” He added that talks in Beijing with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are still unscheduled.
“It is very hard to see any off ramps before the June 28 Trump-Xi meeting in Japan at the G-20,” Krueger said. “A few more weeks like we had this week and that meeting may not even materialize.”
‘Dark Place’
“The most important question is what is the U.S. Government trying to accomplish,” MKM analyst Michael Genovese wrote in a note. “If the answer is to destroy Huawei and slow the development of 5G networks in China, then the U.S.-China relationship is likely headed to a dark place with major geopolitical ramifications beyond the tech sector.”
But Genovese tends to believe the move may be a “negotiating tactic.” MKM assigns a 50% probability that Huawei is permanently banned from purchasing key U.S. technology, and hopes there’s a 50% probability the order is walked back. Genovese downgraded NeoPhotonics Corp. on Huawei uncertainty, helping send shares plunging 28% to the lowest in four years.
Earlier, China’s state media signaled a lack of interest in resuming trade talks, while the government said stimulus will be stepped up to buttress the domestic economy. That helped send U.S. stocks broadly lower. Deere & Co. slumped as much as 6% as trade worries dimmed the machinery giant’s outlook; that followed Thursday’s warning from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. about increased tariffs leading to increased prices. Qorvo fell 4% in Friday trading and Lumentum dropped 4.3%.
On Friday morning, Acacia Communications Inc. said it plans to fully comply with the Commerce Department’s Huawei order. As sales to Huawei have been less than 1.5% of total revenue, it sees a “de minimis impact” from losing those sales in the second quarter. But Acacia cautioned that “developments or regulatory actions against Huawei may have a broader impact on overall conditions” in its markets.

The fall in shares after Pinterest's first quarterly results as a public company took some of the shine off its successful stock market debut last month. Up to Thursday, Pinterest's shares had risen 62% since their April 18 opening.
The company, which gets revenue through advertisements that are placed among the ""pins"" or posts that users upload on the site, forecast full-year revenue of $1.055 billion to $1.08 billion - mostly in line with analysts' estimate.
""We continue to believe that Pinterest's early-stage international and self-serve offerings provide meaningful growth drivers over time, but they require strong, sustained execution and Pinterest cannot simply flip a switch on either one,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a statement.
Two brokerage groups said the it would take the company at least two years to become profitable.
""We see low daily engagement relative to peers will limit average revenue per user potential,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz said.
Most brokerages are optimistic on the stock, with four of them rating the stock ""buy"" or higher and only one recommending ""sell"". Twelve brokerages have a ""hold"" rating.
In the first quarter, Pinterest's net loss narrowed to $41.4 million in the quarter ended March 31 from $52.7 million a year earlier.
Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said he expected the company to be profitable by 2021, and that the first quarter results displayed Pinterest's progress in being profitable.
""While around 93% of total revenue was from the US, we believe growth opportunities remain in the market, as Pinterest can further monetize its U.S. users via increasing ad loads (which resemble native ads), and adding more advertisers,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Stephen Ju.

Shares were down 13.7 percent at $26.62 in morning trading, after falling as much as 16.7 percent earlier.

Investors have adopted a “benign” view on the race to succeed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that could be mistaken, according to Jefferies International economist Marchel Alexandrovich.
In a note on Friday, Alexandrovich said that markets should stay focused on the German candidates for top European Union roles to determine the future policy of the ECB. They include Commission candidate Manfred Weber and Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president vying to replace Draghi.
Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, and the current and former governors of the Bank of Finland, Olli Rehn and Erkki Liikanen, are all also in the running for the ECB.
“At the moment, the markets are focused on other names, with potential candidates including Villeroy, Coeure, Rehn and Liikanen all expected to offer an uneventful transition from Draghi,” Alexandrovich wrote. “This benign view could prove completely misplaced if a policy hawk ends up in charge of the ECB.”
For Alexandrovich, those focusing on the race should pay “particularly attention” to Weber’s prospects. If he gets the Commission job, then Weidmann won’t clinch the ECB role.
“If Weber ends up stepping aside, then part of the agreed deal between Germany and France could be that Weidmann, or perhaps another German economist, ends up in charge of the ECB.”"
368,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 01:18PM ET</span>",Walmart bets big on attracting workforce with new HQ campus,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New corporate headquarters are springing up across the United States.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest retailer and the country's biggest private sector employer, on Friday revealed plans for a new corporate campus, joining rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple in expanding their corporate campuses as President Donald Trump pressures U.S. companies to make larger investments at home.
The Bentonville, Ark. based-company is building a new headquarters in its hometown - a project it announced in September 2017 - that will spread over 300 acres and house its nearly 17,000 employees with room to accommodate more as it creates new jobs.
Bike trails that run through the heart of the campus, a massive park, fitness centers, food trucks and child care centers will be some of the amenities that will fuse with a modern aesthetic design, said Dan Bartlett, executive vice-president of corporate affairs, who is overseeing the project.
There will also be the more basic elements that go into designing a modern workplace, such as flexible open floor plans that boost collaboration and offer privacy, tall ceilings, lots of windows and light and ample parking space, he said. 
""We are striving to attract and retain the best talent in order to win the future of retail and the key component of that is the work environment that we are creating,"" Bartlett said.
Walmart has kept its plans for a new headquarters relatively low key, unlike some of its rivals.
For example, Amazon.com captivated elected officials across North America in September 2017 when it announced it would create more than 50,000 jobs in a second headquarters dubbed HQ2. Cities and states vied desperately for the economic stimulus, with some states offering billions in potential tax credits. 
After an aggressive hunt, Amazon announced two winners: Long Island City in New York and Arlington, Virginia. But it had to reverse its plans abruptly in the Big Apple after a backlash over various issues, including tax breaks.
iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also announced it is spending $1 billion to build a second campus in Austin, Texas, that will house up to 15,000 workers.
Corporate America has been under political pressure to ramp up investments at home as part of Trump's ""America First"" policies, which have led to a bitter trade war with China. 
It is also increasingly in the interest of U.S. companies to tout investments and job creation, especially because those that have moved jobs overseas or shuttered factories have drawn sharp rebukes from Trump, who has championed job creation. 
Walmart's Bartlett did not give details on the amount it is investing in the project, nor the number of new jobs it will create at its new campus. He said the project and the capital investment will be phased over multiple years and will not hurt its financials in any single quarter or year.
Walmart also did not receive any ""special packages or tax breaks that were out of the ordinary"" for its project, he said. It received a state investment credit that any company in Arkansas can apply for and receive, Bartlett added.
""Our goal was not to extract things from the community,"" he said.
Bartlett said Walmart embarked on this project because the company's current headquarters are at full capacity and its home office workforce is stretched over 20 buildings across Bentonville and Rogers, Arkansas. 
The new buildings will have solar panels atop parking decks, energy-efficient lighting, regionally sourced building materials, including mass timber construction - in addition to a connected campus design. 
The retailer took design inspiration from the headquarters of companies like McDonald's Corp, Deloitte, large consumer product makers and others on the West Coast. Officials also visited college campuses such as Stanford, the University of Texas and the University of Arkansas.
Demolition will begin this summer and the new campus will be constructed through 2024.

371,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>",Airlines urge regulators not to compete on safety after Boeing crisis,"PARIS (Reuters) - Global airlines urged regulators on Friday not to compete over setting new safety rules, after two crashes led to the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and raised questions about the international influence of the U.S. aviation authority.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was the last regulator to halt flights in March over safety concerns.
Europe and Canada announced their own independent studies before restoring flights, rather than taking a cue from the FAA.
The head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing 290 airlines or more than 80 percent of world traffic, backed the existing process that usually involves one host regulator lead certification for each type of new aircraft, in exchange for reciprocal agreements with other agencies across the world.
Airlines want to ""avoid each model being certified 1,000 times"" but focus instead on a single lead regulator, Alexandre de Juniac told a meeting of aerospace executives in Paris.
""Competition between regulators would be detrimental,"" he added.
But many industry executives say they expect more differences between global aviation regulators as a result of the accidents, which have triggered a series of probes into whether the FAA did enough to certify the latest 737 as safe.
China and the European Union, each with their own aerospace industries, are likely to impose their own conditions before agreeing to allow 737 MAX flights to resume, analysts say.
The FAA is hosting a meeting of global regulators in Dallas on May 23 to review software and training proposals from Boeing before deciding whether and when to end the two-month grounding.
IATA has convened a meeting of airlines with grounded 737 MAX jets for the same day in Montreal.
""We have decided to gather the operators in Montreal to assess with them ... what they expect from the manufacturer and from the regulatory authorities,"" de Juniac said, adding that IATA would cooperate if certification rules needed altering.
The airline industry is anxious to maintain confidence in air travel after the intense focus on the accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia and a grounding that presented Boeing with its worst crisis in decades.
""Safety is our key achievement,"" de Juniac told the Usaire association of U.S. and European aerospace companies. ""2018 and 2019 will unfortunately not be the best years but we remain the safest mass transportation system by far.""

372,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 01:12PM ET</span>",Starbucks' China rival Luckin surges in market debut,"(Reuters) - Shares of Luckin Coffee Inc surged as much as 52.7% in their market debut on Friday, indicating strong investor demand for the self-declared challenger to  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) in China.
The company raised around $561 million after pricing its offering at the top of the anticipated price range, giving it a market value of $4.2 billion, in the biggest U.S. float by a Chinese firm this year.
The IPO gives Luckin more firepower and exposure to fuel its ambitious plan of overtaking Starbucks in China this year as the largest coffee chain by number of outlets.
""For us, brand is very, very important. If you're a listed company, particularly in the U.S., that will elevate your brand even further than what it is today. So (the IPO) helps us with branding,"" Chief Financial Officer Reinout Schakel said in an interview at the Nasdaq. 
The stock opened at $25, well above its IPO price of $17. By 12:35 p.m. EST, shares pared gains to trade up at around $21.34. 
Luckin has 2,370 stores in China and plans to open 2,500 more this year to go past Seattle-based Starbucks, which has long dominated China's coffee scene and has over 3,600 stores in the country.
Luckin's expansion is in stark contrast to Starbucks, which opened its first China store in 1999 and has spent two decades reaching its current store count.
The coffee start-up's customers can order coffee via an app, watch a livestream of their coffee being made, and have it delivered to their door in an average of 18 minutes.
Luckin's innovation on how consumers enjoy a cup of coffee sets it apart, said Zephirin Group analyst Lenny Zephirin in a note. ""We believe this will continue to support above-industry growth in the coming years."" 
The company has also expanded outside coffee, allowing customers to buy food and other beverages such as grapefruit cheese jasmine tea and Sichuan cold noodles with pulled chicken via its app.
""People think we're just coffee, but actually we're more than coffee. We're coffee but actually we want to use it as a connection ... and cross-sell different types of products,"" Schakel said.
However, Luckin's expansion comes at the cost of an aggressive cash burn. It relies heavily on cheap delivery and big discounts as a key strategy to attract customers.
Since inception in June, 2017, the company has been in the red, with net loss to shareholders at $475.4 million and total revenue of $125.27 million last year. For the first three months of this year, it posted a net loss of $85.3 million.
Luckin warned it may incur losses in the future and said it was more focused on expansion than turning a profit.
The coffee chain was co-founded by Chief Executive Officer Qian Zhiya and backed by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd.
Other investors in the company include U.S. money manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Chinese investment firms Centurium Capital and Joy Capital.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), CICC and Haitong International were the lead underwriters on the IPO.

(Reuters) - Deere & Co on Friday missed quarterly profit estimates for the fifth-straight quarter and cut its full-year outlook, as an escalating U.S.-China trade war threatens to further hit farm incomes and demand for the company's equipment.
Shares of Deere, known for its trademark green tractors and harvesting combines, fell as much as 6% to $137.18, as slump in demand for big agricultural machines has forced the company to cut production by 20 percent at two of its large factories in North America. 
""Ongoing concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and a delayed planting season in much of North America are causing farmers to become much more cautious about making major purchases,"" Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen said in a statement https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837019005158/ex-99d1.htm.
U.S. agricultural exports are likely to suffer, as the world's two largest economies level escalating tariffs on each other's imports in the midst of negotiations.
Earlier this week, soybean futures fell to their lowest in more than 10 years, which is squeezing U.S. farmers whose incomes have already been under pressure from a global grain glut. (graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BYCdun)
China, the world's top importer of soybean, bought about $12 billion worth of U.S. soy in 2017, but mostly shifted purchases to Brazil last year because of the trade fight, leaving U.S. farmers with surplus produce.
Deere, which gets nearly 60% of its sales from the United States and Canada, said it now expects full year equipment sales to rise by 5 percent, compared with a 7 percent rise, it had previously expected, as large farm machinery sales lag.
The company lowered its fiscal 2019 profit outlook to $3.3 billion, from its prior forecast of $3.6 billion, while raising its estimate for full-year costs by one percentage point to 76% of net sales, as the company speeds up research and development expenses.
""The lower forecast is partly a result of actions we are taking to prudently manage field inventories, which will cause production levels to be below retail sales in the second half of the year,"" said Allen. 
Some U.S. company executives have warned that costs related to the latest round of tariffs on goods from China will be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc on Thursday said that prices for U.S. shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on goods from China.
Net income attributable to Deere fell 6.1% to $1.14 billion, or $3.52 per share, in the second quarter ended April 28, missing analysts' estimates of $3.62 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net sales rose 5.4 percent to $10.27 billion, and were above the Wall Street's estimate of $10.19 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has taken a stake in British online food delivery company Deliveroo, leading a $575 million fundraising to pit itself against Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats in the global race to dominate the market for takeaway meals. 
The news the world's biggest online retailer had bought into one of Europe's fastest growing tech companies sent shockwaves through the sector, hitting shares in European rivals Just Eat, Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero.
The online giants are betting the takeaway market will expand as it branches out from fast, unhealthy meals to nutritious dishes, and that they have the scale to beat smaller rivals which are still largely sacrificing profits to grow. 
Deliveroo founder and CEO Will Shu said the fundraising would enable the loss-making group to increase its reach, develop technology and pursue innovations such as expanding its own kitchens that can be rented to restaurants to meet demand.
Deliveroo did not give a figure for Amazon's contribution. It has now raised $1.53 billion to date, helped by existing investors T. Rowe Price, Fidelity Management and Research Co, and Greenoaks. 
Shu said: ""Amazon has been an inspiration to me personally and to the company, and we look forward to working with such a customer-obsessed organization."" 
The former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker launched Deliveroo after moving to London from the United States and finding a lack of delivery options when working late. He says he still delivers meals once a week to understand the job of the rider. 
Headquartered in London, Deliveroo uses 60,000 riders dressed in black and teal jackets to deliver meals from more than 80,000 restaurants and takeaway outlets in 14 countries including France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait. 
Its ""Frank"" algorithm links the restaurants and riders with the customer, based on location, to cut the time of delivery. 
Deliveroo competes with Uber Eats, present in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, and part of the ride hailing giant that has a market valuation of $72 billion after its recent flotation. 
It also competes with the loss-making Takeaway.com platform which is in 10 European countries and Israel, and Germany's Delivery Hero. Operating in more than 40 markets with more than 290,000 restaurant partners, it hopes to break even in Europe in the second half of this year. 
Showing the fight underway in each market, Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero recently settled a costly struggle for supremacy in Germany, with Takeaway agreeing to buy its larger rival's businesses there for almost 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).
In Britain, Deliveroo is locked in a battle with Uber Eats and the online platform Just Eat, and its riders are a common sight carrying delivery boxes emblazoned with its kangaroo logo.
Just Eat, which originally connected customers with local takeaway restaurants that provided their own delivery service, has grown rapidly since it launched in 2001 and listed in 2014. 
But it has spooked investors this year with its need to constantly ramp up spending to meet demand. Just Eat had a market valuation of 4.6 billion pounds ($5.9 billion) prior to Friday, when its shares fell 10 percent in early trading.
Just Eat investor Cat Rock Capital said it was surprised Amazon had decided to partner with ""cash-burning"" Deliveroo, but that the deal showed the strategic interest in the sector and should spur the Just Eat board to find its own partner.
""We are confident that Just Eat’s significant strategic value will be unlocked if the Board engages with the many potential strategic partners available to the Company.""
Just Eat lags chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LOtjqz
Other challenges facing the sector include the push by riders to have workers' rights, an issue that is facing all parts of the gig economy, where people work for multiple employers without fixed contracts. 
Analysts said Amazon's firepower and distribution capabilities could have a huge impact on the market, and suggested the U.S. group might take over Deliveroo completely.
""Amazon is known for its tolerance for losses, and its willingness to price-gouge in search of market share,"" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said. 
Doug Gurr, Amazon UK country manager, said Deliveroo was an innovative company and the U.S group was excited to see what it did next.
Amazon currently sells food in Britain through its Amazon Fresh, Amazon Pantry and Amazon Prime Now services and has a wholesale deal with supermarket Morrisons. But, according to market researchers Kantar Worldpanel, its UK grocery market share is still less than 1 percent.

It has previously tried and failed to run a restaurant delivery service in Britain.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Nestle SA (S:NESN) will increase its natural and organic products in Brazil, its No. 4 market worldwide, as part of a wider Americas plan to cut sugar, sodium and saturated fats in its food, a spokesman said.
The local subsidiary of Swiss-based Nestle has 25 initiatives in its pipeline for 2019, compared with 20 last year, with most geared toward natural and healthier products, its Brazil head of Marketing and Communications, Frank Pflaumer, told Reuters.
Like other packaged food makers, the producer of Nescau chocolate powder and Kitkat bars is aligning itself with a worldwide consumer shift toward healthier food. 
Nestle Brazil allocated 400 million reais ($99.66 million) to innovation in the last five years, Pflaumer added. He declined to give estimates for capital expenditure in the coming years, but said investment levels were unlikely to fall.
Pflaumer said Nestle has cut over 14,000 metric tons of sugar, 5,000 tons of saturated fats and 300 metric tons of sodium from its manufacturing process in Brazil since 2014. 
Last year, Nestle opened a new quality assurance lab and launched its first organic food line in Brazil. [nL2N1Q90UN] [nL2N1VW1E5]
""Producing organically is not the hardest part, the most challenging is producing organically on a large scale,"" Pflaumer said, adding that Nestle is about to enlarge its portfolio with four flavors of a new organic baby food later in May.
Partnerships with startups, including Colombian delivery firm Rappi, are also underway as the company looks for new ways to bring its products to consumers, he said.
Asked about potential acquisitions, Pflaumer said Nestle is monitoring all opportunities, while it remains focused on four priority business areas: coffee, pet care, children's nutrition and water. 
""There is no fixed-budget for innovation ... Deals can happen,"" he added. 

Outside of Brazil, Nestle has been actively acquiring other businesses. In 2018, the Swiss company bought a majority stake in Terrafertil, an Ecuadorian firm selling natural and organic plant-based foods, after a deals in the U.S. for Blue Bottle Coffee, Sweet Earth vegetarian foods, Chameleon Cold-Brew Coffee and ready meals group Freshly.

382,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Direct lenders vie to resurrect cemetery owner StoneMor,"By Kate Duguid and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rising debt load at U.S. cemetery operator StoneMor Partners LP has helped bring it to death's door, but specialized lending funds are clamoring to refinance the company's borrowings, according to sources familiar with talks.
In the wake of the financial crisis when interest rates sank to historic lows, StoneMor borrowed over $300 million to acquire cemeteries and funeral parlors. The strategy added the deathcare company to a generation of companies now saddled with debt that has limited growth prospects.
This borrowing binge led the Federal Reserve to warn in its most recent financial stability report that business debt over the past decade has grown faster than the overall economy. In the event of an economic downturn, high debt levels leave companies - and sectors - vulnerable to collapse.
StoneMor has not turned a profit since 2008, has missed deadlines to report financial results and has seen its share price fall from over $30 in 2015 to less than $3 today. The deathcare company hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey to help it refinance its credit line as its existing lenders grew skittish about its deteriorating financial condition, according to the sources familiar with the deal.
StoneMor: A credit zombie?: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WQx2ow
Discussions to refinance StoneMor's nearly $200 million credit line are now in advanced stages, with a deal expected to close as soon as next month, the sources said, cautioning that the negotiations could still fall apart.
Specialty lenders, firms that make direct loans to middle market companies, are attracted to situations like that at StoneMor because of investor demand for ever-riskier assets, as safer bets yield little in the low-rate environment. The Fed has reported that leveraged loans grew 20% in 2018.
Funds managed by Ares Management Corp and Brookfield Asset Management have been vying to help refinance StoneMor's debt, according to the sources.
Those funds are up against targeted lending groups at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), the sources said.
Houlihan Lokey, Ares, Brookfield, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The sources could not be identified because the details of the refinancing process are confidential.
StoneMor declined to comment on the refinancing.
In response to a request for comment on StoneMor and its potential turnaround, chief executive Joe Redling said, ""I joined StoneMor in late July 2018, and have been working with my current management team to turn the company around since then. In recent investor communications, we outlined a number of steps we have undertaken to improve efficiencies and profitability which includes cost reductions and a comprehensive review of our asset base.""
StoneMor shares and market value: https://tmsnrt.rs/2W20wTn
BACK FROM THE DEAD?
Buried by debt, StoneMor has eliminated 15 percent of its workforce since 2008, leaving it with a total headcount of 2,630 full time workers as of December 2018. A company spokesperson, confirming three former employee accounts, said that under prior management, StoneMor put in place hiring freezes and a furlough.
Some of StoneMor's salesforce departed as it changed its compensation structure and cut a popular contest offering trips to the Caribbean for top performers, according to two ex-employees. A spokesperson for the company confirmed the trip had been cut and acknowledged they altered their compensation for salespeople.
These efforts to conserve cash have so far done little to revive StoneMor. Earlier this year, Moody's downgraded StoneMor's debt deep into junk territory, indicating that investors may not receive all of their money back. 
""Our rating reflects our concern that they will not be able to continue to make interest and principal payments,"" said Edmond DeForest of Moody's Investor Service.
StoneMor's $175 million bond due in June 2021, rated eight notches into junk by Moody's, now features a yield to maturity of 14.3%, nearly double its coupon of 7.875%, reflecting creditors' increasing skittishness about the prospect of being repaid.
A $35 million loan from its largest equity holder Axar Capital Management earlier this year has helped StoneMor stay alive. New leadership - Redling is its third chief executive in the last 18 months - is now attempting to change its corporate structure.
The company plans to convert into a C corporation as soon as this summer after a vote by unitholders, from its current form as a master limited partnership, a structure which entails large quarterly payouts to the company's investors. It ceased making the expected distributions to its limited partners in 2017, effectively closing off its access to public equity markets and hobbling its ability to acquire new cemeteries and grow its business. 
Though the company is not expected to make any further payouts, Moody's still predicts it will be cash-flow negative this year.
StoneMor's bondholders vote with their feet: https://tmsnrt.rs/2W2jFob
ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE
The outlook for the $20 billion deathcare industry is actually bright, thanks to the large and wealthy generation of Baby Boomers who are aging, and will soon require the services StoneMor provides.
Meeting that growing demand requires a cemetery company to acquire more property. StoneMor did just that after the financial crisis, borrowing heavily to buy smaller cemeteries from local entrepreneurs. It then added in its own operating system and costly perks, such as health benefits for employees, and corporate cars and credit cards for sales staff.
But the company failed to implement changes at new properties with consistency, DeForest said, making it difficult to tell which acquisitions were performing well and which were not.
""Acquisitions were never integrated,"" he said. ""StoneMor tried to figure out integration as they went.""
Interest costs tied up any cash the company could have used to buy new plots, limiting StoneMor's ability to expand.
As StoneMor saw its shares slide, stock in its competitor Service Corporation International has more than tripled. The company last year reported record profit and has maintained a debt level at around four times earnings.
Like StoneMor, Service Corp also made acquisitions to grow, but clustered assets, allowing cost-saving central management. Strategic acquisitions such as The Neptune Society Inc, the largest U.S. provider for the growing cremation business, have also boosted earnings.

At last, the bears get to say “I told you so.”
Strategists have been forecasting for months that European equities would lop off some of this year’s rally but their prediction didn’t come true until May. Shaken by the flare-up in the U.S.-China trade spat, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is set for its first monthly retreat of 2019, breaking the longest winning streak in almost two years.
And it might get worse, if the forecasters are right.
According to the average response in a Bloomberg poll, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index is likely to fall 5.4% from Thursday’s close, to 362 points, by the end of 2019. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index, home to the region’s biggest companies, will drop 4.7% to 3,278, according to survey estimates.
Analysts remain pessimistic even after recent declines: trade wars are only adding to the region’s woes of spotty economic data and messy political developments in the U.K. and Italy, where the country’s Deputy Premier is challenging European fiscal rules. Being short European equities is one of the most popular trades globally, according to the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fund manager survey, and Sanford C. Bernstein strategists last month said the region is “uniquely hated.”
 State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, which oversees $2.8 trillion, agrees with the consensus.
“We’re definitely staying underweight European equities. I definitely don’t think it’s time to buy. The economy isn’t strong, you have political and growth concerns in Germany, Italy, the U.K.,” said Altaf Kassam, EMEA head of strategy and research at State Street.
And to think things were going so well just a few weeks ago. At the end of April, the Euro Stoxx 50 was less than 1% away from entering a bull market, while  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA recommended European small-caps and automakers. That last call in particular hasn’t aged well, with carmakers this month tumbling the most among industry groups.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was set for a weekly gain of 0.7% as Trump announced a delay in imposing tariffs on imported vehicles from the European Union.
Earnings expectations for European companies briefly turned positive last month, but in May profit downgrades have once again been outweighing upward revisions, according to the  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) index.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - When Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) CEO Guido Kerkhoff announced plans to list its prized elevators unit last week, he set off a battle for the conglomerate's future that could test Germany's brand of ""social market"" capitalism.
Kerkhoff had little choice but to think the unthinkable when the company's share price sank to a 15-year low on May 8. The plan to take elevators public not only broke with long tradition but marked the abandonment of a turnaround plan he himself had unveiled less than eight months before.
Now Thyssenkrupp's future is in play, with activist investors on the one side baying for a restructuring of the group to drive up value, and its top shareholder - the charitable Krupp foundation - and workers on the other side with a mandate to protect the unity of the company and jobs.
It's also a clash of cultures and of differing visions of capitalism: Anglo-Saxon profit maximization pitted against Germany's long-term focused social market economy model.
Kerkhoff's strategy will not only decide the fate of his career, but also the shape of Thyssenkrupp - a poster child of Germany's so-called Rhineland capitalism, which buttressed the country's economic success by emphasizing social policies to protect workers rights as much as the rules of free enterprise.
Thyssenkrupp's conglomerate structure has fallen out of favor in the market, reflected in the deterioration of its share price. Many investors say Kerkhoff and the non-profit foundation must move to reshape the group's portfolio, including through spin-offs and divestments.
Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at top-20 shareholder Deka Investment, said this kind of active portfolio management was the likeliest and best solution for the group.
""Parts will be separated out and the resulting proceeds used to make acquisitions.""
Bankers and investors are now eyeing the prospect of finding new owners for the group's sprawling businesses, ranging from steel and elevators to car parts and submarines.
Components Technology, which makes automotive parts, and Industrial Solutions, which makes chemical and cement plants, may be merged with sector peers in the medium to long-term, according to three financial sources familiar with the matter.
Elevators may end up in the hands of Kone or Schindler, should they intercept Thyssenkrupp's IPO plans, while plant engineering could be combined with Linde's engineering unit, one of the sources said. 
Other investment bank pitches to potential buyers will focus on finding a partner for some of Thyssenkrupp's automotive businesses, where Bosch, ZF Friedrichshafen, Nexteer or Mando are seen as potential players, according to the sources.
The company's Rothe Erde machine parts unit may attract interest from Sweden's SKF, Schaeffler and Japan's NSK, they said.
""This is the breakup of Thyssenkrupp,"" said a senior banker who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
All the companies either declined to comment on potential deals or were not immediately available to comment.
Kerkhoff has acknowledged that new ownership structures for its businesses is needed to turn the company around. But Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on any future asset sales.
'NO QUICK, EASY WINS'
Such a process will however be lengthy and difficult, according to three separate financial and labor sources, for two reasons: apart from elevators, all other units of Thyssenkrupp are less profitable than their peer average, are going through a restructuring or are in need of one.
This is reducing their value and makes it less probable that an M&A frenzy will ensue.
""I don't see quick, easy wins unless assets are sold under value,"" said another senior banker. ""A fire sale is not the way forward.""
Secondly, powerful labor representatives at Thyssenkrupp, who control half of the seats on group's 20-member supervisory board, are willing to oppose M&A that will result in further job cuts among its 161,000-strong workforce.
The 10 workers' representatives can team up with the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation, which holds a 21 percent stake, to veto major changes.
The foundation's mandate is to preserve the unity of the company while at the same time relying on healthy dividends to fund its non-profit activities for promoting the ""common good"".
It therefore needs to tread carefully, preserving the company's future without obstructing needed reforms.
The elevator IPO, part of a plan that also includes 6,000 job reductions, has found support because it brings in cash that is badly needed to fix Thyssenkrupp's balance sheet and strengthen the businesses as a whole.
""It will be a difficult path for the company and its employees. But we won't abandon workers,"" said Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and secretary at IG Metall, Germany's biggest labor union. 
POWER OF ACTIVIST INVESTORS
The conflict at Thyssenkrupp also illustrates the growing influence of activist shareholders on European household names, with demands to tackle underperformance and simplify structures.
Swedish investor Cevian, a shareholder since 2013 that has long pressed for change, holds an 18 percent stake, while more recent investor Elliott holds under 3 percent. Both have criticized Thyssenkrupp's underperformance.
Activists argue specialized businesses are often more highly valued than conglomerates because in times of growth, high-potential assets do not have to share the balance sheet with cash-consuming, lower-return businesses.
Conglomerates tend to be valued at a trading multiple of some of their lowest performing business resulting in the so-called conglomerate discount and higher refinancing costs.
In recent years, groups that have reshaped their portfolios through spin-offs and sales have outperformed peers in terms of share price development, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a study last year, a trend which helped asset disposals in Europe reach their highest level since 2007.
""It's not necessarily that boards and companies were doing things wrong before,"" said Rich Thomas, managing director and head of European shareholder advisory at investment bank Lazard.
""But things are different now and now boards and companies need to do things differently because the world has moved a bit underneath them,"" he added, referring to the rise of investor activism. ""And now, I think, in many ways European and German boards are playing a little bit of catch-up.""
German labor leaders and credit agencies, for their part, argue a diversified model with exposure to several businesses with different growth, margin and cash flow generation rates is an advantage when one sector enters a downturn.
POST-WAR REFORMS
Germany has been slow to embrace portfolio management because of reforms introduced after World War II to safeguard worker rights.
In 1947, the United States forced the breakup of German industrial monopolies so that they could not be used as instruments of power by political forces, as had happened with the steel industry under the Nazis.
Krupp, which later merged with Thyssen in 1999, was among the first companies to be dismantled. Among others, IG Farben was split into businesses including BASF, Hoechst and Bayer (DE:BAYGN).
At the time, price controls were also lifted, sparking concerns among German workers about their welfare so Germany's leaders allowed industry associations including the German Trade Union Confederation and Federation of German Industries to help formulate new labor laws and working conditions.
In 1949, collective wage-bargaining negotiations set a minimum wage for entire sectors to ensure competition would not mean a race to the bottom for wages. The law is still in place.
Three years later, trade unions were also given the right to appoint a third of company directors so they could have a say in determining the conditions of hiring and laying off workers when restructuring was needed.
It is this law which has given Thyssenkrupp's workers a near veto power to stop radical job cuts and even to block the appointment of shareholder-friendly candidates to the board.
Decisions at Thyssenkrupp have rarely, if ever, been taken without the consent of workers.
For CEO Kerkhoff, a deal for the elevator unit may mark one of the last chances to raise cash to pay for necessary reforms following three profit warnings, a botched plan to spin off its capital goods business and the collapse of a steel joint venture with Tata Steel.
But analysts at Jefferies are still skeptical about management's ability to get the listing off the ground.

""The timeline and execution of such a deal remain concerns of investors,"" they said, adding management must come up with a credible restructuring plan that is supported by unions and convince markets the IPO will repair the group's balance sheet.

386,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","Investors Are Downplaying ‘Immense’ U.S.-China Damage, Jefferies Says","(Bloomberg) -- Global equity investors are likely underestimating the damage from the U.S.-China trade dispute, Wall Street analysts say.
With the Trump administration putting Huawei Technologies Co. and dozens of its affiliates on an export blacklist , “the U.S. government has halted China’s 5G push,” transforming the trade war “into a digital one,” Sean Darby, Jefferies’s chief global equity strategist wrote in a note. And it’s likely to have ramifications beyond the tech sector as well, analysts at MKM wrote.
“The progression from tariffs to direct actions against single Chinese companies and their inter-linked supply chains has a wide-ranging impact on profitability that investors will find difficult to quantify,” Darby warned.
The Huawei ban “holds back the development of 5G (the largest global capex project) and the growth of Internet-of-things,” he said. It also “completely disrupts the global tech supply chain. The macro and micro implications are immense.”
Darby noted that 5G provides a “huge advantage” for “everything from the use of autonomous vehicles to AI eco-systems,” while “enormous amounts of money” are also required to install fiber-optic and operating systems.
China has been a 5G technology leader, but Chinese companies have an Achilles heel -- their reliance on U.S. semiconductors and components with no alternatives, he said. Those include baseband chipsets for handsets, from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).; semiconductors for base stations, from  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX).; RF/power amplifier chipsets, from Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions Inc., Qorvo Inc., Avago Technologies Ltd. and Macom Technology Solutions Inc., and optical components, from Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Finisar Corp.
The Huawei blacklist “is a very important development and we suspect it has fallen through the cracks,” Cowen senior policy analyst Chris Krueger wrote in a note. He said that “a framework has now been put in place that could be extremely broad, disruptive, and restrictive.”
He sees the Commerce Department’s license process as “likely to take some time,” and suspects “nearly all requests will be denied.” He added that talks in Beijing with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are still unscheduled.
“It is very hard to see any off ramps before the June 28 Trump-Xi meeting in Japan at the G-20,” Krueger said. “A few more weeks like we had this week and that meeting may not even materialize.”
Earlier, China’s state media signaled a lack of interest in resuming trade talks, while the government said stimulus will be stepped up to buttress the domestic economy. That helped send U.S. index futures and European stocks lower. Qualcomm is dropping 1.9% in pre-market trading Friday, while Intel is down 0.5%, and the exchange-traded fund that tracks the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1.4%.
On Friday morning, Acacia Communications Inc. said it plans to fully comply with the Commerce Department’s Huawei order. As sales to Huawei have been less than 1.5% of total revenue, it sees a “de minimis impact” from losing those sales in the second quarter. But Acacia cautioned that “developments or regulatory actions against Huawei may have a broader impact on overall conditions” in its markets."

389,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Putin’s 2018 Growth Spurt Proves Brief as Tax Hike Hits,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian officials touted last year’s surprisingly strong growth as a sign the economy was finally getting traction, but as initial results for 2019 come in, that’s looking more like a stall.
A value-added-tax hike that took effect on Jan. 1 has been a drag on growth after helping boost the performance at the end of last year to the best since 2012. Economists say growth in the first quarter was likely the lowest in more than a year. Though disappointing for the Kremlin’s hopes for faster expansion, the weak result is likely to provide further encouragement for the central bank to resume cutting interest rates at its next meeting in June.
“The first quarter wasn’t horrible, it was just bad, most likely the central bank will cut rates by a quarter point in June,” said Anton Tabakh, the chief economist at Moscow-based credit assessor Expert Ra. “Because of the VAT hike, a lot of economic activity moved to the fourth quarter of last year.”
GDP rose 1.2% in the first quarter of this year, according to 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey, after a 2.7% jump in the last three months of 2018. The Federal Statistics Service, known as Rosstat, may release the first quarter reading as early as Friday. A weak report could also help defuse recent criticism of the agency for producing overly rosy economic data.
“Weakening wage growth has weighed on spending,” said Liza Ermolenko, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in London. “We expect further weakness going forward. If anything, growth could slow more in the coming months.”
After adjusting for inflation, wages were stagnant in February and March and are forecast to have risen only 0.2% in April, according to another Bloomberg survey. Car sales fell 2.7% last month.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say:
“The slowdown was a self-inflicted blow, with higher taxes squeezing households. But the inflation spike hasn’t been as big as we feared, and the sting should fade quickly. Rate cuts and fiscal stimulus could help fuel a swift rebound in the second half.”
--- Scott Johnson, Russia economist. Read RUSSIA PREVIEW
Consumer confidence fell to a historic low of 62 in the first quarter, three points below the previous reading, market researcher Nielsen said in a report. With the current economic conditions, fewer people are expecting favorable financial prospects and think now is not the best time to spend money, according to Marina Volkova, head of analytics and consulting at Nielsen Russia.
The Bank of Russia sees the economy expanding 1.2%-1.7% this year, citing the value-added tax increase to 20% from 18% as “a small restraining effect” and noting that planned government infrastructure spending could boost growth later this year.
But BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research warned in a report Thursday that increasing risks to global growth could also cloud the outlook for Russia next year, with the 2020 result sliding below 1% confounding hopes of an uptick.

390,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Huawei Built At Least a Three-Month Stockpile Ahead of Trump Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. has stockpiled enough chips and other vital components to keep its business running for at least three months as the U.S. curtails its access to American technology, people familiar with the matter said.
The Trump administration on Friday blacklisted China’s largest tech company -- which it accuses of aiding Beijing in espionage -- threatening to cut off the American software and semiconductors it needs to make smartphones and networking gear. But it’s been preparing for such an eventuality since at least the middle of 2018, hoarding components while designing its own chips, the people said.
Government officials also privately warned Huawei executives last year to explore non-American alternatives, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about internal affairs. The three-month cushion is a conservative internal estimate and the company could well sustain operations beyond that time-frame, they said.
The moves against China’s national champion may have devastating consequences for the rest of the world. Blocking the sale to Huawei of critical components such as semiconductors could cripple its operation, depress the businesses of American chip giants from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. to Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and retard the rollout of critical 5G wireless networks worldwide.
“The impact on Huawei will be extremely significant. An obvious impact is on the supply chain, but there is another layer of impact on confidence and its overall business,” said Cui Kai, a telecom analyst with consultancy IDC. “It will also have a negative impact on the 5G technology evolution around the world.”
Ken Hu, Huawei’s deputy chairman, responded to the U.S. decision in a memo to employees.
""This decision is the latest move in the campaign against Huawei, waged by the US government for political reasons,” he wrote. “The company has known this could be a possibility for many years. We have invested heavily and made full preparations in a variety of areas, including R&D and business continuity, which will ensure that our business operations will not be greatly affected, even under extreme conditions.
That U.S. maneuver coincides with sensitive trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. Huawei executives reckon their company has become a bargaining chip and they will be able to resume buying from American suppliers if a trade deal is reached, the people said. That’s why they calculate a three-month stockpile may be enough to tide them over.
If Huawei’s calculation is wrong, the consequences would be dire. If the ban isn’t resolved along with the trade dispute, the company would be severely handicapped in its ability to provide advanced wireless networks. Much of its carrier and smartphone businesses -- the two pillars of the company -- would be at risk.
An outright ban on Huawei elevates fears in Beijing that President Donald Trump’s broader goal is to hamstring China, igniting a protracted cold war between the world’s biggest economies. In addition to a trade fight that has rattled global markets for months, the U.S. is pressuring allies and foes alike to avoid using Huawei in the 5G networks that will form the backbone of the modern economy.
At the heart of Trump’s concerted campaign is suspicion that Huawei aids Beijing in espionage while spearheading China’s ambitions to become a technology superpower. The Justice Department also accuses it of willfully violating sanctions on Iran, and last year engineered the arrest of the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations.
In the longer term, Huawei still has to assure its customers -- many of the world’s largest telecommunications carriers -- that it can not just build, but also maintain, their wireless networks. The U.S. ban hits the Chinese company just as it’s jockeying for a big chunk of the hundreds of billions of dollars that the likes of  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) and China Mobile Ltd. are devising around the world, laying the foundation for future technologies from autonomous cars to smart cities.
Huawei’s predicament underscores the extent to which China as a whole is reliant on foreign chip technology: the country imports more semiconductors today than oil. While Huawei and peers such as Tsinghua Unigroup are designing increasingly advanced architectures, they haven’t reached sufficient scale in production to make a dent in that annual inflow.
Still, Huawei has had business-continuity plans in place for years. Teresa He, president of Huawei chip-making unit HiSilicon, called the U.S. ban “crazy” and “groundless” in a letter sent to employees and seen by Bloomberg. While HiSilicon was seen as a backup plan for Huawei’s semiconductor needs, the ban will make it a primary supplier, she said in her letter.
Hu, in his memo to employees, wrote that the company is on the right side of history.
“No hardships or difficulties can stop us from forging ahead,” he said.

For almost three years, Theresa May has clung to power with grim determination, fighting to complete her defining mission and deliver Brexit.Britain's ruling Conservative Party finally ran out of patience yesterday. In a tense and emotional meeting inside May’s wood-paneled Westminster offices, the party’s grandees delivered their blunt message to the prime minister: it’s time to go. The question is who – and what – comes now.
May was forced to promise a timetable for stepping down, and to formally start a contest to pick her successor as party leader (and thus prime minister), after she tries one last time in June to get lawmakers to endorse her to get her Brexit plan. Today, her attempt to strike a cross-party deal on Brexit finally broke down today, compounding her predicament.
Boris Johnson, the colorful former foreign minister who quit in protest at May’s handling of talks to leave the European Union, announced that he will stand. Others are waiting in the wings.Johnson’s strongly pro-Brexit stance makes him the current favorite in what will be an unpredictable and over-crowded race. But would he find delivering Brexit any easier? Unless he triggers and wins a general election, or a second referendum on the EU divorce, he will have no mandate or means to get any deal through Britain's deadlocked Parliament.In the end, that’s what destroyed Theresa May. Whoever replaces her, Britain faces yet more political turbulence ahead.
Global Headlines
Battle lines | President Donald Trump, who was elected after promising to end U.S. involvement in Middle East conflicts, is wary of drawing the U.S. into a war with Iran, concerned it would imperil his bid for a second term, Jennifer Jacobs and Margaret Talev report. At the same time, he is under pressure from his base to show the U.S. won’t be pushed around, and members of his national security team have issued increasingly bellicose warnings to Tehran.
 Trade stalemate | Chinese state media has signaled a lack of interest in resuming trade talks with the U.S. without new moves that show Washington is sincere. That's after the Trump administration said restrictions on Huawei will take effect today, placing China’s largest technology company and scores of its affiliates around the world on a blacklist that curtails its access to critical U.S. suppliers.
Blocking move | Ukraine’s ruling coalition collapsed today after the People’s Front quit, effectively blocking President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy from calling early elections. Zelenskiy, a comedian whose new political movement is not part of the government, tapped into widespread public anger at government corruption to score a landslide victory over Petro Poroshenko last month. He had pledged to consider dissolving parliament and hold a snap election.
Risky business | Whoever wins Australia’s election tomorrow will be handed a formidable challenge: keeping an economy that’s just chalked up the longest expansion on record from running out of gas. Should it be a Labor victory – as polls suggest – it will be a familiar story for the party, which almost always returns to power when times are tough. For now both Labor and the ruling Liberal/National Coalition are seeking to convince voters that nearly 28 years of unbroken growth will continue under their stewardship. For more on the election, see here and here.
Domestic troubles | The Kremlin is struggling to defuse unrest in Russia’s provincial heartlands, normally the bedrock of President Vladimir Putin’s support. Nightly protests this week in Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, over plans for a new cathedral are the latest example of spreading discontent amid rising economic hardship. Putin yesterday intervened, urging local officials to conduct a poll of residents’ views.
What to Watch
 And finally…Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize gay marriage after a landmark vote in parliament cheered on by tens of thousands of supporters outside. But the move carries risks for President Tsai Ing-wen, who’s Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party forced through the legislation over opposition from older and more conservative voters. More than 72% favored keeping restrictions on marriage rights to heterosexual couples in a November referendum.

394,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>","Nissan retains Saikawa as CEO, in likely rebuff of Renault","By Maki Shiraki and Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Friday that Hiroto Saikawa would stay on as chief executive, backing the protege of former boss Carlos Ghosn even as top shareholder  Renault  had earlier pushed for a change in the Japanese automaker's leadership.
Saikawa's re-appointment is likely to be seen as a rebuff to Renault SA (PA:RENA), which has pushed for leadership changes as a prelude to merger talks, sources at both companies have told Reuters. Saikawa - who has long opposed full integration - is seen as an obstacle to a tie-up, several people have said.
Nissan has proposed that Renault Chief Executive Thierry Bollore will join the board, while Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard will remain on it. The board will be increased to 11 members from eight, and will include seven outside directors. The proposals will be put to a shareholder vote in June.
The make-up of Nissan's board has vast implications for the Nissan-Renault alliance. The unequal relationship between them - smaller Renault has the bigger stake in Nissan - has long been a source of friction.
The board unanimously backed Saikawa, even while acknowledging he may have not done enough to rein in Ghosn, one external director said. Ghosn, who has been charged with financial misconduct, has denied wrongdoing.
""While there are issues pertaining to Saikawa's responsibility, we feel it is more constructive to focus on cooperation within the alliance, Nissan's recovery and its strategic plan,"" Keiko Ihara said.
""We had a robust debate, we took our time to look at the risks ... but in the end all of the directors agreed to the appointment,"" she said, adding that Renault's Senard had agreed at a meeting earlier this week to the decision to keep Saikawa. 
However, a source close to Senard said there had been no vote earlier this week, unanimous or otherwise, on Saikawa's reappointment as CEO.
LACKLUSTRE PERFORMANCE
Nissan's uninspiring performance in the months since the dramatic ouster of Ghosn in November has sparked concern at the French automaker.
Renault owns 43% of its bigger partner and analysts estimate that Nissan's planned 30% dividend cut this year will wipe around 130 million euros ($145 million) from the French company's earnings.
The two Renault executives were recommended to Nissan's board by the French automaker to strengthen the alliance, Ihara said. Renault also recommended Bernard Delmas, who chairs French tyre company Michelin's Japanese operations.
There had been widespread speculation about Saikawa's future and the make-up of the board after Nissan this week flagged a 28% drop in annual profit and slashed its dividend, underscoring its struggle to turn a page after Ghosn.
Ghosn's arrest in Japan and immediate ouster by Nissan strained the partnership, as Renault resisted a full investigation of alliance finances and kept its absent leader in office as chairman and CEO for two more months.
Ghosn is out on bail and awaiting trial in Tokyo.

Nissan's shares ended down 0.9 percent on Friday, underperforming a 0.9 percent rise in the Nikkei share average.

UBS analysts cautioned against reading too positively into the auto tariff delay in a note, saying the development represents a ""continuation of the U.S. carrot-and-stick approach"" to ongoing negotiations, while the news on Huawei ban shows the ""wider scope of the U.S.-China dispute"".
Delivery food companies tumbled after Britain's Deliveroo, which is unlisted, secured funding from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Just Eat tanked 6.9%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, while Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero lost 4% and 3% percent respectively. 
European share advances on Thursday were supported by better-than-expected U.S. economic data and upbeat earnings from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).
Investors will on Friday turn to euro zone CPI data for April, due at 0900 GMT, for further clues to the health of the region's economy after powerhouse Germany returned to growth in the first quarter of 2019. 
Swiss luxury goods maker Richemont reported weak profitability in its watch business and online distributors in its past financial year, sending its shares down 1%.

In a bright spot, Britain's EasyJet rose xx% after the budget carrier said it would meet expectations in 2019 despite a worse trading environment.

LONDON (Reuters) - World share markets suffered a fresh bout of risk aversion on Friday after tough words on trade from China, while bets on a new pro-Brexit leader in Britain whipped the pound towards its worst week since October.
Europe's bourses slipped 0.6% early on that seemed a minor blip after what had happened in Asia.
Shanghai stocks finished 2.5% in the red and the yuan hit its weakest in nearly five months amid growing fallout from President Donald Trump's move to block China's Huawei Technologies from buying vital American technology.
On Friday, the Communist Party's People's Daily used a front page commentary to evoke the patriotic spirit of past wars, saying the trade war would never bring China down.
In terms of how the trade conflict plays out, ""the next fortnight will be very, very important,"" UniCredit strategist Kiran Kowshik said.
""Chinese counter-tariffs are due on June 1 and if those get effective, I think markets will price in the risk of the U.S. imposing its additional $300 billion of tariffs ahead of the G20 meeting (near the end of June).""
The drop in the yuan saw it ease past 6.9400 per dollar in the offshore market for the first time since November 2018.
Its slide has been steepening in recent days. Sources in China told Reuters the central bank would intervene to ensure it did not weaken past 7 to the dollar in the near term.
While breaking 7 could reduce some of the effects of U.S. tariff increases, it could hit confidence and trigger fund outflows, one of the sources said.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was at 15-week lows and down 2.6% for the week at the end of trading.
Japan's Nikkei did manage to bounce 0.9%, while the main Australian index climbed to an 11-year peak as higher commodity prices boosted miners.
In Europe, Germany's exporter-heavy DAX fell the most, auto stocks lost as much as 1.6% and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 shed 0.35% ahead of Wall Street trading. 
Sentiment had been briefly soothed on Thursday by better U.S. economic news, with housing starts surprisingly strong and a welcome pickup in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing survey.
Upbeat results from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) burnished the outlook for retail spending, though the chain also warned that tariffs would raise prices for U.S. consumers.
As the earnings season winds down, of the 457 S&P 500 companies reporting about 75% have beaten profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
MAY COUNTS DOWN TO JUNE
The chillier trade winds helped Treasuries, with the 10-year yield down at 2.38% after a second strong week running for bond markets.
The dollar lost a little of its shine against the safe-haven yen to stand at 109.64 from a top of 110.03. Against a basket of currencies, it was a shade softer at 96.824.
Yet the euro could make no ground and held at $1.1173, down 0.5% for the week so far.
Sterling was one of the worst performers as Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May battled to keep her Brexit deal, and her premiership, intact amid growing fears of a disorderly departure from the European Union. 
The pound touched a three-month low of $1.2783 and was down 1.6% for the week so far.
Also under pressure was the Australian dollar, losing 1.5% for the week to $0.6880 as investors piled into bets that interest rates would be cut in June.
Cyber currency Bitcoin tumbled over 20% at one stage for no clear reason. It was last down 7%, albeit back on course for its third week of gains and having doubled in value this year.
In commodity markets, spot gold steadied at $1,287 per ounce as risk sentiment soured.
Oil futures firmed into a fourth session as rising tensions in the Middle East stoked fears of potential supply disruptions. 
U.S. crude was last up 33 cents at $63.20 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 19 cents to $72.81.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers will meet in Saudi Arabia this weekend over whether to continue with supply cuts that have boosted prices more than 30% so far this year.

399,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",Airlines face scramble to restore 737 MAX flights once regulators approve fix,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski 
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Once global regulators clear Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX to fly again after deadly crashes, airlines which have put their fleets into mechanical hibernation since March will scramble to begin the biggest ungrounding effort in history.
Quickly reintegrating Boeing's 737 MAX, a fast-selling model because of its fuel efficiency, longer range, and passenger capacity, is crucial for optimizing airlines' routes and improving margins after having to cancel thousands of flights.
Global airlines have warned of a major hit to profits due to the mid-March grounding of the MAX following two fatal crashes.
International regulators are meeting on May 23 to review Boeing software and training plans, though doubts remain over how quickly foreign authorities will clear new flights.
In the United States, following regulatory approval of a Boeing software fix and new training, airlines will have to run through an FAA-approved checklist, industry officials say.
Such work, which will vary by operator, includes cycling the engines, changing and filling fluids, removing covers from the engines and running routine electrical and hydraulics checks.
Each airline will also have to upload Boeing's new software for an anti-stall system implicated in the crashes and complete additional pilot training.
Jason Goldberg, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, said it will take about a week to prepare American Airline Group Inc's MAX fleet to fly, not counting the extra training.
""While the planes are in storage there is of course maintenance that can be done. But as far as steps to put it back into service, none of the work is going to be done until the aircraft is cleared to fly.""
Airlines likely halted standard daily systems checks while the planes were in storage, said one former Boeing test pilot. Similar to a modern car, when mechanics restore power to the aircraft, built-in testing equipment runs checks on sensors gauging the health of aircraft systems from hydraulics and to fuel - known as a 'BITE' test - that would signal failures. 
Another issue is pilot training.
Boeing said on Thursday it was in the process of submitting a plan on pilot training to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for approval, after which each airline will develop its own FAA-approved training program. 
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest MAX operator, has agreed a 30-day window with its 10,000 pilots to implement new MAX training, said Mike Trevino, spokesman for Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.
""If it's computer-based training, that won't be difficult to deploy. The pilots can do it at home,"" he said.
A draft report by an FAA-appointed board of pilots, engineers and other experts concluded that pilots only need additional computer-based training, rather than simulator time, though other regulators and some pilot groups have argued for more.
Southwest is expected to upload the new software at a facility in the California desert where its 34 MAX jets are parked, while American Airlines is expected to install the software at its Tulsa, Oklahoma maintenance facility.

Southwest and American have scheduled MAX flights as of Aug. 6 and Aug. 20 respectively. If the jets are not cleared to fly by then, the airlines will be forced to again cancel more than 100 daily flights.

Euro-area exporters could emerge as surprise winners from the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute.
If U.S. tariffs make imports from China less competitive, European firms have an opportunity to swoop in and take advantage. That’s an argument made by David Owen at Jefferies International, who says trade wars “create winners amongst the losers.”
“This seems to have been lost among all the negativity surrounding the subject,” Owen said in a report on Thursday.
ING economists also argue there’s a chance for Europe to capitalize on the trade tensions. They’ve previously highlighted the best-placed industries as machinery, auto parts, plastics, and some chemicals.
It’s something for the region to cling to in a week that saw Germany, its biggest economy, return to growth after a torrid 2018. Even the European Central Bank has made the point, with a recent research paper highlighting the potential benefits of trade diversion for Europe.
“In a trade dispute involving two countries, third countries may temporarily benefit from rising protectionism. Specifically, third countries can gain market share in countries where tariffs have risen.”--ECB Staff Research Paper
The U.S trade confrontation with China also provided a brief fillip to the European Union this week as President Donald Trump’s administration delayed slapping levies on imports from the bloc. The reprieve is temporary, but it gives the economic giants a chance to figure out a solution to avoid a damaging tariff battle between them.
There are still negatives to consider from the escalation in U.S.-China tensions, particularly a broad hit to business sentiment. China and the U.S. could also seek to dump excess product in the euro area, hitting local producers, says ING.
Global supply chains are complicated and it’s not clear how it will all pan out. Also, the U.S. could still decide to hit Europe with levies. The impact may “very much be non-linear and unpredictable,” Owen said.
“Reduced demand and increasing uncertainty in the U.S. and China will also suppress business investment, which will diminish the chances of European companies exporting capital goods,” said ING’s Timme Spakman. “On top of this, European producers of parts processed in the imports by the U.S. from China, or by imports by China from the U.S., may be hurt as well.”"

""But ultimately this would not only affect German manufacturers, but also consumers in the United States,"" Martin Wansleben said in a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to delay a decision on imposing tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months, three Trump administration officials told Reuters, avoiding opening yet another front in his global trade battles.

402,By Investing.com,"<span>May 17, 2019 04:28AM ET</span>",StockBeat - EasyJet Defies Market Gloom With Upbeat Outlook,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Is  Easyjet  about to turn a corner?
Europe’s second biggest discount airline (LON:EZJ) has had a miserable last 12 months, losing over 42% on a combination of rising fuel prices, overcapacity, drone-related disruptions at London’s Gatwick airport and weaker-than-expected growth across the continent.
All overshadowed, of course, by the uncertainty created by Brexit, which managed to rear its ugly head again on Thursday as the Conservative Party ramped up preparations to ditch Prime Minister Theresa May before the scheduled exit date of Oct. 31.
But this morning, Easyjet stock is up over 2.7%, after the airline stuck to its full-year target despite posting its biggest-ever loss for the six months through March, the first half of its fiscal year.
It’s a rare bright spot on a morning overshadowed yet again by fears of the U.S.’s trade war with China and the growing risk of an actual shooting war with Iran. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.8 points, or 0.5%, at 381.60. The FTSE 100 fell 0.4% while the German Dax dropped 0.6% and the Italian FTSE MIB faring a little better, slipped 0.3%.
Partly, that’s because the results are no worse than the airline warned six weeks ago. And partly it’s down to the fact that management is still reckoning on a strong summer season (which appears to have started with a decent performance over Easter). And partly it’s due to CEO Johan Lundgren saying that the company will likely ease up on adding new seats next year.
EasyJet has been one of the main drivers of a big increase in capacity over the last year, as airlines bet on a sustained rise in European demand that failed to materialize due to the economic slowdown.
It’s planning to add nearly twice as many seats as its competitors over the next six months. That means it’s more than usually dependent on consumers overcoming their Brexit angst and committing to a summer break.
Elsewhere Friday, EasyJet competitor  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) soared over 13% on Thursday on the back of a report in the Spanish newspaper Expansion saying that takeover interest in the airline is reviving. That’s despite IAG (LON:ICAG) CEO Willie Walsh saying last week that he wasn’t looking at renewing his interest after two unsuccessful bids for the company at a much higher price last year. Oslo's stock exchange is closed for a holiday today."

NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Luckin Coffee Inc, the Chinese challenger to  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), on Thursday priced its U.S. initial public offering at the top end of its targeted range and sold more shares than planned in the biggest U.S. float by a Chinese firm this year.
The Beijing-based coffee chain raised $561 million by selling 33 million American depositary shares (ADS), more than the 30 million it originally said it would sell, at $17 each - at the top end of an indicative range of $15 to $17.
Each ADS represents eight Class A shares, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week.
The pricing values loss-making Luckin, already backed by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and U.S. money manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), at about $4.2 billion.
Luckin is due to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Friday under the symbol ""LK"".
The IPO comes as Chinese-U.S. trade tensions involving tit-for-tat tariffs rattle global financial markets. In total, Chinese firms have raised $619 million in U.S. IPOs so far this year, down sharply from $3.7 billion in the same period in 2017, Refinitiv data showed.
Luckin is the latest Chinese start-up tapping international capital markets to bolster coffers amid ever-intensifying competition with bigger rivals, notably Starbucks, at the home market.
Luckin currently operates 2,370 stores across China and plans to open 2,500 more this year with the goal of displacing Starbucks as China's largest coffee chain.
The coffee chain, co-founded in June 2017 by Chief Executive Qian Zhiya, plans to primarily use the IPO proceeds for store network expansion, customer acquisition, marketing, research and development. 
The brand is banking on increased coffee consumption in China, expected to rise to 15.5 billion cups by 2023 from 8.7 billion last year, according to a report cited by Luckin in its prospectus.
The company has warned it may continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future. Last year, it recorded a net loss to shareholders of $475.4 million and total revenue of $125.27 million, according to the filing. For the first three months of 2019, it posted a net loss of $85.3 million.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), CICC, Haitong International and KeyBanc Capital Markets are among the banks underwriting the IPO.

404,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 03:47AM ET</span>",Chinese firms' missing $6 billion tests regulators' resolve,"By Samuel Shen and Shu Zhang
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cash is considered among the hardest assets for a company to fake, which is why the disappearance of a combined $6.1 billion from two Chinese companies has dumbfounded investors and forced regulators to take action.
Drugmaker Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, a constituent of MSCI's global indexes, in April said an ""accounting error"" led it to overstate cash in 2017 by 29.94 billion yuan ($4.4 billion). This month, Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co Ltd, a producer of high-polymer materials, said its auditor could find no trace of the 12.21 billion yuan that it said it held in a bank deposit.
Regulators are investigating both cases and neither company has offered detailed explanations for the missing billions.
Weak governance has long been a black mark against mainland Chinese companies. Yet these cases have still stunned many investors as they involve straightforward cash, and because the sheer size of the disappearances is equivalent to more than half the two groups' combined market capitalization before they disclosed the issues, triggering calls for tougher punishment for any corporate wrongdoing. 
""If you tell me fish in a pond disappeared, I probably would buy the story... Tens of billions of deposits missing, that's a bit unthinkable,"" Liu Enqi, vice head of Bank of Nanjing Co Ltd, told Reuters. ""If such things happened in the U.S., someone would be jailed.""
Pan Jiang, chief executive of asset manager Shanghai V-invest Co, said the cases were ""beyond description"".
""If regulators just let bad guys walk away, it would be a huge blow to investor confidence,"" he said.
Officials appear to be listening. China's top securities regulator, Yi Huiman, told a conference on May 11 that ""those who did bad things must pay the price"". The chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) also vowed to tighten scrutiny of corporate governance and push for tougher punishment.
Shi Donghui, a senior researcher at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, at a seminar this month said the bourse would ""resolutely"" delist any companies found to have seriously violated disclosure rules.
FAKING THE UNFAKABLE
Accounting issues take place the world over. When it comes to manipulation, common ploys include inflating asset values, faking customers and overstating money owed. Companies also face more straightforward crimes such as theft.
But cash, sitting in bank accounts, is low on that list. Any big-sum cash fraud would be tough to pull off without help from bankers or auditors, said accounting consultant Ma Junsheng.
Rose Zhang, a partner at Zhong Xi, an accounting firm that audits over 25 China-listed companies, said collusion was likely in cases of disappearing cash because ""it is impossible for deposits to vanish out of the blue"".
Kangmei disclosed its issue on April 30 and has said almost nothing beyond its initial diagnosis of ""accounting error"". It said China's securities watchdog was investigating the matter. Kangmei's auditor GP Certified Public Accountants was also put under investigation, according to local media reports and the auditor.
Kangde Xin also disclosed a CSRC probe. In a series of statements this month, it said it did not exclude the possibility that its cash was appropriated by controlling shareholder Kangde Group. It is also said it was seeking to sue deposit holder Bank of Beijing Co Ltd.
Kangde Group's chairman, Zhong Yu, has been detained, the police said in a separate statement without elaborating.
Kangde Xin declined to comment further when contacted by Reuters. Repeated calls and a text message to Bank of Beijing went unanswered. Neither Kangde Group nor the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission immediately responded to requests for comment. Reuters could not reach a representative for detained shareholder Zhong.
Kangmei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. GP declined to comment.
ANTS VS ELEPHANTS
The scale of the incidents has sparked calls for China to crack down on corporate wrongdoing.
Under securities law, a listed company that makes false disclosure can be fined up to 600,000 yuan, while the criminal law states those who conceal or intentionally destroy accounting records can be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to 200,000 yuan.
""The amount of the fine cannot adequately compensate investor losses caused by corporate fraud,"" said Xie Lianjie, a partner with Beijing Yingke Law Firm Shanghai Office. His team was contacted by more than 100 investors who lost money in the two stocks following the missing money disclosures.
In addition, China does not have a mechanism for group legal action - famously embodied by U.S. class-action lawsuits - making it expensive for small investors to pursue companies for damages.
""It's like a war between ants and elephants,"" said Xu Caiyuan, an activist investor.
Jia Wu, U.S.-based accounting professor at University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, said China needs an equivalent to the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which closed a series of accounting and auditing loopholes and made executives personally liable for the accuracy of financial statements.
""You need to put wrongdoers behind bars,"" Wu said. ""You need a powerful deterrent.""
Last year, China ranked 10th in a widely followed regional ranking of corporate governance, far below nearby India, and above only Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea, according to the report by brokerage CLSA and the Asian Corporate Governance Association. Among categories measured, China scored particularly poorly for management discipline, independence from controlling shareholders, and for transparency - a key issue in the Kangde Xin and Kangmei cases.

""If information in this market is inadequate, and fake, there's no basis for fair pricing,"" said Hong Yan, professor of finance at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. ""That would make the market a casino.""

HONGKONG/FRANKFURT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global private equity firms Bain Capital,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and KKR & Co are among potential bidders for Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Ltd's chemical unit, three people familiar with the situation told Reuters.
Hitachi plans to sell its majority stake in Hitachi Chemical and the process could start as early as this month, Reuters has reported.
The conglomerate shortlisted a select group of financial sponsors and strategic suitors for the bidding process after initial conversations with interested parties earlier this year, two of the people said, declining to be identified as the information is confidential.
The three private equity firms declined to comment.
Hitachi owns 51.2 percent in its chemical unit, which is worth about $2.9 billion based on Hitachi Chemical's $5.7 billion market value at Friday's close. 
Hitachi Chemical's share price, which closed at 3,025 yen apiece on Friday, has almost doubled since the beginning of this year, bouncing back from 2018 when it was hit by a series of scandals.
Hitachi and Hitachi Chemical declined to comment.
Global private equity investors has been increasingly interested in Japan since Bain led a consortium in an $18 billion deal in 2016 for Toshiba Corp's memory chip unit, as many large companies in the country are expected to consider a series of spin-offs amid a government drive to improve corporate governance and boost shareholder returns.
Japan inbound deal value - at $6.7 billion as of Thursday - grew over seven times from the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data. Private equity-backed deals have amounted to $1.58 billion, up 76% year-on-year, despite a big drop in total number of deals, the data showed.
Hitachi last year agreed to buy a majority stake in ABB's power grid unit. It said last month it would acquire U.S. firm JR Automation Technologies, which makes logistic systems using industrial robots, for $1.4 billion.

Its divestitures include semiconductor equipment maker Hitachi Kokusai Electric Inc and the power tool unit Hitachi Koki, both of which were sold to KKR.

408,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 02:05AM ET</span>",New Zealand central bank revokes ANZ's permission to assess operational risk capital,"By Charlotte Greenfield
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank has revoked Australia and New Zealand Banking Group's local license to calculate its own operational risk capital due to ""persistent"" control failures, adding to the bank's minimum capital requirement in the country.
The censure comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is undertaking broader measures to increase capital requirements and reduce risk to the financial system in the event of any major shock.
ANZ's New Zealand unit would now be required to use the central bank's standardized approach for calculating operational risk, raising its minimum capital requirement to NZ$760 million ($496.4 million), the RBNZ said in a statement.
Shares in ANZ's New Zealand unit, listed on the local stock exchange, closed 3.1% lower at NZ$27.25.
ANZ is the biggest of the four Australian-owned banks that dominate the New Zealand market. It is accredited by the Reserve Bank to calculate its own regulatory capital requirements, but an internal review in April revealed that ANZ was not using the operational risk model the central bank had approved. 
""ANZ's directors have attested to compliance despite the approved model not being used since 2014,"" RBNZ's deputy governor, Geoff Bascand, said in a statement.
""The fact that this issue was not identified for so long highlights a persistent weakness with ANZ's assurance process.""
The operational risk model is one of several used by ANZ to asses its risk capital, a spokeswoman for the bank said.
ANZ said it accepts the regulator's decision, which would mean that as of March 31 the bank's operational risk capital requirement increased by NZ$277 million.
""While isolated, and with no impact on customers or the operation of the bank, ANZ New Zealand is disappointed this error occurred,"" it said in an emailed statement.
The bank said it will work with RBNZ as it assesses whether it has appropriate verification processes in place.
In late 2017, the RBNZ forced Westpac Banking Corp's New Zealand unit to keep higher capital levels until it fixed issues with its risk model's governance, processes, and documentation. (https://reut.rs/2EhEt0S)
As part of its broader measures for the financial industry, RBNZ has already proposed raising top banks' capital ratio to 16%, indicating the country's top four banks, including ANZ, could collectively have to raise NZ$20 billion in new capital over the next five years, which could push up borrowing costs. 

A decision is expected in the third quarter.

409,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 01:50AM ET</span>",Yuan slides past key 6.9/dollar mark on fresh U.S.-China tensions,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan fell past the psychologically-important 6.9 per dollar level to its weakest in nearly five months on Friday, amid signs of an escalation in Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
The Chinese currency is set for a fifth straight weekly loss and has already shed around 2.5 percent to the dollar since U.S. President Donald Trump said on May 5 he was going to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports.
Market sentiment has been hurt further by U.S. government moves to block China's Huawei Technologies from buying vital American technology, throwing into question prospects for sales at some of the largest tech companies and drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing.
Traders and analysts said many corporate clients had set the strike price for their option contracts at around 6.9 per dollar, meaning a breach of that level could quickly send the Chinese currency to 7. 
The yuan has lost all its gains made this year. Markets are now debating whether the authorities will let the renminbi breach the 7 per dollar level, which was last seen during the global financial crisis. 
Prior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the midpoint rate to 6.8859 per dollar, 171 pips or 0.25 percent weaker than the previous fix of 6.8688. Friday's fixing was the weakest since Dec. 27, 2018.
In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 6.9000 per dollar, fell to a low of 6.9099 at one point, the softest level since Dec. 24, 2018.
At midday, spot yuan was changing hands at 6.9068, 228 pips weaker than the previous late session close and 0.30 percent softer than the midpoint.
If the yuan finishes late night trade at the midday level, it would have lost 1.3 percent to the dollar for the week, the biggest weekly loss since July 2018.
But losses in the onshore yuan were capped as several traders said investors were unwilling to test fresh lows below 6.9 per dollar - a level the market widely believes the authorities will guard to prevent it from sinking further.
""The market does not dare to buy a lot of dollars, as investors are worried that the central bank could step in any time soon,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank.
Philip Wee, FX strategist at DBS, said the yuan was likely to be capped at 7 per dollar ahead of a possible meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in late June.
""Assuming the Xi-Trump meeting takes place next month, no one expects a trade deal, if any, to roll back existing tariffs but to hold off Trump's threat to hit a 25 percent tariff on the remaining $325 billion of Chinese goods,"" he said in a note on Friday.

The offshore yuan weakened to 6.9420 in morning trade, erasing all the gains made since the previous Trump-Xi meeting in November. It traded at 6.94 per dollar as of midday.

Gold futures for June delivery, traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, were at $1,286.95 by 1:37 AM ET (05:37 GMT), up 0.06%.
The safe-haven metal rose above the $1,300 level earlier this week amid intensifying trade dispute between the U.S. and China, but began to decline as a strong rebound in U.S. stock market this week boosted investors’ risk appetite.
A batch of stronger U.S. economic data released overnight were cited as a catalyst for the selling in the precious metal today.
The number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell to 212,000 from the week prior, data showed, indicating that the U.S. economy continues to be strong despite the ongoing trade dispute with China.
U.S. homebuilding also increased more than expected in April. Housing starts rose 5.7% to 1.235 million units last month, data showed.
The U.S. dollar also rose and hit a two-week high overnight following the release of the data, putting more pressure on the safe-haven gold.
“We have seen repeated attempts in the last few days to rise above $1 300 and it (gold) appears to be facing some kind of barrier. There is clearly some selling when it hits that level,” said Capital Economics analyst Ross Strachan.
Reports of U.S. sanctions on Chinese telecoms company Huawei limited bullion’s losses as traders await further news on the Sino-U.S. trade front.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Commerce said it had put Huawei and 70 affiliates to its “Entity List,” a blacklist that could forbid it from doing business with American companies.

411,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>",Palladium boom gives South African miners only temporary reprieve,"By Zandi Shabalala
LONDON (Reuters) - A surge in palladium prices has thrown struggling South African mining companies a lifeline. But it may not be enough.
Besides patchy power supplies and high labor costs, South African miners are saddled with ore that typically produces twice as much platinum as palladium - just at a time a global platinum surplus is weighing on prices.
Russia's Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel), the world's biggest palladium producer, meanwhile, has emerged as the winner from the reversal of platinum's long-standing premium over palladium, because the ore it mines is far richer in the latter.
Unlike South African mines, Nornickel's ore produces four times as much palladium as platinum and the company has lower extraction costs, leaving it in prime position to benefit from palladium's bull run and reinforce its dominance.
Nornickel said in November it would spend $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion in the coming years to boost its metals output. It plans to raise production of platinum group metals (PGMs) from its Arctic mines by 25% from 2017 levels by 2025 - an increase of about 860,000 ounces.
Platinum and palladium are both mainly used in autocatalysts to reduce car exhaust pollution. But while palladium goes into gasoline cars, platinum is mainly used in diesel vehicles and it has fallen out of favor since the emissions cheating scandal.
""We see the current palladium premium over platinum as sustainable in the mid-term as it is justified by higher fair value-in-use in the automotive industry,"" said a Nornickel spokeswoman.
Palladium hit a record $1,620 an ounce in March, a surge of nearly 100 percent since August. It has slipped back to around $1,335, but is still more expensive than gold.
Platinum, meanwhile, sank to a 10-year low of $751 an ounce in August, a far cry from a peak of $2,290 in 2008. Platinum prices are now around $850, partly supported by bets from some investors who believe the price has sunk too low.
""Norilsk is benefiting handsomely from the higher palladium price and most of South African mining can't keep up,"" said Nedbank analyst Arnold Van Graan. 
Palladium vs other precious metals: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WLcFct 
'DEEP TROUBLE'
Spending more to crank up production and take advantage of record palladium prices just leaves South African miners with even more platinum when the market is expected to have a surplus for the fourth year in a row. For Nornickel, investing to expand makes more sense given the market dynamics.
""Palladium is now the largest revenue source for Nornickel, followed by nickel and copper and therefore investors like the purer exposure to key industrial metals,"" said Roger Jones, a fund manager and head of equities at London & Capital.
According to consultants Metals Focus, higher car industry demand should leave the palladium market with a deficit of 574,000 ounces in 2019, the eighth year of shortfalls in a row. Platinum is expected to have a surplus of 630,000 ounces.
Platinum supply-demand balance: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VXZOXe 
Overall, the basket price of PGMs in South Africa has risen about 30% over the past year thanks to palladium, but miners are not generating enough returns given the composition of their ore to boost production significantly.
""It's a tremendous difference from a year ago but we are not out of the woods yet as a sector,"" Northam Platinum CEO Paul Dunne said, adding that the PGM basket price would need to rise another 20% for most South African mines to be sustainable.
In 2018, margins for South African platinum miners were negative on average, the industry made an aggregate loss and capital expenditure was less than a billion dollars, said industry group Minerals Council South Africa.
Rising costs, including higher wages and electricity bills, are also eating away at margins.
""The reality is the industry is still in deep, deep trouble,"" said James Wellsted, spokesman for Sibanye-Stillwater. 
""They might be making a little bit of money now but it's still not high enough to justify investment in projects that will extend the lives of the operation,"" he said.
Sibanye has fared better than its rivals partly thanks to its higher exposure to palladium after its acquisition of U.S. mining company Stillwater in 2017. The addition of Stillwater means it now produces an even split of platinum and palladium.
Higher profits from its PGM operations offset a loss from its gold mines, which were hit by five months of strikes, to give it an adjusted core profit (EBITDA) of $12.5 million in the first three months of 2019.
OUT ON A LIMB
Lonmin, the world's fifth largest platinum miner, is being bought by Sibanye in an all-share deal to help both weather the markets after a series of strikes in South Africa and low prices battered Lonmin's balance sheet.
It made an annual pre-tax profit in its 2018 financial year after four years of losses but is sticking to its plan to cut high-cost production and focus on its newer ""Generation 2"" operations.
""Despite the progress made, this does not provide a long-term solution to the capital structure challenges faced by Lonmin, as it is still inadequate to invest in the new projects necessary to avoid shaft closures and job losses and maintain our production profile,"" Chief Executive Ben Magara said.
 Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum (Amplats), the top South African palladium producer, resumed dividends in 2017 for the first time since 2011 and raised its dividend payout-ratio this year, but it too is shying away from major spending.
Instead, it is focusing on incremental increases from its palladium-rich Mogalakwena mine. Amplats is studying how to lift PGM output from Mogalakwena by about 500,000 ounces in four to five years from 1.2 million ounces last year.
Mogalakwena sits in the Northern limb of the South African platinum belt where the ore contains relatively more palladium.
But most mines owned by the major miners sit on the Western limb. They contain more platinum, are older and much deeper, making them more expensive and labor intensive to mine.
Impala Platinum, which has seen its profits rise, is closing shafts and cutting thousands of jobs at its Rustenburg mine to try to return it to profitability.
Impala is reviewing an option to raise its stake in a palladium deposit owned by Platinum Group Metals but plans no major expansion itself. It will be cutting platinum output by 230,000 ounces by the end of next year.

""The fact is, we get the metal in the ratio that it was put there and its very difficult mostly in South Africa to change that mix,"" said Amplats Chief Executive Chris Griffith.

412,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>",Sony Surges After Announcing Another Record Stock Buyback,"(Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp (T:6758). jumped to its highest since December after Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida unveiled another record share buyback just months after completing a similar program.
The Tokyo-based company soared as much as 8.8% on Friday after announcing it will purchase as much as 4.8% of its outstanding shares, spending up to 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion). The repurchase period begins Friday and lasts till March 31. That comes after it spent 100 billion yen from February to buy 1.5% of stock, then the largest buyback in history in terms of value.
Yoshida’s move underscores a commitment to supporting the stock price as Sony became the latest Japanese company to announce a buyback of at least $1 billion. Executives in the country are becoming increasingly responsive to shareholder activism and purchasing stock is the CEO’s preferred tool to thwart pressure from investors in a deteriorating economic and market environment. His company is grappling with plateauing smartphone demand and fewer blockbuster titles for the aging PlayStation 4. Escalating tensions between the U.S. and China now also cloud the global economic outlook.
“This is a message that investors shouldn’t sell Sony just because the rest of the market is falling,” said Makoto Kikuchi, founder of Myojo Asset Management Co.
With the back-to-back stock repurchases, Yoshida is beginning to leave his mark as CEO on the storied electronics giant. The finance guru was elevated to the position about a year ago and so far has earned a reputation more for cost cuts and buybacks than long-term strategic decisions. Thursday’s announcement would mean spending about 14% of Sony’s total cash reserves purchasing its own stock.
Analysts at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and SMBC Securities Inc. upgraded their price targets for the shares after the news.
“The second buyback in quick succession suggests that the management finds the current stock price attractive,” wrote Jefferies Group senior analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a report. “We expect a less bearish/more bullish Sony management on IR day (21 May).”
The buyback will likely dominate conversations on May 21, when executives will update investors about their strategy. Shareholders will be looking for an explanation after the company last month abruptly withdrew some of its medium-term profit targets, saying the operating environment was changing drastically.
Operating profit will be mostly flat this fiscal year after adjusting for one-time items, the company announced last month. Prior to Thursday’s announcement, shares had gained 3.1% since the results -- compared with a 5% drop for the broader Japanese market -- as analysts were surprised that Yoshida’s outlook was less conservative than expected.
Not everyone was convinced the record buybacks will lead to more gains. Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Pte in Singapore, began on Friday recommending that investor sell Sony shares, saying the firm’s profit forecast won’t hold up given more poor phone demand and growing competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in video games.
Sony on Thursday separately announced a new partnership with bitter rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). in cloud gaming, underscoring the challenges the PlayStation faces in scaling its cloud infrastructure.
“The partnership with Microsoft with the cloud on gaming was a surprising move,” Anvarzadeh said. “It shows that both firms are taking Google’s Stadia venture very seriously.”

413,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2019 12:35AM ET</span>","China plans to cut jet fuel prices to aid airlines, consumers","By Chen Aizhu and Min Zhang
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is planning to lower wholesale aviation fuel prices as early as July, part of Beijing's pledge to reduce business costs in a slowing economy, said an oil industry executive and a spokeswoman with the Chinese aviation authority. 
The cuts will apply to both ex-refinery prices and rates charged to airlines by China's dominant jet fuel distributor China National Aviation Fuel Group (CNAF), and could amount to a total annual savings to airlines of more than one billion yuan ($145 million), said the industry executive on Thursday. 
""This is part of the aviation authority's response to the (Chinese) Cabinet's call to help smaller businesses and consumers, as the economy is really slowing,"" said the executive, who declined to be named due to company policy. 
The National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) is expected to tweak a formula that has been used since 2011 to set the domestically produced aviation fuel prices charged by state oil refiners, said the executive. 
Changes will also be made to a separate formula set by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) that regulates fuel prices charged to airlines that fly international routes, he said. 
The government will lower the fixed premiums previously set in the formulas, which are linked to prevailing Asian spot prices of jet fuel, as well as cut marketing and operational fees, said the executive. 
The executive did not give any further details, and the NDRC did not respond to a faxed request for comment. 
A CAAC spokeswoman said the price cuts will start in July including reductions to marketing and operational charges, but she gave no details on the changes to the pricing formulas. 
Calls to the press office of CNAF, the dominant aviation fuel distributor, went unanswered. 
The proposed price cuts come on top of CAAC's plan to halve the levy that airlines pay into the civil aviation development fund and will benefit China Eastern Airlines Co Ltd, Air China Ltd and other operators. 
Singapore free-on-board spot jet fuel prices have so far this year gained nearly 30% to about $84.40 per barrel. 
The industry executive said China's stimulus would likely help counter slowing growth in China's air traffic. 

China's air passenger traffic in April rose 4.6% from a year earlier, recovering slightly from March's 4.0% growth, which marked the slowest gain in three years, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.

414,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Places Huawei and Scores of Affiliates on Export Blacklist,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration said restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. announced this week will take effect Friday, placing China’s largest technology company and scores of its affiliates around the world on a blacklist that curtails its access to critical U.S. suppliers.
In a Federal Register notice released on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the curbs, apply to Huawei and 67 of its affiliates scattered across 26 countries from Germany to Madagascar. They were mainly private subsidiaries that the networking giant owns and uses to trade or conduct business in different cities or countries, and hence prime targets should the White House decide to pursue export restrictions.
The Trump administration is pulling out the big guns in its push to slow China’s rise, with potentially devastating consequences for the rest of the world. If the U.S. blocks the sale to Huawei of critical components such as semiconductors, it could cripple Huawei’s businesses, depress the business of American chip giants from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. to Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)., and potentially disrupt the rollout of critical 5G wireless networks around the world.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday it will soon put Huawei on an “Entity List” -- meaning any U.S. company will need a special license to sell products to the world’s largest networking gear maker and second-largest smartphone brand. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Bloomberg Television the measures limiting its access to U.S. components become official on Friday. Separately, he said President Donald Trump had given his department 150 days to establish a process to screen U.S. companies’ purchases of equipment from the Chinese firm, and other equipment providers with which officials have concerns.
The threat is likely to elevate fears in Beijing that Trump’s broader goal is to contain China, igniting a protracted cold war between the world’s biggest economies. In addition to a trade fight that has rattled global markets for months, the U.S. has pressured both allies and foes to avoid using Huawei for 5G networks that will form the backbone of the modern economy.
Ross dodged questions about whether the new moves against Huawei could lead to a negotiation with the company or the Chinese government. He insisted the growing campaign against Huawei remained a separate matter from broader trade negotiations between the U.S. and China, which have stalled in recent days.
“The purpose we have in mind here is we think there is a significant danger to national security and to our foreign policy of the existing situation at Huawei,’’ Ross said.
In notice published Thursday, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security said the U.S. was adding Huawei’s affiliated companies around the world because they “pose a significant risk of involvement in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.’’
“This decision is in no one’s interest,” Huawei said in a statement on Thursday. “It will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business, affect tens of thousands of American jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain.”
The U.S. has long accused the telecommunications equipment giant of facilitating Chinese espionage and sought to convince allies not to purchase its equipment for new 5G networks. The Justice Department is prosecuting Huawei over accusations of bank fraud, technology theft and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.
How Huawei Became a  Target  (NYSE:TGT) for Governments: QuickTake
Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of its founder, was detained in Canada in December at the request of the U.S., which seeks her extradition over allegations of violating Iran sanctions. Huawei has denied any wrongdoing and sued the U.S. separately for a ban on American government entities from purchasing its equipment.
Teresa He, president of Huawei’s chip-making unit HiSilicon, called the U.S. ban “crazy” and “groundless” in a letter sent to employees and seen by Bloomberg. While HiSilicon was seen as a backup plan for Huawei’s semiconductor supply, the ban will make it a primary supplier, she said in her letter.

418,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 10:17PM ET</span>",Bayer bets on 'silver bullet' defense in Roundup litigation; experts see hurdles,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) plans to argue that a $2 billion jury award and thousands of U.S. lawsuits claiming its glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup causes cancer should be tossed because a U.S. regulatory agency said the herbicide is not a public health risk.
Some legal experts believe Bayer will have a tough time convincing appellate courts to throw out verdicts and lawsuits on those grounds. Bayer has a better shot if a business-friendly U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, experts said. But that could take years.
Bayer has come under intensifying pressure after a third consecutive U.S. jury on Monday found Roundup to be carcinogenic, awarding more than $2 billion to a couple who used the chemical on their property - the largest verdict in the glyphosate litigation to date. 
Bayer, which inherited the Roundup litigation with its $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year, faces lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs nationwide, alleging the product causes cancer.
The Germany-based company's shares have been hammered since the first Roundup cancer verdict against it last August, wiping out some 40 billion euros ($44.76 billion) in market value and leaving Bayer worth less than the price it paid for Monsanto. 
Bayer denies that Roundup causes cancer, saying decades of studies have shown glyphosate and the weed killer to be safe.
On Wednesday, the company said it will argue that the lawsuits, which are brought under state law, conflict with guidance from a federal agency, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
On April 30, the EPA reaffirmed prior guidance saying that glyphosate is not a carcinogen and not a risk to public health when used in accordance with its current label..
Citing the EPA decision, Bayer has repeatedly rebuked plaintiffs' calls to add a cancer warning to Roundup, saying the agency would reject that change.
Under the legal doctrine of preemption, state law claims are barred if they conflict with federal law.
""We have very strong arguments that the claims here are preempted ... and the recent EPA registration decision is an important aspect of that defense,"" William Hoffman, one of Bayer's lawyers, said during a call with reporters on Wednesday. Hoffman said the argument applied to all U.S. Roundup lawsuits.
Preemption is generally regarded as a ""silver bullet defense"" because it stops claims across the board, said Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. 
But Zimmerman and three other legal experts agreed that Bayer faces a big hurdle convincing appeals courts that the EPA determination on glyphosate shields it from state law claims.
They cited a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the EPA's approval of a product does not necessarily bar state law claims. The ruling, Bates v Dow Agrosciences, gives broad leeway to juries to decide if such claims should proceed, they said.
Judges in the three Roundup cases that have gone to trial against Monsanto all rejected the company's preemption argument, citing this ruling.
""In light of the Bates decision, it's going to be an uphill battle for the company to win on preemption on appeal,"" Zimmerman said.
Bayer also said it will argue on appeal that trial courts improperly admitted evidence that was not backed up by science. But legal experts said appellate courts generally defer to lower court evidentiary rulings.
'SORE THUMB'
Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida, said Bayer's chances of success would increase significantly if the Supreme Court takes up the Roundup appeals.
The high court only accepts around 70 cases each year, but a business-friendly majority on the court could be inclined to hear the dispute, said Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. 
Since 2005, the high court has decided at least three preemption cases in favor of companies, none of which involved the EPA.
The Supreme Court will soon rule in another case that rests on whether a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval preempts tort claims.
In that case, plaintiffs sued Merck & Co over the company's alleged failure to warn of the risk of serious bone fractures associated with its osteoporosis drug Fosamax. 
Merck, which denies the allegations, argued the lawsuits should be preempted because the FDA did not require an additional fracture warning in the drug's prescribing information. During a January hearing, the Justices appeared to side with the company.
Bayer in a statement on Thursday said it does not believe the 2005 Bates ruling posed a barrier for the appellate courts due to other Supreme Court rulings since then.
Noah agreed that the Court has more recently signaled its appetite to limit lawsuits that contradict opinions by experts at regulatory agencies. 

""The Bates decision by now sticks out like a sore thumb,"" Noah said. ""Bayer has more than enough ammunition in recent Supreme Court cases to show the trial court judges got it wrong.""

419,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 16, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",Tesla Fires Sound Alarms About Electric-Car Battery Safety,"(Bloomberg) -- Electric vehicles may be less prone to catch fire than gas guzzlers, but recent blazes involving Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and NIO Inc. cars in Greater China are prompting the industry to take steps to alleviate concerns from potential customers.
Worries heightened after reports emerged of a fire involving a Tesla in a Hong Kong parking lot. Weeks earlier, a video on Chinese social media platforms showed a Tesla bursting into flames in a Shanghai garage. Separately, NIO said last month that one of its ES8 vehicles caught fire in the northwestern city of Xi’an while being repaired, and on Thursday disclosed that smoke came out of the same model of car in Shanghai, with firefighters extinguishing it.
“Battery combustion is a very serious incident for consumers, and it could lead to consumer aversion to electric vehicles,” Automotive Energy Supply Corp., whose batteries power about 430,000 Nissan Motor Co. vehicles, said in an email. “We are determined not to cause serious accidents and put damage on the industry, and we believe that now it is more important to proceed with caution.”
There’s reason to be worried. Should Chinese consumers slow their shift to plug-ins because of safety concerns, it would be a serious blow to the nascent segment. The nation accounts for more than half of all electric passenger-car sales worldwide.
While China is forecast to remain the largest market for the next two decades, sales are already slowing and growth will probably continue decelerating until 2021 as the government phases out subsidies, according to BloombergNEF.
In response to the latest incident, Tesla is rolling out an over-the-air software update for two of its vehicles, including the flagship Model S, to improve safety and battery life as it continues investigating the cause of the Hong Kong fire. The action will revise charge and thermal-management settings “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said in a statement. Teslas are 10 times less likely to experience a blaze than cars that run on combustion engines, the company said.
Early findings on the incident in Hong Kong showed only a few battery modules -- clusters of smaller cells -- were affected, and that the majority of the car’s battery pack was undamaged, according to Tesla. Hong Kong’s Transport Department said it’s liaising closely with the company on the May 12 incident and the one in Shanghai, given the similarity of the cases.
Panasonic Corp., which makes Tesla’s batteries, didn’t specifically address the fires in an email. “We are working with car manufacturers to develop battery systems with higher performance while putting safety as our top priority,” the company said.
For EVs, the risk of a fire or explosion is comparable -- or potentially slightly lower -- than for gas or diesel-fueled models, according to a 2017 report commissioned by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, safety risks may increase as manufacturers work to boost performance and push battery cells closer to their limits, the study found.
The recent incidents weren’t unprecedented. In 2018, China recorded at least 40 fire-related cases involving new-energy vehicles -- a category that includes pure-electric, hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles -- according to the State Administration for Market Regulation.
The electric-car sector is grappling with the challenges of quality control, boosting performance and expanding capacity to meet rising demand for batteries, said Simon Moores, London-based managing director of industry consultant Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Demand for lithium-ion batteries for EVs will surge by more than 10 times through 2030, while prices will continue to tumble, according to BNEF.
Rapid growth means the sector “will no doubt see increasing quality control issues with the supply chain,” Moores said. “The biggest challenge for all EV makers is to ensure quality and consistency runs right through the supply chain -- from raw material selection to chemicals to battery cell -- and into the pack and vehicle.”
Though recent fires are negative for automakers, any impact on sales will probably be limited, said Toliver Ma, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co.
“Tesla and NIO have built up a large fan base and should be able to minimize the impact,” Ma said.
It’s not just cars. A series of at least 21 fires at energy-storage projects in South Korea between August 2017 and February, as well as a blaze at an Arizona facility last month fueled concern about the safety of lithium-ion batteries. Korean Reinsurance Co. almost tripled its rate for local storage projects in response, while new deployments in the nation this year may be about half of those in 2018, according to BNEF.
The incidents threaten to “slow the breakneck pace of adoption of grid storage systems,” said Sam Jaffe, managing director at Boulder, Colorado-based Cairn Energy Research Advisors. “It’s definitely a black eye for the stationary storage industry.”
Still, the recent storage fires in Korea may be isolated cases so they don’t necessarily point toward a global problem, BNEF analyst Logan Goldie-Scot wrote in a February report.
For both vehicles and storage systems, there is a suite of potential advances in battery technology that could upgrade safety, including the deployment of high-performance insulating materials, ceramic coatings for battery separators, and the use of solid electrolytes.
Solid-state batteries, in particular, are commercially promising as they would offer an upgrade from existing lithium-ion packs in terms of safety and driving range. Scientists, cell manufacturers and automakers from Japan to the U.S. are competing on the technology, with Toyota Motor Corp. seen as leading the field.
While some trial production of solid-state batteries is planned to begin in the early 2020s, it will be another decade before the products are widely available in mass-produced vehicles, according to BNEF.

420,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 08:22PM ET</span>",Walmart says higher China tariffs will increase prices for U.S. shoppers,"By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Thursday that prices for shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on goods from China as the world's largest retailer reported its best comparable sales growth for the first quarter in nine years.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart called out the impact of tariffs on consumers after Macy's Inc delivered a similar warning on Wednesday. The department store chain's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said tariffs on Chinese imports are hitting its furniture business and warned investors that additional levies would leave its clothing and accessory categories vulnerable.
U.S. President Donald Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% last week. The move is widely expected to raise prices on thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics. China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale.
Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview that higher tariffs will result in increased prices for consumers. He said the company will seek to ease the pain, in part by trying to obtain products from different countries and working with suppliers' ""costs structures to manage higher tariffs.""
Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said the potential impact on Walmart and its shoppers from tariffs is limited by its food business. Its grocery operation, which includes fresh food, contributes roughly 56 percent to overall revenue.
""We believe Walmart has the wherewithal both financially and via its vendor relationships to minimize the impact on both itself and its shopping base,"" he said.
Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call the company will maintain its ""low-price leadership"" and ""manage costs on an item-by-item basis."" But that position has been threatened, in part, by rising competition from discount chains like Aldi. 
Also, Walmart's vendors have started to raise prices, among them Del Monte Foods, which supplies fresh and packaged goods to Walmart, including mandarin oranges imported from China. Prices will go up again with tariffs rising.
""It’s not just tariffs. Transportation costs are up, labor costs are up. It’s an inflationary environment,"" Del Monte CEO Greg Longstreet told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference. ""A lot of that's going to have to be passed on. The consumer is going to have to pay more for a lot of critical goods.""
Walmart shares, which have gained 7% so far this year, closed up 1.4% at $101.31.
NO SIGNS OF SPENDING SLOWDOWN
Walmart CFO Biggs said the retailer has not seen signs of a slowdown in consumer spending. 
Investors and analysts expect U.S. spending to slow this year against a backdrop of rising debt, tariffs and economic uncertainty.
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in April as households cut back on purchases of vehicles and a range of other goods, reflecting a slowdown in economic growth after a temporary boost from exports and inventories in the first quarter.
Earlier this week, Walmart stepped up its online battle with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) by offering one-day delivery in some markets without a shipping fee, weeks after Amazon announced a similar plan.
Walmart said it will cost the company less than for two-day shipping since orders will come straight from warehouses closer to the customer and arrive in a single box rather than multiple packages.
Sales at Walmart's U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.4%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts estimated growth of 3.1%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Walmart has recorded over four straight years of sales growth, unmatched by any retailer.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.13 per share, beating expectations of $1.02 per share.
But profits remained under pressure as more revenue was generated by lower-margin online sales and as e-commerce investments rose.
Operating income fell 4.1% to $4.9 billion, in part because of Walmart's purchase of Indian e-commerce startup Flipkart last year.
In the United States, the largest piece of Walmart’s business, operating income grew 5.5% as some transportation costs eased.
Online sales rose 37%, slowing from the previous quarter's 43% increase but stronger than online sales growth at most of its brick-and-mortar rivals. The company has forecast a 35% increase in online sales this year. 
Total revenue was up 1% at $123.9 billion but lower than analysts' estimates of $125.03 billion, dragged down by the currency impact and lower international sales. Excluding currency, revenue was up 2.5% at $125.8 billion. 

On Tuesday, Walmart said it was considering a stock market listing for its British supermarket arm Asda, whose attempt to combine with rival J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) Plc was blocked by UK regulators last month.

421,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>","New round of claims against vendors, bondholders on tap in Puerto Rico bankruptcy","By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s federally appointed oversight board will file another round of lawsuits against government vendors and bondholders, Luc Despins, a lawyer representing unsecured creditors in the U.S. commonwealth's bankruptcy, said on Thursday.
U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing Puerto Rico's attempt to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations through a form of bankruptcy, approved on Thursday a stipulation between the board and an unsecured creditors committee allowing them to jointly pursue litigation ahead of a Monday deadline to file claims. 
The board recently filed a flurry of lawsuits seeking to recoup payments made to government vendors and owners of the island's general obligation bonds.
The new litigation will target Puerto Rico's Employees Retirement System (ERS) and Highways & Transportation Authority (HTA), which filed separate bankruptcy cases. In addition to going after vendors, the lawsuits will seek to invalidate liens claimed by bondholders over those entities' revenues, Despins said during Thursday's court hearing. Bond insurers objected to the move. 
Prior to defaulting on ERS and HTA debt, Puerto Rico used employer contributions made by government agencies and public entities to pay pension bonds, while toll revenues and other license fees covered HTA debt. 
Actions to recoup debt services payments will be filed against owners of pension bonds issued by the commonwealth and not against bondholders of highways authority debt, according to Despins. 
With a two-year statute of limitations ending for ERS and HTA on Monday, Swain noted: “The litigation must commence within the next few days.” 
In her ruling, the judge also took into account a new July 15 deadline set earlier this month by a U.S. appeals court for the seven-member oversight board to be reappointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
Swain said the oversight board’s future status ""remains in question"" and added that “in the face of that uncertainty, it would imprudent to deny” the stipulation. 
The appeals court handed some of the island's creditors a win in February, ruling that the board members' appointments were unconstitutional.

422,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 07:13PM ET</span>",Pinterest shares plummet on disappointing 2019 revenue forecast,"(Reuters) - Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc on Thursday forecast 2019 revenue broadly in line with Wall Street targets, disappointing investors who had expected more from the freshly public, high flying stock, and sending its shares down 16 percent.
The online scrapbook company's shares have risen 62% from its initial public offering price of $19 last month.
""Clearly the after-hours pullback is a reflection of investor expectations being too high heading into the quarter,"" DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.
Pinterest's sales outlook was a disappointment said Forte, especially given the high expectations reflected in the run up in shares.
The company expects full-year revenue between $1.055 billion and $1.08 billion, the mid point of which is slightly above analysts' estimate of $1.06 billion, driven by average revenue per user (ARPU) in the United States. 
Pinterest also said in a regulatory filing it would look to invest in its advertising products through the year. 
The company, which calls its users ""pinners"", added 291 million monthly active users globally in the first quarter, above estimates of 289.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ARPU globally rose 26% to 73 cents, the company said.
Net loss narrowed to $41.4 million in the quarter ended March 31 from $52.7 million a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the company lost 32 cents per share. 
Total revenue rose about 54% to $201.9 million, beating estimates of $200.6 million.

Unlike Pinterest, other companies that made their stock market debut in 2019 such as  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc have seen a steep drop. Uber shares have fallen nearly 18% since its IPO, while Lyft is down about 23%.

Of 12 new slots agreed with Japan, the DOT has tentatively allocated five for Delta, four for United, two for American Airlines Group Inc and one for Hawaiian Airlines. 
The extra slots for U.S. airlines, which are still pending final government approvals, were unlocked after Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. Air Force to open up new flight paths around a nearby U.S. air base, a move needed to boost Haneda movements in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Haneda is located closer to downtown Tokyo than the capital's other international airport Narita, and flies to more destinations throughout Japan, making it attractive for both business travelers and tourists.
Under the proposal announced on Thursday, Delta would receive new slots for flights between Haneda and Seattle, Detroit, Atlanta, Portland and Honolulu.
United would be able to fly from Newark, Chicago, Washington-Dulles and Los Angeles, while American would fly from Dallas and Los Angeles, and Hawaiian Airlines from Honolulu.

Objections to the proposed allocations are due by May 30, with answers to the objections due by June 10, the DOT said, noting that it will consider all of the material before reaching a final decision.

Tesla earlier this month closed a $2.7 billion offering of stock and convertible notes, giving it much needed cash as it ramps up production.
Musk in an email to employees, seen by Reuters, said its net proceeds from the offering gave Tesla only 10 months to achieve breakeven at the rate it was burning cash in the first quarter.
""That is why, going forward, all expenses of any kind anywhere in the word, including parts, salary, travel expenses, rent, literally every payment that leaves our bank account must (be) reviewed,"" Musk said.
Tesla's attempts to cut costs are not new. In April 2018, in an email sent to employees, Musk said he had instructed his finance team to ""comb through every expense worldwide"" to find possible cuts. 
More recently, Tesla laid off 9 percent, and 7 percent of its workforce in June 2018, and January, respectively. 

The new initiative comes after a tumultuous year for Tesla which has seen analysts and investors cast doubt on its ability to produce, sell and deliver enough cars to make a sustainable profit.

CRRC Corp Ltd has launched a charm campaign in the United States as it seeks to secure a Washington D.C. metro car contract worth over $500 million, after roaring into the American passenger rail market by dramatically underbidding foreign rivals.
Concerns CRRC could soon set its sights on the much more lucrative U.S. freight market and use its railcars to spy on passengers have prompted a series of legislative proposals. A bipartisan bill unveiled in the U.S. House this week, which mirrors one proposed in the Senate earlier this year, would prevent transit agencies from spending federal dollars on projects awarded to CRRC.
At a House hearing on state-owned enterprises and rail, Phillip Washington, chief executive of Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was asked by Arkansas Republican Rick Crawford if he knew CRRC was a Chinese state-owned enterprise ""hellbent on conquering the rail market.""
""I stand by our procurement,"" Washington said, noting CRRC's bid in 2017 offered the best terms on the $647 million contract to build 64 subway cars for the city. 
CRRC was not invited to testify at the hearing, just weeks before the May 31 due date for bids for the Washington D.C. tender.
""CRRC has no plans of building freight railcars in the U.S. and is focused exclusively on the manufacture of passenger railcars in the U.S.,"" said Dave Smolenksy, a spokesman for CRRC's Chicago-based unit. 
While some experts see the cyber security fears as overblown, many see CRRC's likely expansion into the American freight market as a significant security and economic concern. 

During the hearing, Crawford read a CRRC tweet that appears to have been deleted: ""So far 83% of all rail products in the world are operated by #CRRC or are CRRC ones. How long will it take for us conquering the remaining 17%?""

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - A U.S. bid to block China's Huawei Technologies from buying vital American technology threw into question prospects for sales at some of the largest tech companies and drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, further ratcheting up tensions over trade.
Shares of Huawei's U.S. suppliers fell on fears the Chinese firm would be forced to stop buying American chips, software and other components after the Trump administration banned it from buying U.S. technology without special approval.
Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, said that losing access to U.S. suppliers ""will do significant economic harm to the American companies"" and affect ""tens of thousands of American jobs.""
""Huawei will seek remedies immediately and find a resolution to this matter,"" the company said in a statement.
The U.S. crackdown, announced on Wednesday, was the latest shot fired in a U.S.-China trade war that is rattling financial markets and threatening to derail a slowing global economy. 
Trade talks had looked close to collapsing in the past week after a dispute over Chinese changes to a draft text prompted the United States to hike tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing to retaliate with higher duties on U.S. products.
Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said the United States should avoid further damaging relations between the world's two largest economies, and accused Washington of ""trade protectionism."" 
""China will take all the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese firms,"" Gao told reporters.
The Foreign Ministry also announced the formal arrest of two Canadian citizens who were detained shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in December.
Meng faces extradition to the United States on charges that she conspired to defraud global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran. She and the company deny the charges.
While China has made no specific link between the detentions of the two men and Meng's arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt it is using their cases to pressure Canada.
ECONOMIC FALLOUT
The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it was adding Huawei and 70 affiliates to its ""Entity List,"" which bars them from buying components and technology from U.S. firms without government approval. It later revised the number of affiliates down to 68.
The order includes non-U.S. Huawei affiliates in Canada, Japan, Brazil, the UK and Singapore. Requests for approvals for transactions will be reviewed under a ""policy of presumption of denial,"" which suggests obtaining permission will be very difficult.
Huawei was the world's third largest purchaser of semiconductors last year, accounting for 4.4% of global market share, behind only Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to Gartner, a research firm.
U.S. lawmakers have long feared that the firm's equipment could be used to spy on Americans, and Democrats and Republicans lined up in support of the Trump administration's move.
But leading analysts downgraded their assessments for several U.S. microchip companies on Thursday.
Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland, who said he believed Huawei had built up a one-to-two-year supply of U.S. components, cut price targets on several microchip companies, including  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX). Shares of Xilinx closed down 7.3 percent while those of rival chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc fell 4 percent. 
TARIFFS
As negotiations toward resolving the trade war stalled last week, the United States ramped up the pressure by raising tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, prompting China to retaliate with higher duties on a revised list of $60 billion worth of U.S. products.
President Donald Trump, who has embraced protectionism and accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, has threatened to put 25% tariffs on a further $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said prices for shoppers would rise because of higher tariffs on Chinese goods even as the world's largest retailer reported on Thursday its best comparable sales growth for the first quarter in nine years.
Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters the company would seek to ease the pain, in part by trying to buy from different countries.
With few options left for levying its own tariffs, China could opt for other ways to pressure the United States, including blocking corporate mergers and other deals.
""There's other things they can do, and M&A would certainly be one thing,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.  
The United States wants to see significant changes in China's approach to intellectual property rights and state subsidies as part of any trade deal, and Beijing is insisting that all tariffs be eliminated.
The two sides are also at odds over how much more U.S. goods China would buy and how ""balanced"" the text of the draft trade agreement would be, Chinese state media said.
Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Huawei case was a significant complication to the resolution of the trade dispute.

""Every step by the United States makes it much harder for the Chinese not to push back,"" he told reporters and analysts.

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Thursday it had completed a software update for its 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded worldwide since March after they were involved in two fatal crashes.
The planemaker said it was in the process of submitting a plan on pilot training to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and would work with the regulator to schedule its certification test flight.
The FAA is planning a meeting on May 23 in Fort Worth, Texas, with regulators from around the world to update them on reviews of Boeing's software fix and on pilot training.
Aviation regulators from other countries will have to assess Boeing's proposed fixes and clear the aircraft to fly in other regions independently of the FAA.
It is unclear when the 737 MAX aircraft will return to service, but U.S. airlines have said they hope the jets will fly this summer.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines Group Inc, the two largest U.S. operators of the MAX, have pulled the jets from their schedules until Aug. 5 and Aug 19, respectively. 
The airlines, which must still decide on pilot training, have said they would use the jets as spare planes if they are approved for flight before those dates.
The FAA said on Thursday that Boeing had not yet submitted its final software package for approval.
On Wednesday, acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said he expected Boeing to make its formal submission for its software update in the next week or so. 
The 737 MAX was grounded following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board just five months after a similar crash of a Lion Air flight killed 189 people.
Boeing hopes the software upgrade and associated pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed.
The planemaker said it had completed simulator testing and engineering test flights as well as developed training and education materials, which were now being reviewed by the FAA, global regulators and airline customers. 

To date, Boeing has flown the 737 MAX with updated software for more than 360 hours on 207 flights, the company said https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130434.

(Reuters) - Investors rattled by lingering trade tensions between the United States and China pulled $12.27 billion from U.S.-based equity funds in the week ended Wednesday, according to data released by Refinitiv's Lipper research service on Thursday.
It was the category's fourth consecutive week of outflows, Lipper data showed. Investors sought shelter from plummeting equity markets earlier in the week and moved money into money market and Treasury funds. 
U.S.-based money market funds attracted $14.49 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their fourth consecutive week of inflows, Lipper said. U.S.-based government-Treasury bond funds attracted $1.55 billion in the week ended Wednesday, Lipper said. 
On Monday, the S&P 500 suffered its steepest drop since early January, after Beijing said it would raise tariffs on American-made goods in retaliation for a similar move from the United States. Stocks have since rebounded from that plunge but there are signs that investors continue to worry about the costs of the prolonged trade dispute.
Pat Keon, senior research analyst at Lipper, noted that for the second week in a row equity, equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had net outflows right around $10 billion.
""This represents the 2nd and 3rd highest of the year for the group and highest since January 30 with investors withdrawing about $14.6 billion,"" Keon said.
For the last two weeks, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has accounted for over half of the total weekly net outflows for equity ETFs, Keon said. 
""This coupled with the large net inflows into money markets over the last two weeks indicates to me that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, driven mainly by the U.S-China trade tensions,"" he said.
High-yield ""junk"" bond funds correlate more with equity than they do with investment-grade taxable debt, Keon noted. U.S.-based high-yield funds posted $2.57 billion in cash withdrawals in the week ended Wednesday, their second straight week of outflows.
""Not surprising to see the large net outflows from them as it aligns with market performance and the negative flows from equity funds,"" Keon said. 
""The high-yield results were the main reason that taxable bond mutual funds suffered a weekly net outflow this week of $263 million, which broke a streak of 17 straight weekly net inflows,"" he added.

While the U.S.-China trade war has dominated market direction over the past few days, better-than-expected corporate earnings took the spotlight Thursday, serving as a reminder that some corners of the economy remain robust.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) reported first-quarter results that beat the consensus from Investing.com on the bottom line thanks to better-than-expected same-store sales in the U.S. Shares rose 1.4%.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) also delivered better-than-expected quarterly results and upbeat revenue guidance, sending its shares up nearly 6.7%. Cisco was the top-performing stock in the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 Index Nasdaq 100. The last rose 1% on the day.
The sunny day for Cisco, however, failed to prevent a slump in the chip sector in the wake of Trump's executive order against Huawei products.
Following Trump's decision, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing was against countries imposing unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and vowed to take action. The latest rise in trade tensions arrived as both nations recently have imposed tariffs on each other.
In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was up 2.36%, adding to gains from a day earlier as the aircraft maker reportedly completed a software update for its 737 Max jets.

Boeing added that it is planning to work with the Federal Aviation Administration to schedule a certification flight.
Energy stocks also boosted the broader market on the back of a rise in oil prices as traders continued to bet on potential disruptions in global crude supplies amid growing tensions in the Middle East.

Nvidia, whose graphics chips are used in personal computers, video games and other products, guided second-quarter revenue of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 2%, implying a year-over-year decline of 18.3%. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected the company to forecast second-quarter revenue of $2.54 billion.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported earnings per share of $0.88 on revenue of $2.22 billion, above Investing.com's consensus expectations for earnings of $0.62 a share on revenue of $2.2 billion. That compared to earnings per share of $1.98 on revenue of $3.21 billion in the same period a year earlier.
Nvidia shares gained about 5.7% to trade at $169.34 in after-hours trading following the report. The shares were up 0.4% in regular trading. The stock is up 20% this year.
The earnings beat comes even as gaming revenues, which account for the bulk of total revenues, fell 39% to $1.06 billion. But the company continued to express optimism on the gaming front.
""Nvidia is back on an upward trajectory,"" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, in a statement. ""We’ve returned to growth in gaming, with nearly 100 new GeForce Max-Q laptops shipping. And Nvidia RTX has gained broad industry support, making ray tracing the standard for next-generation gaming.""
The company’s data center business segment saw revenue slip 10% to $634 million as the application of artificial intelligence continued to accelerate despite the near-term pause in demand from hyperscale customers, the company said.
""AI adoption is accelerating in the world's largest industries, moving beyond the cloud to the edge where AI processing has to be instantaneous. We're excited about our pending acquisition of Mellanox, which will help us drive data center architecture for high performance computing and AI from the cloud to the edge,"" Huang said."

1. Nvidia, Applied Materials Give Chips a Boost
The tech sector will likely get a boost tomorrow thanks to solid earnings report in the semiconductor sector after the bell today.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and delivered in-line guidance even as the chipmaker's gaming segment posted a sharp fall in sales.
Nvidia guided second-quarter revenue of $2.55 billion, plus or minus 2%, implying a year-over-year decline of 18.3%. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected the company to forecast second-quarter revenue of $2.54 billion.
The stock gained 5.75% in after-hours trading.
And Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported fiscal second-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations on both the top and bottom lines and offered up in-line guidance, easing investor concerns the glut in memory supplies will weigh on the sector for prolonged period of time.Its shares rose 6.7% postmarket.
2. Michigan Consumer Sentiment Expected to Rise
Consumer confidence numbers are the only market-moving economic indicator out tomorrow and that comes after the opening bell.
The University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of May consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Consumer sentiment is expected to tick up slightly to 97.8, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But the expectations component is forecast to dip to 86.8.
3. Will Oil End the Week Up?
Oil has a good chance to close out the week with a gain, with bulls gaining the upper hand on tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
But for traders, there is also the question also how well-balanced oil supplies are now.
There will be another data point to consider when the Baker Hughes U.S. oil rig count arrives at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
Last week, the active rig count dropped to 805 from 807 the previous week and is down 9% this year.
U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 5.4 million barrels last week, the U.S. government announced on Wednesday, surprising a market expecting a decline instead of 800,000 barrels. In the previous week, crude inventories fell by almost 4 million barrels.
The Paris-based IEA said due to weakened demand, the global oil market was in a surplus of about 700,000 barrels in the first quarter despite WTI and Brent gaining about 30% in prices.
Combined with the worsening U.S.-China trade war and its impact on the global economy, the oil market is sending “mixed signals,” the IEA said."

That compared to earnings per share of $1.22 on revenue of $4.57 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company had reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $3.75 billion in the previous quarter.
""In the second fiscal quarter Applied Materials delivered results toward the top-end of our guidance range, reflecting solid execution across the company in a business environment that remains challenging,"" said Gary Dickerson, president and CEO, in a statement. “Looking ahead, we maintain a positive view of our markets as powerful new demand drivers for semiconductors and displays take shape, creating tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials."""

It’s true that new duties would lower imports, but lower foreign demand would also weigh down on exports, he said in Hamburg on Thursday.
The surplus also means that other countries can benefit by being able to invest more than they can save.
“If the German savings surplus flows into productive investments abroad, growth opportunities and jobs are created there,” Weidmann said.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Germany for taking unfair advantage of the U.S. by running a current account surplus for almost two decades and Weidmann admitted that even after peaking at more than 8% in 2015, it still remains “very high.”

The new chief executive officer’s message: I’m the fix-it guy, sent here to seek redemption for California’s largest utility.
And then legislators started whispering. Someone handed assembly member Eloise Gomez Reyes a piece of paper. She was the one to publicly break the news to Johnson, who had started his job two weeks ago: State investigators had just found the company’s power lines at fault for the Camp Fire that killed 85 people and destroyed an entire town in November.
Johnson looked at her and nodded. “I made the assumption, when I got here, that PG&E equipment caused the fire -- that’s the best place to start,” he said later in the hearing. “It’s a disappointment that this happened. Let’s not do it again.”
The tense meeting underscored just how much work Johnson has ahead of him in guiding PG&E out of the biggest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history and repairing its relationship with state lawmakers and customers. Shares cratered 70% in the three months leading up to the company’s Chapter 11 filing in January. Its credit ratings were downgraded to junk, and dozens of lawsuits have been filed. Now that the utility is restructuring, some of the biggest names in distressed debt, including Elliott Management Corp., are piling into its case. California Governor Gavin Newsom is pressing for a quick exit.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Being blamed for the Camp Fire “sets the stage for two key goals for the bankrupt company: Paying off existing liabilities and restructuring California’s regulatory structure that puts utilities on the hook for natural disaster liabilities.”
--Kit Konolige, utilities analyst
Click here to view the research
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection found probable violations of state laws and forwarded its investigation to the district attorney of Butte County, where the Camp Fire occurred, Cal Fire deputy director Michael Mohler said Thursday. PG&E shares fell as much as 1.4%.
Exactly how Johnson will rescue PG&E from the damages incurred by wildfires that tore through Northern California in 2017 and 2018 remains to be seen. The company has already warned that its liabilities may exceed $30 billion, and the report by Cal Fire could open the door to more.
Wearing a blue suit with a matching blue paisley tie on Wednesday, Johnson assured lawmakers in a southern drawl that he would turn the company around. “I’d like to fix it,” he said. “If you actually talk to people in the industry, they would say, ‘Oh yeah, he’s the fix it guy.’ This is a big fix.”
Cal Fire said power lines owned by PG&E ignited the Camp Fire, the deadliest in California history, while dry brush and strong winds helped it spread quickly. The finding “certainly was telegraphed -- it’s hard to believe that anyone is surprised,” Bloomberg Intelligence utilities analyst Kit Konolige said in an interview. “But it is certainly a negative.”
Under a legal doctrine known as inverse condemnation, California utilities including PG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX) may be held responsible for damages from wildfires their equipment causes -- even if they aren’t found negligent. The power companies have been fighting to kill this doctrine since a series of wildfires devastated parts of wine country in 2017.
At Fault
Paul Patterson, a utilities analyst with Glenrock Associates, said Cal Fire’s brief statement on Wednesday failed to answer the most important question: Did PG&E act negligently in maintaining the power line that sparked the fire?
“What’s really key is whether or not the company’s operation or maintenance of the system was in fact at fault,” he said.
The news came just as activist shareholder Appaloosa Management disclosed it had more than doubled its stake in PG&E in the first quarter. The fund now holds about 4.4% of the company’s outstanding shares. Baupost Group boosted its holdings by 58% to 24.5 million shares valued at $436.1 million, regulatory filings show.
PG&E had meanwhile already disclosed that a criminal grand jury in Butte County is investigating the Camp Fire and has requested documents related to its operations and maintenance. The company said it’s cooperating with prosecutors in collecting physical evidence at the fire site.

Sitting before lawmakers on Wednesday -- with only a prepared statement, a notepad and a pen accompanying him -- Johnson said his goal as CEO is to leave PG&E in better shape than when he arrived. Before joining the company this month, he led the federally owned utility Tennessee Valley Authority for more than six years.
“I believe in redemption,” he said. “I want some redemption for PG&E in the hearts and minds of the customers, and the people in this building and elsewhere. Earned redemption.”

439,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 02:35PM ET</span>",U.S. LNG exporters face headwinds due to trade war with China,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - The U.S. trade war with China has dozens of developers of liquefied natural gas export terminals scrambling to find other buyers, now that the fastest-growing market for the fuel is out of reach.
U.S. shipments of LNG to China hit a record in 2017 but have already dropped to next-to-nothing so far in 2019. Then on Monday, China said it would raise tariffs on U.S. LNG imports to 25% on June 1 from the current rate of 10%, retaliating against Washington's increase in tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods last week.
The tariffs are discouraging Chinese customers from signing long-term deals with U.S. suppliers, analysts warned, which has made banks and investors less willing to finance projects under development. Natural gas use is growing fast among power generators worldwide as countries like China seek to wean themselves off dirtier coal, although gas is still a small part of the overall fuel mix. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WQIeS4)
World demand for natural gas is expected to grow from 340 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2015 to 485 bcfd by 2040, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), with China accounting for more than a quarter of that growth.
Six U.S. LNG projects have units currently under construction. More than two dozen others are still seeking customers to satisfy potential investors before they can break ground. These projects are less likely to come to fruition if tariffs remain in place for an extended period.
Chinese buyers have started signing deals with other suppliers. This complicates the search for customers for U.S. developers hoping to build the next generation of LNG export plants.
“There will be a reluctance to (Chinese gas users) signing new deals with U.S. projects as long as this trade war persists,” said Sindre Knutsson, senior analyst at Rystad Energy’s gas markets team.
Major U.S. suppliers disagreed. They said low U.S. gas prices will attract enough customers to justify funding new export projects, regardless of what China does.
""The very low cost of American LNG will create its own demand,"" said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian Inc, which expects to make a final decision in coming months to build its Driftwood LNG export project in Louisiana.
Most LNG projects are financed through long-term contracts signed well before construction begins. Rystad, a Norway-based independent energy research consultancy, expects China to be one of the biggest sponsors of new LNG projects in coming years. 
Rystad forecasts Chinese LNG demand will reach 95 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in 2025, up from 53 MTPA in 2018, which would make it the world’s biggest LNG importer, overtaking Japan.
U.S. LNG exports are expected to nearly quadruple to 86 MTPA by 2025, equivalent to about 11.4 bcfd of natural gas, according to EIA projections. That is enough for about 55 million U.S. homes every day.
Before the U.S.-China trade war ignited in July 2018, China was the third biggest buyer of U.S. LNG. This year, China is not even in the top 15, with only two U.S. shipments reaching the country.
“Chinese investment in U.S. LNG export projects will remain at a standstill, in our view, with Chinese offtakers likely waiting on a trade deal before signing any deals with U.S. counterparties,” analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said. 
They noted that China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp’s (CNOOC) recent deal for an equity stake in Russia’s Arctic LNG 2 project signals China could look elsewhere for long-term supply until trade tensions thaw.
Jack Fusco, chief executive officer at Cheniere Energy Inc, however, told analysts last week that while the tariffs add some costs to Chinese customers, they are not expected to have a material impact on the company “either today or going forward.” 
Fusco said trade tensions were not having an impact on the company's plan in coming months to make a final investment decision to build a sixth liquefaction train at its Sabine Pass LNG export plant in Louisiana, one of two it operates in the United States.

Analysts, however, said Cheniere was likely waiting for the resolution of the trade dispute before completing a 20-year deal to sell LNG to China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, known as Sinopec.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) is confident its appeals of recent court rulings that its glyphosate weed killer Roundup caused cancer will be successful, a senior executive said on Thursday, amid a steep selloff of the company's shares this week.
Liam Condon, president of Bayer's crop science division, said the appeals of jury rulings against the chemical will be heard by judges, a factor he sees as favorable to Bayer's chances.
A California jury on Monday awarded more than $2 billion to a couple who claimed Bayer’s glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused their cancer, in the largest U.S. jury verdict to date against the company in litigation over the chemical.
It was the third consecutive U.S. jury verdict against the company over the widely-used weed killer, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year.
""The key point is from a regulatory point of view, nothing has changed,"" Condon said at the BMO Farm to Market investor conference in New York. ""We just need to get this litigation sorted out and move on.""
Shares of Germany-based Bayer have fallen about 38 percent since the first adverse U.S. judgment on Roundup last August, leaving the company with a market value smaller than the price it paid for Monsanto.
The ""phenomenal"" selloff is due to investors being uncertain how to price the lawsuits into the stock, Condon said.

“The experience has been in all industries (involved in litigation), these things always get solved,"" he said. ""There has been a significant overreaction there and it’s a great buying opportunity. It’s almost like buy one, get one free.”

443,By Investing.com,"<span>May 16, 2019 02:08PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Semis Sink Ahead of Nvidia Results as Trump Orders Ban on Huawei,"Investing.com - Semiconductor stocks were on the back foot Thursday after President Donald Trump banned U.S. companies from using telecom infrastructure from Huawei, citing national security concerns.
The move from the White House could force chip companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to apply for U.S. export licenses to continue supplying to Huawei.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid more than 1.7%, with Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), and Qualcomm - all of whom count Huawei as a major customer -- fell more than 3%. Qorvo was off more than 6%.
According to the executive order, the technology that could be banned will include that which is “designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary.""
The recent slump in semi stocks has been exacerbated by the return of the U.S.-China trade war at a time when the backdrop for the sector is far from constructive.
Worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled $96.8 billion during the first quarter of 2019, a 15.5% plunge over the fourth quarter and a 13% drop year on year, according to a report published by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) on April 29.
The outlook is hardly encouraging, with some estimating the sector will suffer a double-digit sales decline for the year.
Traders will be keeping a watchful eye on earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) after the bell to gauge whether the gloomy outlook on the sector is overdone.
Bucking the trend, however, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) racked up gains after delivering first-quarter results that beat on the bottom and top lines. The networking company revealed upbeat revenue guidance to send its share price soaring around 7%. That made Cisco the top performer among the stocks in the Nasdaq-100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday. 
Cisco's service provider segment was weaker than expected, dropping 13%, mostly due to ""soft demand in the Americas, but we are confident demand will recover closer to 2020,"" CFRA said in a note."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is seeking new ways to widen use of the euro and counter the dollar's global dominance, top EU officials said on Thursday, as the bloc tries to salvage Iran's nuclear deal by helping companies bypass U.S. sanctions.
Fears they will be hit with sanctions have pushed European corporations to suspend their dealings with Iran after Washington pulled out of the nuclear accord last year. The EU has tried to defend the pact signed with world powers in 2015 by offering firms alternative ways to trade with oil-rich Iran.
Because the dollar is the world's dominant currency, European officials and businessmen are aware that financial threats by the United States cannot be overlooked, even when they rest on controversial legal grounds.
""You simply don't want to take the risk,"" said a manager at a top European company.
Companies that trade with Iran risk being shut out from the U.S. market and could lose access to credit. Banks, insurers and other financial operators that provide support to firms breaching sanctions also face fines. The effectiveness of U.S. sanctions is increased by the dollar's global dominance.
Beyond immediate but limited moves to challenge Washington's boycott of the Iran deal, such as plans to set up a barter-based trade channel, INSTEX, EU officials are taking a long view and pondering how help the euro challenge the dollar's position. 
""A stronger international role for the euro is a key priority,"" France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Brussels, saying U.S. policy toward Iran had triggered renewed efforts in that direction.
""I don't want our companies to suffer from American decisions that we do not share,"" Le Maire told the conference of European financial experts.
The dollar is dominant in most sectors of the global monetary system, accounting for about a 60% of foreign reserves, sovereign debt issuance and international loans to corporations. The euro takes roughly a 20% share of those markets.
Reforming the euro zone's governance, with joint debt issuance and stronger common guarantees to rescue ailing banks and their savers, is considered the crucial route to strengthen the euro. But divisions between the 19-country bloc's governments have for years prevented progress.
FROM INSTANT PAYMENTS TO RUSSIAN GAS
EU officials are therefore considering complementary measures to boost the euro's global relevance.
""The time has come to strengthen the international role of the euro, because the euro is also one of the best tools we have to support our European values abroad,"" the EU commissioner for the common currency Valdis Dombrovskis told the conference.
He said the Commission, the EU's executive, supported the development of a bloc-wide instant-payment system that could increase the euro's 35% share of the market for global transactions, and challenge U.S. dominance in card payments.
The European Central Bank has set up an infrastructure to settle euro payments in a few seconds, but banks have so far been reluctant to join the system, favoring national schemes.
The EU is also discussing with foreign countries, like Ukraine and India, how to facilitate the issuance of part of their public debt in euros, one EU official said.
Europe is also looking at ways of better leveraging its weight on energy markets, Dombrovskis said.
Despite being the world's primary importer of oil and gas, less than 10 percent of the 40 trillion euros worth ($44.7 trillion) of transactions each year in Europe's energy markets are executed with the bloc's currency. 
Brussels is pushing European states and companies to use euros in their energy contracts, especially for gas, imported mostly from Russia.
It may find in Moscow an unexpected ally, as Russian suppliers have for years been showing interest in replacing the dollar in their contracts, said Marco Piredda, Vice-President of government affairs at the Italian oil and gas group  ENI  (MI:ENI).

447,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Five more U.S. states sue OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma over opioid epidemic,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Five U.S. states on Thursday filed lawsuits accusing Purdue Pharma LP of illegally marketing and selling opioids, escalating the wave of litigation over a nationwide abuse epidemic.
Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, West Virginia and Wisconsin joined 39 states to file lawsuits targeting Purdue Pharma and its leaders, including former president Richard Sackler and his family.
Officials accused Purdue Pharma of repeatedly making false and deceptive claims that opioids, including OxyContin, were safe for a wide range of patients seeking to reduce pain.
""This is a bipartisan effort,"" Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, a Democrat, said on a conference call.
The lawsuits were announced six days after a North Dakota judge dismissed that state's lawsuit accusing Purdue Pharma of overstating the benefits and trivializing the addiction risks of prolonged opioid use. North Dakota is expected to appeal.
Purdue Pharma called the new lawsuits ""misleading attacks,"" and said it will defend itself against them.
""These complaints are part of a continuing effort to try these cases in the court of public opinion rather than the justice system,"" the Stamford, Connecticut-based company said.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in a record 47,600 U.S. overdose deaths in 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.
State and local governments have filed hundreds of lawsuits accusing drugmakers such as Purdue Pharma of deceptive marketing, and distributors such as AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) of ignoring how opioids were being used illegally.
Oklahoma reached a $270 million settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers on March 26.
The prospect that Purdue Pharma might eventually seek bankruptcy protection is a reason that Sackler family members have been named as defendants in some lawsuits.
On the conference call, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said the family has ""left a trail of addiction and death.""
In the North Dakota case, Bismarck-based Judge James Hill rejected the state's argument that Purdue Pharma's conduct created a public nuisance.
""Purdue cannot control how doctors prescribe its products and it certainly cannot control how individual patients use and respond to its products, regardless of any warning or instruction Purdue may give,"" Hill wrote.
The Sacklers have long been prolific cultural benefactors, but their alleged role in the opioid crisis has led some major museums to distance themselves.

On Wednesday, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose Sackler Wing contains the popular Temple of Dendur, said it would stop accepting donations from the Sacklers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies said on Thursday it will challenge a decision by the U.S. Commerce Department to add the Chinese company to a export blacklist, warning the decision ""will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business.""
Huawei said the decision will ""affect tens of thousands of American jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exist on the global supply chain."" 
The Commerce Department did not immediately comment. 
The decision by the Commerce Department to add the company and 70 affiliates to its so-called Entity List bans them from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.
U.S. officials told Reuters the order would also make it difficult, if not impossible, for Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, to sell some products because of its reliance on U.S. suppliers. The order will take effect in the coming days.
The dramatic move comes as the Trump administration has aggressively lobbied other countries not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation 5G networks and comes just days after Washington imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods amid an escalating trade war.

452,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Investors renew calls for Deutsche Bank to trim investment bank,"By Andreas Framke, Hans Seidenstuecker and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) investors are renewing calls for it to scale back its investment bank division ahead of what promises to be a challenging annual shareholder meeting next week.
The future of Deutsche Bank's investment banking operations has returned to the fore after the collapse of merger talks with smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
One major investor is trying to extract a pledge from the bank for cuts to the unit before committing to back management in a symbolic vote of confidence at the meeting, a person with knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity. 
Another prominent investor, Union Investment, said changes in strategy were long overdue. 
""Without cuts in investment banking, we believe it will not be possible to achieve targets on returns,"" said portfolio manager Alexandra Annecke, who is due to address the meeting.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
The division generates about half of Deutsche Bank's revenue but is also considered its Achilles heel, with European regulators fearful that it will fail the next round of stress tests in the United States. 
Last week, the risk of a rebuke from shareholders at the annual meeting grew after two influential investor advisory groups - Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis - urged them to issue a vote of no confidence in Deutsche Bank's management.
QUELLING CONCERNS
Deutsche Bank's shares have dropped 34% since shareholders convened a year ago. On Thursday, the price was just cents above the record low of 6.68 euros set in December.
The bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, and top executives are speaking to investors to quell concerns of large shareholders, a common practice in the run-up to the annual meeting on May 23, said another person familiar with the matter. 
But the bank is unlikely to announce any changes to its investment banking operations in the coming days, executives said.
Revenue at the division is forecast to fall to 12.5 billion euros ($14.0 billion) this year, according to a consensus of analysts. That would mark a fourth consecutive year of decline, down 34% from 2015, based on Reuters calculations.
That contrasts with a projected 6% rise in JP Morgan's investment banking revenue to $36 billion for the same period. It far outpaces a 5% drop in investment banking revenue across the industry from 2015 to 2018, according to Coalition, which tracks banking industry performance. 
Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank attributed the collapse of merger talks to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands, but concerns about the investment bank loomed large, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The ratings agencies Moody's and Fitch, which have both tagged Deutsche for a possible credit-rating downgrade, have cited troubles at the investment bank as key concerns.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said in a report this week that Deutsche had only one option: a restructuring of its investment bank.
This could mean exiting the United States, where it employs 9,000 people, and dropping out of the equities business, they said, adding that an exit would be costly and weigh on earnings. 
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing told analysts last month that it was ""non-negotiable"" that the bank remain ""globally relevant"", including in the U.S. and Asia. 
Sewing announced plans to cut more 7,000 jobs soon after assuming office in a management reshuffle last year, including a 25% cut in equities sales and trading jobs.

Glenview Capital added to its holdings of  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc. and  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM)., while taking new stakes in  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp. and Wellcare Health Plans Inc., which announced plans to merge at the end of March. Among hospitals, the New York-based hedge fund bought more shares of  Tenet Healthcare  Corp (NYSE:THC). and  Universal Health Services  Inc (NYSE:UHS)., its latest 13-F filings show. Glenview remains Tenet’s largest shareholder.
Managed care and hospital shares have been roiled by Washington policy debates centered on offering “Medicare-for-All”. Stocks began to slide in late February and fell to their lowest level since late 2017 at one point in April. While they’ve recovered over the past month, the S&P 500 Managed Care Index remains down for the year, while a Bloomberg Intelligence hospitals benchmark is up 2.6%, significantly underperforming the broader market.
In a Bloomberg interview last week, Glenview founder Larry Robbins said investors were wrong to be fearful of Democrats’ single-payer proposals as they have little chance of becoming reality. He also repeated his bullish call on managed care and hospitals while cautioning against pharmaceutical stocks that may come under pressure due to drug pricing risks.
The hedge fund managed about $7.7 billion as of March 1, down from $10 billion in June of last year.

In 2017 the then Austrian government launched legal proceedings against the Eurofighter consortium - comprising Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo - alleging fraud and wilful deception linked to the order of fighter planes.
Austria's Defence Ministry said at the time that following an investigation it believed Airbus and Eurofighter had misled Austria about the purchase price, deliverability and equipment of the jets. 
Airbus and the consortium have denied the allegations, which are being investigated by Austrian prosecutors. The investigation has also prompted the current government, which took office in December 2017, to put off a decision on whether to scrap its Eurofighter fleet.
However, according to an internal document obtained by ORF radio and news platform Addendum, two prosecutors told a meeting last month that there were insufficient grounds to open an investigation into the consortium in the first place.
The meeting on April 1 between prosecutors and Justice Ministry officials was held to discuss next steps in ongoing Eurofighter investigations. One prosecutor told the meeting that ""he had difficulty understanding why the investigation was begun at all"", ORF said, citing minutes from the meeting published in the document.
The investigation was launched in response to a complaint filed in 2017 by then Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil about the sale of the jets.
""Apparently no one wanted to tell Minister Doskozil that no grounds for suspicion existed,"" ORF and Addendum, which also obtained the internal report, said, quoting the unnamed prosecutor's comments at the meeting.
The prosecutor now overseeing that investigation agreed with that statement, Addendum said.
The prosecutors' office for economic affairs and corruption, which is handling the Eurofighter investigation, was not immediately available for comment.

Their investigation continues.

459,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 11:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump EPA did not await court ruling to loosen biofuel rules for refiners - documents,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration made it easier for oil refineries to get waivers from the nation's biofuel law at least four months before a 2017 court decision it often cites to justify the move to the corn lobby, and the move was motivated by a desire to save the oil industry money, Reuters has learned.
The timing and motivation for the Environmental Protection Agency's policy change, revealed through court documents and an interview with a former top agency official, have not been previously reported. This reinforces the concerns of the corn industry that the decision to expand the waiver program was made at the EPA's discretion.
""EPA repeatedly told Congress its hands were tied and blamed the courts. That appears to have been a lie. EPA also said it was following Department of Energy recommendations. We also know that’s bunk. I’m going to get to the bottom of this,"" U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from the farm state of Iowa, said in a statement on Thursday.
The waivers, granted to small refineries including those run by oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars. The waivers angered the corn lobby which argued they hurt farmers by threatening demand for ethanol. 
Whether the EPA's moves have hurt ethanol demand has been a topic of fierce debate.
The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits generated by those who do, but smaller refineries can be exempted if they prove compliance would cause them financial harm. 
Trump's EPA granted 35 such waivers for 2017, up sharply from seven in the final year of the Obama administration.
Court documents filed by a biofuels advocacy group show that the EPA changed the policy before May 4, 2017.
On that date, the EPA told a refining company in a letter that ""we are changing our approach"" to the waiver program by allowing exemptions to refineries even if their operations ""are not significantly impaired"" by compliance, according to the documents filed by the Advanced Biofuels Association in a challenge of the expanded waiver program. 
That puts the policy shift at least four months ahead of an August 2017 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that found the agency was using too strict a standard when it denied Utah-based Sinclair Oil an exemption. The EPA subsequently withdrew its defense on a similar court case, and lost a third. 
Those cases are often cited by EPA officials and refining industry representatives defending the expanded waiver program.
""The courts have clearly told us we have to follow the law, and that's what we are going to do,"" EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in April media interview when pressed about the expansion.
Mandy Gunasekara, who retired as principal deputy assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation this year, said the EPA under then-administrator Scott Pruitt had decided to ""reinstate"" the small refinery waiver program to help an industry that felt ignored by Obama.
She said Pruitt also believed loosening the standards could help lower the cost of compliance credits, known as RINS, which could help the entire industry as opposed to just smaller refiners. 
""Certainly, one of the goals was to put downward pressure on the price of RINs,"" she told Reuters in an interview. 
She said the Sinclair case did not influence the changes to the waiver program. ""When I saw the Sinclar decision come down, I saw it as a vindication of our changes,"" she said.
EPA spokesman Michael Abboud did not respond to questions about whether the agency still believes the small refinery program should be used to help manage RIN prices. He maintained that EPA has been consistent in its justification for the expansion of the waiver program.
“The premise of this story is wrong,"" he said, adding that the waiver program has ""been subject to appropriations language and court opinions prior to and during the Trump Administration."" 
Expansion of waivers drove down RIN prices to multi-year lows last year. This helped refiners like  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) and PBF Energy Inc that had been purchasing them, along with CVR Energy Inc, owned by Icahn.
Icahn came under federal investigation after CVR was seen shorting the credit market in 2017 while he advocated for financial relief from the biofuel program.
Icahn and other merchant refiners had long complained that their profit margins were being squeezed by the law, which is nearly 15 years old. It was intended to help farmers and reduce U.S. reliance on energy imports.

The waiver provision was intended to temporarily exempt smaller refineries so they could invest in biofuel blending equipment.

460,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 11:15AM ET</span>",Huawei's $105 billion business at stake after U.S. broadside,"By Sijia Jiang and Michael Martina
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - The latest U.S. broadside against Huawei that puts the Chinese firm on an exports blacklist threatens to rattle the global tech supply chain, linked closely to the $105 billion business of the world's top supplier of telecoms network equipment.
The Trump administration has said it would add Huawei Technologies and 70 affiliates to its ""Entity List"" - a move that will likely ban the firm from acquiring U.S. components and technology without government approval, adding another incendiary element to the U.S.-China trade war. 
The ban is not yet effective.
A similar U.S. ban on China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) had almost crippled business for the smaller Huawei rival early last year before the curb was lifted.
Such sanctions on Huawei are, however, likely to have ramifications beyond the company itself, analysts said. 
It would disrupt Huawei's business at a minimum and all but put it out of business in an extreme, while its U.S. suppliers would also be hit, they said.
Out of $70 billion Huawei spent for component procurement in 2018, some $11 billion went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), and they could see that revenue disappear. 
On the other hand, U.S. companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) face the risk of severe retaliation from China, a key market.
""This is going to be very messy,"" a China-based source at a U.S. tech company said. 
It will be tough for Huawei too, the person said, noting none of its U.S. suppliers ""can be replaced by Chinese ones, not within a few years, at least. By then, they are already dead"".
Revenue for the company, also the world's second-biggest maker of smartphones, touched 721 billion yuan ($105 billion) last year, eight times ZTE's and half the annual sales of South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co.
But its business has come under pressure over the past year given mounting international scrutiny, led by U.S. allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, a concern the company has said is unfounded.
Huawei's American suppliers: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-CHINA-HUAWEI/0H001GSE93H2/index.html
STOCKPILING
A range of Asian and European suppliers would also be hurt if Huawei was forced to curb production, while telecom carriers that rely on Huawei, and have largely resisted U.S. calls to bar the company, would be left scrambling just as countries race to roll out next-generation 5G mobile networks.
""Huawei being unable to manufacture network servers, for example, because they can't get key U.S. components would mean they also stop buying parts from other countries altogether,"" said an executive at a Huawei chip supplier.
""They can relatively better manage component sourcing for mobile phones because they have their own component businesses for smartphones. But server and network, it's a different story,"" the executive said.
According to brokerage Jefferies, the sanctions would mean a ""nightmare for China's 5G"" too. The country, which is targeting a nationwide rollout next year, will very likely slow down its 5G push as a result, it added. 
However, industry participants pointed out that Huawei had been stockpiling components such as chips to ease disruptions.
Its initial target was to build inventories of six to nine months, and it has recently been raised to 12 and, in some cases, 24 months, Jefferies said.
Shares in Huawei suppliers fell across in Asia on the news of the U.S. blacklist.
South Korea's Samsung dropped 2.4%, SK Hynix fell 3.5%, while China's Luxshare Precision Industry fell as much as 6.1%. Shares in ZTE also tumbled.
Huawei has said it is ""ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security"".
Its rotating Chairman Eric Xu also told Reuters in a recent interview that ""in case of unforeseen events ... we definitely have our contingency plan. What we have prepared has already been used in some of our products in the Chinese market"".
Huawei has spearheaded China's campaign to develop its own high-end technologies to reduce reliance on imports and such efforts have taken on urgency after U.S. sanctions on ZTE.
The ZTE case led to some ""benefits"" and ""external pressures have developed into internal drivers"" in China, said Wan Gang, vice chairman of China's parliamentary advisory body.
TRADE TALKS
The pain for Huawei's supply chain would be redoubled if the trade war put a damper on the Chinese technology industry.
""The bigger concern would be U.S. allies that used to buy Huawei's components may not continue businesses with Huawei, because of fear of possibly upsetting the United States,"" said Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities in Seoul.
The Trump administration's rhetoric toward China had cooled in recent days after another round of tariffs between the world's top two economies and a selloff on global stock markets. 
Tensions escalated on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring American companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms deemed to pose a national security risk.
While the president's order did not specifically name any country or company, U.S. officials have previously labeled Huawei a ""threat"".
""The U.S. seems to have already decided to nail Huawei down,"" said the China-based U.S. tech company source.
""The problem is that because there doesn't seem to be a prospect for a trade deal in the near future, the U.S. has expedited the process of killing Huawei.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) has defended the 6.3 million pound ($8.06 million) pay package awarded to chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, after criticism from politicians and investor trade bodies. 
Horta-Osorio's pay in 2018 has drawn harsh commentary, with particular focus on the generous pension perks that eclipsed those on offer to Lloyds' broader workforce.
Addressing questions at the company's annual general meeting, Lloyds Chairman Norman Blackwell insisted executive awards were ""fair"" and justified given the bank's turnaround in recent years from the brink of insolvency to becoming one of Europe's most profitable lenders.
""Let me be clear - our view is we should and need to pay for performance,"" Blackwell said, adding of the bank's senior leadership team that ""not many people would do the arduous hours and arduous tasks they do for free"".
But one investor accused the bank's bosses of ""living in a parallel universe"" and said awards to bankers like Horta-Osorio - currently Britain's best paid banking boss - ""totally distort the world in which we are living"".
Despite the concerns raised, the remuneration report was backed by 92% of investors that cast their votes.
Investors also questioned the lender's handling of a major fraud at the bank's HBOS Reading branch, with at least two accusing Blackwell and fellow executives of lying about the scandal and calling for Blackwell to resign.
In a repeat from last year's event, British television personality Noel Edmonds posed a barrage of questions about the fraud in a heated, 10-minute exchange with the Lloyds chairman.
Edmonds alleges his former entertainment business collapsed as a result of the HBOS Reading fraud and has long threatened legal action against the bank.
""If you don't know how many police forces are investigating Lloyds Bank, then you clearly don't know the extent of the criminality in Lloyds Bank, do you?"" Edmonds asked.
""You and many others can make allegations all over the place but criminality has to be proven,"" Blackwell responded. ""There is no countenancing in this bank of any illegality or wrongdoing.""
Blackwell said various inquiries into what went wrong were still ongoing and the bank would co-operate with any police investigation. 
A Lloyds spokesman said 71 business customers of HBOS Reading had been offered compensation and 98% had accepted those offers.
PAY UNDER SCRUTINY
Horta-Osorio has already waived part of the bank's contributions to his pension pot this year, taking the annual payments to 33 percent of base salary from 46 percent previously.
But that is still more than double the 13 percent contribution made to the retirement pots of less senior Lloyds employees.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen all had more sizeable investor rebellions against the pay of senior management in the past few years, although all ultimately secured a majority of shareholder support.
Increased shareholder scrutiny of pay comes as banks provide more disclosure on pay to comply with new reporting rules on company remuneration.
From next year, firms will be obliged to set out the ratio of CEO pay to a median UK employee, and those in the lowest and upper pay quartiles.
The top bosses of Britain's biggest banks were paid on average 120 times more than the median pay of their U.K. employees in 2018, bank filings showed. 
At Lloyds, Horta-Osorio was paid 169 times as much as the bank's median paid employee, who earned 37,058 pounds a year.
Blackwell told investors that the bank was committed to narrowing the gap between its lowest paid workers and executives.

463,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 10:28AM ET</span>","EU fines Barclays, Citi, JP Morgan, MUFG and RBS $1.2 billion for FX rigging","By Foo Yun Chee and Kirstin Ridley
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JP Morgan, MUFG and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) were fined a combined 1.07 billion euros ($1.2 billion) by the European Union on Thursday for rigging the multi-trillion dollar foreign exchange market.
Banks have been hit with billions of dollars in penalties worldwide over the last decade for the rigging of benchmarks used in many day-to-day financial transactions, further damaging the industry's fragile reputation after the financial crisis.
The European Commission said individual traders at the banks involved formed two cartels to manipulate the spot foreign exchange market for 11 currencies, including the dollar, the euro and the pound. 
""These cartel decisions send a clear message that the Commission will not tolerate collusive behavior in any sector of the financial markets,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Citigroup was hit with the highest fine of 311 million euros, while Swiss bank UBS was not fined as it had alerted the two cartels to the European Commission. 
The EU competition enforcer said most of the traders knew each other on a personal basis and set up chatrooms such as ""Essex Express 'n the Jimmy"", which was given this name because all of them except ""James"" lived in Essex, to the east of London, and met on their train commute to the British capital.
The five-year investigation found nine traders spread across the banks exchanged sensitive information and trading plans in the chatrooms and occasionally co-ordinated trading strategies.
""The traders, who were direct competitors, typically logged in to multilateral chatrooms ... and had extensive conversations about a variety of subjects, including recurring updates on their trading activities,"" the Commission said in a statement.
The ""Essex Express"" cartel, which also involved a chatroom called ""Semi Grumpy Old Men"", ran between December 2009 and December 2012. The second cartel - called ""Three Way Banana Split"" and involving other chatrooms named ""Two and a half men"" and ""Only Marge"" - ran from December 2007 until January 2013. 
Information swapped by the traders in the chatrooms included details on their clients' orders, the bid-ask spreads for specific transactions, their open risk positions and other details of current or planned trading activities. 
Occasionally the traders would co-ordinate trading activity, for example through a practice called 'standing down' whereby some of the group would temporarily stop trading to avoid interfering with others, the commission said. 
JP Morgan and RBS both said they were pleased to have settled the cases and that they had since made changes to their controls.
JP Morgan said the fine related to the conduct of one former employee and RBS that it served as a reminder of how it had lost its way in the past.
MUFG said it had also taken measures to prevent a re-occurrence. 
Barclays and Citigroup declined to comment.
BANANA SPLIT 
The ""Three Way Banana Split"" cartel, made up of traders at UBS, Barclays, RBS, Citigroup and JP Morgan, was handed a fine totaling 811.2 million euros.
The Essex Express group involving UBS, Barclays, RBS and MUFG, was fined a 257.7 million euro fine, with the fine against Barclays the largest for this cartel at 94.2 million euros.
Allegations of widespread manipulation in the spot foreign exchange market were first reported in 2013 following the Libor scandal in 2012 where traders were found to have rigged the setting of interbank lending rates. 
U.S. and British authorities have since fined seven of the world's top banks a total of around $10 billion for trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates. 
Meanwhile, U.S. prosecutors have charged a handful of former traders over forex rigging. Three former London-based currency traders were acquitted of all charges last October, although others await sentencing after convictions.
The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), meanwhile, dropped its own forex investigation in 2016, saying there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction of individuals.
Thursday's EU fines have sounded a starting bell for investors considering suing banks over alleged forex-related losses in Europe.
Litigators have long been hoping to replicate in Britain the success of U.S. class action claims against banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC and Barclays, that have yielded more than $2 billion for investors in settlements.
Scott & Scott, a U.S. law firm that has set up shop in Britain after its success in the U.S., where it was lead counsel in the action against 15 banks, said it had been waiting for the European Commission penalties.

""Our firm will be working to recoup losses suffered by non-U.S. pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies and multinational corporations, among others, as a result of the banks' wrongdoing,"" London-based partner Belinda Hollway said.

ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Nestle has entered exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.1 billion), as the food group shifts its portfolio in response to changing consumer demands.
The proposed transaction with private equity firm EQT, a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and PSP Investments is expected to close in the second half of 2019 pending regulatory approval, Nestle said on Thursday. 
Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider put the skin health unit up for sale last September as the group moved to ditch underperforming businesses, following years of slowing growth as many consumers favored fresh foods over packaged goods.
Nestle was also under fire from activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point, which asked for a faster overhaul in July. The U.S. hedge fund has since generated very good returns on its Nestle stake, leading Loeb to praise Schneider's performance this year.
Nestle shares were up 0.8 percent at 1315 GMT, after hitting an all-time high earlier in the session following the announcement of the deal, which according to Refinitiv data is the second largest European private equity buyout since the financial crisis after Carlyle's acquisition of an Akzo Nobel unit last year. 
Analysts said the price tag was attractive for Nestle at an enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 3.6 times, or a multiple of roughly 20 times expected core earnings. 
The unit, which will be rebranded Galderma, is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of roughly 550 million Swiss francs this year and of more than 600 million next year, a person close to the matter said.
""EQT focuses on quality businesses. We have a lot of good ideas how to develop Nestle Skin Health into a pearl and then make our return,"" EQT partner and co-head of private equity Marcus Brennecke told Reuters.
""We will strengthen Galderma's board with relevant industrial expertise to develop each of the three business units to their full potential. A couple of prescription drugs are theoretical blockbusters with large business opportunities,"" he said. 
RETURN TO HEALTH
ZKB analyst Patrik Schwendimann estimated the transaction would generate an extraordinary gain before taxes of around 4 billion francs for Nestle based on the net book value of 6.2 billion francs Nestle gave the unit in its 2018 financial statements.
Nestle will provide an update on how it will use the proceeds and its future capital structure after the deal closes.
Schwendimann said Nestle was under no pressure to announce a new share buyback given that the current one runs until the end of the year. 
Nestle Skin Health (NSH), which sells Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care products, Restylane wrinkle fillers and prescription dermatology medicines, had sales of 2.8 billion Swiss francs last year.
Nestle created the unit, which will remain headquartered in Switzerland, in 2014 when it bought L'Oreal's stake in their Galderma joint venture.
Under former Chief Executive Paul Bulcke, skin treatments were part of Nestle's push into higher-growth health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food business, but performed poorly, leading to one-off costs and restructuring.
A reorganization over the last two and half years returned it to double-digit sales growth in the first quarter of 2019.
Schneider said in February that NSH was now ""a leader in its space"" with a competitive cost structure, and that suitors were lining up to acquire it.
""(This) looks like a very good piece of business for Nestle. Most probably assumed a price tag would be around 7 billion Swiss francs at the start of the process,"" said Jon Cox, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux.
Vontobel's Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the disposal was the logical consequence of the sharper capital allocation introduced by Schneider.
EQT and ADIA, which are financing the deal through a roughly 50:50 split of equity and debt, had faced competition from rival buyout funds and industry players including a consortium of Advent and Cinven, as well as U.S. private equity firm KKR and European fund PAI Partners, sources had said.

Advisory firm Evercore and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) advised Nestle on the deal, while EQT was advised by Rothschild, PWC and Kirkland & Ellis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial services software startup OpenFin has raised $17 million in a funding round led by  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co with participation from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), the company said on Thursday.
Existing investors including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bain Capital Ventures and Pivot Investment Partners, also participated in the round, the company said.
OpenFin, which is headquartered in New York and London, will use the cash injection to accelerate sales efforts and for product development, it said.
Founded in 2010, the company has developed an operating system that enables financial institutions to more easily create and upgrade their computer applications, similarly to how consumer apps are updated on smartphones.
This can help large firms cut down on the time and money needed to modernize the software they use for a wide array of both front- and back-office functions, such as trading or risk management. 
It would otherwise take between 6 to 18 months for a financial institution to deploy or update an application, OpenFin said.
Over the past few years, banks have been ramping up partnerships and investments in young companies that create products and services which can help large financial institutions remain competitive in an increasingly digital world.
""Banks know that they need to significantly reduce their cost of doing business and they need to increase productivity,"" Mazy Dar, chief executive and co-founder of OpenFin, said in an interview. 
""All of this heavy infrastructure needs to be replaced with something that is a lot more agile and nimble."" 
OpenFin's operating system is used on nearly 200,000 desktops at 15 global investment banks and more than 1,500 other banks and buy-side firms, it said.

The latest investment brings the company's total amount of venture funding to $40 million.

470,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 16, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",Nvidia Caution Abounds as Earnings Come at End of Rough Season,"(Bloomberg) -- NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to release its first-quarter results at the tail end of a reporting season that has shown few signs of a recovery in chip demand. That’s making Wall Street nervous.
Analysts’ chief concern is Nvidia’s data center business. Sales in that segment contracted for the first time in three years in the fourth quarter, which the company attributed to a pause in spending by hyperscale cloud companies.  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., the world’s second-largest chipmaker, put that characterization in doubt last month when executives projected its 2019 data center sales would shrink for the first time in a decade.
“Data center may be the biggest risk,” in Thursday’s earnings report, Christopher Rolland, a Susquehanna analyst, wrote in a research note.
Nvidia’s data center success has been a central theme in Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s pitch that the company is much more than a graphics chipmaker now as its technology has become central to growing demand for artificial intelligence-based data processing. While gaming is still the biggest contributor to Nvidia’s sales, data center has been increasing. It accounted for nearly a third of revenue in the fourth quarter.
Nvidia’s total first-quarter revenue is expected to shrink 32 percent from a year ago, a result of a cryptocurrency mining market collapse that caused a rapid drop in orders for its graphics chips traditionally used for gaming. That’s placed extra emphasis on new markets such as automotive and artificial intelligence-based data processing to drive growth.
Wall Street’s optimism has faded fast as Nvidia’s shares slumped 45% from a record in October. The total number of buy ratings has dropped to 25 from 32 in five months as analysts reduced their price targets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Data center challenges and lower revenue in the desktop PC gaming market may make it difficult for the Santa Clara, California-based company to meet its fiscal 2020 revenue forecast of flat to slightly down, according to Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy.
“We are cautious on Nvidia shares in front of its earnings report,” wrote Cassidy, who has the equivalent of a neutral rating on the stock. “We believe the company will be challenged to meet its full year guidance for revenue.”

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are among five banks that agreed to pay European Union fines totaling 1.07 billion euros ($1.2 billion) for colluding on foreign-exchange trading strategies.
Citigroup was hit hardest with a 310.8 million-euro penalty, followed by fines of 249.2 million euros and 228.8 million euros for RBS and JPMorgan, the European Commission said in a statement on Thursday.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc was fined 210.3 million euros and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. must pay nearly 70 million euros as part of the settlement with the EU’s antitrust regulator.
Traders ran two cartels on online chatrooms, swapping sensitive information and trading plans that allowed them make informed decisions to buy or sell currencies, the regulator said. Many of them knew each other, calling one chatroom on the Bloomberg terminal the ""Essex Express n’ the Jimmy"" because all of the traders but one met on a commuter train from Essex to London. Other names for rooms were the ""Three Way Banana Split"" and ""Semi Grumpy Old Men.""
""Foreign exchange spot trading activities are one of the largest markets in the world, worth billions of euros every day,"" EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. ""These cartel decisions send a clear message that the commission will not tolerate collusive behavior in any sector of the financial markets.""
While relatively large, the cartel fines are lower than a 1.3 billion-euro penalty for banks for rigging Euribor rates and below a record 3.8 billion-euro penalty for collusion between truckmakers.
UBS Group AG escaped a fine because it was the first to tell regulators about the collusion. The five other banks won reduced penalties by striking a settlement with the commission that won’t allow them to challenge the EU’s findings.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG was separately charged by the EU over FX collusion last year. That case involves another online chatroom and banks may be fined at a later date.
Traders’ manipulation of benchmark foreign-exchange rates was exposed in 2013 Bloomberg articles, triggering regulatory probes in the U.S., the U.K. and Switzerland. More than a dozen financial institutions have paid about $11.8 billion in fines and penalties globally, with another $2.3 billion spent to compensate customers and investors. Former U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch in 2015 said the banks engaged in a “brazen display of collusion” to game markets.
“Today’s fine is a further reminder of how badly the bank lost its way in the past and we absolutely condemn the behavior of those responsible,” RBS said in an emailed statement. “This kind of behavior has no place at the bank we are today; our culture and controls have changed fundamentally during the past ten years.”
JPMorgan said the bank is “pleased to resolve this historical matter, which relates to the conduct of one former employee” and has now “made significant control improvements.”
MUFG is “committed to ensuring integrity and compliance with the regulatory authorities in every jurisdiction in which we operate, and have taken a number of measures to prevent this occurring again,” the bank said in a statement. Citigroup and Barclays declined to comment.
The fines for Barclays and RBS are covered by the two British banks’ existing provisions and in line with expectations, according to Edward Firth, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London.
Traders exchanged information about outstanding customers’ orders, bid-ask spreads, their open-risk positions and details of current or planned trading activities. They would sometimes agree to ""stand down"" or stop a trading activity to avoid interfering with another trader in the group. They traded 11 currencies, including the euro, the U.S. dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
While the U.S. has won guilty pleas from JPMorgan, Citigroup, RBS and Barclays, three British traders in a group known as “The Cartel” were acquitted by a U.S. federal court last year of using a chatroom to coordinate trades and manipulate prices on the spot exchange rate for euros and U.S. dollars.
The EU is continuing to investigate banks for possible EU antitrust violations.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), Credit Suisse and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA are targeted by an EU probe into a suspected cartel for trading of U.S. dollar supra-sovereign, sovereign and agency bonds via online chatrooms between 2009 and 2015.
Eight banks are the focus of yet another EU probe looking at the trading of eurozone sovereign bonds from 2007 to 2012. UniCredit SpA said it faces a possible fine from the eurozone probe. RBS is also one of the banks being probed, a person said in February.
The EU regulator is also looking at ""potential coordination in options trading"" in the FX market,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) said in its annual report in February. HSBC received questions from regulators in October and the investigation is at an early stage, it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned on Thursday any further escalation of trade tensions would damage aerospace firms globally, including the European planemaker's U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The United States and the EU have each threatened to impose billions of dollars of tit-for-tat tariffs on planes, tractors and food in the nearly 15-year trans-Atlantic dispute at the World Trade Organization over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.
""The trade tensions that we see, we believe they are lose-lose tensions,"" Faury told reporters on a visit to London. 
Boeing on Wednesday urged the U.S. government, which has the first crack at imposing any tariffs since its WTO process is running several months ahead of the EU's, to restrict reprisals to European aircraft to avoid harming American manufacturers. 
But Faury said it would be impossible to isolate the fallout from the deteriorating international trade climate, which has also led to a tariff war between the United States and China.
""These tensions, and the trade situation, are not supportive to any of the players in aerospace,"" he said.
""We don't think we'll be losing more than the other guys in that situation, but we think it should be resolved in one way or another that enables global businesses like aviation to continue to grow,"" Faury said.
The new Airbus CEO, who stepped up from its planemaking division a month ago, repeated warnings over the impact of Britain's European Union exit, while using softer language than his predecessor Tom Enders who threatened to quit the UK.
Airbus, which makes wings in Britain and employs 14,000 people across the country, is using the delay in Brexit to ""prepare for all scenarios,"" Faury said, adding that a no-deal Brexit remained on the table, even if less likely.
""Things have basically not changed, and therefore they are worsening. This long-lasting lack of clarity is ... a distraction,"" he said.

""The UK is really a place where we are part of the ecosystem. Our plants and our sites in the UK are very competitive. We would like this to continue, whatever happens.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan's former Asia investment banking vice-chair Catherine Leung has been charged with two counts of bribery by Hong Kong's anti-corruption watchdog for offering a job to the son of a potential client.
Leung allegedly offered employment to the son of the chairman of a logistics company in 2010 and 2011 as a reward for the chairman favoring J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) when choosing banks to work on the company's IPO, Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement on Thursday.
Leung, currently at MizMaa Ventures, an Israeli-U.S. tech-focused venture capital firm she co-founded, did not immediately respond to a Reuters email sent via MizMaa requesting comment.
Leung has been released on ICAC bail pending a scheduled appearance in a Hong Kong magistrates court on May 20, ICAC said.
ICAC said that in 2010 and 2011, the times of the alleged offences, Leung was responsible for sourcing business for JP Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) and its parent JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said: ""This is a historical case, which J.P. Morgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016.""
""We strengthened our compliance procedures and controls around hiring and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people,"" the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
In 2016, JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials - dubbed ""princelings"" - to win banking deals, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Justice Department.
U.S. authorities at that time said JPMorgan's Asia unit created an elaborate program, called ""Sons and Daughters,"" that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires.
Leung was vice-chair of Asia investment banking when she left JPMorgan in February 2015 amid a wider reshuffle in the bank's regional leadership.
She first joined JPMorgan in 1994, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, and left to join rival Merrill Lynch in 2001, before rejoining JPMorgan in 2002.

480,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>","On the radar: Nissan stays cool on lidar tech, siding with Tesla","By Naomi Tajitsu
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Thursday it would, for now, stick to self-driving technology which uses radar sensors and cameras, avoiding lidar or light-based sensors because of their high cost and limited capabilities.
The Japanese automaker unveiled updated self-driving technology a month after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Chief Executive Elon Musk called lidar ""a fool's errand"", berating the technology for being expensive and unnecessary.
Nissan, which wants to have its self-driving cars on city streets by 2020, has long shunned lidar, a relatively new technology for automobiles which has recently been the subject of an influx in investment by many of its rivals.
""At the moment, lidar lacks the capabilities to exceed the capabilities of the latest technology in radar and cameras,"" Tetsuya Iijima, general manager of advanced technology development for automated driving, told reporters at Nissan's headquarters.
""It would be fantastic if lidar technology was at the level that we could use it in our systems, but it's not. There's an imbalance between its cost and its capabilities.""
Iijima unveiled Nissan's own latest self-driving technology, which enables hands-free driving in single lanes on highways on predefined routes.
The technology, to be released in Japan later this year, uses radar and sonar sensors along with cameras to compile the three-dimensional mapping data required for cars to ""see"" their surroundings.
Apart from sonar, side radar and around-view monitoring cameras, Nissan said it has developed a ""tri-cam"" that focuses on three points to the front and sides of the vehicle to capture a wide area of view.
Tesla also relies on cameras and radars for its self-driving technology.
Nissan wants to add its self-driving technology to more of its affordable models to boost sales and recover from a profit slump. When reporting earnings earlier this week, the automaker said it had hit ""rock bottom"" in the aftermath of a financial scandal involving its ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn.
FOOL'S ERRAND?
Lidar is currently used by companies including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo as automakers and tech firms race to develop self-driving cars. 
Lidar technology uses light-based sensors that fire roughly 1 million laser pulses a second as it collects measurements that are analyzed and processed into 3D models and maps.
More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been pumped into some 50 lidar startups over the past three years, according to a Reuters analysis in March of publicly available investment data.
Still, it is a technology in flux.

Initially using bulky spinning devices placed on the roof of cars, lidar developers have transitioned to more compact solid-state devices that can be mounted on other parts of a car. These now sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, and are widely expected to eventually sell for as little as $200 in mass production.

481,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 16, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Trump's Huawei Threat Is the Nuclear Option to Halt China's Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is pulling out the big guns in its push to slow China’s rise, with potentially devastating consequences for the rest of the world.
The White House on Wednesday initiated a two-pronged assault on China: barring companies deemed a national security threat from selling to the U.S., and threatening to blacklist Huawei Technologies Co. from buying essential components. If it follows through, the move could cripple China’s largest technology company, depress the business of American chip giants from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. to Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)., and potentially disrupt the rollout of critical 5G wireless networks around the world.
“The Trump administration action is a grave escalation with China,” Eurasia Group analysts Paul Triolo, Michael Hirson and Jeffrey Wright wrote in a note. If fully implemented, the blacklist would “put at risk both the company itself and the networks of Huawei customers around the world, as the firm would be unable to upgrade software and conduct routine maintenance and hardware replacement.”
The threat is likely to elevate fears in Beijing that President Donald Trump’s broader goal is to contain China, leading to a protracted cold war between the world’s biggest economies. In addition to a trade fight that has rattled global markets for months, the U.S. has pressured both allies and foes to avoid using Huawei for 5G networks that will form the backbone of the modern economy.
“@Huawei 5G, RIP. Thanks for playing,” U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, wrote on Twitter.
Shares in Huawei-suppliers, including Sunny Optical Technology Group and AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., tanked in Asia Thursday. But U.S.-based suppliers could also take a hit: Huawei has said it devotes about a third of its budget -- some $11 billion annually -- to the acquisition of American components. It counts 33 U.S. companies among its top 92 suppliers.
“The negative impact on the global 5G market will be significant,” said Charlie Dai, a Beijing-based analyst at Forrester Research, nothing that Huawei is one of the market leaders globally. “Nokia and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) could address the gap to some extent, but the overall adoption will be slowed down, which eventually will be harmful to telco carriers and consumers around the world.”
The Commerce Department said Wednesday it will soon put Huawei on an “Entity List” -- meaning any U.S. company will need a special license to sell products to the world’s largest networking gear maker. Since American companies dominate semiconductors, that could smother Huawei’s production of everything from 5G base stations to mobile phones. It may not even be able to use Google’s Android, the most popular operating system globally for smartphones. A similar move last year against ZTE Corp (HK:0763). -- China’s second-biggest telecom equipment company -- nearly forced the company out of business.
At the heart of Trump’s concerted campaign is suspicion that Huawei aids Beijing in espionage while spearheading China’s ambitions of becoming a technology superpower. The Justice Department also accuses it of willfully violating sanctions on Iran, and last year engineered the arrest of the eldest daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder.
Huawei, which has denied those allegations, said Thursday it was “ready and willing” to engage with the U.S. to ensure product security. Restricting it from doing business “will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior yet more expensive alternatives,” it said in a statement.
China’s government said it will take “all necessary measures” to defend its companies.
“We resolutely object to any country, based on their own laws, unilaterally sanctioning Chinese entities,” Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said at a regularly scheduled briefing in Beijing Thursday. “We also object to the generalization of the national security concept and abuse of export control methods.”
The lack of alternatives is one reason that it’s far from certain the U.S. will make good on its threat to cut off Huawei. Observers for months had been dismissing the possibility, in part because it would hurt some of America’s largest tech corporations. The Trump administration has also been pressuring allies to bar Huawei equipment from their communications networks for security reasons. But the U.S. effort had largely failed, as even the U.K. declined to join the American call for a boycott.
If the U.S. kneecaps Huawei by cutting off suppliers, countries and telecoms carriers around the world that are already shelling out billions to build 5G networks may have to resort to pricier equipment from Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) AB. Tying up a chunk of the world’s 5G gear supply would slow the build-out of a technology that underpins future services from self-driving cars to smart homes and advanced medicine.
Huawei appears to have anticipated this possibility. It’s been developing and designing its own chips for years, which it now uses in many of its own smartphones. It’s reportedly even developing its own operating software to run phones and servers.
For now, though, it remains heavily reliant on American technology.
Huawei’s base station, smartphone, server and maritime cable businesses simply cannot run without Qualcomm baseband and processor chips. There are alternatives -- but from American peers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Micron and Broadcom Corp (NASDAQ:AVGO).
It also depends on smaller American suppliers in key areas: Lumentum Holdings Inc. for optical cable; Amphenol (NYSE:APH) for fiber-optic connectors; Inphi Corp. for analog chips; Qorvo Inc. and  Analog Devices  Inc (NASDAQ:ADI). for radio-frequency semiconductors in both 4G and 5G; and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). for storage. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc. supplies it with digital signal processing chips. Huawei even uses  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). software in products sold to state-owned companies.
ZTE provides a roadmap for what may happen next. Huawei’s much smaller rival in 2017 ran afoul of the Commerce Department for violating the same Iranian sanctions, and then lying about it. The subsequent ban on American exports pushed the company to the brink of extinction, before Trump intervened as part of trade negotiations with Beijing.
A blanket ban would hurt not just U.S. companies, but also alienate American allies around the world. Many have resisted Washington’s attempts to steer them away from Huawei, for reasons ranging from economics to just the simple fact that the Shenzhen-based company’s 5G technology is for now considered superior.
That’s why some observers, including the Eurasia Group, argue that the White House is unlikely to bring the full force of a blacklist to bear. Instead, it argued, the Trump administration is likely to issue export licenses to all of its American companies while retaining the option in future to pull them if needed.
Roger Sheng at market research firm Gartner Inc. draws parallels with the Chinese fable of the Monkey King, whose powers are constrained by a magic circlet that his handler constricts -- painfully -- when the deity misbehaves.
“The U.S. is putting a circlet around the head of Huawei,” said Sheng, who is based in Shanghai. “The impact goes well beyond its 5G ambitions because without American suppliers like Qualcomm and Marvell, it can’t even maintain normal operations.”"
482,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Brokers brave China's FX market crackdown in hunt for household high rollers,"By Samuel Shen and Vidya Ranganathan
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lured by hopes that China's retail investors could become major players in global currency markets, foreign brokers are brazenly chasing business in a gray area of the country's online trading sector, even as Beijing vows to wipe out such activities.
Despite its booming middle-class, household foreign exchange trading in the world's most populous nation has been insignificant, restricted by tight cross-border capital controls and a ban on currency margin trading, in which investors borrow money to trade.
Those curbs, however, have not stopped locals trading currencies online on platforms owned and operated by foreign brokers, which appear to be exploiting regulatory loopholes, notably the fact their systems are based offshore.
In Shanghai last month, Australian firm Cardiff Global Markets pitched its ""1,000 people, 1,000 cities"" vision, a plan to sign up a million clients to its offshore forex trading platform.
""How much is 1,000 times 1,000? Correct! It's one million,"" Cardiff's China representative Carl He told a group of brokers to rousing applause at the marketing event, many of whom signed up as local partners.
That exuberance is shared by other firms who are sponsoring local exhibitions, holding lectures on trading skills and cultivating relationships with local businesses.
They are drawn to China by hopes the retail forex community could one day rival the so-called ""Mrs Watanabes"", the nickname given to Japan's day-traders who emerged as major global currency players in the 1990s.
Javier Paz, founder of advisory firm ForexDatasource.com, says that if deregulated, China's retail forex market would dwarf Japan to become the world's largest, ""given the appetite for speculative trading in the population"". He estimates Japan has about 7-8 million retail traders, of whom at least 700,000 are active.
Internet use is widespread among China's 1.4 billion people but the retail trading market is minuscule. Forex website fx220.com reckons the country has about 1.5 million currency trading accounts, with only 200,000 active.
Yet, retail forex trading in China each day averaged about $31 billion in 2016, accounting for 6-7 percent of the global market, highlighting the huge potential for growth.
It's a highly profitable but risky business, Paz warns, given local authorities could impose fines, seize computers or even detain local managers.
BRAZEN BETS
Forex margin trading is officially banned in China. Individuals can trade currencies through commercial banks, but without leverage, and there are limits on how much one can buy in a year in China.
Overseas forex brokers, however, have been active in China since the 1980s, offering leverage of up to 400-times, thanks to lax enforcement.
These brokers have helped Chinese citizens move money into overseas bank accounts to trade, often via online currency transactions, according to their product brochures, or even through fake deals, according to salespeople. Brokers that own overseas licenses argue that investor money is safe, internet trading is boundless, and China has no rules banning them from doing business in the country.
But regulatory conditions are changing: China has over the past year intensified already tight scrutiny of outbound capital flows and hunted down some online brokers after a surge of complaints from loss-making investors.
In a statement to Reuters, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) reiterated that forex margin trading is illegal in China. ""The Internet knows no national boundaries, but there must be national boundaries for financial licenses. Cross-border financial service providers cannot operate without a license,"" China's forex regulator said in the emailed statement.
SAFE said regulators are cleaning up online forex trading platforms and strengthening international regulatory cooperation, having shut down more than 600 illegal forex platforms by the end of 2018.
CAT-AND-MOUSE
While this regulatory sweep has forced some firms to shutter onshore offices, others are less fazed.
FXOpen, a forex trading platform, recently opened a second China office. Others, including CXM Trading and CMS Prime, said they were also looking for ways to tap the market.
Even Chinese firms, such as  Citic  Securities (SS:600030), Nanhua Futures and carmaker Geely, have entered the market, through acquiring overseas forex trading platforms.
Within China, firms like Cardiff are targeting small cities and counties, seeking to convert stock investors into forex traders.
Mr. Shi, who only gave his family name, is exactly the kind of investor Cardiff seeks.
Based in Yuncheng in eastern Shandong province, Shi was lured into forex trading five years ago by the prospect of quick fortune.
He operates an eight-person trading room and mainly invests in euro and sterling, using technical models with strict rules on cutting losses.
""What matters is not to make big bucks in one bet but to steadily make small profits, without going bust,"" said Shi.
Shi opened accounts at several offshore forex trading platforms, transferred $50,000 to each account via third-party payment companies, and has traded on a leverage of between 100-400 times his capital.
The risks for firms like Cardiff are growing, however, as China seeks to co-ordinate law enforcement with Australian regulators.
The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) said in a statement in April that Chinese authorities had advised that ""some online platforms are illegally engaged in forex margin trading activities,"" and ASIC would not condone brokers who break the law overseas. 
But even with more expansive curbs, there are still ways firms can steer clear of authorities.
Some chase Chinese traders with money already parked offshore. Other methods include using multiple licenses, shifting to online marketing, or simply maintaining a low onshore profile.
""It's like cat-and-mouse kind of game and they've been hunted for years,"" said Audrey Blater, senior analyst at research firm Aite Group.

The tiny but wealthy Gulf state has seen its rental prices slide by 20 percent over the past three years. Analysts expect these prices to fall further as a wave of projects tied to the tournament come online over the next three years.
Qatar has had the added challenge of a diplomatic and trade boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since 2017. The move has hit tourism and dampened demand for real estate from foreign buyers. 
The bloc accuses Qatar of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies. Qatar has since moved to liberalize its real estate sector, opening up new areas to foreign buying in a bid to boost demand.
While Qatari banks have largely bounced back from liquidity issues arising from the 2017 boycott, when around $30 billion in deposits left the system, Fitch said deteriorating real estate assets are now a ""key risk"".
""Qatari banks' concentrated exposure to the weakening domestic real estate market is an increasing risk to asset quality,"" Fitch said, naming Doha Bank, Commercial Bank, and International Bank of Qatar as the most exposed.
""The real estate and hospitality sectors, already facing falling prices due to oversupply in preparation for the 2022 World Cup, have been further pressured by reduced tourism and occupancy rates resulting from the boycott of Qatar.""
Fitch said however that Qatari banks' credit ratings would not be affected ""as they are driven by our assumption of the authorities' propensity and ability to provide support to the banks, if needed"".

Qatar injected about $40 billion into its banking system in the months after the boycott in order to boost liquidity.

484,By Investing.com,"<span>May 16, 2019 04:44AM ET</span>","StockBeat: U.S. Huawei Ban Lifts Nokia, Ericsson","Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com - It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good, so they say, and it's no surprise to see who's profiting from the U.S.'s decision to effectively ban Huawei from its market.
Shares in Europe's two leading makers of telecoms network equipment are both higher after early trade, with Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) rising 0.9% and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) up 1.4%. They're among very few companies gaining on a day when fear of an all-out trade war between the world's two largest economies is dominating sentiment.
As of 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was down 0.1% at 377.5 while Germany's DAX was down 0.5% and the U.K. FTSE 100 down 0.2%
Ominously, automotive stocks have struggled to build on the late gains they made on Wednesday after the U.S. administration decided to hold fire on levying tariffs on car imports for six months. The big auto names are all down by 1% or more, as are many of their biggest suppliers.
The Commerce Department's order Wednesday not only bans Huawei from taking part in tenders to build 5G networks in the U.S., it also makes companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) require licenses to sell Huawei the chips it needs to make its equipment. As such, it could hobble Huawei's efforts to build out 5G in Europe and elsewhere too.
Less competition from Huawei means greater pricing power for the Scandinavian companies, who have lost market share consistently to the Chinese giant in recent years. Nokia last month reported a loss in the first quarter due in large measure to the intensity of competition. Investors may now allow themselves to be a little more confident in the company's prediction of profitability over the full year.
All other things being equal, the loss of Huawei means that telecoms companies, such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) will have to pay more for what is already promising to be a fearsomely expensive network upgrade. And of course it's also bad news for their customers, who will end up footing the bill. Given that the administration's issues with Huawei were already well-known, much of that may already be priced in.
Likewise, some of Europe's biggest operators such as  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and the Netherlands' KPN have already signalled they won't use Huawei in the 'core' of their new 5G networks, although that still leaves them able to buy other, less sensitive, equipment. How badly the new licensing requirement will hit Huawei's ability to compete in that area remains to be seen."

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks fell, government bond yields slipped and the Japanese yen firmed on Thursday after the U.S. government hit Chinese telecoms giant Huawei with severe sanctions, further straining Sino-U.S. trade ties.
An index of European shares fell as much as 0.5% in early European trading with the German stock index down 0.4%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.4%, pointing to a weak start on Wall Street.
The broad weakness in European markets was somewhat offset by small gains in Chinese and Hong Kong stock indexes leading to only marginal losses on a global stock index as investors expected state authorities to step in to support the market and stabilize sentiment.
""Chinese stocks are up as markets expect authorities to intervene to support sentiment but this kind of activity is not sustainable and unless we see a clear resolution in the China-U.S. trade conflict, overall sentiment will remain weak,"" said Neil Mellor, a senior FX strategist at BNY Mellon in London.
While benchmark indexes in China and Hong Kong were up between 0.3-0.8% at the close of trading, bond markets were signalling more pain for risk appetite.
Core German government bond yields were flirting with their lowest level in nearly three years while Dutch bond yields were about to dip into negative territory, a phenomenon not seen since October 2016.
Late on Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its ""Entity List"" - a move that bans the company from acquiring components and technology from U.S. firms without government approval.
The move took global markets by surprise as sentiment had steadied somewhat in the previous session on news that U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to delay tariffs on auto imports after a swathe of weak U.S. and Chinese economic data.
RATE CUT BETS GROW
As trade tensions have made a reappearance on investors' radars, weak U.S. data has also ratcheted up market expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut in the coming months.
In the United States, retail sales unexpectedly fell in April as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, while industrial production fell 0.5% in April, the third drop this year.
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds eased to 2.366%, near a 15-month low of 2.340% touched on March 28.
Fed funds rate futures are fully pricing in a rate cut by the end of this year and more than a 50% chance of a move by September.
""The markets are inching step by step in pricing in a rate cut. That is a sea change from a year ago when the consensus was three to four rate hikes a year,"" said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One. 
Falling U.S. yields have eroded support for the greenback with the dollar down 0.1 percent against a basket of its rivals.
Oil prices gained on the prospect of mounting tensions in the Middle East hitting global supplies despite an unexpected build in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude rose 0.3% to $71.99 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fetched $62.26, also half a percent higher. 
Gold edged up to $1,296.9 per ounce.

The shares slumped early Thursday after the company reported sales on the mainland that are well behind luxury rivals’ robust gains. Overall guidance for the coming year was unchanged, disappointing investors hoping for a quick fix from Tisci’s new looks.
While sales in the previous year were in line with expectations, the outlook suggests earnings before interest and taxes will decrease by a low single-digit percentage, Morgan Stanley analyst Elena Mariani said in a note.
Tisci has helped put Burberry back in the fashion spotlight as new CEO Marco Gobbetti seeks to reinvigorate growth. While the company said his designs have drawn an encouraging reaction from consumers, it’s too early to measure commercial success as most products didn’t arrive in stores until February.
Sales of runway fashions are up by double-digit percentage since then, Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said on a call. But that represents only about 10% to 15% of the product lineup, the company said.
Burberry moved to appease investors who’ve stuck out the wait as the brand seeks a turnaround, announcing a share buyback of 150 million pounds ($193 million) even after net debt rose during the year.
While China delivered low-single-digit percentage sales growth in the latest year, the company said consumers are shifting spending to the mainland as the country’s consumers buy more fashion items at home rather than elsewhere in Asia. Other luxury brands, led by  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA’s Gucci, are seeing double-digit gains from China.
Worldwide comparable retail sales in the year ended March 30 rose 2%, roughly in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares fell as much as 4.9% in London, the most in six weeks."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Japanese automation machinery makers, construction firms and suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). have borne the brunt of recent selling in the country's stock market after an escalation in U.S.-Sino trade tensions.
The Nikkei index has fallen on 7 out of the last eight trading sessions amid a global market rout. 
The slide came after a setback in the long-running trade war, when U.S. President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, saying China reneged on commitments made earlier during negotiations. China retaliated on Monday.
Adding to the pressure on Asian equity markets, surprisingly weak Chinese data on Wednesday pointed to slower growth in the world's second-largest economy, a big market for Japan.
Shares of Fanuc Corp, which makes industrial robots, have tumbled 8.5% so far this month.
The company saw a significant drop in its China sales for the fiscal year ended March 2019. China now accounts 19% of its overall sales, down from 30% a year ago.
Shares of servo motor maker Yaskawa Electric have dropped 9.2%, while Tokyo Electron and Advantest Corp are down around 7.5% each, underperforming a 5% drop in the Nikkei benchmark index.
""Machinery and exporters' stocks are the most hit and will likely stay pressured in the next 2-3 months,"" said Naoki Kamiyama, chief strategist at Nikko Asset Management.
He said it now seemed far fetched to expect Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would reach a deal by the time they meet on the sidelines of a G20 gathering in late June.

Japanese-based Apple suppliers have also turned sharply lower, with Murata Manufacturing diving 16%, Alps Alpine plunging 15% and Minebea Mitsumi sliding 13%.
Construction equipment makers with heavy China exposure are taking it on the chin, too.
Komatsu Ltd has dived 18%, while another Hitachi Construction Machinery has plunged 16%. Komatsu expects a 15.3% drop in operating profit for this fiscal year due to weak sales from such regions as China and North America for its construction, mining and utility equipment.

Investors expect Japanese exporters' earnings will remain under pressure. Japanese companies are likely to report a 1% drop in pretax profits this fiscal year through March, Daiwa Securities said, while machinery firms are expected to see a 14% drop and precision equipment makers are seen posting a 9% fall.
According to BoFA Merrill, global fund managers' Japan equity allocation showed that global investors have no plan to go overweight on Japan over the next 12 months as the profit outlook for Japanese equities has continued to deteriorate.
""On top of weak earnings concerns, there is another worry about Japan's weak EPS which has a correlation with trade data,"" said Shusuke Yamada, a FX/Equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), referring to the earnings-per-share standard measure of equity returns.
""There is no room for Japan's monetary policy to loosen further and the country's population is not growing. Japan's economy relies heavily on the global economy, so there is no domestic reason to buy Japanese stocks now.""

U.S. President Donald Trump surprised global markets last week by hiking tariffs on Chinese goods in the midst of trade negotiations, saying China had backtracked on earlier commitments. Beijing retaliated on Monday.
The emerging market exodus was led by Chinese equities, which saw outflows of $1.5 billion on Monday, after investors took $2.5 billion off the table last week, according to the IIF.
Outflows from Taiwan hit $400 million on Wednesday, and other emerging Asian countries, such as South Korea, India and Indonesia, ""have mirrored China's trend, highlighting the risks to the broader EM complex from increased US-China trade tensions,"" said IIF economists Jonathan Fortun and Greg Basile.
But bond inflows remained steady, with Thailand recording its highest daily inflows in nearly three months this week, at over $240 million.

IIF said recent outflows came to around $1 billion, largest since last October's $1.1 billion.

""As we continue our investigation of the root cause, out of an abundance of caution, we are revising charge and thermal management settings on Model S and Model X vehicles via an over-the-air software update that will begin rolling out today, to help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity."" Tesla said in a statement on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper reported that a Tesla car caught fire in a shopping mall parking lot 30 minutes after being parked.
Tesla said its investigation with authorities into that incident so far found only a few of the car's battery modules affected and that the majority of the battery pack was undamaged.
The Hong Kong incident came three weeks after Tesla said it had sent a team to investigate a video on Chinese social media that showed a parked Tesla Model S car exploding in the commercial hub of Shanghai.

There have been at least 14 instances of Tesla cars catching fire since 2013, most of them following a crash.

Josh Stein, the first state attorney general to sue Juul, said the company's targeted marketing toward youth, while downplaying the potential harm its products can cause, resulted in an ""epidemic"" of vaping among minors. 
Stein announced an investigation into Juul last October looking into its marketing practices and retail partners.
Juul's e-cigarettes resemble USB flash drives and work by vaporizing a nicotine-laced liquid.
Stein said he shared information from his investigation with other states and would not be surprised if they followed North Carolina's lead.
A Juul spokesman said the company had not yet reviewed the lawsuit, but has been cooperating with Stein's office. 
E-cigarette makers are already under pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which laid out plans in March to clamp down on the use of the popular nicotine devices among teens.
Juul, in which Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) has a 35 percent stake, has already pulled popular flavors such as mango and cucumber from retail store shelves and shut down its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Stein said he is requesting the North Carolina State Court to require Juul to limit the flavors sold in the state and delete customer data for those below 18. He also requested Juul pay civil penalties.

494,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 10:22PM ET</span>",Harvey Weinstein's former film studio plans to liquidate in bankruptcy,"By Jim Christie and Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - The film studio once run by Harvey Weinstein said it plans to liquidate in bankruptcy, as it tries to resolve civil lawsuits against former directors and officers arising from sexual misconduct claims against the onetime Hollywood mogul.
Lawyers for Weinstein Co asked a Delaware bankruptcy judge to convert the studio's bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 liquidation from the Chapter 11 case filed in March 2018, according to papers filed on Tuesday night.
Several rounds of mediation over the last 10 months have failed to resolve liability claims arising from Weinstein's alleged misconduct, the lawyers said.
A hearing on the conversion request is scheduled for June 4.
Weinstein, 67, fell from grace after more than 70 women, mostly young actresses and others in the movie business, accused him of sexual misconduct dating back decades.
He has denied all accusations and said any contact was consensual.
Weinstein has also pleaded not guilty to criminal charges arising from his having allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on a woman in 2006 and raped another woman in 2013.
A trial is scheduled for September.
Weinstein's case helped launch the #MeToo movement, where dozens of powerful men in entertainment, politics and other fields were accused of sexual misconduct. Many lost their jobs.
Lawyers for Weinstein Co said Chapter 7 was best because the company had sold nearly all its assets in a $289 million sale last July to private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners, and lacked enough liquidity to reorganize under Chapter 11.
They also said liquidation was the best means to resolve claims against the former directors and officers, taking into account the interests of their insurers.
Weinstein Co's plan to hire a law firm, Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, to pursue claims it might have against the directors and officers drew two objections on Wednesday, including from New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Her office said hiring a firm with no prior involvement in the case might drag out negotiations on a possible global settlement, waste time that lawyers already spent and unnecessarily deplete the debtors' limited resources.
Lawyers for Weinstein Co did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the objections. 

The case is In re Weinstein Co Holdings LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 18-bk-10601.

The earnings growth of non-financial mainland-listed companies could drop by about 4.2 percentage points over 12 months on the back of last Friday’s move by the U.S. to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, according to China International Capital Corp. analysts Wang Hanfeng and Zhou Changjie. For those listed overseas, they forecast the drag to be 5.1 percentage points.
Washington has followed up with a threat to apply 25% tariffs to another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, covering virtually all imports from the country. That puts obvious pressure on exporters of those products, while companies within the global supply chain are also at risk of losing orders if multinationals shift operations to countries such as Vietnam to lower costs and avoid tariffs.
The weaker yuan caused by trade tension is also hurting companies with piles of dollar-denominated debt, including airlines and real-estate firms. The big three carriers -- Air China Ltd., China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. -- closed between 5.8% and 7.1% lower in Hong Kong on Tuesday when markets reopened for the first time since the tariff increase.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded its ratings and price targets on the airlines on Tuesday, and CICC followed with cuts on Thursday.
CHINA INSIGHT: Very Few Firms Can Live With 25% Tariffs
For Caroline Maurer, head of Greater China equities at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, the impact of the escalation in the trade dispute should be “manageable” because Beijing -- which has retaliated with higher levies on U.S. goods -- is likely to step up its easing measures to offset the impact on economic growth. Still, some areas won’t escape unscathed.
“Sectors that are going to be the most impacted are sectors related to the global supply chain, such as China’s electronics,” she wrote in an email.

496,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 09:37PM ET</span>",Trump administration hits China's Huawei with one-two punch,"By David Shepardson and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday took aim at China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, banning the firm from buying vital U.S. technology without special approval and effectively barring its equipment from U.S. telecom networks on national security grounds.
Taken together, the two moves threaten Huawei's ability to continue to sell many products because of its reliance on American suppliers, and represents a significant escalation in the U.S. government's worldwide campaign against the company.
The steps also come at a delicate time in relations between China and the United States as the world's two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China's unfair trade practices. 
Washington believes the handsets and network equipment for telecommunications companies made by Huawei could be used by the Chinese state to spy on Americans. 
Huawei, which has repeatedly denied the allegations, said in a statement that ""restricting Huawei from doing business in the U.S. will not make the U.S. more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the U.S. lagging behind in 5G deployment."" 
""In addition, unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei's rights and raise other serious legal issues.""
The ban on U.S. suppliers, which appears similar to one on Huawei rival ZTE Corp (HK:0763). last year, could hit the shares of Huawei's biggest U.S. suppliers, including chipmakers Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc. 
In the first action taken on Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk.
The order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States. It directs the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by October.
Members of Congress said Trump's order was squarely aimed at Chinese companies like Huawei, which generated $93 billion in revenue last year and is seen as a national champion in China.
""China’s main export is espionage, and the distinction between the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese ‘private-sector’ businesses like Huawei is imaginary,"" Republican Senator Ben Sasse said.
ENTITY LIST
Soon after the White House announced the order had been signed, the Commerce Department said it had added Huawei and 70 affiliates to its so-called Entity List - a move that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.
U.S. officials told Reuters the decision would make it difficult, if not impossible, for Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, to sell some products because of its reliance on U.S. suppliers. It will take effect in the coming days.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Trump backed the decision that will ""prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.""
With Huawei on the Entity List, U.S. suppliers will need to apply for licenses to provide the Chinese company with anything subject to U.S. export control regulations. Obtaining such licenses will be difficult because they will have to show the transfer of items will not harm U.S. national security, said John Larkin, a former export control officer in Beijing for the Commerce Department. 
The United States in January unsealed a 13-count indictment against Huawei accusing the company and its chief financial officer of conspiring to defraud global financial institutions by misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with a suspected front company that operated in Iran.
The indictment was unsealed a month after CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on a U.S. warrant for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng, who maintains her innocence, is fighting extradition.
5G NETWORKS
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Trump was expected to sign his long-awaited executive order this week. The order does not specifically name any country or company, but U.S. officials have previously labeled Huawei a ""threat"".
The United States has been actively pushing other countries not to use the Chinese company's equipment in next-generation 5G networks that it calls ""untrustworthy."" In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government from using equipment from Huawei and another Chinese provider, ZTE Corp.
ZTE was added to the Commerce Department's Entity List in March 2016 over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries in violation of U.S. law.
The restrictions prevented suppliers from providing ZTE with U.S. equipment, potentially freezing the company's supply chain, but the restrictions were suspended in a series of temporary reprieves, allowing the company to maintain ties to U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.
The status of Huawei and ZTE has taken on new urgency as U.S. wireless carriers rollout 5G networks.

While the big wireless companies have already cut ties with Huawei, small rural carriers continue to rely on both Huawei and ZTE switches and other equipment because they tend to be cheaper. Trump's order applies to future purchases and does not address existing hardware, officials said Wednesday.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it would convene a meeting in Montreal, Canada on May 23 and invite airlines that have the Boeing 737 MAX in their fleet or on order.
""The meeting is for airlines only, although updates from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing will feature on the agenda,"" IATA said in a statement.
IATA counts around 290 airlines as members of its association, of which 28 have the Boeing 737 MAX in their fleet.
Boeing's 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board just five months after a similar crash on a Lion Air flight that killed all 189 passengers and crew.
May 23 is also the same day the U.S. FAA is planning a meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, with air regulators from around the world to update them on reviews of Boeing's planned software update and new pilot training. 

Boeing has said the software upgrade and associated pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which activated in the Ethiopian Airlines crash and also during the Lion Air crash.

498,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 07:52PM ET</span>","Cisco beats earnings target, says has cushioned supply chain from tariffs","By Akanksha Rana and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday and gave an upbeat sales forecast for the current period, saying that minimal sales exposure to China and changes to its supply chains have helped cushion the blow of U.S.-China trade dispute.
The United States raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% last week, prompting China to increase duties on $60 billion of U.S. goods in retaliation on Monday.
Analysts have been worried about the impact of the trade war on Cisco's traditional business of selling switches and routers because some are made in China.
However, the company said it had been working for six months to change its supply chain and that it expects minimal impact at this point.
""We still have some manufacturing happening in China. But we've greatly, greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers,"" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said on a post-earnings conference call.
Shares of the Dow component rose 2.5% to $53.75 in extended trading.
Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said only about 3% of Cisco's overall revenues come from China, shielding it from slowing economic growth there that has caused slower sales for tech companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) . She told Reuters that some Cisco products still face tariffs even after the company moved manufacturing lines for some U.S.-bound products and found alternative sources for some parts.
""We still have products that are being tariffed, but we are reducing the size of that pie,"" she said. ""We can take some pricing actions to account for the cost.""
The company has been betting on its newer business such as cyber security and software as it looks to counter any impact from slowing sales of routers and switches.
Sales in the company's security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 21% to $707 million, beating estimates of $670.4 million. 
Revenue in its software business rose 9% to $1.43 billion, but fell short of estimates of $1.52 billion.
Revenue in its infrastructure platform business, which includes switches and routers, rose 5% to $7.55 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.47 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That business is expected to get a boost from 5G communication networks, but Cisco executives said they do not expect an impact until 2020.
The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, implying $13.33 billion at the mid-point, and adjusted profit of 80 cents to 82 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 81 cents per share and revenue of $13.29 billion.
""The results continue to be consistent. They were pretty much in line which is a relief to investors given all the negative macro news,"" Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said.
Net income rose to $3.04 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the third quarter ended April 27 from $2.69 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 78 cents per share. Analysts were expecting Cisco to earn 77 cents per share. 

Total revenue rose about 4% to $12.96 billion, beating estimates of $12.89 billion.

Soros' increase in the 1.250% convertible bonds follows the firm's purchase last year of another Tesla convertible bond that came due in March. Soros also previously held some Tesla stock, but he sold off his stake in 2017.
A spokesman for Soros did not respond to a request for comment. 
Convertibles are hybrid securities, either bonds or preferred stock, that can be exchanged for a predetermined number of common shares. That effectively lets an investor participate in stock-price changes but with the yield and greater security of a fixed-income instrument.
Soros Fund Management also opened a new stake of 200,000 shares in ride-sharing giant  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), which went public in late March.

WINDWHISTLE, New Zealand (Reuters) - At Dave Harper's family farm in New Zealand's scenic Canterbury region, a painstakingly bred flock of lambs is grazing, not on grass, but on a field of herbs selected to unlock healthy omega-3 fatty acids in the animals' meat.
Known as 'Te Mana lambs', they are part of an effort by the island nation to future-proof its agricultural sector from the threat of meat and dairy substitutes based on synthetic proteins or plant-based alternatives. 
Aimed at occupying a similar niche as premium Wagyu beef, each Te Mana lamb has a unique number and has been tracked, weighed and scanned since birth.
""We've got to tell our story better and we can't do that unless we collect the information…everything's got to be right,"" said Harper, whose farm hosts the lambs for their final few weeks grazing on chicory herbs after being brought down from the mountainous high country.
The lambs have received millions of dollars in government funding in a joint venture with meat company Alliance Group. Both want to cut the country's dependence on shipping bulk commodities and move up the value chain into luxury products with burnished ethical, environmental and health credentials.
New Zealand relies on agricultural farming and processing for 8% of its GDP, among the highest in the OECD so has a lot to lose as synthetic food gathers momentum. 
With an ideal climate, plenty of arable land and a long farming history, New Zealand is the world's top dairy exporter, and ranks second and seventh for sheepmeat and beef exports respectively. 
""I see this as both an opportunity and threat to New Zealand, depending on how we react to this emerging reality,"" New Zealand Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor told Reuters. ""Animal welfare, labor standards, environmental management and food safety systems must be the best in the world."" 
DISRUPTIVE THREAT
The global meat substitutes market is predicted to reach $6.4 billion by 2023, according to research firm Markets and Markets, still a tiny fraction of the multi-trillion dollar traditional meat market but growing quickly. Asia, New Zealand's top agricultural export market, is the fastest growing region.
High-profile investors are pouring in. 
Vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc, which counts Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates and actor Leonardo DiCaprio among its backers, saw shares surge after its initial public stock offering, reflecting ravenous investor demand.
Impossible Foods, which makes a meatless plant-based burger and is backed by celebrities like Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Katy Perry, this week announced it raised $300 million ahead of a possible initial public offering.
Dairy is also at risk, particularly in the ingredients business, which relies on products such as milk powder and dairy-protein casein in everything from cakes and cookies to salad dressing and chewing gum.
San Francisco-based Perfect Day plans to roll out dairy-like ingredients based on yeast cultures within the next two years, while Ripple Foods is selling a milk substitute, derived from yellow peas, throughout the United States.
New Zealand's Fonterra, the world's biggest dairy exporter, has taken note. It made a modest investment – it has not disclosed the exact value - in U.S.-based Motif, a start-up using fermentation technology to create ingredients that mimic milk and egg proteins.
""We're trying....to position ourselves so if this was to take off and become a huge demand, that we're well placed to try and tap into it,"" said Judith Swales, head of Fonterra's consumer and foodservice business. ""We can't say that we don't see an increasing rise in veganism and vegetarianism.""
After safety scares in China and criticism from environmentalists at home, Fonterra has also introduced a 'trusted goodness' seal to its products, which it says reflects increased efforts to improve traceability and ensure its grass-fed status and animal welfare meet independent standards. 
CHANGES COMING
Still, many animal and environmental advocates say damage from industrial agriculture is unavoidable. 
Complaints include the removal of male 'bobby' calves from their mothers, methane emissions from animals, and chemical and agricultural runoff polluting New Zealand's once pristine rivers and lakes. 
The government has introduced new requirements for the agriculture sector to slash methane emissions by 10 percent in the next decade, drawing a vocal backlash from farmers who say they have already improved practices significantly.
The industry is banking on its clean, green image to capture a niche global pool of consumers willing to pay a premium for ethically produced real meat and dairy. 
""There's going to be people who don't always want to have the synthetic stuff and having the organic, outdoor pasture fed stuff is definitely going to have a huge part of that market,"" said entrepreneur Craig Piggott. 
His agri-tech start-up, Halter, has won backing from Silicon Valley venture capitalists, some of whom also invest in synthetic proteins.
North Island-based Halter is in the trial phases of a device, worn around the cow's necks, that allows farmers to monitor cattle health from an iPad, much like a human fitness tracker. 
The device can help to share information with consumers and uses noises and vibrations to direct livestock away from waterways without the need for farmhands, dogs, or fences.
Other agricultural projects, from milk powder with immune-enhancing probiotic properties to farm management and product tracing software, are attracting government research and funding through the Ministry of Primary Industries.
The partly state-funded Primary Growth Partnership plans to spend NZ$726 million ($478 million) on innovative projects in agriculture and horticulture. Te Mana lambs received NZ$12.5 million from the fund for the decade they took to develop with the help of a full-time geneticist and a handful of farmers working to develop a new niche for one of New Zealand's most famous foods.

""There are some big changes coming,"" said Harper, 57, one of the farmers. ""We're going to see more changes in the next 10 or 15 years than we've ever seen before.""

HANOI (Reuters) - As Vietnam's aviation sector booms and passenger numbers rise at double-digit rates, local upstart Bamboo Airways is embracing what it hopes will be a novel way of standing out in a crowded market: Golf.
Competition among airlines in Vietnam has intensified since Bamboo launched in January. Malaysia's AirAsia Group recently canceled its foray into the Vietnamese market, and increased traffic has placed strain on Vietnam's aging infrastructure.
But Bamboo chief executive Trinh Van Quyet is confident he can fend off budget carrier VietJet and state-owned Vietnam Airlines by using the airline to connect his golf resorts to cities in Vietnam and northeast Asia.
""Even international airlines don't have an ecosystem like Bamboo's,"" said Quyet, chairman of Bamboo's parent company, FLC, which owns five golf resorts across the country.
The young airline's slogan is ""more than just a flight.""
""We have the rooms and combo packages for passengers. They can visit Vietnam, stay and play golf for free,"" Quyet told Reuters in a recent interview from an FLC resort in Ha Long Bay.
Quyet is hoping that helps draw tourist crowds from South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, some of Bamboo's first international destinations.
Bamboo has already sold out its domestic packages for this summer, a company spokeswoman said. 
The package offers flights from the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City to an FLC resort in northern Vietnam for about $500, just more than half what it would cost to fly and golf separately, the spokeswoman added. 
POPULAR ATTRACTION
Tourism to Vietnam from golf-obsessed South Korea has soared in recent years. The number of visitors from that country in January to April this year rose by 23.2 percent from a year earlier to 1.45 million, according to Vietnam's Government Statistic Office.
""I hadn't heard of Bamboo before; I learned about it on the way here,"" said golfer Kim Yeong-jin, a South Korean businessman who had just putted for a bogey at the Ha Long Bay resort's 11th hole.
Kim had traveled to Vietnam with Vietnam Airlines, but said he would be interested in one of Bamboo's packages.
An official at Pacific Air Agency, a Seoul-based PR firm Bamboo hired to attract clients in South Korea, said they expected an increase in tourist demand. 
""That will help Bamboo Airways expand its international routes,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media. Pacific Air Agency plans to start promoting Bamboo this autumn, the official added.
Bamboo also hopes to attract pilots with golf.
In an online job advertisement, the airline said it would offer Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 pilots free golf at FLC resorts. 
In early May, Vietnam's deputy transport minister Nguyen Nhat told a government meeting that his ministry had received a complaint from Vietnam Airlines that the state-owned carrier was losing its pilots to Bamboo.
""That's just how the market works, and the state won't be able to interfere too deeply into this,"" Nhat told the meeting, according to a report posted to a Vietnamese government website. 
Vietnam Airlines, which is more than 80% government-owned, declined to comment.
Nearly one-third of Vietnam Airlines' Boeing 787 pilots have resigned in the past few months, ""pushing the national airlines into an emergency state of pilot shortage,"" a report by state television said on May 9. 
The report said salaries offered by new airlines are significantly higher than at Vietnam Airlines, making them ""irresistible.""

Despite Vietnam's rising GDP and fast-growing tourism industry, it could take some time for Bamboo to reach profitability, according to Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. 
""There's every chance the carrier can be profitable if it can withstand losses in the first couple of years,"" Yusof said. 
Quyet, however, told Reuters he expects Bamboo - which has 20 domestic routes and plans to serve as many as 40 international cities - to be profitable as soon as next year. 
FLC reported a net profit of 470 billion Vietnam dong ($20.13 million) last year, up 22 percent from 2017.
Bamboo leases all 10 of its aircraft but has signed deals with  Boeing Co  and Airbus SE to buy dozens more. The first of Bamboo's Boeing 787s is scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter next year, and its first Airbus A321 in 2022.
Quyet told Reuters that capital from Bamboo, FLC and funds borrowed from Vietnamese and foreign banks would be used for the purchases.
""The payment for the planes is being made normally and in a timely manner,"" he said.
The lawyer-turned-entrepreneur said he made his fortune investing in real estate with FLC, short for the Finance Land Corporation.
By 2016, he had become Vietnam's second dollar billionaire and started to turn his attention to planes.

""When I was a student, I couldn't even afford a bicycle,"" Quyet said.

502,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 06:33PM ET</span>",Big U.S. hedge funds regain ardor for FAANGs in first quarter: filings,"By Jennifer Ablan and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Some of the biggest, highest-profile U.S. hedge fund investors and money managers fell back in love with FAANGs in the first quarter, according to regulatory filings released on Wednesday. 
After dumping shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc - the FAANG components - prominent hedge fund managers including Tiger Global Management LLC have moved back into the popular group. 
Tiger, managed by Chase Coleman, boosted its Facebook stake by 64.5% to 8.8 million class A shares during the first quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It increased its stake in streaming company Netflix by 42.8% to 2.1 million shares. Soros Fund Management LLC opened a new stake in Netflix, holding 50,000 shares, at the end of March.
T. Rowe Price also added Facebook shares during the first quarter, increasing its stake by 19% to 107.9 million shares, as of the end of first quarter. 
Netflix shares gained 2.7% to close at $354.99 and Facebook gained 3.1% to close at $186.27.
FAANG's return to vogue in 2019 has mostly outpaced the broader market's recovery, with Netflix surging 33% year to date, despite slowing user expansion and the threat of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's upcoming video streaming service. Facebook has surged more than 40% in 2019 as investors bet that regulatory threats and calls to break up the world's largest social network will not endanger its meteoric growth in ad sales.
High-flying FAANG stocks came back to earth late last year amid fears that a decade-old bull market was fading. 
""Facebook’s stock price has been hammered on the back of recent controversies, making what was already a very attractive return outlook for the stock even brighter,"" Paul Greene, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Communications & Technology Fund and Facebook analyst for the firm, wrote at the end of 2018. ""In my view, all the worries surrounding Facebook have been more than discounted in the stock, and we have been eagerly adding to our position.""

Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings in 13F filings with the SEC are one of a few public ways of tracking what the managers are buying and selling. But the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. 
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it owned $860.6 million of Amazon shares at the end of March, after the billionaire earlier this month admitted to having underestimated the online retailer and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos.
Buffett, who told CNBC in early May that Berkshire had bought Amazon shares for the first time, detailed the stake in Wednesday's 13F filing, revealing that Berkshire took a stake in the first quarter totaling 483,300 shares.
Buffett had told CNBC that the Amazon investment was made by one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, and said he had been ""an idiot"" for not investing in Amazon himself.

Amazon shares on March 29, the last trading day of that month, closed at $1,780.85. On Wednesday they finished at $1,871.15.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Wednesday said its solar factory in Buffalo, New York, would become the ""manufacturing home"" for its electric vehicle Supercharger cabinets and other energy storage products as it seeks to meet employment targets tied to state subsidies.
The company disclosed the move in an annual report to New York state in which it said it had exceeded its jobs and investment commitments thus far. But the company must add hundreds more workers in New York to meet next year's target.
Tesla employs 329 workers at the factory and about 300 others elsewhere in the state, the report said. It was required to have at least 500 employees in the state by April 30 of this year in exchange for $750 million in subsidies for the Buffalo facility, which is known as the RiverBend factory. 
By this time next year, it must employ 1,460 workers in the state, including 500 at the factory, according to Empire State Development, the state's economic development arm.
Tesla also said it has invested $381.9 million total in New York state as of April 30, including $179.3 million in the previous year.
""We’re committed to investing in Buffalo and the State,"" Tesla said in an emailed statement.
Tesla's manufacturing partner, Panasonic Corp, has about 400 employees at the Buffalo plant. It was not immediately clear whether those jobs are included in the count toward meeting the state targets. Panasonic manufactures solar cells and assembles panels at the factory for Tesla and others.
""We are pleased that Tesla is reporting that it has exceeded its job and investment commitments,"" Pamm Lent, spokeswoman for Empire State Development, said in an emailed statement. ""In the coming weeks, ESD will perform the necessary due diligence to verify the data provided by Tesla.”
Tesla's plan to manufacture solar products in New York has come under scrutiny as the company drastically scaled back the U.S. solar business it acquired in 2016 with the $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity.

At the time, it planned to use the factory to make a trailblazing product called the Solar Roof, an energy system meant to look like normal roof tiles. But that product has been far slower to reach the market than promised, and Panasonic is shipping most of the cells originally intended for the Solar Roof to customers overseas. Panasonic has also sought other customers for its Buffalo-made panels.

504,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",Advisory firms say AIG shareholders should vote 'no' on executive pay,"By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) shareholders should vote against compensation packages for top executives at the insurer's annual meeting next week, according to two advisory firms that hold sway over investor votes.
Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis & Co, which together influence the vast majority of institutional shareholder votes, each argued in recent reports that AIG's top executives get paid too much.
AIG's executive compensation has an ""unmitigated pay-for-performance misalignment,"" ISS said in a report on May 7.
""The company paid more than its peers, but performed significantly worse than its peers,"" Glass Lewis said in a report seen by Reuters that was distributed last month. Neither recommendation has previously been reported publicly.
An AIG spokesman declined to comment.
Executive compensation has been an issue for AIG since it received a $180 billion taxpayer bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, while still paying executives tens of millions of dollars and funding lavish client events.
It has drawn renewed scrutiny since Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault joined in 2017 with a lucrative package, and began paying top dollar for talent.
AIG's board awarded Duperreault $21 million last year, less than half his compensation in 2017.
His pay compares with $10 million to $17 million for CEOs of major U.S. competitors Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Companies Inc and MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET). ISS noted that AIG's total shareholder return last year was negative 32%, compared with negative 0.8% for a major insurance index.
Duperreault has said previously that AIG needs to be able to attract and retain top talent to turn around lagging performance. Without big paychecks, executives might not want to join the insurer, which has been working through underwriting and technology issues for several years.
In the first quarter, AIG showed signs of improvement. It beat Wall Street expectations, with its general insurance business posting an underwriting profit for the first time since the crisis.
Still, compensation was the one area in which ISS and Glass Lewis disagreed with management regarding how shareholders should vote at the May 21 meeting.
In addition to performance misalignment, ISS said AIG did not adequately explain some elements of Duperreault's pay. It offered only ""cautionary support"" for board members who sit on the compensation committee.

The two firms advised against voting for AIG's executive compensation last year as well. Shareholders approved the packages nonetheless, by a smaller-than-usual margin.

507,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 05:22PM ET</span>",Buffett's Berkshire unveils $861 million Amazon stake,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it owned $860.6 million of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares at the end of March, after the billionaire admitted to underestimating the online retailer and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.
The size of the investment was disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stocks as of March 31.
Wednesday's filing includes investments by Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, but does not say who bought and sold what.
Buffett told CNBC this month that the 483,300 share Amazon investment, which would now be worth $904 million, was made by Combs or Weschler, and that he had been ""an idiot"" for not investing in Amazon himself.
The investment tightens the relationship between Buffett and fellow billionaire Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to create a venture, Haven, to reduce their employees' healthcare costs.
Berkshire also invests in JPMorgan, and boosted its holdings in the largest U.S. bank by 19 percent in the first quarter to 59.5 million shares, worth $6.02 billion. 
Bezos has also drawn praise from longtime Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.
""I don't mind not having caught Amazon early. The guy is kind of a miracle worker,"" Munger said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting on May 4, referring to Bezos. ""It's very peculiar. I give myself a pass on that.""
Combs and Weschler's initial investments have sometimes heralded major Berkshire commitments directed by Buffett.
These have included Berkshire's $32.1 billion purchase in 2016 of industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, and a stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) worth close to $48 billion.
Investors monitor Berkshire's quarterly filings for signs about how where Buffett, Combs and Weschler see value, and stock prices often rise when Berkshire discloses new stakes.
Berkshire also owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer.
It often buys stocks when buying whole companies appear too costly. Buffett said on Feb. 23 that prices were ""sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects."" The Standard & Poor's 500 has since risen 2.1 percent.

Among other portfolio changes, Berkshire reported adding to its stakes in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and software company Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT), and paring stakes in oil refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.45%, the S&P 500 gained.58%, while the Nasdaq Composite moved up 1.13%.
Wall Street recovered strongly after an early slump following a rise in auto stocks on expectations that the White House would not move ahead with duties on imported autos from the EU and Japan. Reuters reported that Trump was leaning against imposing tariffs, citing administration officials.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) rose around 1% on the day.
But a reversal in shares of department-store giant Macy’s (NYSE:M) took some gloss off consumer discretionaries as the retailer warned it could see an impact from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. Macy's closed down 0.5% after rising as much as 4% early in the day on the back of better-than-expected earnings.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), meanwhile, ended the day higher after its fourth-quarter results beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, thanks to a 76% surge in its cloud business.
In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose 0.8% after the FAA said that the aircraft maker plans to submit a fix for its anti-stall software for its Boeing 737 Max jet ""in the next week or so."" Boeing shares are down 9.45% this quarter but up 7.1% for the year.
Rising energy stocks also supported the positive day on Wall Street as fears that rising tensions in the Middle East could hurt global supplies offset an unexpected build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
In other company news, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) added to gains after hours as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), in a government filing, revealed it had taken a $904 million stake in the e-commerce giant.
The economic front, meanwhile, offered little optimism as negative industrial data from both the U.S. and China exacerbated fears that the a prolonged trade dispute between the countries could hurt the world's largest two economies.
""The data have been volatile in recent months, led by swings in autos, but the net result has been significant weakening. Manufacturing is especially export-oriented, but weakening has exceed the degree implied by survey data,"" Hedge Fund Economics said in a note.

PARIS (Reuters) - The chief executive of European missile maker MBDA is returning to Airbus as head of strategy as the planemaker seeks to modernize its factories and explore future options in defense.
Antoine Bouvier, 59, replaces Patrick de Castelbajac who becomes head of Airbus Asia-Pacific, Airbus said in a statement. Castelbajac's responsibility for Airbus international operations had already been transferred to sales chief Christian Scherer.
At Airbus, Bouvier will be embarking on a battle of wits with a new opposite number at arch-rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
Chris Raymond, until recently head of Autonomous Systems, has been named Boeing's group-wide vice-president for enterprise strategy under finance director Greg Smith, Boeing said in his biography on its website, confirming a Reuters report.
Bouvier's appointment is the latest evidence of a management shake-up at Airbus, accelerated by the promotion last month of planemaking chief Guillaume Faury to CEO.
A former civil servant who narrowly missed out on running France's DGA defense procurement agency two years ago, Bouvier brings experience in forging defense partnerships to Airbus, which is embroiled in a row with Germany over arms controls.
He will be replaced at MBDA by former OneWeb chief Eric Beranger.
From July 1, Castelbajac will also assume responsibility for Asia sales, recently a key battleground with Boeing.
China Airlines last week announced a leasing deal expected to pave the way for the Taiwan carrier to switch its medium-haul fleet to the Airbus A320neo rather than the Boeing 737 MAX.
The deal to replace older 737s took years to complete and was drafted before the 737 MAX was engulfed by a crisis involving two crashes and a worldwide grounding.
Although day-to-day competition remains intense, Airbus seems wary of over-exploiting the 737 MAX problems, fearing they could destabilize the market and supply chains, some industry sources say. A U.S. industry official denied this. 
NEXT GENERATION
The future of the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX - the industry's most successful models - is seen as strategically entwined and insiders say Airbus is also worried about the impact of the grounding on global certification..
Decisions on what replaces the current generation of single-aisle jets from about 2030 and how they are built could define the aircraft industry well into the second half of the century.
Early planning of those models will be a major topic for strategists at both Airbus and Boeing in coming years.
Insiders say Faury wants Airbus to focus on industrial strategy and closing a perceived gap with Boeing in production technology, as well as the threat of increased environmental regulation, when designing new products.
Airbus must also assess how to respond to rising defense spending after its failure to merge with Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) in 2012 left it heavily skewed toward commercial markets that are now approaching the end of an extended upcycle.
It is involved on the German side of a nascent Franco-German fighter project along with French partner Dassault Aviation but faces competition for valuable systems work and a growing spat with the German government over export controls.
At MBDA, Bouvier was credited with driving an Anglo-French agreement on the use of shared missile technology.
Bouvier followed the classic path of a French mandarin from prestigious Polytechnique engineering school to ENA civil service academy. He had been linked to top posts at suppliers such as  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Thales, although was not hired. 

""His appointment will be very credible with the French government,"" a person familiar with the appointment said. France and Germany own 11 percent each of Airbus.

513,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>","Boeing made mistakes on 737 MAX says Southwest CEO, hopeful planes return in U.S. summer","By Tracy Rucinski 
DENVER (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co made mistakes with its 737 MAX planes that need to be addressed, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly told shareholders on Wednesday, but he said he is still hopeful that the jets grounded after two crashes will return to service in the U.S. summer.
Southwest, which only flies 737s and is the world's largest MAX operator, has bet its growth strategy on the fuel-efficient, longer-range MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March following two deadly crashes, one in Indonesia and one in Ethiopia.
As a result, Southwest has canceled 160 daily flights through Aug. 5, hitting revenue and costs, and putting its growth plans on hold. The low-cost carrier launched service to Hawaii earlier this year but has had to defer flying there from San Diego and Sacramento because of the MAX groundings.
""Boeing made some mistakes ... they need to address those mistakes,"" Kelly said at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Denver, where Southwest has expanded faster than any other city. 
Asked by a shareholder whether he was seeking compensation from Boeing, Kelly said: ""No one is happy with the situation. All of our growth is with the MAX."" 
A handful among about 40 shareholders questioned Kelly about the airline's heavy MAX exposure. The MAX jets represent less than 5 percent of Southwest's fleet of about 750, but the airline has at least 249 more on order.
Southwest is scheduling flights on the MAX as of Aug. 6, but it is still unclear whether regulators will clear it to fly by then. They were grounded following an Ethiopian Airlines accident just five months after a similar Lion Air crash, killing a combined 346 people.
During a call with investors last month, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he knows ""we have some work to do to earn and re-earn the trust of our customers and the flying public in particular.""
The Federal Aviation Administration's acting chief, Dan Elwell, told lawmakers on Wednesday he expects Boeing to submit a software fix soon, a key step to flying the planes again.
Asked by a reporter if he would fly on the first MAX flight, Kelly said: ""I'd love to."" But he said Southwest would not fly the jets until he and regulators were fully confident in their safety.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed that U.S. fliers still consider ticket price the most important factor when choosing a flight. Southwest remained the most popular airline, with 21% of respondents picking it as their preferred carrier, up from 19% in a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran in June 2017.

Shareholders of Southwest, whose stock is flat over the past year, rejected a motion to split Kelly's dual role as CEO and chairman of the board at the annual meeting.

514,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 03:11PM ET</span>",Supersonic jets must be no noisier than existing planes: airports group,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - A new generation of U.S.-produced commercial supersonic jets must be no louder than existing planes or risk exacerbating existing complaints over noise from air traffic, Angela Gittens, director of Airports Council International (ACI) said.
U.S. supersonic jet makers are working to reintroduce ultra-fast passenger planes for the first time since the Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003, with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) working on proposed rules for noise certification of supersonic aircraft by 2020.
These latest supersonic jets, while quieter and more fuel efficient than the Concorde, have difficulty meeting existing noise levels and carbon emissions standards for conventional planes due to engine constraints and higher fuel burn.
Gittens told Reuters in an interview late on Monday that supersonic jets should not get ""a free pass"" to generate more noise than subsonic planes or fail to meet global carbon emission standards for new aircraft.
The new jets have already sparked global debate with supersonic planemakers backing U.S. calls for the creation of new global standards for passenger planes traveling faster than sound while European nations want the aircraft to meet existing subsonic rules for noise.
Governments, airports and industry have spent billions of dollars globally to improve aircraft technology, install noise-reducing insulation and buy up homes near airports to mitigate public disturbance as air traffic rises.
""We're already getting more noise complaints and the (supersonic) plane isn't even flying,"" Gittens said on the sidelines of an Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) Global Sustainable Aviation forum in Montreal.
Aerion Supersonic, which is backed by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, and Spike Aerospace have said their ultra-fast business jets will meet noise levels for subsonic planes.
A Boom Supersonic spokesman said in an emailed statement that ""noise levels are not directly comparable"" between subsonic and supersonic jets, since the two are ""fundamentally different"" and should be held to ""broadly different standards."" 
Boom's supersonic passenger plane will have a similar impact on airports as ""the quietist long-haul aircraft it replaces,"" the spokesman said. Boom did not specify whether the plane would meet existing standards. 
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations aviation agency which sets global standards that are adopted by its 192 member countries, has said it would study supersonic jets. It has not committed to creating new standards for the planes. 
Boom said the U.S. standards published in 2020 will be sufficient for its certification needs.

""We expect that ICAO will eventually adopt a similar harmonized standard,” the spokesman said.

517,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 01:57PM ET</span>",U.S. bank regulator will vet next Wells Fargo CEO,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator said on Wednesday it will vet  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's pick for its next chief executive, a development that could complicate the scandal-hit lender's efforts to find a permanent replacement for CEO Tim Sloan. 
Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), told Congress he would use special legal powers that the regulator typically reserves for overseeing financially troubled lenders to review any proposed candidate. 
But Otting said he does not plan to make findings from the review public, despite pressure from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren who pressed him on the issue during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.
""At this point in time I do not have plans to release that information,"" Otting told Warren in a heated exchange.
Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have accused the OCC of being too soft on Wells Fargo, a claim Otting disputed on Wednesday. 
Otting said the OCC remains disappointed by the bank's progress on fixing risk management and governance problems that led to a number of customer abuse scandals, including in its mortgage and auto lending businesses.
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment.
Sloan abruptly departed in late March, making him the second CEO to leave Wells Fargo following its sales practice scandal. He has said he stepped down because the external attention on him had become a distraction.
Wells Fargo general counsel C. Allen Parker, one of the few newcomers in the bank's top ranks, is serving as interim CEO.
Intense congressional and regulatory scrutiny is likely to narrow the field of CEO candidates. Wells Fargo's board is looking for an outsider following criticism that company veterans are incapable of turning things around. 
The bank's CEO search is also being hampered by limits on how much it can pay, Reuters reported this month.
Wells Fargo's woes began in September 2016 when the bank admitted it had potentially opened millions of unauthorized accounts. Internal and regulatory probes have discovered other issues in the bank’s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.

The Federal Reserve has also placed an unprecedented restriction on Wells Fargo to keep it from growing its balance sheet until it proves risk management controls are improved.

By early afternoon, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) rose 1.32%, General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose 0.84% and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) rose 1.35%
With time running out ahead of a Saturday deadline to make a decision on whether to impose tariffs on car and auto part imports over national security concerns, the White House is expected not to press ahead with duties on imported autos, Reuters reported, citing Trump administration officials.
After Saturday, the administration can decide to delay tariffs on autos for 180 days as long as it continues talks with trading partners.
Traders had feared that Trump would use the threat of the tariffs to gain the upper hand in trade talks with the European Union and Japan.
U.S. auto tariffs would raise the price of both new and used vehicles, and dealerships would see employment declines and a decrease in revenue, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
But with the European Union standing ready to retaliate against any potential U.S. levies on autos, the president has seemingly decided that fighting a trade war on multiple fronts may prove too costly."
520,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>",FAA expects Boeing to submit 737 MAX fix soon for approval,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Aviation Administration acting chief Dan Elwell told lawmakers on Wednesday he expects Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to submit a software fix for the grounded 737 MAX involved in two fatal crashes for approval soon, and said he was concerned by the planemaker's lengthy delay in disclosing a software anomaly.
At a congressional hearing, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee told the FAA it must ""get it right"" in deciding when to allow the Boeing 737 MAX to fly again.
""The world is watching and the FAA and Boeing must get it right,"" Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio said, adding the incidents have raised concerns about how the FAA certifies aircraft.
The Boeing 737 MAX plane was grounded worldwide in mid-March after two crashes in October and March killed 346 people.
Elwell said the agency expects to get the software upgrade and training update from Boeing in the ""next week or so."" He said the FAA will only allow the plane to resume flights when it is ""absolutely safe to do so ... It's important we get this right,"" Elwell said.
Elwell said Boeing should not have waited 13 months to tell the FAA that it inadvertently made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s.
Elwell said he was ""concerned"" by the delay. ""We're going to look into that,"" Elwell said. ""Thirteen months is too long.""
The FAA is planning a May 23 meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, with air regulators from around the world to update them on the reviews. U.S. airlines have canceled flights as a result of the 737 MAX grounding into August.
Elwell said he hopes the international aviation community will work together. ""My hope is that they have the confidence in our work and our analysis to make their ungrounding decisions if that's where the discussion is as close to our decision as possible,"" he said.
Democratic Representative Rick Larsen, who chairs the aviation subcommittee that held Wednesday's hearing, said the FAA ""has a credibility problem. The FAA needs to fix its credibility problem.""
Boeing has said its software upgrade and associated pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering the system called MCAS.
The system activated in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March and also during a separate Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October. Elwell said Boeing should have included more details on MCAS in its own manuals on the Boeing 737 MAX.
Committee leaders said they still expect to call Boeing to testify at a future hearing but expressed some frustration they have not yet received any documents from Boeing as they probe what went wrong with the 737 MAX.
The U.S. planemaker has been trying for weeks to dispel suggestions it made airlines pay for safety features after it emerged that an alert designed to show discrepancies in Angle of Attack readings from two sensors was optional on the 737 MAX.
Erroneous data from a sensor responsible for measuring the angle at which the wing slices through the air - known as the Angle of Attack - is suspected of triggering a flawed piece of software that pushed the plane downward in two recent crashes.
Boeing said last week it only discovered once deliveries of the 737 MAX had begun in 2017 that the so-called AOA Disagree alert was optional instead of standard as it had intended, but added that was not critical safety data.
Boeing said a Safety Review Board, convened after a fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October, corroborated its prior conclusion that the alert was not necessary for the safe operation of commercial aircraft and could safely be tackled in a future system update.

Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department’s inspector general and lawmakers are investigating the FAA’s certification of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

521,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>",Macy's CEO says tariff escalation could hurt business,"By Melissa Fares and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Macy's Inc said on Wednesday the latest tariffs on Chinese imports by Washington are hitting its furniture business and warned investors that additional levies would leave its clothing and accessory categories vulnerable as well. 
The largest U.S. department store operator is one of the first to comment publicly on the damage that U.S. President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, another $300 billion worth of goods, could have on business.
In Macy's case, the potential tariffs would impact both its private and national brands, Gennette said.
Gennette said any escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs was not factored into the company's annual outlook and that the company would do what it could to minimize the effect on customers.
The executive said the company had worked hard to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers.
Washington dramatically escalated its 10-month trade war with Beijing on Friday by raising levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods in the midst of trade talks, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports from China, sending global financial markets into a tailspin. China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale.
Q1 RESULTS TOP EXPECTATIONS
Macy's topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit benefiting from increased online sales and higher demand for items sold at its off-price stores.
Macy's shares, which have so far lost more than a quarter of their value this year, were down less than 1% at $21.61 in afternoon trading. 
Like its peers, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based department store chain, which has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, faltered in the past few years as it struggled to adjust to a fiercely competitive retail landscape where shoppers buy more goods online at places like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The 160-year-old retailer has poured money into building up its private label clothing as well as expand its off-price venture, Backstage, by adding 45 more stores this year.
Gennette said brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially in the first quarter, helped by its off-price Backstage business. The retailer said it saw double-digit growth in its digital business and that mobile continues to be Macy's fastest-growing channel for sales growth.
Sales at Macy's stores open more than 12 months, including sales in department stores licensed to third parties, rose for the sixth straight quarter. They were up 0.7%, above the average analyst estimate of a 0.3% rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.
(For an interactive graphic, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LTSNma)
Gross margin in the quarter fell to 38.2% from 39%, because a delayed start to spring bloated inventories. Macy's said it expects to see some gross margin pressure in the second quarter as it continues to clear excess spring products.
Last quarter, Macy's announced a plan focused on cost cuts for 2019 to speed up decision-making and result in an annual savings of $100 million. 
The company earned $136 million, or 44 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 4, compared to $139 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of 33 cents.
Net sales fell to $5.50 billion, roughly in line with analysts expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""With comp results coming in better-than-feared, we'd expect a modest relief rally out of Macy's today, but would not be chasing the stock,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said in a note. 
The company also repeated its previously issued financial forecast for the year.

522,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 01:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Kone looks at options for potential Thyssenkrupp elevator deal - sources,"By Christoph Steitz, Arno Schuetze and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Finland's Kone is assessing the viability of a bid for Thyssenkrupp's 14 billion euro ($15.7 billion) elevators division even as the German conglomerate pursues plans to list it, four people familiar with the matter said.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) last week ditched a plan to spin off its capital goods business after months of shareholder criticism, and opted instead to list elevators, its most profitable division, to raise badly needed cash.
The sources said it was not clear if Kone could fund an all-cash bid and whether or not the deal would face significant anti-trust hurdles similar to Thyssenkrupp's failed steel joint venture with Tata Steel.
This is why Thyssenkrupp's management prefers the option of an initial public offering, the sources added.
""What the company needs is guaranteed proceeds. The IPO is a safe option. Other options are subject to execution risk,"" a person familiar with the matter said.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said although the merger would be likely to face opposition from Thyssenkrupp's labor representatives, a deal with Kone would result in 3-4 billion euros of synergies attributable to the German firm.
""Why give away half the synergies which could be extracted from a potential elevator merger with an IPO of 50% of ET?,"" the bank said in a note.
Thyssenkrupp has also said that it is open to partnerships in its other businesses. People close to the matter said that previous talks with gases group Linde over a merger of engineering activities could be revived.
Thyssenkrupp boss Guido Kerkhoff, who is under pressure to deliver after the botched overhaul, hopes an IPO of a minority stake in the elevators business would repair the group's stretched balance sheet.
But Kone, whose top investor Antti Herlin approached Thyssenkrupp in 2016 over an elevator merger, is willing to do a deal and is working with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to explore options, three people familiar with the matter said.
""It's only natural that Kone is looking at its possibilities now that Thyssenkrupp has signaled a willingness to pull out partly,"" one of the people said.
The people said a Kone bid was doable if it was shares and cash.
""We've been saying for years that consolidation would make sense in our industry and our thinking hasn't changed,"" a spokeswoman for Kone said, declining to comment further.
Thyssenkrupp has not given a timeframe for the listing, only saying it wants to be market ready in the next financial year which starts in October. One source said a flotation in the second quarter of 2020 was not unrealistic.
The sources also said that Switzerland's Schindler, controlled by the Schindler and Bonnard families, is expected to review its own options regarding the elevators business.
Schindler, which does not have a big M&A track record, may face larger antitrust hurdles in a potential deal, one of the people said, citing greater geographic overlap with Thyssenkrupp than Kone.
Possible deals for other Thyssenkrupp activities include tie-ups for the steering business in its automotive division or a merger of Industrial Solutions, which builds plants and industrial sites, with Linde, the sources said.
""Thyssen and Linde held talks on a combination of their engineering businesses about two years ago, but those did not reap any results,"" one of the people said, adding that talks may be revived at a later stage.
The people said that because Linde is also seen as a seller this might allow both groups to deconsolidate the business, possibly by bringing in a private equity investor. 
A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp referred to comments by CEO Kerkhoff who said that the IPO was aimed at strengthening the group's balance sheet. He declined to comment on Linde.
Schindler, Linde and Bank of America declined to comment.
In the second quarter, sales at the elevators business rose by 6.6 percent to 1.87 billion euros, but its adjusted operating margin fell by a percentage point to 10.6 percent, hurt by higher material prices.

A formal announcement is expected by Saturday, they said.
The news spurred investors to boost positions in tariff-sensitive firms, aiding a recovery among a swathe of European stocks.

535,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 11:56AM ET</span>",Trump expected to delay auto tariffs decision by up to six months: officials,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to delay a decision on imposing tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months, three Trump administration officials told Reuters, , avoiding opening yet another front in his global trade battles. 
A formal announcement is expected by Saturday, the due date for Trump to make a decision on recommendations by the Commerce Department to protect the U.S. auto industry from imports on national security grounds, the officials said.
A White House spokesman declined to comment.
They added that the administration has drafted language to formally delay a decision on the tariffs that is due by May 18.
Reuters reported last week that automakers expected Trump to delay the decision as trade negotiations get underway with the European Union and Japan.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Toyota Motor Corp and others have warned of the damaging impacts of imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts.
The White House has held a series of high-level meetings on the issue in recent days, and administration officials have repeatedly told automakers they planned to delay the decision.
In February, the Commerce Department submitted its ""Section 232"" national security report to the White House. The agency was investigating whether imports harmed U.S. national security by weakening American automakers' ability to invest in future technologies. The Commerce Department's specific recommendations have not been revealed.
A series of announcements by GM last week of $700 million in investments in three Ohio plants and efforts to sell the company's closed Lordstown plant had made Trump more inclined to delay the tariffs, administration officials told Reuters last week.
At the same time, Trump has escalated his trade war with China, sharply increasing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and launching public consultations on remaining Chinese imports of about $300 billion. 
The auto tariffs face wide opposition in Congress. The White House has refused to turn over the Commerce Department report to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who has been demanding to see it.
Last week, 159 House of Representatives members led by Ways and Means Committee Vice Chair Terri Sewell wrote White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow to urge him to advise Trump against “imposing trade restrictions that could harm the auto sector and the American economy.”
The letter from 79 Democrats and 81 Republicans, which was seen by Reuters, warned that imposing tariffs on parts in cars “may overlap with motorcycles, recreational vehicles, construction equipment, heavy-duty trucks, farming equipment, powersports vehicles, and others.”
Administration officials have said tariff threats on autos are a way to win concessions from Japan and the EU. Last year, Trump agreed not to impose tariffs as long as talks with the two trading partners were proceeding in a productive manner.
The industry says tariffs of up to 25 percent on millions of imported cars and parts would add thousands of dollars to vehicle costs and potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses throughout the U.S. economy.
""The case remains clear – cars are not a national security threat,"" the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, VW, Toyota and other producers, said in a statement. ""We are deeply concerned that the administration continues to consider imposing auto tariffs.""

An auto industry research report released last year estimated that U.S. light-duty vehicle prices would increase by $2,750 on average, including U.S.-built vehicles, reducing annual U.S. sales by 1.3 million units and forcing many consumers to the used-car market.

536,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 11:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla's solar factory is exporting most of its cells - document,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - The ""great majority"" of solar cells being produced at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's factory in upstate New York are being sold overseas instead of being used in the company's trademark ""Solar Roof"" as originally intended, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
The exporting underscores the depth of Tesla's troubles in the U.S. solar business, which the electric car maker entered in 2016 with its controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity.
Tesla has only sporadically purchased solar cells produced by its partner in the factory, Panasonic Corp, according to a Buffalo solar factory employee speaking on condition of anonymity. The rest are going largely to foreign buyers, according to a Panasonic letter to U.S. Customs officials reviewed by Reuters. 
When the two firms announced the partnership in 2016, the companies said they would collaborate on cell and module production and Tesla would make a long-term commitment to buy the cells from Panasonic. Cells are components that convert the sun's light into electricity; they are combined to make solar panels. 
Tesla planned to use them in its Solar Roof, a system meant to look like normal roof tiles. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk billed the product as a cornerstone of the strategy behind the acquisition - selling a low-carbon lifestyle to eco-conscious consumers who could use the power from their Solar Roof to charge their Tesla electric vehicle.
But the company has installed them on just a handful of rooftops nationwide so far after production line troubles and a gutting of Tesla’s solar sales team. 
California state data shows 21 Solar Roof systems were connected by the state's three investor-owned utilities as of Feb. 28. Only a few others were connected in the northeastern United States, according to a former Tesla employee with knowledge of the matter, who was laid off during staff cuts earlier this year and asked not to be named.
Tesla declined to comment on the company's purchases of cells from Panasonic and would not provide figures for Solar Roof installations. But a company official said in an email ""the number of solar roofs you cite in the story is low and unrepresentative as we are actively installing the Solar Roof in eight states currently.""
The situation raises new questions about the viability of cash-strapped Tesla's solar business. Musk once called the deal a ""no brainer"" - but some investors panned it as a bailout of an affiliated firm at the expense of Tesla shareholders. Before the merger, Musk had served as chairman of SolarCity's board of directors, and his cousin, Lyndon Rive, was the company's CEO.
Panasonic spokesman Alberto Canal declined to comment on the company's sales to Tesla, but confirmed that Panasonic was seeking to use its Buffalo operations to fulfill demand for U.S.-made solar cells from foreign buyers. 
Panasonic had said in a filing with the U.S. Department of Commerce in October 2018 that foreign demand for U.S.-made solar cells had sprung up after the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on overseas-made panels in 2018. 
Panasonic also produces traditional solar panels at the Buffalo plant for Tesla, but has been selling many of them to other buyers since at least last year due to low demand from the California car company, Reuters reported in August 2018. Tesla last month reported a 36 percent slide in its overall solar sales in the first quarter, adding to previous big drops since the SolarCity acquisition. 
Since Tesla purchased SolarCity in the fourth quarter of 2016, installations have dropped more than 76 percent, according to company financial disclosures. 
After gutting its solar sales team and ending its retail relationship with  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Tesla last month announced a plan to counter the downward spiral by offering cut-rate prices on standardized rooftop systems and requiring would-be customers to order solar products online.
Panasonic's move to diversify its solar customers is the latest sign of the company falling out of step with its longtime partner. Panasonic is Tesla's sole battery supplier for its electric car business, but Musk last month blamed Panasonic for EV production delays. He has also said Tesla was looking for more battery suppliers for its new Shanghai car factory.
SEPARATE OPERATIONS
Panasonic’s letter to U.S. officials last October accompanied a request to produce the cells in a foreign trade zone within the Buffalo plant that would allow Panasonic to import certain parts tariff-free because the finished cells would be sold overseas, not domestically. 
That request was granted in April.
The zones help companies avoid, delay or pay reduced tariffs on imported parts in cases where it helps U.S. manufacturers compete with overseas rivals. 
""It is fully anticipated that the majority of the cells to be produced"" in the FTZ ""will be exported,"" the company said in its application.
Panasonic's Canal said foreign solar panel manufacturers want the Buffalo plant’s cells because solar panels assembled abroad with American-made cells can be shipped to the United States tariff-free, according to U.S. trade rules implemented last fall. 
Panasonic's Buffalo operation is one of few U.S.-based solar cell producers because it is traditionally far cheaper to make the components in other countries, putting it in a unique position to serve the foreign demand.
Canal would not disclose the company's non-Tesla solar cell customers or say what percentage of its Buffalo cell output was being shipped outside the country, saying that information was ""proprietary and competitive."" 
A Panasonic source said much of the exported material was going to a large Asian buyer.
Tesla inherited the factory, known as RiverBend, through its purchase of SolarCity, and is now required to deliver on investment and employment promises that SolarCity had made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies.
The factory employs about 800 workers, and by this time next year it will be required to have 1,460 employees or pay millions in penalties.
The state of New York remains pleased with its investment in the factory and Panasonic's move to diversify its customer base beyond Tesla.
“We have two of the leading clean energy companies in the world in Buffalo at the RiverBend facility,"" Pamm Lent, spokeswoman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. ""Tesla produces their innovative solar roof tiles ‎largely for development and testing with the goal of full scale launch in the future. Panasonic is now the largest producer and employer at RiverBend with a customer base independent of Tesla."" 
Today, the companies operate separately at the Buffalo factory, according to one current and one former Panasonic employee.

""Everybody wants Tesla to succeed,"" the employee said, ""but we are operating completely independently from them right now.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt has secured a 350 million euro loan from the European Investment bank (EIB), the lender's largest ever direct financing of battery technology, as the Swedish startup raises funds to build Europe's biggest battery plant. 
The factory is critical to Europe's effort to compete with Asian rivals such as CATL, Samsung (KS:005930) and LG Chem, which are leaders in the battery market after locking in supply deals with carmakers.
Northvolt got a boost on Wednesday when IKEA said it was in the final stages of talks about participating in the fundraising for the factory.
Northvolt asked the EIB for the loan in September, part of a 1.5 billion euro fundraising, split equally between debt and equity, to build half of its planned 32 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual battery capacity by 2023. 
""The EIB's approval is one really key piece of the puzzle in putting together that full funding,"" co-founder Peter Carlsson, a former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive, told Reuters, adding that Northvolt expected to close the funding round before August. 
Other potential debt and equity investors had viewed the EIB's approval as a crucial indicator of the project's viability, he added, given the due diligence the bank would have carried out before granting the loan.
Equity investors have been wary of the lead taken by Asian companies, but Northvolt says it expects cost savings from bringing a larger portion of cell making in-house to make it competitive.
Battery suppliers are also competing for raw materials as carmakers try and cut the use of expensive minerals, especially cobalt, from electric car batteries, to reduce costs.
Carlsson said the cells Northvolt is currently building are close to the low-cobalt NMC811 formula used by Tesla-supplier Panasonic.
""It is also fair to assume that the cobalt content will continue to fall and there will be efforts to further raise the nickel content to create even higher and richer energy densities,"" he said.
Carlsson said Northvolt was putting together a consortium of banks to arrange the remaining debt and looking for industrial and financial investors to provide equity.
INDUSTRIAL MONEY
Automakers have been plowing funds into battery production and development, a key battleground in their electrification ambitions. 
Swedish carmaker Volvo said on Wednesday it had signed long-term battery supply deals with LG Chem and CATL as it pursues its EV target of 50 percent of sales by 2025.
Northvolt estimates the European electric vehicle market will need 500-600 GWh of annual capacity by 2030, or at least 10 factories as large as Tesla's U.S. Gigafactory.
The company had intended to sell half its battery capacity to grid storage and industrial and portable application customers but Carlsson said 80 percent of the 16 GWh it had already sold had gone to automakers.
""As automotive companies are now launching their new portfolios of electrified vehicles ... we see a larger appetite for very, very strongly committing to volumes,"" he said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) truck brand Scania told Reuters this week it was participating in the financing talks and had signed up to buy batteries from Northvolt, while a banking source named a number of other participants.
Carlsson said several other large German manufacturers were among its customers, but declined to identify them. The company has also applied for German funding to build a second factory in the region, as well as for a project with Volkswagen.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd beat fourth-quarter revenue forecasts on Wednesday, thanks to growth in its core business and its diversification into cloud computing and other services.
Alibaba has invested in new business lines such as cloud computing as a boom in its core e-commerce has peaked and its top line growth is slowing.
It reported a 51% increase in group revenue for January-March from a year earlier to 93.50 billion yuan ($13.6 billion), beating estimates of 91.58 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Sales excluding revenue from consolidated businesses grew 39 percent year-on-year.
While still solid, Alibaba's top-line growth rates have slowed sharply from a few years ago, as have those of domestic rivals such as JD.com, which last week reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since it listed in 2014.
Alibaba said it expects its revenue for the full fiscal year ending in March 2020 will top 500 billion yuan, which would be a 33% increase on the previous year when revenue increased xxx
Its shares were up 1.7% at $177.55 in New York trade by 1451 GMT, after its fourth-quarter results release.
The group said its net income attributable to ordinary shareholders rose in the quarter to 25.83 billion yuan, from 7.56 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.
Alibaba has made money primarily by selling advertising and promotional services to third-party merchants that list products on Taobao and Tmall, two of its e-commerce sites, but has in recent years invested heavily in cloud computing as well.
It also opened 135 supermarkets in China under its Hema division, according to its earnings release.
Revenue from the company's cloud computing business rose 76% in the fourth quarter, it said.
It is still a relatively small part of Alibaba's overall business, accounting for 8% of group revenue in the fourth quarter. However, the company is now the world's third-largest cloud service provider, after  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and the largest in China with a market share of over 40%, according to data from IDC. 
Selling analytics technology to offline retailers and expanding its AliExpress e-commerce sites are other initiatives it is taking further.
Most of Alibaba's new initiatives are still losing money. Stephen Zhu, senior analyst at Pacific Epoch, said that e-commerce growth, while slowing, remains strong enough to support these new investments.
Managing the group's transition to new areas of business is Daniel Zhang, who was tapped by Chairman Jack Ma to be Ma's successor in September 2018 and will formally replace him later this year. 

An accountant by training, Zhang is soft-spoken and pragmatic, in contrast to Ma's flamboyance.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd posted record quarterly profit on Wednesday, smashing market expectations, as the social media and gaming giant booked a rise in the value of its investments while fintech and cloud revenues helped make up for declines in games.
Even so, revenue grew at its slowest-ever rate, as heightened regulatory scrutiny hobbled its gaming operations. That allowed earnings from its nascent financial technology (fintech) and business services to eclipse smartphone games for the first time.
In the three months ended March, Tencent saw 17% growth in net profit to 27 billion yuan ($3.93 billion), beating the 19.4 billion yuan average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Boosting profit was a 46% rise in ""net other gains"", such as from investments, to 11.1 billion yuan. Revenue, however, came in just shy of analyst estimates at 85.5 billion yuan, with growth at an all-time low of 16%.
Tencent has been hit by a suspension in the approval of new games by China's internet regulator for most of last year, which led to the company posting its sharpest-ever profit drop in the three months through December, and the slowest annual profit growth in 13 years.
Approvals restarted in December, with Tencent receiving permission to launch major title Perfect World Mobile in the January-March quarter. 
Tencent, which is seeking to find new revenues by shifting to industrial services, in September reorganized its business and created a Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG).
""FinTech and Business Services"", a category disclosed for the first time and which includes payment and cloud services, generated 21.8 billion yuan in the March quarter, up 44 percent.
That was more than smartphone gaming revenue, traditionally Tencent's largest single revenue generator and still the most lucrative business, which fell 2% to 21.2 billion yuan due to fewer new titles.
But president Martin Lau said on an earnings call that its nascent industrial internet business was still loss-making and needed more investment in capital and headcount. 
""From an operating perspective the business is still in investment mode, so in addition to the capital expenditure the business is also generating some operating losses,"" he said. 
The firm also said it would release several games in the second quarter and is ""in the early stages of experimenting"" with season passes for some of its main titles in China after a positive reception for passes in overseas markets. 
Chief strategy officer James Mitchell said overseas games now account for a ""high single digit"" percentage of its gaming revenue. 
Tencent waited in vain for over a year for approval to earn money via in-app purchases on its popular game PUBG Mobile. It pulled the game last week and launched approved title ""Peacekeeper Elite"", also known as Game for Peace, a tactical tournament game similar to PUBG but with a socialist makeover. 
Elsewhere, Tencent appears to be taking a hit from a slowing Chinese economy amid a China-U.S. trade war. Its online advertising revenue grew 25% versus 55% in the same period a year earlier, with Tencent blaming a ""challenging macro environment"" and high comparison base.
Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said advertising revenue was lower than expected, though advertising gross margin improved.
Mitchell said advertising spending from sectors such as automobile, real estate and internet services had dropped, but that Tencent would not aggressively release more advertisement space at the cost of user experience. 
Tencent operates China's largest social media platform WeChat, which had 1.11 billion users at the end of March.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co plans to start production of new luxury Lincoln models in China for that market as they are launched, starting with the new Corsair later this year, to benefit from lower costs and avoid the risk of tariffs, a top executive said on Monday.
""It's a huge, huge opportunity for Lincoln because we see China as Ground Zero for Lincoln given the size of the market and how well the brand has been received,"" Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said at a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) conference in New York. 
Ford has lower levels of localized production than rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) or Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, who make more vehicles in China for Chinese consumers, benefiting from lower labor and material costs, and avoiding tariffs in the burgeoning trade war between the United States and China.
Shanks said all new Lincoln models, with the exception of the Navigator assembled in Louisville, Kentucky, will also be produced in China. 
He declined to say how much Ford will save through localized production.
Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China, the automaker's second biggest market. Ford sales slumped 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017.

Shanks said that all of the problems the automaker experienced in China last year were related to the Ford brand, not Lincoln, which is popular with Chinese customers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior officials from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and a U.S. aerospace trade group on Wednesday urged the U.S. government to narrowly tailor any tariffs imposed on the European Union over illegal aircraft subsidies to avoid harming American manufacturers.
The comments were made in prepared testimony at a hearing held by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office on proposed tariffs on EU goods related to the dispute. 
The United States and the EU have threatened to impose billions of dollars of retaliatory tariffs on planes, tractors and food in a nearly 15-year trans-Atlantic aircraft subsidy dispute at the World Trade Organization over subsidies given to Boeing and European rival Airbus.
Theodore Austell, a Boeing legislative and regulatory affairs executive, said his company backed 100% tariffs against Airbus imports to force compliance with World Trade Organization findings, but added that they should be limited to wings, tails and fuselages from France, Germany, Spain and Britain.
Imposing tariffs on other categories such as undercarriages or ""other parts"" could damage the broader U.S. aerospace supply chain, Austell said in prepared testimony.
Remy Nathan, vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), told the hearing that failure to negotiate a resolution could trigger ""ever-escalating retaliatory tariffs.""
Barring a settlement, he urged the U.S. government to tailor any tariffs to avoid disruptions to the supply chains of the globally integrated U.S. aerospace industry.
AIA submitted a list of specific items it said should be excluded from any U.S. tariffs to ensure there was no inadvertent damage to the U.S. industry, including thrust reversers, inlets and fan cowls in aerospace engines.
""The WTO has already found injury to the U.S. industry. Imposing further tariffs on aerospace imports from Europe would aggravate that harm and further undermine the U.S. industry's competitiveness in an already challenging global environment,"" Nathan said.

Airbus has invested about $1 billion in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, creating more than 700 jobs and prompting 21 other aerospace companies, many from Europe, to set up businesses in the region, it has said. Airbus is expected to argue that those jobs and investments would be put at risk if Washington proceeds with tariffs.

The nation’s three megabanks have been relying on the healthy status of borrowers and sales of so-called cross-shareholdings for earnings as rock-bottom interest rates crimp lending profitability. Results on Wednesday showed they are losing those benefits at a time when the economy is weakening, trade tensions are escalating and the Bank of Japan’s extraordinary monetary easing looks set to stay.
“The business environment is very uncertain and tougher than last year,”  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc. President Jun Ohta said at a news briefing in Tokyo, dismissing the notion that his bank’s profit target is conservative.
Sumitomo Mitsui (T:8316), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and  Mizuho  Financial Group Inc. (NYSE:MFG) all posted net income projections that missed analysts’ estimates, as rising bad-loan costs and diminishing gains from sales of stock holdings put a dampener on earnings prospects in the year ending March 2020.
While both Mizuho and MUFG are expecting profit to increase this year, to 470 billion yen ($4.3 billion) and 900 billion yen respectively, that’s only after they booked large writedowns that hurt results in the previous period. Sumitomo Mitsui sees net income slipping about 4% to 700 billion yen.
“Signs of an economic slowdown have been emerging in Japan and overseas,” Mizuho Chief Executive Officer Tatsufumi Sakai told reporters. The bank is seeking to cut a further 30 branches in the next five years, on top of 100 reductions previously targeted.
Sakai said Mizuho’s profit target reflects a likely decline in gains from stock selling and an uptick in credit costs that were “very low” last year.
The banks have been paring their stakes in corporate clients in response to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to urge firms to improve governance. A stock market rally since Abe took office in 2012 has helped them book gains from the sales.
Not all the news was bad for bank investors. Sumitomo Mitsui, the best performing of the three stocks, said it plans to buy back as much as 100 billion yen of shares. Its stock has climbed 5.2% this year, while Mizuho and MUFG have fallen at least 3%.
The lenders trade at about half the book value of their assets or less, and Bloomberg Intelligence sees little chance of improvement.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
MUFG, SMFG and Mizuho’s price-to-book values may continue to struggle in 2019, barring consistent profit growth. Only a complete turnaround in the BOJ’s easing policy could rejuvenate the megabanks’ loan spreads and profit growth, in our view.--Francis Chan, Asia banks analystClick here to view the research
The banks are replenishing loan provisions that they had drawn down and booked as profits in recent years amid a dearth of corporate bankruptcies. But Sumitomo Mitsui’s Ohta and MUFG CEO Kanetsugu Mike were quick to say that the increase in bad-loan expenses doesn’t mean they expect a wave of defaults.
“We don’t have room for more provision clawbacks,” Ohta said. “Given the uncertain environment, we expect a normalization of credit costs.”

The Dow Jones dropped 172 points, or 0.7%, to 25,363.57 points by 9:43 AM ET (13:43 GMT), while the S&P 500 was down 15 points, or 0.6%, to 2,817.12 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite shed 39 points, or 0.5%, at 7,700.56 points.
The losses suggest that fear has regained the upper hand, after a bounce on Tuesday when concerns over the escalating trade war briefly subsided.
U.S. President Donald Trump denied that talks between the two sides had broken down. ""We have a dialogue going. It will always continue,"" said Trump, who has already announced plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit late next month.
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.2% in April, which could dent hopes for a rebound in consumer spending after a weak first quarter.
A separate report showed that output at U.S. manufacturing companies decreased by 0.5% last month.
The reports came after Chinese data overnight showed growth in retail sales and industrial output slowed unexpectedly in April, indicating that the economy was already losing momentum before the Trump administration hiked U.S. import tariffs on Friday.
In earnings news, Macy’s shares were up more than 1% after it reported first-quarter earnings that handily beat analysts’ expectations. The retailer also reaffirmed its profit outlook for the full year.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s ADRs rose after the company reported that first-quarter revenue beat estimates, boosted by growth in its core e-commerce and cloud computing businesses.
Shares of ride-hailing companies Uber (NYSE:UBER) and peer  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) were higher, gaining 1.1% and 2.8% respectively.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, advanced to 97.458 due largely to a slump in sterling, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury fell to 2.15%, its lowest since February last year.

PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury department store chain Le Printemps plans to expand abroad and in e-commerce as it seeks to double sales to 3.5 billion euros ($3.9 billion) by 2030, it said on Wednesday.
Chief Executive Paolo de Cesare told a news conference that Le Printemps would open a 30,000 square metre flagship store in Qatar's Doha and a 2,500 square metre one in Milan in the city's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele area in 2021.
Five to 10 more store openings could later follow abroad ""in unique and iconic locations, depending on opportunities,"" he said
Le Printemps, owned by Qatari investors since 2013, also announced the acquisition of online designer furniture and lighting company Made in Design. It said it aimed to do about 25-30% of its business online by 2030, compared with 7% now.
This is not the first time Le Printemps has ventured overseas. In the 1980s it opened stores in the Middle East and Asia, which it has since closed. The last store closed abroad was in Tokyo in 2017.
This time, Le Printemps will manage the stores directly instead of using franchises.
The group did not disclose the size of planned investments, but said they would significantly outpace the 700 million euros spent in the last ten years to upgrade stores in France and increase its luxury focus.
French arch-rival Galeries Lafayette has been expanding abroad in recent years to target high spending shoppers in the Middle East and Asia.
The Doha store will be Le Printemps's second largest after its flagship on Boulevard Haussmann in Paris at 45,000 square meters.
Despite six months of anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests in France, Le Printemps saw a 3% rise in group sales for the year ended March 31.
The Haussmann store is aiming for sales of 1.5-1.7 billion euros by 2030, compared with 1 billion euros currently.
Le Printemps, which traces its roots back to 1865, has 19 stores and eight Citadium lifestyle stores in France, employing 3,000 people.

NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. fliers still consider ticket prices the most important factor when choosing a flight, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, suggesting two fatal crashes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jets have had little impact on consumer sentiment.
In the public opinion poll released May 15, only about half of U.S. adults say they are familiar with the airplane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people, and only 43% could identify the Boeing 737 MAX as the aircraft involved.
Most importantly for Boeing in the wake of the crashes, only 3% said that aircraft maker or model number was most important to them when buying a plane ticket. In contrast, 57% said ticket price was most important. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points. For a graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2DTmkpW
To see the full results of the poll, which was conducted online in English throughout the United States and gathered responses from 2,008 adults, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2VNbtI7
A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the Reuters/Ipsos poll, but said the company is ""committed to returning the MAX safely to the skies so that pilots, crew, regulators and the traveling public have total confidence in this airplane.""
During a call with investors last month, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he knows ""we have some work to do to earn and re-earn the trust of our customers and the flying public in particular.”
If global regulators clear the jets for flight, the Reuters/Ipsos poll data suggest that carriers likely will not have trouble booking seats on the aircraft. 
Boeing's fast-selling 737 MAX airliner was grounded worldwide in March after an Ethiopian Airlines crash, just five months after a similar disaster on a Lion Air flight.
Boeing's stock has fallen about 18% since the March 10 crash, and airlines have warned that the groundings are hitting revenues, and costs, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.
U.S. President Donald Trump urged Boeing to ""rebrand"" the 737 MAX with a new name in a April 15 tweet, saying ""No product has suffered like this one."" That sentiment was echoed in a recent  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Investment Bank report that concluded that ""a large portion of fliers are likely to avoid 737 MAX for an extended period beyond when the grounding is lifted.""
Barclays said it based its findings on a survey of fliers in North American and Europe, though it would not disclose to Reuters the survey methodology or questionnaire. It is unclear how Barclays selected its respondents and how much they were informed of the Boeing crashes before being asked their opinion. 
Boeing declined to comment on the Barclays survey.
The Chicago-based manufacturer is the target of investigations and lawsuits, and is in regular discussions with U.S. airlines on how to regain public trust. Half of all U.S. adults say that airlines prioritize profits over passenger safety, nearly identical to the result in the April 2018 poll.
But based on the Reuters/Ipsos poll, even if people were aware of the 737 MAX crashes, that knowledge is not likely to influence their travel decisions. People say they mostly consider ticket price when planning upcoming plane trips, followed by travel time, the number of stops and the carrier.
That does not mean all fliers ignore models, according to Steve Hafner, CEO of travel booking website KAYAK. He said the website has seen significant usage of a plane model filter it introduced after the Ethiopian crash, showing demand from some travelers.
""As the news cycle on this simmers down and it becomes less top of mind for travelers, we've seen filter usage go flat. But that's not to say it won't pick back up once the planes start flying again,"" Hafner said. 
SOUTHWEST STILL ON TOP
In another indication of the limited impact of the 737 MAX crashes on consumer sentiment, the airline with the deepest connection to the Boeing narrowbody, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, remained the most popular carrier in the poll.
Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator with 34 jets and at least 249 more on order, is cancelling 160 daily flights during the peak summer travel season as a result of the MAX grounding, more than rival U.S. carriers.
Still, 21% of respondents picked the low-cost airline as their preferred carrier, up from 19% in a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran in June 2017.
""We don't book the plane, we book the place,"" said Allen Forrey, a 63-year-old truck driver who did not participate in the poll, after landing at Chicago's Midway airport from Phoenix, Arizona on Southwest.
Other frequent Southwest customers at Midway told Reuters they choose the airline because of its two free bag policy, versus fees charged by competitors, and friendly service.
Southwest said the comments were consistent with feedback it receives and noted that ""well less than 1% of customers check their aircraft type traditionally, but we do expect more customers to become aware given the current climate.""
To ease any concerns, Southwest said it is providing MAX updates on its website and communicating with passengers on a regular basis.
After Southwest, 14% chose Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), 11% American Airlines Group Inc and 8% United Airlines. Thirty-five percent said they did not have a preferred airline, while the rest selected among JetBlue Airways Corp, Alaska Airlines, Virgin America or ultra low-cost carriers Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines Inc.
As for the MAX, even if passengers rank prices as the top factor when buying plane tickets, U.S. pilot and flight attendant groups are demanding guarantees from Boeing that the aircraft is 100% safe before they support its return to service.

""The last thing we want is our flight attendants to be afraid to fly that plane,"" said Lori Bassani, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants.

554,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",JPMorgan Chase will invest $125 million in programs to encourage people to save money,"By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will provide $125 million over the next five years to nonprofit groups in the United States and abroad that help people save, pay down debt and improve their credit scores, the bank said on Wednesday.
The goal is to aid the expansion of nonprofits that help people become more financially secure and better able to weather financial hardships. The bank has committed more than $800 million in grants, donations and loans to promote urban renewal in cities including Paris, Detroit, Chicago and others, efforts that need financially stable citizens to succeed.
""We see financial health as a cornerstone of inclusive growth in cities"", Colleen Briggs, head of community innovation at JPMorgan Chase's corporate responsibility office, said in an interview.
Families who have even a small amount of emergency savings - between $250 and $749, depending on where they live - are less likely to be evicted, miss housing or utility payments or receive government benefits after a health issue or job loss, according to a 2016 report by the Urban Institute.
JPMorgan is initially giving seven grants worth between $300,000 and $1 million to nonprofits operating in Miami, London, San Diego and Boston, including some, like Mission Asset Fund, which the bank has worked with before.
Briggs said the investments aim to help organizations build out technology or complete other steps needed to scale their services in their communities or nationwide.
""The main theme is really understanding how do we actually improve people's financial health - moving beyond knowing how to save more to actually saving more,"" Briggs said. 
Mission Asset Fund provides no-interest loans to help immigrants and small business owners establish credit scores. Starting a few years ago, the bank's corporate responsibility office provided financial assistance to help MAF expand to 60 cities, and will give it another $1 million as part of this initiative.
Alice Rodriguez, head of community and business development for Chase, said working with nonprofits has contributed to the bank launching low-cost products like a no-overdraft-fee checking account called Chase Secure.
But where those products cannot help low-income customers, the bank can refer them to these nonprofits. 
""To the extent that we can't help a client with our own services, we are investing in these other nonprofits so that they can continue to provide that counseling at an ever greater scale,"" Rodriguez said.

556,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 08:12AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump expected to sign order paving way for U.S. telecoms ban on Huawei,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk, paving the way for a ban on doing business with China's Huawei, three U.S. officials familiar with the plan told Reuters.
The order, which will not name specific countries or companies, has been under consideration for more than a year but has repeatedly been delayed, the sources said, asking not to be named because the preparations remain confidential. It could be delayed again, they said. 
The executive order would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States. The order will direct the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up a plan for enforcement, the sources said.
If signed, the executive order would come at a delicate time in relations between China and the United States as the world's two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China's unfair trade practices.
Washington believes equipment made by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's third largest smartphone maker, could be used by the Chinese state to spy. Huawei, which has repeatedly denied the allegations, did not immediately comment. 
The White House and Commerce Department declined to comment. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said during a daily briefing in Beijing on Wednesday that the United States had been ""abusing its national power"" to ""deliberately smear"" and suppress certain Chinese companies.
""This is not honorable, nor is it just,"" he said.
""We urge the United States to stop using the excuse of security issues to unreasonably suppress Chinese companies, and provide a fair, just, non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies carrying out normal investments and operations in the United States.""
The United States has been actively pushing other countries not to use Huawei's equipment in next-generation 5G networks that it calls ""untrustworthy."" In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using equipment from Huawei and another Chinese provider, ZTE Corp (HK:0763). 
In January, U.S. prosecutors charged two Huawei units in Washington state saying they conspired to steal T-Mobile US Inc trade secrets, and also charged Huawei and its chief financial officer with bank and wire fraud on allegations that the company violated sanctions against Iran.
The Federal Communications Commission in April 2018 voted to advance a proposal to bar the use of funds from a $9 billion government fund to buy equipment or services from companies that pose a security threat to U.S. communications networks.
Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said last week he was waiting for the Commerce Department to express views on how to ""define the list of companies"" that would be prohibited under the FCC proposal.
The FCC voted unanimously to deny China Mobile Ltd’s bid to provide U.S. telecommunications services last week and said it was reviewing similar prior approvals held by China Unicom and China Telecom Corp.
The issue has taken on new urgency as U.S. wireless carriers look for partners as they rollout 5G networks.
While the big wireless companies have already cut ties with Huawei, small rural carriers continue to rely on both Huawei and ZTE switches and other equipment because they tend to be cheaper.
The Rural Wireless Association, which represents carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers, estimated that 25 percent of its members had Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks, it said in an FCC filing in December.
At a hearing Tuesday, U.S. senators raised the alarm about allies using Chinese equipment in 5G networks.

The Wall Street Journal first reported in May 2018 that the executive order was under review. Reuters reported in December that Trump was still considering issuing the order and other media reported in February that the order was imminent.

558,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Trade War May Yet Spur China to Sell Treasuries as Yuan Tumbles,"(Bloomberg) -- The idea that China would dump its $1.1 trillion of Treasuries to retaliate against U.S. tariffs is often dismissed as improbable. It’s seen as a nuclear option that would inflict more harm on China’s economy than America’s.
Yet the tensions rippling through global financial markets could still lead Beijing to reduce its stockpile in the $15.9 trillion Treasuries market -- not to retaliate, but to defend its currency if it goes into a free-fall. The offshore yuan has slumped 2.6% this month to about 6.92 per dollar as the trade standoff intensified, reaching the weakest since December.
The specter of Treasuries being deployed as a weapon in the trade spat surfaced via a tweet from a Chinese journalist on Monday that said the nation’s scholars are “discussing the possibility of dumping” U.S. government debt. The post came after trade negotiations last week ended without a resolution. Beijing on Monday said it will increase levies on some American goods in retaliation for the latest U.S. tariff hikes.
“China selling Treasuries is a risk, but it would have less to do with any retaliation they might pursue in response to tariffs and more to do with managing their currency,” said Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “But if the capital account is leakier than they want it to be and they have to defend the yuan, then they’d need to be selling Treasuries.’’
Macquarie Securities Ltd. says China is unlikely to let the yuan’s slide get out of control, as it could lead to capital outflows and sharper depreciation. In 2016, Chinese authorities unloaded about $188 billion of Treasuries -- 15% of the total -- as the yuan sank almost 7% amid capital flight.
Tannuzzo sees an additional 7% decline in the yuan as likely without a trade deal, for a combined slide in line with that seen in the second and third quarter of 2018, when a previous bout of trade angst roiled markets. Last year, China’s Treasuries holdings fell by about 5%, second in scale only to the 2016 reduction.
China’s Treasuries holdings are still more than double where they stood before the U.S. recession and comprise about a third of the country’s $3.1 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves. It taps those coffers to manage its currency.
The Chinese journalist’s tweet on Monday barely registered in the bond market, as it came amid haven buying as stocks slumped in the face of the trade impasse. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yields 2.38%, compared with 2.68% at the end of December.
U.S. officials have warned China against deliberately weakening the yuan to combat the hit from U.S. duties. But most strategists say China’s painful experience with devaluing the yuan in 2015, which prompted an exodus of capital, is likely to dissuade such a move.
Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds, also sees the risk that China will trim its Treasuries pile if it needs to prop up the yuan to prevent repercussions for its economy.
“If there is no trade deal, China’s currency will come under further pressure and that’s a problem for their funding, so they will need hard currency to intervene to prevent the weakening,” he said.
Last Resort
But the consensus is that any further selloff would be a last resort. For one thing, China would struggle to find other places to park its cash. But it would also have to consider the consequences for its own economy, if a stronger yuan undermines exports.
Even if China did dump Treasuries, yields might not rise that far. Any such move would probably trigger risk aversion that drives other investors to snap them up as a haven. What’s more, the Federal Reserve is about to start adding to its Treasuries again, providing a buffer to the marketplace.
“Whenever tensions emerge between the U.S. and China, questions arise as to whether China would sell off its Treasuries in retaliation,” said Mark Sobel, a former Treasury official and now U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. “This has been the dog that didn’t bark.”

559,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",One of World's Biggest Funds Isn't Wooed by Market Sell-Off,"(Bloomberg) -- Thinking of buying the dip? One of the world’s biggest money managers says the stock market hasn’t slumped enough to make it purchase more equities.
According to  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariff spat with China has spooked investors so much that they’re unlikely to buy stocks until a deal is reached.
“Even though some people are saying this is a good opportunity to buy on dips, we’re not really seeing clients take advantage of that this month,” Altaf Kassam, the head of investment strategy and research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at State Street, which oversees $2.8 trillion, said in an interview in London.
“Those that have enjoyed the gains of the last 10 years are looking to protect themselves, and those who haven’t got in are probably not going to get in now until this trade war is resolved,"" he said.
The renewed trade war between the U.S. and China has removed one of the main catalysts for this year’s market rally, which lacked the conviction of many investors. It only took a few tweets for volatility to surge as global equities erased about $3 trillion in market value.
State Street’s view stands in contrast to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management and Robeco, which are buying, or considering buying, equities following the market correction as they bet on a resolution of the conflict. But the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) fund manager survey showed that investors consider the trade war to be the top tail risk, and a record share of market players has bought protection against a sharp decline in the stocks over the next three months.
This month’s drop of 4.4% in the MSCI All-Country World Index through Monday isn’t dramatic enough to encourage traders to buy the dip, said Kassam, who estimated it would take a 10% sell-off to get people interested. State Street had been overweight stocks before the May retreat and hasn’t used the dip to add to equity holdings.
The market mood soured again on Wednesday after a short bounce on Tuesday as traders fretted over the impact of the trade conflict on global growth.
The good news is that according to Kassam, this year’s share rally has the potential to resume, thanks to softer monetary policy and Trump’s re-election bid -- although the returns are unlikely to be “explosive.”
“This rally will end with a whimper, not a bang,” Kassam said. “It’s just going to die out, but I think it could go on for a lot longer because accommodating policies don’t look like they’re going to be removed anytime soon.”

560,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Sweden rejects Browder appeal over Swedbank money laundering complaint,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden has rejected an appeal from campaigning investor Bill Browder which had urged authorities to pursue a complaint alleging accounts at Swedbank were used to launder money, the Economic Crime Authority (EBM) said on Wednesday.
Browder's complaint was originally filed in March and was dismissed a month later as the transfers involving Swedish accounts had occurred before tighter anti-money laundering legislation was introduced in 2014 and as the statute of limitations had expired in the case.
Browder appealed, but the EBM said it had rejected his appeal.
""It is correct that the EBM has decided not to change that decision,"" a spokesman for the EBM said.
The CEO and chairman of Sweden's oldest bank have both left as money laundering allegations have come under scrutiny from Baltic and U.S. authorities.
Browder, an investor who campaigns to expose corruption, has taken criminal complaints against Swedbank to Swedish, Estonian and Latvian authorities, alleging that accounts at the bank were used to launder $176 million between 2006 to 2012.
Allegations against Swedbank, mostly reported by Swedish TV, have linked it to a scandal at Danske Bank, which faces potential lawsuits, fines and sanctions after admitting last year that 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious payments had flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.

561,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 07:27AM ET</span>",Profits fall at Japan's top three banks as economy slows,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's three largest banks all reported lower annual profits on Wednesday, highlighting the challenges faced by the banking industry as the world's third-largest economy looks to be headed for another downturn.
The size of the declines varied - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group had a 1% drop while rival Mizuho reported an 83% dive - all three show the difficulty banks have in navigating Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy.
Japanese banks have had to cope for years with an ageing and shrinking population and massive central bank stimulus that has left them with razor-thin profit margins. Now, there are signs of economic weakness on the horizon.
A government assessment this week showed Japan may already be in recession due to the impact of a U.S.-China trade war and weak external demand. That is likely to drive up bad debt costs for banks as more loans go sour.
""Our core profit fell for a fourth straight year. We had expected this, but the environment is very tough,"" Kantesugu Mike, the chief executive of top lender Mitusbishi UFJ Financial Group, told a briefing.
MUFG, one of the world's largest banks by assets, reported a 12 percent slide in annual net profit, reflecting the squeeze on lending margins. The bank was also hit by a one-time charge from suspending development of a new system at a credit unit, reflecting increased competition from cashless services.
Mizuho, Japan's second-largest bank by assets, reported an 83% percent decline in net profit, to 96.6 billion yen ($884 million), in the year through March 2019.
That marked its weakest performance since the global financial crisis when the bank made a loss. The result was widely expected after Mizuho cut its outlook for the year two months ago.
Mizuho said it was hit by the cost of closing domestic branches and restructuring its securities portfolio.
CHALLENGES ABOUND
""The restructuring costs that the bank incurred in its domestic retail business highlight the challenges that Japanese banks face in keeping their retail businesses profitable amid an aging and shrinking population, and given the persistent ultra-low domestic interest rates,"" analyst Tetsuya Yamamoto of Moody's said in a note about Mizuho.
Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan's third-largest bank by assets, reported a 727 billion yen net profit for the year just ended from 734 billion yen in the previous year. For the year ending March 2020, SMFG forecast profit of 700 billion yen, down nearly 4 percent from the year just ended.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Wednesday said he was not considering additional easing right now but would consider it without hesitation if consumer prices lost momentum.
""We have decided we should be prepared for a certain amount of credit costs for this year,"" Mizuho Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai told a news conference, referring to money put aside to cover bad loans.
Mizuho also announced a five-year business plan saying it needed to be able to respond quickly to structural changes, including Japan's low birthrate and the industry's increased use of technology.
It said it would target consolidated net profit of 900 billion yen by 2023.

Sweden's Northvolt is looking to raise 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion), split equally between debt and equity, and has asked the European Investment Bank for a 350 million euro loan.

She declined to give further details. 

Northvolt, founded by former Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive Peter Carlsson, is looking to spend 3 billion euros to build Europe's biggest battery cell plant in Sweden, a project to rival U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's Gigafactory.

563,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",‘Buy the Dip’ Alive and Well as BofA Sees Biggest Inflows in 2019,"(Bloomberg) -- The carnage in U.S. stocks meant a buying opportunity for Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) clients.
While the benchmark S&P 500 last week slumped the most since December, the bank had its largest equity inflows of the year, totaling $4.7 billion. Its institutional and retail clients snapped up single-stock names while hedge funds offloaded holdings. In a sign of optimism for a resolution in the U.S.-China trade conflict, overseas-exposed and cyclical shares saw the largest net purchases.
It’s a sign that “buy the dip” is alive and well in stock markets, even as global shares erased $3.6 trillion amid renewed trade tensions. While the latest tit-for-tat tariff hikes dashed earlier hopes for an impending deal, investors including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management and Robeco, still expect common interest to bring the two countries to an accord.
“Strong inflows (even when excluding buybacks) indicate clients were likely expecting a benign resolution on trade,” strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote in a note. Futures on the S&P 500 were down 0.4% as of 6:37 a.m. in New York
Buying was largely driven by single-stock names, with the bank’s clients turning net sellers of equity exchange-traded funds for the first time in nine weeks. Markets also enjoyed some support from the usual suspects: corporations bought back the most shares in about a year last week, reflecting a tendency for repurchases to peak in mid to late May, the strategists said.
In terms of sectors, this year’s market darling, technology, posted the largest inflows this week. There are other signs the industry group has emerged as an all-weather favorite. Long U.S. tech was considered the most crowded trade in Bank of America’s latest fund manager survey, while hedge funds’ first-quarter filings so far also indicate they boosted such holdings.
The lender’s clients also poured cash into health-care stocks for a third straight week, helping to reverse some of the drastic outflows spurred by fears of policy changes earlier.

Europe's most valuable technology firm completed its $8 billion takeover of Qualtrics, a U.S. company that tracks customer sentiment online, in January, following on from its $2.4 billion purchase of cloud-based human resources software company Callidus in 2018.
""We will also take a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including evaluating a multi-year share repurchase program,"" McDermott told shareholders at SAP's annual general meeting in Mannheim.
SAP last bought back 500 million euros ($561 million) of its shares in 2017.
Wednesday's shareholder meeting is expected to focus on SAP's restructuring program, announced in January, that involves around 4,400 layoffs as part of efforts to reshape the company into a digital platform business.
The restructuring has led to several departures of high-profile executives with deep industry expertise, sparking some concerns of a knowledge outflow.
Last month, U.S. activist investor Elliott disclosed a $1.2 billion stake in SAP last month and said it supported a management efficiency drive to expand adjusted operating margins by a total of 5 percentage points through 2023.
McDermott has indicated there is no pressure from Elliott for retrenchment after a recent round of job cuts, and the activist investor, which purchased a stake of 1 percent in SAP, is not expected to speak at the shareholder meeting.
SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, 75, is also seeking re-election as chairman at the meeting but only for three years instead of the usual five.

569,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>","Tencent Beats Estimates, Signaling the Worst Is Behind It","(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s (HK:0700) quarterly earnings beat estimates, boosted by gains on investments, giving shareholders much-needed assurance the Chinese gaming behemoth is bound for a revival.
Net income rose 17% to 27.21 billion yuan ($4 billion) in the three months ended March compared with the 19.4 billion-yuan average of analysts’ estimates. Revenue climbed 16%, about a third of the pace a year earlier and the slowest since its 2004 listing.
Tencent’s recovering from a brutal 2018. Last week, China’s largest social media company finally unveiled a viable entry in the Battle Royale genre, a red-hot arena it’s been shut out of since Beijing suspended game approvals last year. Now that regulators are again green-lighting titles, investors are counting on the worst being over as the company invests in video and news personalization to win back users from Bytedance Ltd.
“Missing consensus top-line estimates is not ideal, but the bright spot is growth came where it mattered -- in games, which is their most profitable segment,” said Vey-sern Ling, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The 11% sequential jump in mobile game sales bodes well for the sustained recovery of the business over 2019, especially with the addition of new games.”
The profit was boosted by 11.1 billion yuan of gains, including adjustments for fair value of investee companies, it said.
Shares of Tencent rose 0.9% in Hong Kong before earnings were announced. The stock has gained 19% this year, compared with a 28% rise for New York-listed rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. Shares of Naspers Ltd., its biggest shareholder, rose more than 1% in Johannesburg.
Revenue from the Value Added Services unit, which includes online games and messaging, rose just 4.5% to 49 billion yuan. Online advertising revenue surged 25% to 13.4 billion yuan, but that was down from previous years as the economy slowed and the business gained scale, Tencent said.
WeChat had 1.112 billion monthly active users at the end of March, an increase of 6.9% from a year earlier, while the mobile version of QQ had 700.4 million users at the end of the quarter.
Tencent last week unveiled Game for Peace, a self-produced title in the same vein as global smash PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. It concurrently pulled the plug on the mobile version of PUBG in China, a title it was never allowed to make money on during the months-long freeze.
Game for Peace pays tribute to China’s air force and sought out the country’s military recruitment arm for advice during development. Users can port or transfer their accounts easily, and in many cases the app automatically replaces PUBG on phones.
Tencent garnered $14 million of in-app purchases within 72 hours of the title’s launch, according to research consultant Sensor Tower. Game for Peace comes as revenue from desktop games continues to decline and its tentpole Honour of Kings loses steam. The latter hack-and-slash game saw monthly active users fall 12% in March from the previous month, according to David Dai, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bernstein.
“We expect Tencent’s fundamentals to improve in the second half, backed by the launch of new games and stronger monetization potential of shooting games,” Alicia Fu, an SWS Research analyst, said in a research report prior to earnings. “We expect to see a more diversified and sustainable recurring revenue model for Tencent’s mobile games.”

(Reuters) - Italian shares led losses in Europe on Wednesday after the country's deputy prime minister said Rome was ready to break EU fiscal rules, masking early gains fueled by optimism around U.S.-China trade rhetoric.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.1% by 0910 GMT weighed down by a 0.7% drop in the bank-heavy Italian index. 
Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini's comments from Tuesday have raised concerns about the country's high spending, taking a hit on Italian banks.
""It's not the first time the Italians have pushed the boundaries with EU fiscal rules, it is just this time his rhetoric has come at a time when the markets are probably more sensitive to this commentary than normal,"" said John Woolfitt at Atlantic Markets.
The European banks lost 0.3%, also weighed down by some disappointing earnings.
Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) and Dutch bank ABN Amro both missed profit expectations. French bank Credit Agricole's first-quarter net profits dropped after two one-off events offset gains in profitability at some of its businesses.
Bucking the trend was British bank CYBG Plc, which rose 4% after posting a first-half profit.
European markets witnessed a strong rebound from two-month lows on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a softer tone on trade following a recent flare-up in tensions between Beijing and Washington with both sides slapping duties on each others' imports.
Autos, which were among the leading gainers a day earlier, slipped 1.1%, weighed down by shares of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Renault's Japanese partner Nissan issued a bleak earnings outlook.
In an earnings-heavy day for British companies, London's FTSE 100 outperformed its peers. The blue-chip index was helped by  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) Plc shares after the caterer raised its full-year revenue outlook. (L) 
E.ON tumbled more than 5%, among the biggest losers, as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the energy company's stock. Its shares also traded ex-dividend. On the other hand, its rival RWE rose after beating quarter profit expectations.
Meanwhile, latest data showing euro zone economy accelerated sequentially first quarter of 2019, helped by a rebound in the biggest economy Germany, failed to lift investors' spirits.
""While the recession in the German industry may have started to bottom out, businesses in the export-orientated sector barely added anything to growth in the first-quarter,"" said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg.

LONDON (Reuters) - A global equity bounce stemming from softer rhetoric by U.S. President Donald Trump on the trade dispute with Beijing waned on Wednesday as grim China data and fresh Italian debt woes cast a shadow over global markets. 
Concerns that the world's top two economies could career into a fierce and protracted trade war has kept markets on edge over the past days. Investors had taken some comfort from Trump calling the trade dispute with Beijing ""a little squabble"" on Tuesday and insisting talks had not collapsed.
But data from China showing surprisingly weak retail sales and industrial output growth weighed on markets and added pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus.
Adding to the woes are fears over Italy's fiscal situation after Rome said it was ready to break EU fiscal rules to spur employment.
Italian stocks declined 0.7% to lead European stocks lower while France's benchmark slipped 0.4%. Data confirming that Germany's economy had returned to growth in the first quarter cushioned the DAX which eased 0.2%. London's FTSE rose 0.2%.
""Investors had been waiting for data to confirm signs of stabilization in the Chinese economy which, in turn, would bolster expectations that the global economy could start making a sustainable recovery,"" said Neil McKinnon at VTB Capital. 
""The recent escalation in tariffs makes that more difficult and can only add to investor risk aversion and increase the risk of a more prolonged economic downturn.""
The souring mood also looked to spill over to Wall Street with U.S. futures pointing to a softer open following healthy gains in the previous session. MSCI's broadest index of world stocks traded flat.
In currency markets, the Australian dollar - a proxy of China-related trades - fell to its lowest level in three months amid the China data fallout. 
The dollar held broadly steady at 109.51 yen, having pulled away from a three-month low of 109.020 plumbed on Monday when trade war worries boosted investor demand for the safe-haven Japanese currency.[FRX/]
The Chinese yuan was a shade firmer at 6.9056 per dollar in offshore trade, having edged away from a five-month trough of 6.9200 set on Tuesday. The euro remained anchored at $1.1214 while the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was nearly flat at 97.524 after gaining 0.2% the previous day.
The pound remained near a two-week low after Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said late on Tuesday she planned to put forward her thrice-rejected Brexit deal in early June to try to secure an agreement on how to extract Britain from the European Union before the summer holiday. 
In commodities, U.S. crude futures fell 1 percent to $61.15 per barrel after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a bigger-than-expected build in crude inventory. [O/R]
U.S. crude inventories rose by 8.6 million barrels in the week to May 10 to 477.8 million, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 800,000 barrels.
Brent crude lost 0.6% to trade at $70.38 per barrel.
Brent and U.S. crude futures had surged the previous day after top exporter Saudi Arabia said explosive-laden drones launched by a Yemeni-armed movement aligned to Iran had attacked facilities belonging to state oil company Aramco.

573,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Italy Rocks European Bond Markets Over Its Deficit Once Again,"(Bloomberg) -- Concerns of a renewed showdown between Italy and the European Union are rippling through euro-area assets.
Italian bonds and stocks tumbled, leaving investors scrambling for the safety of German bunds a day after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini ratcheted up tensions by saying he would be prepared to see the country’s deficit rise above EU limits if it were to boost employment.
Fears over Italy’s deficit have resurfaced over the past week following a projection from the European Commission that the shortfall will exceed the bloc’s 3% limit in 2020. A battle between the nation’s leaders and Brussels roiled the nation’s bond markets last year before an agreement was finally reached. A strong performance by Europe’s populists at the European Parliamentary elections next week could embolden Salvini further.
“Italy’s yield spread was going to come under pressure over the summer on a protracted budget process, but the market is now front-running this scenario,” said Michael Leister, head of rates strategy at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). “We will test 300-320 basis points versus bunds.”
Italy two-year yields surged 11 basis points to 0.79%, with trading volumes in bond futures reaching more than twice the 10-day average. The slide was precipitated by a block trade in short-dated contracts. The FTSE MIB Index of shares fell for a second day in three.
The slide in Italian notes spurred demand for German securities, with the 10-year bund yield falling three basis points to minus 0.10%, the lowest level since October 2016. Italy’s 10-year bonds now offer 287 basis points more, having widened 37 basis points this year.
Some investors will have been burned by the latest selloff. Italian bonds offer some of the highest yields in the euro area offering what’s known as carry -- effectively higher coupon payments received for just owning the bond. But those returns are eroded during volatile periods. Both NatWest Markets and Danske Bank A/S recommended long trades in segments of Italy’s bond markets in recent notes.
“Stay out of Italy,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske, in emailed comments Wednesday.
Other investors favor the bonds of Italy’s neighbors, such as Portugal and Spain.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). extended its recommendation to buy Portuguese 10-year bonds versus their Italian peers for a second time, with the latest reports on the country’s deficit stoking another wave of selling pressure.
“On BTPs, we continue to target further widening to 300 basis points versus bunds in 10s on weak growth prospects and renewed politicization of the deficit,” wrote Citigroup strategists led by Jamie Searle.
The slide in Italy over the past week will have also been compounded by heightened fears over U.S.-China trade relations, according to Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV. President Donald Trump has given his Chinese counterparts a month to agree to a deal or face tariffs on all exports. Investors have shed riskier asset such as stocks and Italian bonds as a result.
“It’s not just idiosyncratic Italy risk that is driving bund yields lower but also the broader risk-off sentiment as evident in equities/credit risk markets,” said Martin van Vliet, a strategist at Robeco.

574,By Investing.com,"<span>May 15, 2019 04:17AM ET</span>",StockBeat - Italy's Budget Woes Return to Haunt Its Stock Market,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Italy’s Achilles heel is starting to trouble its stock market again.
The FTSE MIB has been the big laggard in Europe over the last month and the underperformance is getting starker, as the economic slowdown puts the populist coalition in Rome on collision course with the European Union’s budget cops.
The issue flared again on Tuesday after deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini threatened to increase spending and openly breach EU deficit and debt limits, if needed, to support growth and stop unemployment rising.
""Until we arrive at 5% unemployment, we will spend everything that we should and if someone in Brussels complains, that won't be our concern,"" Reuters reported Salvini as saying.
The comments drove Italy’s 10-year bond yields to a two-month high of 2.76% and the premium over their German counterparts widened to 283 basis points, the most in three months. Such movements effectively raise the cost of capital and hit the profitability of all Italian companies, especially its banks.
The MIB is still reeling from Salvini’s comments this morning, down 0.7% and the worst-performing major index on the continent. Tellingly, Italy’s two largest banks, Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), are both near the bottom of the index, down 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively, by 4 AM ET (0800 GMT).
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.4 points, or 0.4% at 374.98. The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.1% and the German DAX down 0.4%.
Over the last month, the MIB has lost 5.4%, compared to a drop of only 3.7% for the Stoxx 600 and 1.4% for the Dax.
Italy and the EU had struck an uneasy peace over the new year, Brussels turning a blind eye to a budget forecast from Rome that rested on some heroic growth assumptions. However, the European Commission slashed its 2019 growth estimate for Italy to only 0.1% when it updated its economic forecasts last week. It now sees the budget deficit at a much higher-than-projected 2.5% of GDP, rising to 3.5% next year, a level most economists see as unsustainable."

Market sentiment found some support however, after Trump said it would become apparent “in about three or four weeks” whether trade talks with China were successful. He then predicted that China’s next move would be a rate cut, and he urged the Federal Reserve to do the same to help the U.S. to win the trade war.
“China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a “match,” it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!” he tweeted."

585,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",Walmart mulls stock market listing for UK arm Asda,"LONDON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the world's biggest retailer, said it is considering a stock market listing for its British supermarket arm Asda, whose attempt to combine with rival Sainsbury's was blocked by the UK regulator last month.
Judith McKenna, the Walmart International CEO, told Asda managers at an event in Leeds, northern England, on Tuesday: ""While we are not rushing into anything, I want you to know that we are seriously considering a path to an IPO - a public listing - to strengthen your long-term success.""
But she cautioned that any preparations for an IPO would ""take years"", according to comments released by Asda afterwards.
Britain's competition regulator ruled Sainsbury's 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Asda could not proceed, blocking one potential exit route for Walmart from the UK.
The decision prompted analysts to speculate that Walmart would try to sell Asda to private equity or consider a stock market listing for the business, which it paid 6.7 billion pounds to acquire in 1999.
McKenna's comments are the first time Walmart has publicly addressed its future strategy for Asda since the Sainsbury's deal collapsed.
""Walmart does not have a one-size-fits-all approach to operating its international markets, but a consistent focus on strong local businesses powered by Walmart,"" she said.
Asda has reported seven consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth thanks to a strategy focused on lower prices, more innovation in own-brand products, better store standards and improvements in its e-commerce operations.
Monthly industry data produced by researcher Kantar indicates that Asda will likely report an eighth quarter of growth when it updates on trading on Thursday.
CEO Roger Burnley told managers at the Leeds meeting there would be 80 million pounds of price cuts throughout the rest of 2019.

Asda's strategy is working, he said, but noted it would be harder to deliver the strategy at the same pace without the synergies that the Sainsbury's deal would have provided.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nelson Peltzs' Trian Fund Management LP may push  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM). to implement changes to boost returns, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, the second time in 10 years that Trian has targeted the mutual fund company.
The two sides have discussed cutting costs, the source said, and Legg Mason chairman, president and chief executive officer Joseph Sullivan said on an earnings call on Monday that the company plans to manage costs more effectively to improve profitability.
Legg Mason's share price has fallen 15.5 percent in the last year. Ranked as one of the country's 30 biggest mutual fund firms, the company reported $758 billion in assets under management at the end of the fiscal year, which ended in March, up from $754.1 billion a year earlier.
Like many other mutual fund firms, Legg Mason has been hit hard by investors' shifting tastes for less expensive index funds offered by larger firms, including Vanguard Group.
Representatives for Trian and Legg Mason could either not be reached for comment or declined to comment.
Trian's discussions with Legg Mason were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
It was not immediately clear whether Trian would resort to a proxy contest to push its demands or whether the two sides might find another resolution.
Peltz first set his sights on the Baltimore-based company ten years ago and ended up being offered a seat on the board, which he held until late 2014.
During Peltz' tenure as a director, Legg Mason appointed Sullivan as CEO, replacing Mark Fetting who served for four years.
Earlier this year Trian stopped short of mounting a board challenge at PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG). after the U.S. paints and coatings company met some of Trian's demands and announced new financial targets. 

Trian's largest investments are  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and Procter & Gamble, where the hedge fund has board seats.

587,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",China still most attractive renewables market despite subsidy cuts: EY,"LONDON (Reuters) - China is the most attractive market for investment in renewable energy for the fourth year in a row and growth there is set to continue despite the country's efforts to trim subsidies, a report by UK accountancy firm Ernst & Young showed on Wednesday. 
In an annual ranking of the top 40 renewable energy markets worldwide, China was in first place, followed by the United States which was No. 2 for the second year running.
Last year, cuts to China's expensive feed-in tariff regime slowed growth in solar installations. Solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity additions fell to 44.3 gigawatts (GW) from a record 53 GW in 2017.
These could fall further and although the government continues to support wind energy through feed-in tariffs, tariff rates are starting to decline.
At the same time, the government has proposed setting up an auction system to support renewables as it tries to move away from subsidies.
""China's renewable energy market is undergoing a transition as the government seeks to rein in the costs of the subsidies paid to the sector,"" EY said.
""With continuing concerns about pollution, falling technology costs and revived interest from international players, however, growth in the world's largest clean energy market is set to continue,"" it added. It did not give an exact prediction for growth.
France moved to third position from fifth, due to its focus on floating offshore wind capacity and more ambitious targets for onshore wind additions.
India, the world's second most populous country after China, dropped to fourth place from third last year.
Some other countries, such as Norway and Finland, have become more attractive for renewables investment due to new projects funded by power purchase agreements (PPAs) as they move away from subsidies, the report said.
PPAs are also taking off in markets such as Taiwan, France, Spain and Australia.
For many companies, PPAs make economic sense as the contracts run for 10 years or more and offer a long-term hedge amid volatile power prices. 

According to the report, PPAs supported 13.4 GW of clean energy generation last year, more than double the amount in 2017.

588,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 07:09PM ET</span>","Nissan faces long, rocky road to cut U.S. discounts, rental sales","By Nick Carey and Naomi Tajitsu
DETROIT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd said on Tuesday it had hit ""rock bottom"" with a 45% drop in annual operating profit. The automaker's troubles in the United States, including a failure to deliver on a slew of promises to dealers, are a major reason why. 
Nissan's U.S. operations, once a big contributor to its international sales and profit, are now emblematic of its global challenges. Under ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's U.S. operations gunned for ambitious sales goals by pitting dealers against each other in a battle for sales bonuses, and cranking up sales to fleets, dealers said.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa said U.S. profit margins had hit a low level of between 1% and 2%.
He acknowledged Nissan had failed to honor its promises and aimed to bring its fleet sales down to 15% to 17% of total sales by around 2022 - from a high of around 40% in the first quarter. Bulk sales to rental-car fleets undermine resale values and hurt retail consumers at trade-in time, dealers said. 
""It's going to take more time than we thought to recover from this situation,"" Saikawa said. 
Nissan dealers complain the Japanese automaker has provided few specifics of a turnaround plan, and has not delivered on its past promises.
""We've heard a lot of talk, but we haven't seen any action,"" said U.S. Marine, managing partner with Sutherlin Nissan in Orlando, Florida. 
Marine said dealers were skeptical because so-called stair step bonus programs remain in place that reward dealers with cash only if they hit monthly sales targets. 
'DEPRESSING'
The programs can force dealers to slash profit margins to hit the targets, or risk seeing rival Nissan franchises get bonus money instead, dealers said. Profitability at his Nissan dealership has fallen by 50 percent in the last three years, Marine said. 
""It's depressing and deflating for a dealer when we get our new objectives for the quarter and they're so high that some dealers are saying, 'Screw it ... we're going to focus on selling used cars,'"" Marine said. 
Jose Valls, Nissan's recently appointed head of North America, told Reuters the automaker will refresh most of its lineup over the next three years. He is reaching out to dealers to persuade them that this time, Nissan really plans to change.
""I know dealers are skeptical ... but I'm trying to be very pragmatic and I need them as they need me,"" Valls said. ""We're in the same boat.""
Nissan still has high consumer discounts and fleet sales. 
(Graphic: Nissan's U.S. sales - https://tmsnrt.rs/2XIResC) 
Pulling back will be hard because overall demand for new vehicles in the United States is falling, and Nissan is weak in some of the remaining strong segments, such as large pickup trucks.
After hitting a peak of 8.9% in 2016, Nissan's U.S. market share slid to 7.8% last year, its lowest since 2010. The company's sales sank 11.6% in the first quarter, compared with an industry-wide drop of 3.2%.
'WATCHING THEM CLOSELY'
To one degree or another, major automakers rely on discounts in the U.S. market to sell vehicles. 
Automakers like Toyota Motor Cop and Honda Motor Co Ltd use discounts sparingly to prop up resale values, according to data from Cox Automotive. 
At the high end, Nissan and others like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co ""still rely heavily on manipulating the deal"" with discounts, said Brad Korner, Cox's general manager for automotive rates and incentives. 
""We've come to a point where customers have been buying our product for the discounts offered on them, not for the strength of the product itself,"" Nissan CEO Saikawa said on Tuesday.
(Graphic: Japanese automakers' U.S. incentives - https://tmsnrt.rs/2X0iAtD)
Unplugging from fleet sales and deep discounts threatens Nissan's U.S. manufacturing operations. Nissan operates North America's largest auto plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, which has capacity of around 640,000 vehicles a year, plus a large plant in Canton, Mississippi.
Nissan laid off nearly 400 workers in Canton earlier this year. Nissan's Valls said the automaker does not plan further job cuts, but added ""anything is possible, we have to be prepared.""
Chris Reed, Nissan's North American head of research and development, said his top goal is to ensure the smooth launch of seven revamped or new models over the next two years. 
According to AutoForecast Solutions, they include new versions of popular models like the Rogue and Pathfinder SUVs and the Frontier pickup truck.
Pete DeLongchamps, senior vice president at auto retail chain Group 1 Automotive Inc, which owns nine Nissan dealerships, said the automaker is launching the right products, but discounts and high inventories remain a problem.

""Nissan needs to execute on its plan,"" DeLongchamps said. ""We will be watching them very closely to see that they do.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.82%, up more than 200 points, but had spent most of the day up more than 300. The S&P 500 added 0.80%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.14%. The gains still erased about a third of Monday's big losses.
Trade talks between the U.S. and China reportedly hit a snag, CNN reported this afternoon, citing sources close to the discussions. The news appeared to sour earlier sentiment on trade, even as President Donald Trump denied that talks had stalled.
Trump showed no intention of escalating trade tensions in the wake of Beijings plans to launch retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, calling the current trade dispute a ""little squabble.""
""We have a dialogue going. It will always continue,"" said Trump, who had earlier announced plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan late next month in a bid to make progress on the trade dispute.
Despite the uncertainty over trade, industrials and tech stocks, which are trade-sensitive sectors, ended the day higher.
But analysts said the rebound in the market was less likely a sign that optimism on trade had returned, but rather a relief rally following the bloody session on Wall Street a day earlier.
""(Yesterday's move) was probably just a little too much to the downside,"" said Chris Battifarano, investment chief at FineMark National Bank & Trust in Ft. Myers, Fla.

Beijing echoed that sentiment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters: ""My understanding is that China and the United States have agreed to continue pursuing relevant discussions.""

1. Alibaba Reports With China Economy in Spotlight
Chinese e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) reports earnings before the bell tomorrow. The numbers will take on even more significance as a proxy for the health of the Chinese consumer as the trade war between China and the U.S. heats up again.
Alibaba is expected to report a profit of $6.62 per share, with sales of about $91.6 billion, according to the analysts’ consensus estimate compiled by Investing.com. The stock finished at $174.91 Tuesday, up 3%. It was a 10-month high and up 34.5% from its $130 low in the December slump. But it fell as much as 12.9% between May 3 and Monday as tariff worries erupted.
Macy’s (NYSE:M) also weighs in, with analysts looking for a profit of 34 cents per share and sales around $5.5 billion.
After the close of trading, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) will issue its quarterly results. On average, analysts predict a profit of 77 cents per share and revenue of around $13 billion. Last week, Needham said it was cautious on Cisco heading into earnings, saying that the company will likely beat estimates, but outlook may be constrained, Briefing.com reported.
2. Retail Sales Rise Predicted
Retail sales figures will be most closely watched on the economic calendar tomorrow. The Commerce Department will report April retail sales numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists predict that retail sales rose 0.2% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, are expected to have risen 0.7%.
At the same time, the May New York Empire Manufacturing Index arrives, with economists looking for a drop to 8.2. At 9:15 AM ET, April industrial production numbers will be released, with economists looking for it to remain flat. Capacity utilization is forecast to have ticked down to 78.7% last month. At 10:00 AM ET, business inventories for March will be released.
3. Oil Stockpiles Seen Falling
The Energy Information Administration releases its weekly oil inventories numbers tomorrow at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). Analysts predict that crude stockpiles fell by 800,000 barrels.
Today in OPEC's monthly report, the cartel said that its 14 members, led by Saudi Arabia, had cut output again in April, albeit slightly. OPEC said it pumped 30.03 million barrels per day in April, nearly 550,000 bpd less than in March. It also forecast that total world oil supply will increase by 2.22 million bpd in 2019 versus demand growth of 1.21 million. The 1 million bpd difference could give the group legitimacy to extend production cuts at its June meeting with Russia and other world oil producers."

595,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>","Disney takes control of Hulu to challenge Netflix, Amazon","By Kenneth Li and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co said it will take full control of the Hulu service in a deal with Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), as it vies for a bigger piece of the global video streaming market dominated by companies such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The agreement, which ascribes a minimum equity value to Hulu of $27.5 billion, allows either company to trigger a sale or purchase of Comcast's 33% stake to Disney as early as January 2024. Comcast has also agreed to fund Hulu's recent buyout of AT&T's 9.5% interest in the company. 
By establishing an expiration date of five years from now, Comcast is betting the value of its stake will nearly double or more without any more additional financial obligations. 
Comcast's departure from the Hulu board will let Disney prepare unencumbered to expand the scope and reach of Hulu in the domestic and international markets to battle the likes of Netflix, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""It is important for Disney to have full control of the direction and content on Hulu,"" said Trip Miller, managing partner of Memphis-based hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, whose funds include Disney shares. ""Postponing the closing five years (later) allows Disney to not take on more debt after just closing (its purchase of) Fox, while giving Comcast an option to the upside if/when the Hulu valuation grows during this time.""
Disney is preparing to launch its own streaming service called Disney+ on Nov. 12. At a Tuesday morning investors conference, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said the service will launch in India. 
Comcast, which is also preparing to launch an NBCUniversal advertising-supported streaming service by the middle of next year, said it will extend its licensing agreement to provide NBCUniversal shows and its live channels until late 2024 and agree to distribute Hulu on Comcast's cable platform.
To preserve the ability to run NBCUniversal programs on its own service, NBCUniversal will have the option to offer some of the shows it currently licenses exclusively to Hulu in one year's time in exchange for lower license fees. NBCU will also have the option to end most of its licensing agreements with Hulu in three years.
Shares of Disney closed up 1.4% at $133.21 on the New York Stock Exchange. Comcast shares rose 1.5% to $42.91 on Nasdaq.
Last month, Hulu said it had bought back telecommunications and media company AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's stake in the U.S. entertainment streaming service for $1.43 billion, in a deal that valued Hulu at $15 billion.

Hulu, which competes with Netflix and Amazon.com's Prime Video, has more than 26.8 million paid subscribers.

597,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",Not Everyone Is Sure the Stock Charts Are Sounding the All Clear,"(Bloomberg) -- Enjoy the buoyant mood while it lasts, say a chorus of skeptics. It probably won’t be around for much longer.
They doubt the rebound in risk assets has much staying power, sensing hallmarks of an oversold bounce in Turnaround Tuesday. Stocks were battered so badly, so briskly Monday, that they were due for at least one session of recovery.
“If you like, you can cite President Trump’s optimism that a deal with China can get done as a ‘reason’ for the mood to improve, but I’m tempted to conclude that the real reason is -- it’s Tuesday!” writes Kit Juckes, global strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). “On which basis, I wouldn’t place too much faith that the current mood improvement is going to last all that long. Still, it can certainly last for a day or two.”
The Chinese yuan, which Juckes calls “the anchor of stability for all markets,” managed to snap its six-session losing streak -- the longest since August -- with a helping hand from the People’s Bank of China. That’s helped catalyze a world-wide risk rebound, helping rescue corners of the U.S. equity market in which selling had reached extreme levels.
The plunge in U.S. technology shares, which bore the brunt of the equity drawdown, constitutes the biggest loss of momentum in more than 28 years, by one measure. The 14-day relative strength index -- a gauge of the magnitude and persistence of price movements -- for the Nasdaq 100 posted its most negative 14-day swing since August 1990, bringing the tech-heavy index from technically overbought territory to the verge of oversold.
This phenomenon holds outside of tech, too. Bespoke Investment Group examined major U.S. equity index exchange-traded funds and found that most have made a “rapid” move toward the lower end of their trading ranges.
“Whereas last week the group was entirely overbought, they head into trading today at either oversold levels or neutral and on the cusp of oversold,’’ the analysts write.
John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, highlights the scant share of S&P 500 members trading above their 10-day moving averages and limited volume to the upside over this span as characteristics of an oversold market. However, the “odds increased that more time and lower prices” are needed for the benchmark gauge in light of the recent breach of the 50-day moving average for the benchmark gauge.
“Risk stabilized overnight, but hopes that trade talks improve in the near-term should prove fleeting especially as China’s stance has hardened,’’ writes TD Securities strategist Mazen Issa. “As a result, the equity market adjustment is probably not over.’’
Trump’s comments and micro-blog missives are an attempt to soothe markets, he concludes, but “the reality is that a ‘trade by tweet’ mentality is not a prudent long-term strategy.’’
On Monday, the S&P 500 plunged to its worst day in four months while the Nasdaq 100 fell more than it did even on Christmas Eve. Come Tuesday, the major benchmarks were all up more than 1% as of 1:05 p.m. in New York, as technology firms powered the gains. As headlines go, all it took were some conciliatory tweets and a softer tone to flip the sentiment switch.
For now, it seems the majority of investors have their hopes pinned on the idea that the U.S. and China will reach some form of agreement ahead of the G-20 meeting late next month, when President Trump and President Xi Jinping are expected to meet. But before that period, China is also set to raise tariffs on U.S. goods and the Trump administration has also readied a new list of products that could be subject to import tariffs.
Until then, large swings in equity markets either which way probably shouldn’t be trusted, according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds Group, which manages $60 billion. It’s likely too early to sound the all clear.
“I wouldn’t trust any of the trading activity that we’re seeing right now to make a definitive decision to buy or sell,” Hackett said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “Yesterday felt a little bit capitulation based, today feels a little bit hope based, but in general, we don’t know. People are literally guessing at this point.”"

599,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",Uber's IPO Flop Is Coming to an ETF Near You After Its 16% Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors betting that the bad times are over for Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. after a dismal trading debut will soon be able to express their views through an exchange-traded fund.
The $40 million Renaissance IPO ETF, known by its ticker IPO, plans to add Uber to its holdings on May 17, according to a statement from Renaissance Capital. While new companies are typically included at scheduled quarterly reviews, the fund can buy firms with at least $100 million of market capitalization as soon as five days after they start trading, said Kathleen Smith, manager of the fund.The ETF already owns  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT).
Although Uber shares rose Tuesday, the company is down almost 16% since it started trading last week. While that’s prompted some analysts to question valuations, enthusiasm for unicorn listings is unlikely to sour given the potential rewards. Vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc. soared 163% after its initial public offering, making history with the best first session for a company raising $200 million or more since at least 2008.
“Uber will put the fear of God into pricing these other IPOs, maybe making them a little more reasonable for investors to own,” said Renaissance Capital’s Smith. “If you’re trying to trade names like Uber, it’s a lot safer to own a basket of them since it can be very volatile to own them individually,” she said, adding “it’s a way for investors to get exposure without the emotional ride.”
Big Choice
ETF investors looking to capitalize on the recent IPO madness can pick between two funds that focus on newly public companies: Renaissance Capital’s IPO and the First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities ETF, known as FPX.
Both funds track indexes that can add new securities before they qualify for mainstream indexes. But while IPO plans to offer exposure to the most anticipated startup of the decade as soon as this week, FPX probably won’t buy Uber immediately, according to Josef Schuster, who designed the index behind the fund.
Instead, the fund will probably wait until the next rebalancing date because it already owns Lyft, which was the first of the two ride-sharing companies to come to market, he said. Eligible candidates can be added as soon as after the first trading day, but are typically added during the next quarterly rebalancing.
Still, the ability to add new IPOs to a fund’s holdings even on a quarterly basis is a value-add since it can take much longer for major indexes to include them. While the S&P Total Market Index permits some fast-track additions, companies must trade for at least 12 months before being considered for the S&P Composite 1500, the methodology shows.
For IPO, most companies are removed when they’re two years old. FPX also holds companies that are not newly listed, such as  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL).,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ)., and Hershey Co. The fund’s index includes spinoffs and firms that acquired a company that went public within the preceding four years.
“Spinoffs tend to be companies that are a little more well-established, well-known names, and they tend to be less volatile in many instances than new IPOs,” according to Ryan Issakainen, senior vice-president and ETF strategist at First Trust Advisors. “They do provide some diversification benefits from the IPO volatility.”
IPO has climbed about 30% this year, more than doubling the returns of the S&P 500 Index. FPX is up about 20%.

604,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>","GE books more power plant orders, beats Mitsubishi, Siemens: sources","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co won the most orders in the sharply contracting market for new gas-fired power plants in the first quarter, according to people familiar with the matter.
But GE faces rising competition, complicating new Chief Executive Larry Culp's efforts to turn around the company's ailing power unit.
GE booked six orders for its advanced, HA-class turbines in the quarter, up from none a year ago, according to three people familiar with the situation and an industry report seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Rival Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (MHPS) booked five orders, while  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) booked four, the sources said.
For a graphic, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LyarvN
The standings highlight an intensifying battle for sales of these newest, most efficient ""advanced class"" generators capable of powering thousands of homes.
Demand for gas turbines has fallen by half since 2014 as utilities rely more on wind, solar and power conservation. GE's share is shrinking. It ranked second for advanced turbine orders in 2018 and is shutting manufacturing sites and laying off workers to reduce costs.
GE confirmed to Reuters it had booked three additional orders in the first quarter that were not counted in its first-quarter earnings report. The three additional units, sold to Tokyo Electric Power Co in Japan, were included in the closely watched McCoy Power Report published on Tuesday. McCoy declined to comment.
Siemens and MHPS also confirmed their tallies with Reuters.
GE has dominated power-plant sales for decades and has installed more than 7,500 gas turbines around the globe. But its position has weakened. Its backlog of power equipment orders is down 1.5% from a year ago, and GE faced pressure after an HA turbine broke at a plant in Texas last year, forcing GE to replace blades in dozens of plants.
Power was once GE's largest unit, but it has been a drag on the company's earnings. GE lost $22.8 billion last year due to a $22 billion write-down of power assets and an $872 million operating loss in its power unit.
GE Power posted an $80 million profit in the first quarter of this year, after Culp restructured the unit in October to separate gas power from other types of power. 
Culp warned at GE's annual meeting last Wednesday that the relatively strong first-quarter performance was not a trend, and remaining quarters would likely be weaker.

Siemens, meanwhile, said this week that it will spin off its oil and gas, power-plant and grid businesses along with its 59% stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy to allow them to grow without competing for capital with higher-margin Siemens businesses. It plans to list the new company publicly by September 2020.

610,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 12:57PM ET</span>","U.S. consumers sue Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea, StarKist over 'dolphin-safe' tuna claims","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - U.S. consumers sued Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea and StarKist, accusing the country's three major packaged-tuna brands of deceiving them into thinking their tuna is caught only through ""dolphin-safe"" fishing practices.
The proposed class actions filed on Monday said the defendants employ fishing techniques that kill or harm dolphins, and do not always use safer, costlier pole-and-line and other methods used by such rivals as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's.
The consumers said this makes the defendants' dolphin-safe labels false and misleading, violating the laws of several U.S. states including California, Florida, New Jersey and New York.
They also said StarKist violated federal racketeering law through its alleged dealings with foreign fishing companies.
Concern about dolphin safety ""makes tuna fish consumers no different from Hindus attributing zero value to beef products, or vegans attributing zero value to animal products, or vegetarians attributing zero value to meat, fish, and poultry,"" the complaints said.
StarKist said it does not discuss pending litigation, but would not buy tuna ""caught in association with dolphins."" It also condemned ""indiscriminate fishing methods"" that trap dolphins along with the intended catch. 
Bumble Bee did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. Chicken of the Sea had no immediate comment.
The lawsuits filed with the U.S. District Court in San Francisco seek full refunds for consumers nationwide who bought tuna in the last four years, or for premiums paid for the dolphin-safe claims.
It was not immediately clear how the consumers plan to show the claims were misleading. Their law firm did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.
The complaints said the defendants have made dolphin-safe claims since 1990, when the federal Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act banned false labeling of tuna products.
In December, the World Trade Organization said U.S. laws governing dolphin-safe labels complied with that group's rules. 
Bumble Bee is controlled by private equity firm Lion Capital, Chicken of the Sea by Thailand's Thai Union Group PCL, and StarKist by South Korea's Dongwon Industries Co.

The cases in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California are Gardner et al v StarKist Co, No. 19-02561; Duggan et al v Tri-Union Seafoods LLC, No. 19-02562; and Duggan et al v Bumble Bee Foods LLC, No. 19-02564.

PARIS (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and U.S. waste recycling company TerraCycle launched on Tuesday the test for their 'Loop' initiative which they hope will tackle the problems of plastic waste threatening to destroy the environment.
The 'Loop' online platform will allow shoppers in the Paris area to buy orange juice, powder detergent or shampoo in reusable containers that do not result in waste.
The initiative was first announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, with over 25 big-name consumer goods and retail partners on board.
Users put down a refundable deposit via the Loop website when ordering products, which are delivered in reusable glass and metal bottles, and shipped in a tote bag to shoppers' doors. 
Loop then retrieves the empty products for cleaning and reuse.
Plastic production has surged over the last 50 years, leading to the widespread use of disposable bottles, cups and containers, but this has also resulted in millions of tonnes of plastic waste ending up in landfills and oceans.
Government bans on products such as single-use plastic water bottles, shopping bags and polystyrene cups have sent retailers and consumer goods companies looking for alternatives.
Carrefour, which is Europe's largest retailer, aims to reach a 100% rate for recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging for its own brands by 2025.
Carrefour is Loop's founding retail partner for France.
It will be offering around 200 products - including around 30 of its own private label and organic products such as honey, oil or spices - during the initial trial in the Paris area.
These products will come alongside those of international brands that have already joined Loop such as Danone's Evian mineral water, Pepsico's Tropicana juice, Quaker Cruesli cereal or Unilever's 'Signal' toothpaste.
NEW YORK TO FOLLOW
Carrefour General Secretary Laurent Vallee said Loop would tie in with a broader strategy overhaul at Carrefour to focus more on areas such as fresh local produce and organic food, under a global five-year plan to boost sales and profits.
""We hope other international manufacturers and retailers will join us to adopt new standards and scale up this concept in order to fight waste,"" said Vallee.
The Loop trial launches first in Paris and then New York on May 21. A London launch via supermarket group  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) is slated for later in 2019, with Toronto, Tokyo and California to follow next year.
The products available on www.maboutiqueloop.fr http://www.maboutiqueloop.fr will cost roughly the same as those in single-use containers but shoppers will have to pay a deposit, which for instance amounts to 25 euro cents for a 4.50 euros 75 cl bottle of Carrefour organic sunflower oil.
From October onwards Carrefour will also integrate Loop in its own e-commerce website www.Carrefour.fr/clvc, in a bid to boost traffic on its site and build up customer loyalty.
Partners in the Loop trial, many of which are re-designing their traditional packages, will test how the system works in general, and above all whether consumers are prepared to put up a deposit and then re-order products this way. Customers can opt to have the product automatically replaced.
Eventually, Carrefour could roll out the service in its stores.

""We want to reach 5,000 users in the trial. The percentage of clients loyal to Loop will be key. We aim for over 50% of re-order,"" Bertrand Swiderski, Carrefour's sustainability director, told Reuters.

614,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 12:08PM ET</span>",Bayer nears 7-year low after $2 billion award in Roundup trial,"By Ludwig Burger
Frankfurt (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) shares fell by as much as 5 percent on Tuesday after a California couple were awarded more than $2 billion in the largest U.S. jury penalty over allegations its Roundup weed killer causes cancer.
The stock closed at its lowest level in almost seven years, even though the punitive damages award is likely to be reduced due to U.S. Supreme Court rulings that limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9:1.
The jury set the total punitive damages at $2 billion and added $55 million in compensatory pay, concluding that Roundup - based on herbicide glyphosate - had been defectively designed, and that the company failed to warn of the herbicide's alleged cancer risk.
The shares closed about 2 percent lower at 55.33 euros.
Bayer said in a statement on Monday it was disappointed with the verdict and would appeal. A spokesman called the jury's decision ""excessive and unjustifiable"". 
It was the third consecutive U.S. jury verdict against the company in litigation over the chemical, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year. 
""Clearly we anticipate that much of the punitive damages of $2 billion would likely be significantly reduced on appeal,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.
""However, the level of compensatory damages is still likely to be somewhat of a concern to the market given the level is above the Hardeman case,"" they added, referring to $5 million in compensatory damages awarded to a plaintiff in a previous case.
The brokerage said the litigation slashed its valuation of the company by 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) but it would take until mid-2020 for more cases and a couple of appeal decisions to provide greater clarity. 
Bayer, inventor of Aspirin and maker of stroke prevention drug Xarelto and Yasmin birth control pills, faces U.S. lawsuits from more than 13,400 plaintiffs over the herbicide's alleged cancer risk. 
The group's market value has fallen below what Bayer paid for Monsanto after shedding about 40 billion euros since the first jury verdict last August. 
In further fallout from the takeover, Bayer said on Monday that Monsanto, which is being investigated by French prosecutors for compiling files of influential people such as journalists and scientists in France, likely did the same across Europe, suggesting a potentially wider problem.
(For a graphic on 'Bayer Stock Performance' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2E7QGF7)
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this month reaffirmed that glyphosate was safe to use. The European Chemicals Agency and other regulators around the globe have also found glyphosate not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.
The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer, however, concluded in 2015 that the chemical probably causes cancer.
Bayer, which was chided by investors for the stock rout at the annual general meeting this month, has said the litigation has had no effect on strong demand from U.S. lawn and garden owners for its glyphosate-based herbicides, adding that demand from U.S. farmers continued to be driven by the weather. 
Under a push to divest assets including its animal health division, Bayer late on Monday said it had agreed to sell U.S. sun care brand Coppertone to Nivea owner Beiersdorf, for $550 million.

618,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 11:51AM ET</span>",Boeing deliveries hammered by 737 MAX groundings,"(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co handed over 24 percent fewer jet airplanes in the first four months of 2019 compared with the same period a year earlier as the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft halted deliveries for a second month.
As expected, the company took no new orders in April for the narrowbody jets as it continues to work on a software fix for the plane's anti-stall system MCAS.
Deliveries of the aircraft were stopped in early March, a few days after an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board, in the second fatal accident involving the 737 MAX in just five months.
Last month Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production of the fastest-selling 737 MAX jets in the wake of the groundings had cost it at least $1 billion.
Boeing recognizes full payment for planes when they are handed over to customers, and the formal grounding of the 737 MAX in almost all global airspace has completely halted deliveries.
At the end of March, Boeing had 91 net orders, but the company's leasing and lending services unit Boeing Capital moved four of its 737 MAX delivery slots to a lessor.
That led to the company recording 87 net orders through April across its aircraft lineup, a reduction of four on a net basis.
Boeing had also removed 206 planes from its order backlog last month due to the near-collapse of India's Jet Airways.
As a result, its net orders for the first four months slid into negative territory, with a total of minus 119 net orders after cancellations, despite a slew of new wide-body sales.
The adjustment has pushed the world's largest planemaker behind European rival Airbus SE in the race for business this year as both companies grapple with cancellations that outweigh new orders.
Airbus last week said it had won 67 gross orders through April this year, but 125 cancellations left it with a negative net order of 58 aircraft.
Airbus delivered 232 aircraft in the first four months of 2019, up from 172 planes a year earlier.
Boeing's total deliveries fell to 172 planes in the same period, compared with 228 jets in 2018.
Investors and analysts closely watch the number of planes Boeing turns over to airlines and leasing firms for cues on the company's cashflow and revenues.

Boeing shares were up 2 percent - in line with the broader market, a day after fears of renewed trade tensions between the United States and China led to a drastic selloff.

LONDON (Reuters) - Since U.S. President Donald Trump's tweets derailed U.S.-China trade talks ten days ago, European stocks have outperformed Wall Street in a sign that investors are pinning their hopes on the region's battered equities weathering the protracted trade spat.
Both the pan-European STOXX 600 and the S&P 500 have fallen since May 3, the trading session before Trump slammed China on trade and threatened more tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from the world's No. 2 economy.
But the European benchmark has outpaced its U.S. peer by about 0.4 percentage points since then.

Though only a small margin, that's a marked change from the past year during which the index has lagged the U.S. market by 9%, as investors have worried about Italy's bulging budget deficit, slowing economic and corporate growth and Britain's chaotic exit from the European Union.
The index also displayed resilience to heavy losses overnight on Wall Street after Beijing retaliated against Washington's latest salvo in the trade row.
Hopes the euro zone economy is through the worst and bottoming out, relatively low valuations and optimism that a U.S.-China deal will soon be brokered are helping fuel the gains, said Lukas Daalder, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Netherlands. 
There's also some relief that the White House may be too distracted by the Beijing battle to wage another trade war in Europe.
""There's a bit of sentiment around that. It means we're not going to be in rough territory immediately, but that's a silver lining to a really dark cloud,"" said Daalder.
Slightly encouraging economic data and a better-than-feared first-quarter earnings season have helped soothe investor worries about the region, Paul O'Connor, head of the UK-based multi-asset team at Janus Henderson, said.
Both agreed, though, it's too soon to expect a major rotation of cash back into the region. O'Connor said macroeconomic data still needed to improve significantly.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) remains 'underweight' EU in favor of the United States because of the trade war and the European parliamentary elections later this month.

620,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 11:24AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UniCredit advances towards bid for Germany's Commerzbank – sources,"By Arno Schuetze and Pamela Barbaglia
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - UniCredit has stepped up preparations for a potential bid for Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) by hiring investment bankers including a former top German official, three people familiar with the matter said.
The Italian lender had engaged Lazard and its banker Joerg Asmussen, the former German deputy finance minister, along with JP Morgan for a possible takeover, the sources said, raising the prospect of a deal that could allow UniCredit to pivot away from its struggling domestic market. 
Although it is unclear whether and when a bid could be made, UniCredit has long been interested in expanding in Germany, said several sources familiar with management's thinking. It already owns HVB, a large German lender based in Munich.
But the Italian bank, which has been concentrating on its own turnaround plan, had been waiting on the outcome of merger talks between Commerzbank and its larger Frankfurt neighbor,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Those talks unraveled in recent weeks, placing Commerzbank back on the agenda for UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, who will be running the rule over a target worth about 9.3 billion euros ($10.4 billion) compared with UniCredit's market capitalization of 24.4 billion euros.
Commerzbank shares rose on the news, climbing 4.7% by 1400 GMT, with UniCredit shares down 2.4%. 
UniCredit's advances come as Dutch bank  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) has also shown interest in Commerzbank, sources familiar with the matter said. One person with knowledge of those informal talks described them as ""intensive"".
Mustier has hired Lazard in the hope that Asmussen can lobby for the deal with finance minister Olaf Scholz. Both have roots in the German Social Democrat Party. 
Asmussen, who studied business administration at Milan's Bocconi University, has previously served on the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB) and as state secretary at the Federal Ministry of labor and social affairs.
UniCredit, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Lazard, Commerzbank and Germany's finance ministry declined to comment while Asmussen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ING also declined to comment.
JOB FEARS
The success of any approach will hinge in part on the German government, which owns a 15 percent stake in Commerzbank, stemming from a bailout during the financial crisis. Some officials had hoped to keep Commerzbank in German hands, which is why they pushed for a deal with Deutsche Bank. 
One German official said the government would be open to a merger between Commerzbank and a foreign European rival, such as UniCredit. 
But a deal that would tie one of Germany's biggest banks to debt-laden Italy could ultimately prove hard to sell in Berlin. 
If a takeover does emerge, it would be one of the largest deals involving banks across European borders since the financial crisis. Such mergers are still hard to pull off because laws and regulations still vary from country to country despite the single market, bankers say.
However, any initiation of talks is sure to ruffle feathers at Commerzbank, where employees - fearful for their jobs - had overwhelmingly opposed a tie-up with Deutsche Bank. Unions had forecast as many as 30,000 lost jobs.
Analysts at Citi said that any tie up with UniCredit could make it cheaper for the bank to refinance its operations and trigger other cost savings. 
UniCredit last week announced that it was reducing its exposure to Italy to boost its financial strength, with measures including cuts to its portfolio of Italian government bonds.
That move could strengthen prospects for an acquisition in Germany, where UniCredit's high exposure to Italy is seen as a barrier to a deal, several bankers said. 
UniCredit had 54 billion euros of Italian government bonds at the end of March. 
    Italian UniCredit shareholders are in favor of any deal that can boost its market value, but some want the bank to retain its Italian identity, a person close to the matter said. 

Mustier last week said that the bank was very proud of being listed and headquartered in the euro-zone's third-biggest economy.

Same-store sales in North America recorded its sixth quarter of decline in the last two years, falling 4% in the fourth quarter ended March 30.
Under Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet, the company has been spending more on advertising to rebuild its brand image and boost margins in its home market.
""We still have more work to do,"" Louvet said in a post-earnings call with analysts.
Shares of the company fell 8% in morning trade. The company's stock has been under pressure from an escalation in tariff war with China, from where it sources a third of its raw materials.
""We have accelerated the diversification of our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of any potential tariff outcomes,"" Chief Financial Officer Jane Nielsen said.
The 52-year-old fashion house has also stepped up its investments in expanding overseas, while building up its e-commerce business to make up for declining sales in North America.
In China, one of its fastest growing market, Ralph Lauren has partnered with Alibaba's TMall, JD.com and WeChat to sell its products. Sales in Mainland China grew 30%, powering a 10% growth in Asia, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.

Revenue from Ralph Lauren's Europe business grew 11% in the quarter. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 10% and set aside about $300 million for capital expenditure in fiscal 2020.
Net revenue fell 1.5% to $1.51 billion due to a strong dollar, but beat estimates of $1.48 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.07 per share and beat estimates of 90 cents.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) workers backed a restructuring of the world's largest carmaker on Tuesday after Chief Executive Herbert Diess pledged to spend 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) on a new battery cell production plant near its headquarters in Lower Saxony.
Diess needs the support of Volkswagen's powerful unions as he attempts to slim down and simplify the German company, which has 12 brands spanning trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars and electric bicycles.
VW's leadership has embraced a strategic shift towards e-mobility, which requires less manpower to produce cars, to help it shed the shadow of the diesel emissions test cheating scandal which damaged its finances and reputation.
Labour opposition has stifled previous restructuring efforts at VW, which also said it plans to list its trucks business, integrating its MAN and Scania divisions to create a global challenger to Daimler and Volvo.
""The employee representatives on the supervisory board welcome the decisions, which they expressly support. These decisions set the course for sustainable further development of secure jobs as well as profitability,"" labor chief Bernd Osterloh said in a letter to VW's employees on Tuesday.
VW had said on Monday it would resume preparations for listing the trucks business, which is called Traton, before the summer break, reversing an earlier decision to postpone the listing due to shaky markets. 
It also said it is exploring a sale of MAN Energy Solutions, which makes diesel engines for use in ships and power stations, as well as a full or partial sale, joint ventures or partnerships for transmissions maker Renk.
Reuters reported earlier this month that VW had approached several companies to gauge their interest in buying MAN Energy Solutions, which is expected to achieve a valuation of about 3 billion euros in a potential sale.
Threats by the United States to impose tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese imports sparked fears of a protracted global trade dispute which has rattled investors and sparked a sharp sell-off on equities markets in the past week. 
Finance Chief Frank Witter said in a statement that ""current market assessments"" had encouraged VW to proceed with the Initial Public Offering (IPO), which could yield up to 6 billion euros if a 25 percent stake is listed.
Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois estimated Traton was worth 15 billion to 16 billion euros. 
""A listing should be positive as the current VW balance sheet is in our view a constraint on Traton's ability to execute on its 'Global Champion Strategy'.""
Shares in VW, which Diess said would invest the proceeds of the IPO in creating a global trucks business, were up 1.1% at 1212 GMT.
This could allow Volkswagen Truck & Bus to build a war chest to deepen its relationship with Navistar, a U.S. truckmaker in which it owns a 16.85% stake.
""NO LAZY COMPROMISES""
Osterloh said talks between labor representatives and VW management over working conditions and restructuring plans were going well and a conclusion could be reached in May. 
VW said it would seek to build a battery cell production factory in Salzgitter, Lower Saxony, if economic pre-conditions, such as subsidized electricity, could be met.
And executive board member Stefan Sommer told journalists that VW was already looking into opening additional battery production sites in Europe.
Diess' predecessor Matthias Mueller failed to sell non-core assets like Ducati, stifled by supervisory board members from Lower Saxony and the company's labor representatives who control more than half the seats on the 20-member board. 
Osterloh said he would agree to divestments and a transformation if the terms and conditions for employees in units which have been earmarked for disposal are not watered down and if there is industrial logic behind the deal.
""You can rely on one thing, there will be no lazy compromises here,"" Osterloh said.

Morgan survey showed on Tuesday.
The share of investors who said they were long or hold more longer-dated Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, grew to 32% on Monday, from 28% a week earlier and matching the level seen two weeks ago, J.P. Morgan said.
The share of investors who said they were short or hold fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, increased to 19% from 13% the week before.
The share of longs exceeded the share of shorts by 13 percentage points, down from 15 points a week ago.
On Monday, China's finance ministry said it planned to set import tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on 5,140 U.S. products on a target list worth about $60 billion. It said the tariffs will take effect on June 1.
The move followed United States' tariff increase on $200 billion of Chinese imports on Friday.
The unexpected breakdown in trade talks between the two economic powers kindled fears of a continuing trade war, sparking a stampede from stocks and risky assets into Treasuries, yen and gold on Monday.
The yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) fell to 2.389% on Monday, the lowest since March 28. They were 2.409% in early U.S. trading on Tuesday.
The latest survey showed the share of investors who said they were neutral or holding longer-dated Treasuries equal to their portfolio benchmarks, fell to 49% on Monday.
This was the lowest neutral reading since March 4 and below 59% the week before.
Among active clients which include hedge funds and market makers, the share who said they are long on Monday doubled to 40% from the previous week.

Those who said they were short increased to 10% from zero in the prior week.

The Dow Jones jumped 117 points, or 0.5%, to 25,441.89 points by 9:43 AM ET (13:43 GMT), while the S&P 500 gained 16 points, or 0.6%, 2,827.76 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite traded up 54 points, or 0.7%, at 7,700.57 points.
The gains came after a broad-based selloff on Wall Street Monday that saw the Nasdaq post its largest percentage drop this year and the worst performance in the Dow and S&P 500 since Jan. 3.
Investor sentiment was soothed somewhat after U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the meeting of G20 leaders next month.
""That'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting,” he said.
Trump also predicted that the outcome of trade talks would come “in about three or four weeks.”
But the escalation has substantially changed the outlook for the stock market, some analysts say.
""If Trump is serious and slaps 25% tariffs on all imports from China, profits (at S&P 500 companies) could fall by between 20% and 30%,"" warned Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan.
The Chinese government also said on Tuesday that both sides would continue to talk, fueling hopes that the recent escalation in tensions could be reversed.
Beijing announced Monday that it would place tariffs on about $60 billion in U.S. imports in retaliation for American tariff increases on its products.Trump insisted via Twitter that “China wanted to make a deal” and took the opportunity to take another shot at the Federal Reserve.



“China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a ‘match,’ it would be game over, we win,” he tweeted.
Investors will look for signs to see if policymakers have shifted their expectations to stay on hold throughout the year. Fed officials Esther George and Mary Daly are scheduled for appearances later in the session and could give indications on whether the Fed would act to pre-empt any economic slowdown caused by the recent escalation of the trade dispute.
Earlier Tuesday, New York Fed President John Williams said slow recoveries from recessions and low inflation are here to stay unless policymakers can get a better grip on how to stabilize the global economy in an era of lower interest rates.
In earnings news, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) produced better-than-expected quarterly results, while cannabis companies Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Aurora (NYSE:ACB) will report after the market close.

627,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",VW Cranks Up Electric-Car Plants to Overtake Tesla's Capacity,"(Bloomberg) -- In about a year, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) may catch up to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) capacity to make electric cars.
The world’s biggest automaker said Tuesday it’s building two plants in China to produce a total of 600,000 vehicles on its dedicated battery-car platform, dubbed MEB. The new factories in Anting and Foshan will open a few months after Germany’s Zwickau, which will assemble as many as 330,000 cars annually and is slated to get started by year-end.
Following through with plans to reach this level of scale will likely leave Tesla trailing behind. Its lone vehicle assembly plant operating in Fremont, California, can make about 500,000 cars. The electric-car leader expects to start output on the outskirts of Shanghai at the end of this year and produce 250,000 vehicles a year initially.
VW has little time to lose after Tesla resolved manufacturing snafus in Fremont and its battery factory near Reno, Nevada, which may start also building Model Y crossovers. While Model 3 sedan deliveries tailed off in the first quarter following a strong second half of 2018, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has dismissed concerns about demand and stuck to a forecast for as many as 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.
VW plans to produce some 70 battery-powered models across its 12 auto brands by 2028 and make 22 million electric cars over the next decade. Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess, who says alternative technologies like fuel-cell cars will struggle to compete, is helming the auto industry’s biggest effort in the transition from combustion engines costing some 30 billion euros ($34 billion).
“Volkswagen leads the competition on e-mobility,” Diess said in speech notes at the company’s annual meeting in Berlin. “As a company we’ll make a success of the electric car -- with the right products, superior underpinnings and global economies of scale.”
The carmaker, which is also considering sites for more electric-car plants, this month opened reservations for its electric ID.3 hatchback. It’s garnered more than 15,000 orders from buyers putting down 1,000-euro deposits.
Tesla, meanwhile, is mulling a factory in Germany, Musk said in a tweet last month, after last year stating the home of BMW AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and VW was the leading choice for a car and battery site in Europe.

628,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Saudi's Sipchem, Sahara to seek deals in U.S. and Asia after merger","By Marwa Rashad
KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi International Petrochemical Co (Sipchem) and Sahara Petrochemical plan to target acquisitions and joint ventures in the United States and Asia when their merger is completed in order to expand market reach, top executives said.
The new entity, Sahara International Petrochemical Company, will have combined assets worth more than 22 billion riyals ($5.9 billion), ranking second after the kingdom's biggest petrochemicals firm, Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC).
""Combining Sipchem and Sahara will create an integrated petrochemical leader with an improved competitive position in Saudi Arabia and globally,"" said Sahara CEO Saleh Bahamdan, who will also be CEO of the new entity.
""We are looking at opportunities in Asia and U.S. markets for either acquisition or organic growth, JVs, and locally we are also exploring,"" said Sipchem CEO Abdullah Al-Saadoon, who will be the new company's chief operating officer.
Growth opportunities will be evaluated and prioritized after the combined entity's management and board are appointed, both executives told Reuters in an interview, without giving further details.
Shareholders of the two firms will hold separate meetings on May 16 to vote on the merger in the last step before completion.
The duo called off a tie-up in 2014, citing an inadequate regulatory framework, but revived it in 2018 as consolidation gained momentum in the Saudi corporate sector as part of the government's Vision 2030 drive to diversify the economy and boost the private sector to create jobs for a young population.
""The transaction comes in line with Vision 2030 goals to build national companies with strong local and international reach in a sector that has been identified as a priority for the future Saudi economy,"" said Bahamdan.
The petrochemical sector, which produces chemicals using oil and natural gas as raw materials, is the backbone of the kingdom's manufacturing sector. Its flagship is SABIC, the world's fourth largest petrochemical firm, the majority of which was recently acquired by Saudi oil giant Aramco.
Sahara produces basic petrochemicals while Sipchem focuses on more high-value products. The tie-up will expand their product portfolio, increase purchasing power and reduce raw material costs, boosting competitiveness and sustainability. ""The merger between Sipchem and Sahara is expected to create synergies of 175-225 million riyals in recurrent EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) annually, coming from increased revenue and also optimizing cost,"" said Saadoon. The synergies will start in the first year of completing the deal and will be fully realised in three years, Bahamdan said.
The two companies will have a shared services structure, including human resources, IT, finance, maintenance and technical services.
They will also have increased scale for procurement and boost cross-selling through 24 companies and affiliates offering 30 distinct petrochemical products, Bahamdan added.
Both Sipchem and Sahara have the Zamil Group, one of the kingdom's most prominent family businesses, as a significant shareholder, along with the Saudi Arabian government.

630,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>","Deere, Apple, Retail in Focus as U.S. Releases Fresh Tariff List","(Bloomberg) -- Deere & Co. on Tuesday joined other companies hit by the U.S.-China trade war, after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cut its rating on the equipment maker due to worsening conditions for U.S. farmers.
The Moline, Illinois-based company is part of a long and growing list of firms confronted with trade-related challenges for their businesses. Cell phones, toys, game consoles and printers were included in a fresh tariffs list released on Monday, and the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).,  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS). and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). may be hurt. President Trump continued to tweet about trade on Tuesday morning, with statements including, “When the time is right we will make a deal with China.”
Deere is down 1.2% in pre-market trading -- but Apple is rising 1.2%, and U.S. equity futures are gaining alongside European stocks as investors assess the prospects for global trade and sift for potential winners. AGCO Corp. may be among those poised to advance, JPMorgan said in a note upgrading its recommendation, as it’s got limited exposure to U.S. row crops and a recent sell-off is overdone.
Here’s a look at some newly exposed U.S. companies:
Mobile Phones
Apple tops the list of U.S. companies that face the biggest impact, as it relies on Chinese labor for the production of nearly all of its devices, including iPhones. That product line alone contributed more than half of Apple’s revenue in the quarter that ended on March 31.
A 25% tariff would cost Apple nearly a quarter of its estimated profit in fiscal 2020,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note last week. If Apple chose to pass on the higher cost to customers the price of an iPhone XS would jump by about $160 and hurt demand, analysts led by Katy Huberty wrote.
According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, the current trade situation could result in Apple seeing production costs for the iPhone rise 2%-3%, given the impact that trade is having on input materials like lithium batteries. Under a “more draconian scenario,” where additional tariffs are levied, expenses could escalate “by roughly 10%+ over time.”
Any pressure on the Cupertino, California-based company is likely to have a ripple effect throughout its vast global network of suppliers, which includes Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc., Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Here’s a list of companies that rank among the highest exposed to Apple, according to Bloomberg supply chain data:
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and Western Digital Corp., which supply memory chips used in smartphones, could also be affected.
Retailers
Retailers may face earnings-per-share declines of 10%-30% or worse, Cowen’s Oliver Chen wrote in a note, as they’re “unlikely to be able to pass on all of potential cost of goods sold increases.” He sees “faster turning” retailers as among the first casualties, while “slower turning retailers will have more time to figure out alternative strategies.” Cowen flagged L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB).,  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc., and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). in the specialty space.
On the other hand, value-oriented retailers may benefit from trade tension as shoppers get increasingly squeezed. That may help Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST). and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT), along with Burlington Stores Inc., TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos., and Ross Systems Inc. Planet Fitness Inc. may get a boost too with “more consumers preferring deep value given its affordable membership.”
Goldman’s Christopher Prykull reiterated buy ratings on  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR). and Five Below Inc. as near-term earnings-per-share impacts may be priced in. Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. also got its buy rating reiterated “given limited negative impact from tariffs as well as an opportunity to capitalize on disruptions in other retailers’ supply chains.”
Video Games
Console tariffs will probably dent sales of Sony Corp (T:6758).’s Playstation,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s XBox and Nintendo Co (T:7974). Video game makers such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) could also see revenue suffer as a result.
Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc., which make graphics processors used in gaming machines, may also be affected.
Storage Devices
A tariff on solid-state drives could hurt Western Digital and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) Plc.

632,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",UBS looks to machine learning to plug FX liquidity gaps,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - As global currency markets grapple with a growing number of flash crashes triggered by shutdowns in algorithmic trading systems when volatility spikes, UBS is utilizing machine learning technology to carry on dealing.
While algorithmic trading has played a growing role in the $5.1 trillion-a-day global foreign exchange market, accounting for up to a fifth of all trading and about 70 percent of all orders placed on multi-dealer currency platform EBS, machine learning is still relatively new.
UBS's ORCA-Direct learns in real time, utilizing historical trading data to find the bank's clients the best available liquidity when volatility rises.
First rolled out to a limited numbers of clients in May 2018, it helped volumes in the bank's algorithmic FX business double in 2018. That made UBS the fastest-growing FX algo broker by market share from the second to the fourth quarter, according to Boston Consulting Group and Expand, a benchmarking house for financial institutions.
UBS is not the only large bank investing millions of dollars in algo technology as it cuts back on trading teams and relies more on automatically computed strategies to trade more efficiently.
JP Morgan, which also reported double-digit growth in its algorithmic trading business in recent months, has released a new machine learning algorithm, and Citibank is another top player in electronic currency trading.
MICROSECONDS 
ORCA's machine learning enables the algorithm to determine within microseconds the best platforms and execution sequence to use, estimating the probability of trading and market impact for each specific order and reducing costs for the bank's clients. 
That can be crucial in the fragmented currency market, where about 70 different platforms exist with multiple banks, hedge funds and technology firms jostling for market share. 
The growing number of flash crashes – where prices of currencies can swing wildly within seconds – also complicates matters.
""What is unique about ORCA is the machine learning we put into it,"" said Chris Purves, head of the bank's FRC Strategic Development Lab. ""Clients...can see their executions improving, they can see their fill rates improving.""
While first-quarter figures are not yet available for algorithmic trading performance, UBS said growth has continued this year.
The bank expanded ORCA to U.S. Treasury trading in late 2018, with further roll-outs expected in the Foreign Exchanges, Rates and Credit (FRC) space.
DIGITAL DRIVE
Investment Bank Chief Operating Officer Beatriz Martín Jiménez said banks have traditionally focused on premium clients but new digital technologies would allow access to a broader customer base.
""The way forward for everybody is to build a platform where you're going to be able to serve a much wider group of clients at a very low margin of cost per new client,"" she said.
Its innovation lab expects to complete a further one or two major projects over coming months.
Meanwhile, from Tuesday until Thursday, UBS will hold sessions for employees on digitalisation and innovation.

""We've learned along way there's a sort of science of innovation,"" Purves said. ""You can teach people to be better at innovation.""

633,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Another ex-Danske Bank executive charged in money laundering scandal,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish prosecutors have filed preliminary charges against former Danske Bank executive Lars Morch as part of their investigation into the bank's involvement in one of the world's biggest money laundering scandals. 
The move, confirmed by Morch on his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, takes the total number of former Danske managers facing preliminary charges in the case to nine, people with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters.
Morch, responsible for business banking including the Baltic operations of Denmark's biggest bank from 2012 until he resigned in April last year, did not detail the preliminary charges, and his lawyer declined to give further comment. The prosecutors also declined to comment.
Two sources familiar with the matter said others facing preliminary charges were accused of breaching Danish money laundering laws. 
The case relates to some 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious transactions that passed through Danske Bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Former Danske chief executive Thomas Borgen, who stepped down last October when the scale of the scandal became clear in an internal report, was also among the people charged, newspaper Berlingske reported last week, citing his lawyer. Borgen's lawyer did not reply to emails and phone calls seeking comment.
Former chief financial officer Henrik Ramlau-Hansen has also been charged, he said in an email on Tuesday, confirming a newspaper report from Monday. 
Ramlau-Hansen was finance director from 2001 to 2015. He then chaired the Danish financial regulator from 2016 until he stepped down in May last year as he did not think he should play any further role in the discussion of Danske's handling of the case.
Danske's former Group General Counsel Flemming Pristed, who resigned in October last year, was charged as well, his lawyer Jens Christensen told Reuters.
Copenhagen-based lawyer Arvid Andersen confirmed that one of his clients had been charged in the case too, but said he had asked for a publication ban of his client's name.
Denmark's state prosecutor filed preliminary charges against Danske Bank in November for alleged violations of the country's anti-money laundering act in relation to its Estonian branch. The prosecutor said at the time he would clarify whether individuals could be held responsible.

636,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>","Nissan set for weakest profit in 11 years as Ghosn woes, bleak sales weigh","By Naomi Tajitsu
YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co forecast a 28% plunge in its annual operating profit, putting it on course for the weakest earnings in 11 years and underscoring its struggle to turn the page after former Chairman Carlos Ghosn was ousted.
The lackluster outlook from Japan's No.2 automaker - hit by Ghosn's arrest last year and troubles at its North American business - is likely to add to the pressure on CEO Hiroto Saikawa as he tries to overhaul corporate governance and put Nissan on a more equal footing with alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA). 
Nissan's weakening profit and a growing number of departing executives and managers have raised concerns at Renault, which holds a 43% stake in the Japanese firm and has pushed for closer ties. 
These issues could strengthen the argument for closer links between the two automakers, although some Nissan executives have opposed a full merger and what they see as an unequal partnership that gives smaller Renault more sway over Nissan.
""Today we have hit rock bottom,"" Saikawa told a news conference at the company's headquarters in Yokohama on Tuesday, adding that he wanted the company to recover to its original performance level in next two to three years.
""Most of the problems we are facing are the negative legacy of our old leader,"" he said in a reference to Ghosn, adding that the company had been slow to move on from these problems.
Nissan expects operating profit of 230 billion yen ($2 billion) for the year to March 2020, missing the 457.7 billion yen average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
The automaker reported an operating profit of 318 billion yen in the year just ended, down 45% from a year earlier. It also booked 4.4 billion yen in expenses to reflect previous misstatements involving Ghosn's compensation.
Sluggish profitability would likely result in a 30% cut to full-year dividend to 40 yen per share, Nissan said. 
DIFFERENT VIEWS
After Ghosn's ousting as head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, the French automaker is set to discuss forming a joint holding company to give both companies equal footing, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
Saikawa declined to comment on the progress of the discussions, but acknowledged a difference of opinion with Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard regarding a closer capital integration between the two companies.
""I have been negative to the idea of a full merger,"" he said. ""Now is not the right time to discuss a merger. We have to focus on our recovery,"" he said.
Ghosn, out on bail and awaiting trial in Japan, has been charged on several counts of financial misconduct and of allegedly enriching himself at Nissan's expense. He has denied all charges and said he is the victim of a boardroom coup.
The scandal has rocked the global auto industry and raised concerns about Nissan's ability to regain its footing following the departure of the charismatic leader and the architect of its alliance with Renault.
Widely considered a protege of Ghosn before taking the reins at Nissan, Saikawa has now come under fire for not doing enough to limit Ghosn's broad control over the company, and for the drop in the automaker's performance since he took over in 2017.
Saikawa has said that he planned to eventually hand over to a successor, but on Tuesday he gave no indication of when such a move may come.
""Timing is a matter I need to decide,"" he said, adding that he would step down ""at the appropriate time"".
U.S. BLUES
The biggest blow to Nissan's bottom line has come from the costly sales incentives in the United States, where its sales fell 9.3% to 1.44 million units in the year ended March 31.
For years it has relied on heavy discounting in its biggest market to sell its Rogue compact SUVs and Altima sedans, under aggressive targets Ghosn set during his time as CEO.
Saikawa has pledged to focus on improving U.S. profit margins, but it has been a slow process as Nissan continues to resort to discounting.
The automaker also cut its mid-term revenue target to 14.5 trillion yen by 2022, from 16.5 trillion yen. It sees its annual operating margin at 6% by then, versus an earlier target for 8%. 
Nissan shares are down around 2% this year, after losing a fifth of their value last year.

(Reuters) - Asset manager Neuberger Berman on Monday urged shareholders of Verint Systems to vote for its three director nominees and asked the data analytics company to detail its cloud strategy.
Verint should also disclose segment-level financials for its customer engagement (CES) and cyber intelligence solutions (CIS) units so that investors can value each of them individually, the investor said in a letter to shareholders.
Verint needs to make a ""compelling case"" for keeping ownership of both units, which it says serves different markets and do not present ""operational synergies,"" Neuberger said.
Neuberger, which holds a 2.7% stake in the company, said it has owned Verint's stock since 2006 and has tried to engage with the company's board for the last two years.
The asset manager said a robust share buyback plan should be an important part for a ""low-growth"" company like Verint.
Verint defended its strategy in an emailed statement to Reuters, citing plans to grow its cloud business by about 40% this year as well as its better-than-expected first-quarter revenue.
""Verint is performing very strongly and is delivering significant value to our stockholders,"" the company said. Shares of the company have risen 41.5% so far this year.
Verint also said it had added three new directors over the last three years, including one director at Neuberger Berman's suggestion in 2017. 
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Neuberger remains willing to resolve its disputes with Verint. 
Verint shareholders are set to vote on the proposals, including the nomination of directors, at the company's annual meeting on June 20.

(Reuters) - Global investors' equity allocations fell 6 percentage points in May and over a third of fund managers have taken out protection against sharp stock market falls in coming months, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest monthly survey found on Tuesday.
The proportion of investors preparing for equity falls is the highest in the survey's history, BAML said, noting that trade war was seen as the main risk by 37% of participants, followed by a Chinese slowdown which was picked by 16%. 
The survey of funds managing close to $687 billion was conducted May 3-9 just as Sino-U.S. trade talks turned acrimonious. The proportion of funds naming trade war as the biggest risk rose by 17 percentage points over last month, and latest developments appear to have vindicated their fears. 
President Donald Trump on Friday carried out his threat to hike tariffs on an additional $250 billion of Chinese goods.
China's decision on Monday to slap on tit-for-tat tariffs sent global equities into their worst one-day fall this year. 
(For a graphic on 'FMS survey's biggest tail risk' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2WFpsgd)
A record 34% of investors had bought portfolio hedges, BAML said, adding that allocation to safe-haven cash had risen seven percentage points to a net 33% overweight. 
(For a graphic on 'Over 1/3 of funds hedged against stock market fall' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2LFVW9b)
""(Investors) are well-hedged but not positioned for a breakdown in trade talks,"" Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist told clients. ""Investors see little reason to 'buy in May' unless the 3Cs – credit, the consumer, and China – quickly surprise to the upside.""
The survey found the overall net equity overweight had dropped to just 11%, while a net 34% were underweight on bonds, the highest in seven years. Emerging markets were the most preferred equity class with a net 34% overweight, while the least favoured was the UK with a net 28% underweight. 
U.S. tech stocks were named the most crowded trade, displacing short European shares for the first time since November 2018. The change came as eurozone equity allocations jumped nine percentage points to a 9% overweight - well off seven-year lows hit in January.
BAML said the ""intention to own"" European stocks had risen to the highest level since last May ""amid greater economic confidence, despite heightened trade war risk."" 
Long U.S. dollar and long emerging markets were the third and fourth most crowded trades respectively.

In keeping with the worries over global economic growth, allocation to commodities slumped 11 percentage points to a net 8% underweight, BAML said.

639,By Investing.com,"<span>May 14, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Futures Rebound after Trade Related Selloff,"Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open on Tuesday a day after a steep selloff triggered by an escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
The blue-chip Dow futures gained 158 points, or 0.6% by 6:52 AM ET (10:52 GMT), S&P 500 futures rose 21 points, or 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 75 points, or 1.0%.
The gains came after a broad based selloff on Wall Street on Monday that saw the Nasdaq post its largest percentage drop this year and the worst performance in the Dow and S&P 500 since Jan. 3.
Investor sentiment was soothed somewhat after U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the meeting of G20 leaders next month. ""That'll be, I think, probably a very fruitful meeting,” he said.
Trump also predicted that the outcome of trade talks would come “in about three or four weeks.”
However, the escalation has substantially changed the outlook for the stock market, some analysts say.
""If Trump is serious and slaps 25% tariffs on all imports from China, profits (at S&P 500 companies) could fall by by between 20% and 30%,"" warned Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan.
The Chinese government also said on Tuesday that both sides would continue to talk, fueling hopes that the recent escalation in tensions could be reversed.
Beijing announced Monday that it would place tariffs on about $60 billion in U.S. imports in retaliation for American tariff increases on its products.
Investors were looking ahead to appearances by Federal Reserve officials Esther George and Mary Daly later in the day, hoping for clues on whether the Fed would act to pre-empt any economic slowdown caused by the escalation of the trade dispute.
Earlier Tuesday, New York Fed President John Williams said slow recoveries from recessions and low inflation are here to stay unless policymakers can get a better grip on how to stabilize the global economy in an era of lower interest rates.

641,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs bought Commerzbank's claim in Saudi's biggest debt saga: sources,"By Davide Barbuscia and Saeed Azhar
DUBAI (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has bought a claim against The International Bank Corporation (TIBC), a Bahraini bank whose default 10 years ago triggered the biggest financial crisis in Saudi Arabia, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The U.S. investment bank bought $100 million of TIBC debt from Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) at the end of last year, two of the sources said, reflecting Goldman's increased interest in Saudi Arabia. 
Although it snubbed a Saudi investment conference last year following the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Goldman Sachs has since won a slew of mandates in the kingdom, including a lead role in Saudi Aramco's debut international bond.
TIBC raised money in international markets, transferring the funds to now defaulted Saudi conglomerate Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Brothers (AHAB), in what a Cayman Islands court last year called one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.
After TIBC defaulted on a foreign exchange deal with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in 2009, AHAB – which denies knowledge of the scheme – collapsed, along with another Saudi conglomerate Saad, leaving an estimated $22 billion in unpaid debts.
TIBC, administered by Bahrain's Central Bank, has a claim of around $3 billion against AHAB, a TIBC spokesman said, while more than 60 banks that have lent money to TIBC remain unpaid.
The sources said Goldman bought TIBC's debt after rulings in various jurisdictions appeared to strengthen the position of the Bahraini bank against AHAB. 
However, if AHAB's application for a financial restructuring under the kingdom's bankruptcy law is successful next week, Goldman's claim may turn out to be worth less than it anticipated. 
Goldman Sachs and Commerzbank declined to comment on the transaction.
LIQUIDATION
Last week, a Saudi court created in 2016 to look into AHAB's affairs, the Joint Directorate of Enforcement at the General Court in Al Khobar (JDEK), suspended TIBC's claims against AHAB until the bankruptcy petition was resolved, AHAB's Chief Restructuring Officer, Simon Charlton, said.
TIBC obtained an enforcement order of around $1.6 billion against AHAB from JDEK last year. 
The TIBC spokesman acknowledged the suspension but said he believed the enforcement order was still valid. 
Meanwhile, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank and HSBC – two of AHAB's creditors – last month launched an application for the liquidation of AHAB under the kingdom's bankruptcy law, said the sources.
AHAB has opposed the petition as it would like to reach a settlement with creditors under the financial restructuring process, Charlton said.
Raffeisen Bank declined to comment while HSBC did not respond to a request for comment.

The Dammam commercial court is expected to rule on the liquidation request next week.

642,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>","World stocks hover near two-month low, investor fears over U.S.-China trade war ease","By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - World stocks hovered near two-month lows on Tuesday, although slightly more optimistic comments from U.S. and Chinese officials on trade brought some comfort a day after equities suffered their worst selloff so far this year.
Fears the United States and China are spiraling into a fiercer, more protracted trade dispute that could derail the global economy, has rattled share markets in recent weeks, and the selloff accelerated on Monday after China announced plans for retaliatory tariffs. 
But the Chinese government's top diplomat said China and the United States both have the ""ability and wisdom"" to reach a trade deal that is good for both. And U.S. President Donald Trump said he was optimistic about resolving the trade dispute.
That paved the way for a positive start for the European trading session, with stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris 0.6% to 0.9% higher, while U.S. stock futures rallied.
""The trade war is driving markets at the moment,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management in London. 
""Markets were prone to a selloff after a good start to the year on expectations of policy easing from central banks and no escalation of trade tensions, and it's this latter pillar that has come away."" 
China has said it would impose higher tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods in retaliate against a U.S. tariff hike on Chinese goods.
Asian shares took another beating on Tuesday but closed off their lows, following the more upbeat tone from U.S. and Chinese officials.
Japan's Nikkei stock index fell to its lowest since mid-February, while broader Asian markets were dragged down by a selloff in Chinese shares. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell over 1% to its lowest level since Jan 30, leaving MSCI's world equity index stuck near its lowest levels in around two months.
Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING in Singapore, said the current volatility showed how a ""180-degree"" turn in U.S. rhetoric on trade negotiations had spooked markets.
""We don't see any quick end to this state of the markets until we see some resolution, constructive dialogue and something very solid in terms of deals. But the hopes for that are a bit misplaced currently,"" he said.
Trump has said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month, with focus now turning to an upcoming G20 meeting.
STABILIZATION?
Signs of stability in world equity markets took the shine off safe-haven assets for now. 
Yields on 10-year German government bonds were two basis points higher on the day at minus 0.06% and off six-week lows hit on Monday when investors flooded into safe havens.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields also rose away from Monday's six-week lows, rising back above shorter-dated three-month bill yields after the yield curve inverted on Monday for the second time in less than a week. 
That move underscored worries about the economic impact of a trade war, given a sustained inversion of this part of the yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
The safe-haven yen too lost some ground as the mood improved, with the dollar strengthening 0.4% against the Japanese currency to 109.74.
The euro firmed 0.12% at $1.1235. However, China's offshore yuan hit a fresh 2019 low in Asian trade before rebounding to trade at 6.8989 per dollar, up 0.2%. 
Its counterpart strengthened slightly to 6.8731 per dollar after the four-month lows touched on Monday sparked speculation Beijing was letting the currency weaken amid the intensifying trade war. 
Oil prices edged up, buoyed by Middle East tensions though gains were checked by trade war concerns. Brent crude gained 0.07% to $70.28 per barrel.

Gold prices held near one-month highs, trading steady on the day at around $1,298 per ounce.

Investing.com -- The cost of preparing for 5G has finally caught up with  Vodafone  (LON:VOD).
The U.K. telecoms giant has finally admitted it can’t afford its 4 billion euro dividend and is cutting its payout for the first time in nearly 30 years, only months after incoming chief executive Nick Read vowed to protect it
It’s a serious blow to pension managers and other income-hunters, but not an unexpected one, in the light of a 6.6 billion-pound loss in the last fiscal year. The company’s shares have been trading at a dividend yield of over 9% in recent weeks, suggesting that a fair amount of speculation on a dividend cut was already baked in.
The stock was up slightly on Tuesday, in line with a modest bounce in European markets after Monday’s trade-war-induced volatility. At 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), it was up 2.3%, outperforming the U.K. FTSE 100, which was up 0.7%. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.4% at 373.94 points, still down 2% over the last week.
With 30 billion euros in net debt and the cost of paying for 5G spectrum still largely to come, the company has been looking financially weak for some time. Operational stumbles in Spain and Italy haven’t helped, and the acquisition of Liberty Global’s German assets, which ought to give it a big boost in pricing power in Europe’s biggest market, still isn’t expected to close until July.
Until those assets can start throwing out cash, Vodafone is resorting to other ways of raising or saving money. Overnight, it announced it will sell its New Zealand business to a consortium led by Brookfield for $2.2 billion. It isn’t too much of a stretch to see its Australian business going the same way, after regulators thwarted its best hope of success there last week by ruling against its proposed merger with TPG.
Closer to home, it has signed agreements to share infrastructure with other operators already in place. Once those agreements are in place, Vodafone says it will look at monetizing its towers business – an area that has generated some eye-catchingly high M&A deals elsewhere in Europe recently.
For investors, the stock still yields a respectable 5.77% and Read on Tuesday promised a “progressive” dividend policy in future, aiming to rebuild the payout once debt is down toward 2.5 times EBITDA."

Seeking to capitalize on the growing popularity of click & collect services, Amazon is offering delivery to hundreds of Next stores as an option on the tens of millions of items it sells online.
The new ""Counter"" service available from Tuesday builds on Amazon's existing parcel pick-up and locker options. In the UK Amazon has over 2,500 automated lockers with partners including supermarket groups Morrisons and the Co-operative as well as Shell (LON:RDSa) petrol stations.
Amazon said the new service is also being launched in Italy, where its partners are bookstore chain Giunti and the network of Fermopoint and SisalPay stores.
""We see it as a great way to create more convenience for our customers and create a win-win situation for the retailers who partner with us,"" said Patrick Supanc, Amazon's director of lockers and pick-up.
He said Amazon is actively seeking more partners across Europe, from family-run corner shops to large retail chains.
Amazon said that feedback from earlier trials showed that adding Counter to a store’s retail offer helped to increase customer footfall.
""In a tough retail environment our aim is that Amazon Counter will contribute to the continued relevance and vibrancy of our stores,"" said Next CEO Simon Wolfson.
Next, one of Britain's pioneers in click & collect, has been grappling with the sector's structural shift from physical stores to online.
The new Amazon service works much like traditional click & collect offers.
When a customer's Amazon package arrives at the store, the customer receives an email notification with a unique barcode as well as the address and opening hours of the selected store. Customers will have 14 days to collect their parcels.

Amazon declined to disclose the commercial terms of its Counter partnerships or how much it has invested in the initiative.

647,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>","Thyssenkrupp Profit Plunges, Raising Pressure on CEO","(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) AG’s earnings plunged as Germany’s economic slowdown took a toll on the engineering company that’s been engulfed in turmoil over the past year.
The company cited a long list of problems during the past six months, everything from weak demand from the auto industry, falling steel prices, higher labor costs and even the low water levels of the Rhine river. The poor results will reinforce criticism from Thyssenkrupp’s top investors that the company has been poorly managed and needs a dramatic action.
Chief Executive Officer Guido Kerkhoff will likely face sharp questions on why the company has kept spiraling downward. The executive stunned the market on Friday by announcing a U-turn in his corporate strategy, abandoning plans to split into two and giving up on a joint venture with Tata Steel Ltd. The company is still reeling from a chaotic 2018, when the top leadership resigned and activist investors mounted a fight to overhaul the business.
It’s time “to hit the reset button,” Kerkhoff said on Friday.
Adjusted earnings before interest and tax fell almost 30% to 685 million euros ($769 million) for the six months ending March 31, Thyssenkrupp said in a statement on Tuesday. Even earnings at the elevator division, the crown jewel asset that the company plans to take public, were lower than last year.
Other red flags include figures that show the company is burning through cash and debt levels have soared.
For the German business industry as a whole, Thyssenkrupp is another example of how escalating trade tensions are hurting the country’s export-led economy. The European Commission last week cut its growth forecasts for Germany and BMW AG said that the economic backdrop is “increasingly challenging” and business conditions are expected to remain volatile.

648,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 01:33AM ET</span>",Members only: U.S. retailers revamp loyalty schemes for Amazon era,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - With private fitting rooms, members-only stores and clever apps, U.S. department stores are reinventing their old and tested loyalty programs to fend off the challenge from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online rivals.
Over the past two years, major U.S. retailers, including Macy's, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Kohls Corp and others, have spent billions of dollars to overhaul existing programs or launch new loyalty schemes. 
According to estimates compiled by market intelligence firm Beroe, the U.S. loyalty program market was worth between $47 billion and $55 billion in 2018 in terms of spending by companies and sector analysts expect it to keep growing by 2 percent to 4 percent a year between 2018-2020.
Data from research firm LoyaltyOne showed retailers now invest at least 2 percent of their total revenue on loyalty programs and double that or more on related customer targeting and analytics. Department stores and apparel retailers typically invest more than the others. 
Its report ""Loyalty Big Picture"" based on an international survey of 1,200 loyalty plan providers and some 4,500 members said 69 percent of executives reported a rise in spending on royalty schemes over the past two years, and 55 percent expected a further increase in investment in the next two years.
Around in some form for over a century, loyalty programs have long relied on a simple concept - reward shoppers with coupons, discounts, prizes or air miles and they will come back.
E-commerce has changed that.
It has made shopping around for bargains easier than ever while Amazon's Prime program set a new benchmark with perks, such as free two-day shipping, video streaming or cloud storage.
Just last month, Amazon raised the stakes again announcing it would spend $800 million to ensure one-day delivery for its Prime members. 
""In the age of Amazon, it's very much 'what have you done for me lately type of retail environment',"" Matt Lindner, senior ecommerce analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel.
""The challenge these retailers are facing is how do you offer attractive rewards without totally compromising your bottom line."" 
Realizing that expensive advertising is unlike to win back shoppers lost to online rivals, traditional retailers have shifted their focus to retaining existing customers and making them spend more, industry analysts say.
'BIGGEST AND BADDEST'
Those most successful have employed sophisticated data gathering and analytics to better tailor offers to customers' tastes while providing perks that Amazon cannot match, such as private dressing rooms, members-only stores or beauty workshops.
""Retailers are finally realizing that they need to respond to the 'biggest and baddest' loyalty program in the market right now and that is Amazon Prime,"" research firm Gartner director Tom Gehani said. 
They have done so over the past five years by combining revamped loyalty schemes with increased online presence, in-store pickup for online purchases, upgraded stores and new or improved mobile apps that tie in with loyalty programs.
Macy's, for example, relaunched its scheme in mid-2017 after 10 straight quarters of comparable sales declines as a tiered plan with special privileges to its most loyal and big spending customers. The perks include ticketed seats to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade sales, concerts, fashion shows and cooking classes.
When a year later, Macy's reported third quarter 2018 earnings that nearly doubled Wall Street's predictions, the department store chain attributed some of the growth to its ""Star Rewards"" program. 
""The program is outperforming our expectation,"" Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gennette said in February. 
Rival Nordstrom redesigned its customer loyalty program, ""The Nordy Club"", in October 2018. It offers more reward points, fast redemptions, curbside pickup of purchases, and perks such as beauty and style workshops or brands not available to other shoppers. Today, the program's 11 million members account for a third of Nordstrom's customers and over half of its sales.
Members can also save items in an app that will send push notifications to remind them of their wish list once they get close enough to a Nordstrom store.
Only three or four years ago the retailer would spend most of its advertising dollars on seasonal campaigns, said Sean Claessen, executive vice president of Bond Brand Loyalty.
""You are now seeing them turn their attention to the 'Nordy Club' and those kind of components,"" he said.
Brand retailers have also joined the fray.
J Crew launched its first rewards program in July 2018 with free shipping and exclusive sales and offers, while  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) has a members-only floor at its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. 
Members of its no-fee NikePlus program get free courier delivery for purchases at the store, exclusive access to in-demand shoes and one-on-one assessments by its experts.
""My favorite perks would be the fact that they can reserve a pair of sneakers for you, also exclusive wear where you can only get it if you’re a member and birthday discounts,"" said Carlos Pena, 23, a college student from New York City. Pena said he bought a pair of sneakers for his 22th birthday using the program's discount.
In December, Lululemon said it was testing its first ever annual membership program for $128 with perks such as access to workout classes, free shipping and a pair of yoga pants.

""The standards of what it takes to win and keep customers are just going to keep getting higher,"" Gartner's Gehani said. ""Amazon is a company that has risen to meet that challenge and every other retailer is learning that they need to continually rise to meet that challenge too.""

649,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 01:08AM ET</span>","China stocks stumble on tariff escalation, state buying seen","By Noah Sin and Luoyan Liu
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stocks fell on Tuesday as the tariff war between Washington and Beijing escalated though losses were contained after conciliatory comments from U.S. President Donald Trump and amid suspected state-backed buying of equities.
Both the Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI300 opened down 1%, but recovered some of these losses, aided, according to some analysts, by ""national team"" purchases.
Zhang Qi, analyst at Haitong Securities, said there was ""buying of key stocks"" by state-backed players, noting that ""volume in morning trade is close to half of yesterday's full session"".
Earlier, Trump said he is holding fire on taxing the remaining $325 billion of Chinese goods, and announced that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in June, reigniting hopes for an agreement to end the tariff tussle.
His comments came after China announced on Monday higher tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods, effective June 1, in retaliation for Washington's decision last week to hike its own levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports.
By midday, the Shanghai benchmark was down 0.4%, while the blue-chip CSI 300 index was down 0.2%. The smaller Shenzhen market was down 0.5%.
CSI300's sub-indexes for the financial sector was up 0.1%, the consumer staples sector was down 0.1%, healthcare shares slid 0.5% and real estate stocks lost 0.4%.
The start-up ChiNext board fell 0.3% despite MSCI confirming it would include part of the board in its benchmark emerging market index.
""The implementation of the new tariffs are (almost) three weeks away from now, and the talks have not collapsed,"" Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong, said of the quick recovery in A-shares. ""People are also speculating whether China will roll out more policy support measures.""
Sticking points in Sino-U.S. negotiations remain, with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow arguing for ""very strong"" enforcement provisions in an eventual deal, and Beijing insisting that it would not swallow any ""bitter fruit"" that harmed its interests.
The Hong Kong stock market, returning from a holiday, shed 1.6% in its first reaction to the tariff retaliation.
Foreign investors took money off the table via the Stock Connect, also closed on Monday, selling a net 7.4 billion yuan ($1.08 billion) worth of A-shares on Tuesday. They have sold more than 20 billion yuan worth of mainland shares via the Connect so far this month, snapping a five-month buying streak. 
In the currency market, the offshore yuan climbed on Trump's comments, rebounding from a four-month low in early trade to 6.8933, up 0.28% on the day, while the onshore yuan firmed over 0.1% against the greenback to 6.8724. [FRX/]
""The market desperately wants to believe in a deal and takes any headline to ignite renewed optimism,"" said a Hong Kong-based FX sales banker at an international lender.
Prior to the onshore market open, the People's Bank of China set its midpoint at its weakest in four months, after the currency wiped out its year-to-date gains on Monday. But traders said the fix was still higher than market expectations.

650,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Walmart fights back against Amazon with one-day shipping in some U.S. markets,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc is stepping up its battle with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) by offering one-day delivery without a shipping fee, weeks after Amazon announced a similar offer - a move that will intensify the race to deliver orders to shoppers faster.
On April 25, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club Prime in just one day and expects to spend $800 million toward the shipping goal in the second quarter alone.
Walmart's offer applies to fewer products. As many as 220,000 items, which are the most frequently purchased, ranging from laundry detergent to toys and electronics will qualify for one-day shipping. The orders have to be worth at least $35 to qualify.
The Walmart deal will be available to online shoppers in Phoenix and Las Vegas and then expand to Southern (NYSE:SO) California in the coming days, the head of its U.S. ecommerce service, Marc Lore, told Reuters in an interview. 
The service will be rolled out gradually, with a plan to reach approximately 75% of the U.S. population this year, which includes 40 of the top 50 U.S. metro areas, Lore said.
One-day shipping marks the latest salvo in a fight between two retailers that have consistently tried to outdo each other in everything from online order delivery to grabbing a bigger share of the online grocery market.
Walmart started offering same-day pickup in its stores in 2011 and caught up with Amazon's two-day free shipping two years ago by offering it without a membership fee. It has made progress in closing the gap with its e-commerce rival by rolling out services such as curbside grocery pickup and same-day grocery delivery - options that have quickly become popular with shoppers.
Amazon, on the other hand, has hastened to reproduce the assets of brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart and has a mixed record with those projects. It is now racing to open shops with top-selling items ranging from books to cell phones; rolling out same-day curbside grocery pickup and gearing up to accept returns at all U.S. Kohls Corp department stores.
""We have been working on this since I have gotten here...we have been building out the infrastructure for the last few years to support this,"" said Lore, who joined the retailer in 2016 when it acquired his company, Jet.com.
The vast majority of the order volume for such a service comes from the ""first couple of hundred thousand"" products, he said.
The move will cost Walmart less as orders will be delivered from warehouses closer to the customer and arrive in a single box instead of multiple packages, Lore said.
""It is counter-intuitive... but the way we have structured our network, we will see improved profitability as a result of lower shipping cost,"" he said.
Walmart sends out boxes from multiple warehouses around the country under its two-day shipping program, but with one-day shipping, it is stocking inventory in the closest single warehouse to the shopper, Lore said.
In a note on Monday, investment bank UBS anticipated a move to one-day shipping from brick-and-mortar retailers and estimated the price tag. 
""The bottom line is that these costs are pretty manageable,"" the note says.
Walmart will put down $215 million of incremental investment. The U.S. business could see a drag on operating margins of 5 basis points on an annualized basis and 3 basis points for Walmart overall over a similar period if they follow Amazon's one-day shipping offer, the note says.
Lore told Reuters the math in the note was not accurate. 

He also said the recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports will not hurt demand as most are best-sellers and popular items that shoppers will keep buying even if prices rise.

As of last Friday, Game for Peace was the most downloaded free game and top grossing game in Apple’s China App Store.
Tencent decided to take down PUBG and replace it with Game for Peace, a largely identical but more sanitized version of the game, after the company waited for more than a year for approval to monetize the mobile version of a global blockbuster title.

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both down 0.3% by 11:00 AM ET (03:00 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 1.5%. The city’s stock market was closed Monday for a holiday.

The order, agreed to by the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Probation Officer, awaits U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup's signature. 
He is also overseeing PG&E's probation stemming from a felony conviction over a deadly 2010 natural gas pipeline in San Bruno, California, that destroyed a neighborhood and killed eight people.
The judge last week called for PG&E officials to tour Paradise town. November's Camp Fire leveled the town and killed more than 80 people, marking the most destructive and deadliest wildfire in California's modern history.
The Camp Fire also pushed San Francisco-based PG&E to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in the expectation of, potentially, billions of dollars in liabilities. PG&E has said it expects its equipment may be found to have sparked the blaze.
The proposed order also requires PG&E's chief executive and board to visit San Bruno to meet with victims of the 2010 explosion there as well as city officials and firefighters.

656,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Stocks Catch Up With Global Rout as Trump Softens Blow,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong stocks fell as the city reacted to the latest wave of declines across the globe.
The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.3% as of 10:34 a.m. local time, while a gauge tracking Chinese companies declined 1.4%. The city’s equity market, which was shut Monday for a holiday, has been relatively resilient to this month’s rapid correction onshore and worsening trade relations between the U.S. and China. The Hang Seng benchmark is now down 5.1% for May. China’s CSI 300 Index rose 0.4% Tuesday.
Beijing retaliated late Monday with higher tariffs on a range of American goods, spurring a 2.4% loss in the S&P 500 Index. As a global financial center with no limits on capital flows, Hong Kong is vulnerable to worsening ties between the two nations and usually does badly during a wave of risk-off sentiment. A weak yuan also weighs on earnings for Chinese heavyweights listed in the city.
Softening the impact on Tuesday were comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that he thinks talks with China will be “very successful.” The offshore yuan, which on Monday weakened past 6.9 per dollar for the first time this year, strengthened to 6.8885 per dollar.
“Investors are not yet in panic mode, since there’s still room for an agreement on trade,” said Steven Leung, a Hong Kong-based executive director at Uob Kay Hian (Hong Kong) Ltd. “The uncertainty is enough to keep investors nervous. Hong Kong is catching up.”
Below are five charts showing the strain that’s building in Hong Kong shares.
A slump in China’s currency tends to weigh on Hong Kong’s equities.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) last year estimated that members of the Hang Seng Index generate about 60% of their earnings in yuan. The offshore rate had weakened for six straight days through Monday, taking its decline in May to about 2.4% against the dollar.
The Hong Kong benchmark fell below its 100-day moving average on Tuesday, which served as a support for the gauge in the past two years. Failure to stay above the key level over the next few days could fuel more sell-offs, according to Uob Kay Hian’s Leung.
Short selling turnover in Hong Kong’s main board has been increasing since early May. It accounted for about 15% of total turnover in the city on Friday, the highest in more than two weeks.
The Hang Seng gauge is showing its strongest downward momentum since a sell-off in October, according to a technical indicator known as the directional movement index. The measure -- a tool to assess price direction and strength -- also shows a widening gap between the Hang Seng index’s bullish momentum (in green) and bearish momentum (in red).
Another momentum indicator also points to further declines in Hong Kong. The moving average convergence divergence line -- which in April triggered a bearish signal -- fell even further last week to turn negative. It has also started to decouple from the Hang Seng Index, a pattern known as a “bearish divergence.”

657,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>",Indonesia First in Asia to Erase This Year's Stock Market Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- Indonesian equities slumped Monday, erasing this year’s gains, as foreign funds pulled out of the local market. With almost every other Asian market still in the green, it is now the first in Asia to lose the rally it posted earlier this year.
The Jakarta Composite Index fell 1.2% Monday, extending its decline after three weeks of losses as concerns surrounding the escalating U.S.-China trade war hit markets across Asia. The wider-than-expected first quarter current account deficit reported Friday added to the wall of worry. Malaysia’s FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index didn’t partake in the global rally and swung between gains and losses earlier this year. The benchmark index has lost almost 7% this year.
“What happened was a mix of several factors, from global to domestic,” John Teja, a director at Ciptadana Sekuritas, said by phone. He pointed to the continuation of the U.S.-China trade rift, concerns surrounding Indonesia’s macroeconomic fundamentals and a volatile currency.
Foreign investors sold a net $260 million of Indonesian stocks in the past six days, the biggest weekly outflows since February. Investors withdrew about $87 million from the iShares MSCI Indonesia ETF last week, the biggest outflows since at least 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI Indonesia ETF dropped 3.5% Monday in the U.S., its steepest decline since Oct. 24
Earlier this year, Indonesia’s benchmark index came close to hitting a fresh record high after rallying almost 6% amid falling oil prices and central banks’ dovish stances. That came to a halt when the 2018 current account deficit widened to a four-year high, raising concerns about the shortfall weighing on the nation’s economy.
Indonesia’s current-account deficit makes the country more reliant on foreign investment and therefore vulnerable to outflows when investor sentiment turns sour. Market watchers are often fixated on whether the deficit, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, widens or not to determine an economy’s vulnerability.
Hopes for an interest rate cut may have cooled. Market watchers had previously expected that the central bank may have room to start easing its monetary policy in the second half of this year.
Election Results
“There isn’t much that we can do unfortunately, but obviously, all eyes will be on May 22,” Harry Su, managing director and head of equity capital markets at Samuel International, said by phone, citing the date of official election results. “We have to get over that domestically. If things are safe and nothing happens, that would be the first big hurdle we overcome, he added.
Thousands of people rallied in Jakarta on Friday to protest the preliminary results of last month’s presidential election that show Joko Widodo has won a second term as president. The rally came as presidential challenger Prabowo Subianto continues to dispute the result of the April 17 vote. The government as well as independent observers have rejected the former general’s allegations of widespread voter fraud.
The incoming government will have to implement sound policies related to labor and investment reforms, Su said. “The market will take its cue from that,” he added.
Rupiah
The escalating trade tensions has impacted the yuan and in turn has hurt the sentiment on Indonesia’s currency. The rupiah fell to a four-month low last week.
“Further tariff imposition on the remaining of $300 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S. will definitely weaken the yuan and hurt sentiment on other markets including Indonesia,” Jeffrosenberg Tan, a strategist at Sinarmas Sekuritas, said by text message. “This may create further downside risks on both equity and bond markets.”
“It’s a bit difficult to see a sudden reversal of the stock market in the short term because of a lack of positive catalysts globally and domestically,” Chandra Pasaribu, head of research at Yuanta Securities, said by phone.
Pasaribu expects the nation’s stock market to rebound in the second half of this year with the caveat that global risks have to be settled.

(Reuters) - A California jury on Monday awarded more than $2 billion to a couple who claimed Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused their cancer, in the largest U.S. jury verdict to date against the company in litigation over the chemical.
The large punitive damages award is likely to be reduced due to U.S. Supreme Court rulings that limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9:1. The jury awarded a total of $2 billion in punitive damages and $55 million in compensatory damages.
It was the third consecutive U.S. jury verdict against the company in litigation over the chemical, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) last year. Both other jury verdicts also came in California, one in state court and one in federal court.
The jury in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland on Monday said the company was liable for plaintiffs Alva and Alberta Pilliod's contracting non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a spokeswoman for the couple said.
It awarded $18 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to Alva Pilliod, and $37 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to his wife, Alberta Pilliod. The jury found Roundup had been defectively designed, that the company failed to warn of the herbicide's cancer risk and that the company acted negligently.
The German chemicals giant faces more than 13,400 U.S. lawsuits over the herbicide's alleged cancer risk. 
The next jury trial in the glyphosate litigation is scheduled for August in Missouri state court, the first time a jury outside of California will hear a Roundup case. The trial will take place in St. Louis County, where Monsanto's former headquarters are located.
Bayer in a statement on Monday said it was disappointed with the verdict and will appeal. A spokesman called the jury's decision ""excessive and unjustifiable."" 
The company said both Alva and Alberta Pilliod had long histories of illnesses known to be substantial risk factors for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
""The contrast between today's verdict and (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's) conclusion that there are 'no risks to public health from the current registered uses of glyphosate' could not be more stark,"" Bayer said.
Bayer says that decades of studies by the company and independent scientists have shown glyphosate and Roundup to be safe for human use. Bayer also points to several regulators around the world that found that glyphosate was not carcinogenic to humans.
Brent Wisner, a lawyer for the Pilliods, at a news conference following the verdict said Bayer had to take responsibility for its product.
""Monsanto keeps denying that it causes cancer and these two fine people here are casualties of that deception,"" Wisner said, standing next to the California couple, who are in their 70s.
Alberta Pilliod called on Bayer to add a warning label to Roundup, saying she and her husband would not have used the product had it alerted them to a cancer risk. ""We've been fighting cancer for more than nine years now and we can't do any of the things we wanted to do. We really resent Monsanto for that,"" Pilliod said.
The prior two jury verdicts against Bayer in U.S. Roundup trials triggered steep declines in Bayer shares.
A San Francisco state court jury in August 2018 awarded $289 million to a California groundskeeper, finding Monsanto's glyphosate-based weed killers caused his cancer. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.
In March, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $80 million to another California man after finding Roundup caused his cancer. The company also said it would appeal that decision.
Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, on Monday said it was too early to speculate about a potential settlement of the litigation by Bayer.
""The legal questions on appeal in the previous two cases will ultimately inform how this litigation proceeds,"" Zimmerman said. It also remains to be seen how juries in other part of the country react to the evidence in upcoming trials, he said.
Shareholders have rebuked the company's top management over its handling of the Monsanto acquisition and the litigation it inherited, which has wiped around 30 billion euros ($33.68 billion) from Bayer's market value since the first jury verdict.
The Pilliods allege the regular use of Roundup on their property between 1975 and 2011 caused them to develop cancers of the lymph system. 
They filed their lawsuit in 2017 after being diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and 2015, respectively. Both of them are currently in remission, but their trial had been expedited due to the risk of a relapse and potentially short life expectancy.
Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that Monsanto had known about the herbicide's cancer risk for decades, but failed to warn consumers and instead attempted to influence scientists and regulators to receive favorable assessments of its products. Bayer denies those allegations.
Lawsuits are largely based on a 2015 conclusion by the World Health Organization's cancer arm, which classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
A 2017 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/article/us-who-iarc-glyphosate-specialreport/in-glyphosate-review-who-cancer-agency-edited-out-non-carcinogenic-findings-idUSKBN1CO251 found that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer had dismissed and edited out ""non-carcinogenic"" findings that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer.
The U.S. EPA, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans.

660,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>",Economists See U.S.-China Trade War Worsening Before 2019 Accord,"(Bloomberg) -- Economists expect the trade war between the world’s two largest economies to get worse before it gets better -- culminating in a deal by year-end.
President Donald Trump on Friday increased tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods and the Asian nation retaliated, prompting traders to price in a U.S. interest-rate cut this year and sending global stocks plunging. A Bloomberg News survey on Monday showed a majority of 40 economists see Trump following through on his threat to impose additional 25% tariffs on all remaining imports from China, with a plurality expecting those higher levies by the third quarter.

“Both sides want a deal but there will be more escalation and more tension before they get a deal,” said David Sloan, senior economist at Continuum Economics, who sees a trade deal reached this year and higher tariffs imposed by the third quarter.
“It is in the economic interest of both sides to reach a deal,” Sloan said. “This will hit the U.S. economy significantly and probably the Chinese economy even more.”
Underscoring that sentiment, Trump on Monday warned China against taking steps to substantially retaliate. He also said he’s planning to meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping at next month’s Group of 20 summit, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin signaled that talks are better than markets assumed. Bloomberg’s survey concluded just as the U.S. Trade Representative’s office released a list of about $300 billion of Chinese goods including toys and phones that Trump has threatened with a 25% tariff.
Overall, the trade war is increasing the chances of an even worse scenario. Four-fifths of economists surveyed say that higher tariffs heighten the risk of a recession in the U.S. by the end of next year. While first-quarter economic growth blew past estimates, the expansion is forecast to cool as the boost from tax cuts wears off and global demand slows. That kind of scenario -- tariffs dragging down already-weaker growth -- could encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, according to almost half of the respondents.

661,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 09:15PM ET</span>",Latest Mexico decisions on Pemex neutral for credit rating: S&P,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The financial package announced by the Mexican government on Monday and an earlier decision to have state oil company Pemex build a new refinery are neutral to Standard & Poor's assessment of Pemex's creditworthiness, the rating agency said on Monday.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced measures designed to help Pemex with its debt load by renewing credit lines with three banks, as well as plans to gradually reduce the company's tax burden.
Luis Manuel Martinez, a sector specialist at S&P, one of the three main rating agencies that investors rely on for guidance when making investments, said the measures changed neither its assessment of the Mexican sovereign rating nor that of Pemex.
""The announcement that the government made today – and I would say even the announcement that was made last week on the new refinery project – both of them are neutral to the rating,"" Martinez said in an interview.
S&P in March cut its standalone assessment of Pemex to ""B-"" from ""BB-"" on what it said were growing concerns that the support pledged by the government was not enough.
It also cut Pemex's outlook to negative from stable, while keeping its global investment grade rating at ""BBB+,"" in line with that of the Mexican government.
Martinez said it was too early to make predictions for another downgrade.
""We have identified certain downside risks on economic activity, which also puts pressure on the sovereign rating,"" he said. ""With respect to the sovereign rating, it's premature to have a strong case for a downgrade down the road.""
The Dos Bocas refinery, slated to be built on the Gulf coast for $8 billion, is one of Lopez Obrador's top priorities.
The president said last week that Pemex and the energy ministry would oversee construction of the refinery because private companies could not meet his budget or deadline.
Investors and ratings agencies have repeatedly raised concerns that it would divert funds from Pemex's more profitable exploration and production business.
Ratings agency Moody's said on Monday the project would likely far exceed the government's budget because of its ""limited know-how.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in Asia extended losses on Tuesday following sharp falls on Wall Street overnight, the yen strengthened and U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower as the trade war between China and the United States escalated.
In early trade on Tuesday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.4%, touching its lowest level since Feb. 15.
Australian shares were down 1.2% while Japan's Nikkei stock index slid 1.9%.
U.S. S&P 500 e-mini stock futures were flat near seven-week lows.
China on Monday announced it would impose higher tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods following Washington's decision last week to hike its own levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office also said it planned to hold a public hearing next month on the possibility of imposing duties of up to 25% on a further $300 billion worth of imports from China.
The tariff escalation has rattled global markets, even as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.38% to 25,324.99, the S&P 500 lost 2.41% to 2,811.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.41% to 7,647.02.
As investors flocked to safe-haven assets, U.S. Treasury yields remained near six-week lows early on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 2.3962% compared with a U.S. close of 2.405% on Monday.
The two-year yield, which rises with traders' expectations of higher Fed fund rates, ticked down to 2.1782% from a U.S. close of 2.193%, with data from CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) showing a more than 75 percent chance of the Fed cutting rates by the end of 2019.
Underscoring market concerns over the economic impact of the trade war, 10-year yields remained below those on three-month Treasury bills. A sustained inversion of this part of the yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
On Monday, some traders had been concerned that China, the largest foreign U.S. creditor, could dump Treasuries to counter the Trump administration's hardening trade stance. But most analysts downplayed such a possibility.
""If China did start to (sell Treasuries) it will galvanize both side of politics in the U.S. against China and the Fed would be sent into the market to buy bonds,"" Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro said in a note to clients.
""That would expand its balance sheet but it would allow it to neutralize China's efforts to disturb US financial markets. So I doubt they'll try to sell Treasuries.""
The dollar dropped 0.1% against the yen to 109.20 .
The single currency was up 0.1% on the day at $1.1234, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly lower at 97.285.
Worries over an escalating trade war also hit commodity markets, sending U.S. crude down 0.11% to $60.97 a barrel. Brent crude was off 0.3 percent at $70.01 per barrel.

664,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 08:20PM ET</span>",What's at stake for Europe Inc in a trade spat with Washington,"By Josephine Mason and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's listed companies are expected to generate 1.2 trillion euros (£1.04 trillion) in revenue from the United States this year, highlighting what's at stake as global trade tensions grow and earnings and economic growth stall.
Analysts and investors say that based on revenues, European companies are more vulnerable to a dispute than their competitors in the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump is due to decide by Saturday whether to impose duties on car imports, potentially posing another significant threat to global growth and denting Europe's prized auto sector.
Washington's renewed tensions with Beijing may distract Trump and delay a decision beyond the May 18 deadline, or he may crank up his protectionist push with a global trade war on two fronts.
Last month, he also threatened to impose tariffs on hundreds of European goods, from cheese to ski suits, worth $11 billion.
The impact on Europe's top firms could be profound -- with slowing economic growth and some countries like Italy struggling with bulging budget deficits, the region may not be as resilient to a prolonged dispute as China has so far proven.
In the past six months, the Chinese government has launched stimulus measures from tax cuts to boosting lending to shore up the world's No. 2 economy as the trade spat rumbles on.
""I'm much more concerned about trade for Europe than I am for China,"" said Christophe Donay, head of asset allocation at Pictet Wealth Management. 
According to Europe's top asset manager Amundi Asset Management, U.S sales average about 20% of MSCI Europe companies' aggregate turnover, while European sales average about 14% of turnover for companies in MSCI's U.S. share index, 
For an interactive version of the below graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2VGtZSu.
AUTOS AND TECH
Typically, Europe's carmakers are considered particularly vulnerable to Trump's protectionism. 
A 25% tariff could result in a 0.2-0.3 percentage point loss of export revenue and GDP for Germany, according to an analysis by Moody's. The United States accounts for 13% of Germany's car exports, the ratings agency has said. 
Measured by revenue, there's a lot at stake for companies like Fiat Chrysler with $45.3 billion in U.S. revenues. But many, like Fiat, have their own U.S. production plants, sheltering them slightly from any outright tariffs.

Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office of UBS Global Wealth Management, said she would expect the technology, energy and industrial sectors to be worst-hit by any further antagonism.
Average European company exposure to the United States in those sectors ranges from 10 to 20% in terms of sales, compared with 33% for healthcare.
UBS is underweight consumer discretionary in the euro zone, which includes autos, partly because of the trade tariffs.
""The market is nervous about it and last year (the U.S.-China spat) escalated more than people expected and the effect on the market was bigger than people had anticipated,"" she said.
HEALTHCARE EXPOSED
Of pan-European STOXX 600 index companies, those in healthcare have the highest revenue exposure on average. 
An analysis by Refinitiv based on companies' estimates of 2019 revenue shows they draw some 133.3 billion euros in revenue from the world's No. 1 economy and top drug market. 
For an interactive version of the below chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2WwCixg.
While healthcare has not been implicated in the tit-for-tat between Washington and Brussels so far, some investors worry about the potential fall-out from souring relations between the two economic powerhouses.
""As these sectors are in normal times regarded as defensive, they may doubly disappoint if the U.S. and Europe also engage in a tariff war,"" said Ibra Wane, equity strategist at Amundi, in a note this week.
The European healthcare index has risen 8% since the late December low, underperforming most other industries and lagging behind an 11% rise in the benchmark STOXX 600.
Pharma and medical equipment companies from BTG to BB Biotech and Fresenius Medical Care are among the most exposed individual companies, with 67-90% of total sales derived from the United States.
Capital goods companies Ashtead (LON:AHT) and Ferguson are also high up on the list, with more than 80% of their sales made to the United States.

665,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Budweiser’s Asian IPO Passes the Taste Test,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s Asian business has a potent brew to offer investors.
Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd. filed on Friday to sell shares in Hong Kong, in what may be the city’s biggest initial public offering of the year. AB InBev is targeting a July listing for the unit that could raise at least $5 billion, Crystal Tse and Daniela Wei of Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Partakers will get a share of a business that has a lock on the most lucrative segment of the world’s biggest beer market, China, as well as ranking first in its next two biggest markets: Australia and South Korea. That’s helped to make Budweiser Brewing the region’s biggest beer seller and a highly profitable operation.
All beers aren’t created equal in China. At one end of the market, some brands are so low-margin that in the recent past they could be cheaper than water. Premium brands, on the other hand, can be big money-spinners — and Budweiser Brewing’s namesake beer is considered a high-end brand in China. AB InBev sells more Budweiser in China than in the U.S. these days.
By volume, the country’s top-selling brand is Snow, made by China Resources Beer Holdings Co. By value, though, Budweiser Brewing leads. In the premium and super-premium segment, the AB InBev unit has 46.6 percent of the market, more than triple the share of its nearest rival, Tsingtao Brewery Co.
Super-premium beer in China sells for 11.6 times the price of “value” beer, compared with 6.1 times in India and 1.6 times in Australia, according to Budweiser Brewing’s IPO filing. Rising incomes are spurring demand for expensive foreign brews among China’s urban consumers. Besides the iconic American brand, the company’s stable of premium beers includes Stella Artois, Corona and Hoegaarden.
That’s helped translate into an operating profit margin of 33 percent for 2018, based on normalized earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. China Resources Beer had an Ebitda margin of 12.5 percent last year and Tsingtao’s was 12.4 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A key motivation for the listing is to help AB InBev reduce its $110 billion debt pile. Investors in Budweiser Brewing will hold shares in a less leveraged business that’s in a faster-growing region. The unit had total debt of $2.75 billion as of March 31 and a ratio of net debt to normalized Ebitda of 0.3 at the end of last year, according to the filing. Parent AB InBev had net debt equal to 4.8 times Ebitda as of Dec. 31, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
As a listed company, Budweiser Brewing will also gain an acquisition currency for expansion. It may need it. Competition in China is increasing, after Heineken NV struck a $3.1 billion partnership deal with China Resources Beer in October. Changing consumer tastes are also a perennial threat: The AB InBev unit has been buying up local craft brewers that are gaining popularity among younger drinkers.
That’s also a factor in Australia, where lower- and no-alcohol beers may help to combat the trend of “mindful drinking” that’s caused consumption in the U.S. to decline. Australia, where Budweiser Brewing’s brands include Victoria Bitter, is an outsize profit contributor, yielding 20 percent of the company’s 2018 revenue but 31 percent of Ebit, according to research from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
The company may want to bulk up in Southeast Asia, where populations are young and consumption is rising. The challenge will be getting its hands on the strongest brands. Take Vietnam, where Budweiser Brewing’s market share is less than 1% and Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp. is the biggest brewer. Offering Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi equity in Budweiser Brewing in exchange for his Sabeco stake may prove more alluring than cash. A similar deal could work for San Miguel Corp.’s beer operations in the Philippines.
The biggest threat to the IPO may be the trade war. Selling America’s most famous beer brand may be less of an asset if relations between China and the U.S. continue to worsen. Any change in U.S. policy that causes partners to limit their trade with the U.S. could have a “material adverse effect on our business,” Budweiser Brewing notes. A cooling global IPO market could also undermine demand for the sale, after Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. flopped on its New York trading debut last Friday.
For now, though, AB InBev’s Asian glass is looking half full.

666,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 07:25PM ET</span>",Long fight over error in JPMorgan loan to GM settles for $231 million,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Lenders and hundreds of investors agreed on Monday to pay $231 million to end their decade-long legal fight over a clerical error in a $1.5 billion loan to General Motors (NYSE:GM) that was administered by JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), according to court documents.
The settlement payment will benefit the unsecured creditors of General Motors' 2009 bankruptcy, as well as the U.S. and Canadian governments, which helped finance GM's Chapter 11 case.
The unsecured creditors, who collected pennies on the dollar from GM's bankruptcy, have been trying for years to recoup some of the $1.5 billion that was paid to GM's secured lenders.
The $1.5 billion loan was syndicated to hundreds of investors who were defendants in the lawsuit. The individual settlement contributions by JPMorgan, a law firm that handled the paperwork and the investors in the loan were not disclosed in court documents.
JPMorgan declined to comment.
The dispute stemmed from the unintentional release of a lien on GM equipment due to a paperwork error.
At the end of 2008, the automaker was preparing to pay off a $300 million financing. The law firm handling the paperwork accidentally included a lien that secured the $1.5 billion loan in the list of security interests it terminated after the $300 million was repaid.
Releasing the lien rendered part of the loan unsecured, allowing a trustee working for unsecured creditors of GM to try to claw the money back.
The mistake did not invalidate all liens securing the $1.5 billion loan, and the parties have spent years disputing whether GM assets such as robots and conveyor belts secured loan.

GM's predecessor filed for bankruptcy in 2009, beset by a deep U.S. recession, an enormous debtload, high labor costs and outdated car models.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are losing faith that a U.S.-China trade deal could happen soon and are bracing their portfolios for a more prolonged battle that could hamper global growth.
An escalation in recent days in the long-running trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies has stoked fears of a global economic slowdown, causing a sell-off in stocks led by trade-sensitive names and a move into low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries and gold.
China on Monday said it would impose tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on 5,140 U.S. products on a target list worth about $60 billion from June 1, striking back after the United States raised duties last week.
Investors have begun to adjust their investment outlooks to factor in more uncertainty on the trade front, at least for the near term.
""You're seeing see a move toward more defensive companies and companies that can still deliver cash flow and dividends,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. These adjustments will continue after Monday, she said. ""There's more to this.""
Among concerns for stock investors, a collapse of U.S.-China trade discussions could hurt the earnings outlook. Investors expect tariffs could lift corporate costs and lower profit margins, while continued uncertainty surrounding a trade deal will hinder the ability of companies to plan or make capital expenditures.
The sudden change in sentiment could cause some investors to move to cash as well, some strategists said. 
""I wouldn't be surprised if some people are raising cash too,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""The market is starting to realize the situation is as bad as it could be.""
Optimism that the United States was close to a trade deal with China had been one of the pillars of this year's stock market rally. The S&P 500 returned to record highs in recent weeks and is still up 12.2% since Dec. 31. 
Investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates for now and that the economy will remain stable have supported stocks as well and kept trade relatively calm.
Market volatility has jumped. After months of calm in U.S. stocks, the Cboe Volatility Index, a widely followed options-based barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks, last week hit its highest close since January. The index jumped again on Monday.
Within stocks, the hardest hit have been companies that rely heavily on global trade. 
Technology, the stock market's leader so far this year, was the day's worst-performing sector, falling 3.7%, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) were among the S&P 500's biggest drags.
At the same time, the S&P 500 utilities index rose 1.1% and the real estate index was flat. 
While the S&P 500 fell 2.4% on Monday in its biggest daily percentage loss since Jan. 3, U.S. Treasury yields dropped to six-week lows.
Ten-year yields fell below those on three-month Treasury bills. A sustained inversion of this part of the yield curve has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
In addition to more tariffs, traders are concerned China, the largest foreign U.S. creditor, may dump Treasuries to counter the Trump administration's hardening trade stance. 
Such a move would send U.S. borrowing costs soaring, strengthen the yuan and hurt Chinese exporters.
""How low can yields go just became the operative question,"" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
Many investors remain hopeful of an eventual trade agreement, and some said the recent selling in stocks is not a big concern.
""I don't think the market is doing anything other than taking a breather,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""If there was a situation where there wasn't some type of trade deal, you would see markets much worse, and it would be across the board.""
But many are wondering how long investors will tolerate the uncertainty surrounding the talks.

""Investors have wanted to believe the best,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Yet, ""clearly this relationship is deteriorating. It's not what investors had hoped it was on Friday.""

Oil traders will be looking out for OPEC's monthly report tomorrow for a sense of supply-demand and price direction.
The cartel is expected to try and make a strong case to continue with the production cuts it has carried out since the winter as dominant member Saudi Arabia shows it isn’t in any mood to give up the current high prices on crude.
One way for OPEC to achieve its aim is to acknowledge lower production by the group due to outages in Iran, Venezuela and Libya, while forecasting higher non-OPEC supply and lower global demand for its oil.
After the bell the American Petroleum Institute will release its estimate of U.S. crude inventories. The API estimated a rise of about 2.8 million barrels last week."

673,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 05:06PM ET</span>","In setback for Apple, U.S. Supreme Court lets App Store antitrust suit proceed","By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave the go-ahead to an antitrust lawsuit accusing Apple Inc of forcing consumers to overpay for iPhone software applications, a decision that could lead to billions of dollars in damages and put at risk the company's lucrative way of selling apps. 
In a 5-4 ruling, the justices upheld a lower court's decision to allow the proposed class action lawsuit to proceed. The consumer plaintiffs claim Apple monopolized the market in violation of federal antitrust law by requiring that apps be sold through its App Store and extracting an excessive 30 percent commission on purchases.
Apple's shares fell 5.8% to $185.72. The ruling came on a day when Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) already were trading lower because of concerns over a full-blown U.S.-China trade war.
The Cupertino, California-based technology company, backed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in the case, argued that it was only acting as an agent for app developers, who set their own prices and pay Apple's commission. 
Monday's ruling, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, did not resolve the merits of the claim against Apple. But if the plaintiffs win at trial, Mark Rifkin, a lawyer representing them, said that ""the overcharges paid by consumers since Apple's monopoly began will be measured in the billions of dollars.""
In a statement, Apple said, ""We're confident we will prevail when the facts are presented and that the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric.""
The dispute hinged in part on how the justices would apply a 1977 Supreme Court precedent. In that case, the court limited damages for anti-competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others.
Kavanaugh explained from the bench that the 1977 precedent was ""not a get-out-of-court-free card for monopolistic retailers,"" an apparent allusion to the popular board game Monopoly. 
""Apple's theory would provide a roadmap for monopolistic retailers to structure transactions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade antitrust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement,"" Kavanaugh wrote in the ruling. 
Apple has said the consumers were indirect purchasers, at best, because any overcharge would be passed on to them by developers. The iPhone users who sued countered that they pay Apple - not an app developer - whenever buying an app from the App Store, and were therefore direct victims of the overcharges. 
Siding with the consumers, Kavanaugh, a conservative appointed by Trump, joined the court's four liberal justices to rule against Apple.
Dissenting from the decision, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, said the decision is ""not how antitrust law is supposed to work"" because it gives a green light to the exact type of case that the court had previously prohibited. Gorsuch also was appointed by Trump.
SERVICES BUSINESS
Apple had avoided much of the antitrust scrutiny faced by other technology firms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), largely by arguing that it does not have a dominant position in the many markets in which it operates, from smart phones and laptops to streaming music services. The lawsuit, along with complaints over App Store policies to European officials from rivals such as streaming music Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), could draw Apple into the broader public debate over the market power of large tech companies.
The legal setback for Apple comes as investors are looking to the company's services business, including its App Store, to fuel growth as iPhone sales slow. 
Rifkin said he was gratified by the court's decision, which ""reaffirmed the straightforward principle that consumers who purchase a monopolized product directly from the alleged monopolist may sue the monopolist to recover the full amount of the overcharge they are forced to pay by reason of the monopoly.""
Apple said in its statement, ""Developers set the price they want to charge for their app and Apple has no role in that. The vast majority of apps on the App Store are free and Apple gets nothing from them.""
The ruling could lead to other lawsuits against tech companies that act as platforms for other products or services. Apple had warned that this could pose a threat to e-commerce, a rapidly expanding segment of the U.S. economy worth hundreds of billions of dollars in annual sales.
The plaintiffs, including lead plaintiff Robert Pepper of Chicago, filed the suit in a California federal court in 2011, claiming Apple's monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources. They were supported by 30 state attorneys general, including from Texas, California and New York.
Apple, also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, had sought to dismiss the case, arguing the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to sue.
After a federal judge in Oakland threw out the suit, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it in 2017, finding that Apple was a distributor that sold iPhone apps directly to consumers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tanked 2.38%, the S&P 500 lost 2.41%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3.41%.
Beijing said it would raise tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. imports from June 1, prompting fears that tit-for-tat tariffs between both nations could return and hurt the world's two largest economies.
U.S.-China tariffs could shave 0.5% off China's GDP, lower U.S. GDP by 0.25% and cut global GDP by 0.15%, said Societe Generale).
In the wake of tariffs from Beijing, President Donald Trump offered investors some hope, saying he has not decided whether to put tariffs on remaining $325 billion in Chinese goods.
But that did little to boost trade-sensitive corners of the market with industrials and technology leading the steep decline in the broader market.
Industrials slumped than 3% as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), bellwethers of international trade, tumbling more than 4%.
Adding to Boeing's woes were fears aviation regulators may delay lifting bans on the aircraft maker's maligned 737 Max jets, which were recently involved in two fatal crashes, until mid to late August.
Chip stocks, meanwhile, pressured tech stocks on fears the return of the U.S.-China trade war may dent the economic recovery in China, one of the biggest semiconductor investors.
Consumer discretionaries were also down sharply, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Energy stocks also contributed to the decline, falling more than 1% after U.S. oil prices came under pressure on fears the trade war could dent demand for oil from China, the world's largest energy consumer.
In other company news, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventured into subscription television after Apple TV Channels went live.

All three major U.S. indexes lost ground in a widespread sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting its biggest one-day percentage loss this year. The S&P 500 and the Dow both had their largest percentage drop since Jan 3.
China said it would impose higher tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods despite President Donald Trump's warnings not to retaliate against additional tariffs on Chinese imports announced by the White House on Friday. The move stoked fears of a global economic downturn.
""The market's realizing that this was an absolute breakdown of (trade) talks and everything is gone backwards,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
""It could be very bad,"" O'Rourke added. ""There's a lot of uncertainty. This should lead to further slowing in the economy.""

676,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 03:54PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon rolls out machines that pack orders and replace jobs,"By Jeffrey Dastin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rolling out machines to automate a job held by thousands of its workers: boxing up customer orders.
The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years that scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelops them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.
Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.
That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.
The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task – picking up an item – is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.
For a graphic on Amazon's warehouse expansion, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WwuOKW
Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.
""We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created."" 
For an Amazon executive's Twitter post about this story, click: https:// Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market. A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world's largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles. The new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion. CMC declined to comment. Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. ""It's truly about efficiency and savings,"" one of the people said. Including other machines known as the ""SmartPac,"" which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon's technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said. The company describes this as an effort to ""re-purpose"" workers, the person said. It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs. But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said. PICKING CHALLENGE Amazon is not alone in testing CMC's packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot. Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment. Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them. Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up. Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines' accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner. Amazon has tested different vendors' technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon's experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers. Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well. These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine. Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado (LON:OCDO) Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest. But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said. The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines. This is just a harbinger of automation to come. 
""A 'lights out' warehouse is ultimately the goal,"" one of the people said.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's shares fell 12% on Monday, more than doubling their losses since the ride-hailing giant's poorly received market debut, and its chief executive officer said he expected the stock to remain under pressure in the coming months.
The fall in shares comes against the backdrop of a global stock market selloff sparked by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China.
The stock hit a low of $36.58, valuing the company at about$14 billion less than the IPO price of $45. Shares of smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), which went public at $72 a share on March 29, were down 7.3% at $47.38.
Uber's stock ""did not trade as well as we had hoped post-IPO"", Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a memo to employees that was seen by Reuters.
""Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months. But we have all the capital we need to demonstrate a path to improved margins and profits,"" Khosrowshahi added.
Bloomberg first reported the news based on the memo.
Uber lowered its valuation expectations twice in the past two months to address investor concerns over its mounting losses, and finally priced its IPO at the low end of the targeted range in a bid to avoid Lyft's stock market struggles.
Uber's market capitalization has fallen to about $61 billion since its IPO on Thursday, still larger than Wall Street heavyweights including General Motors (NYSE:GM) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX).
""In the last couple of weeks we have noticed investors questioning more about how good of a business model is ride sharing really,"" said Tom White analyst D.A. Davidson.
While both Uber and Lyft are trying to find ways to lower driver costs to become profitable, drivers went on a protest in several U.S. cities earlier this month demanding job security, livable incomes and a cap on the amount ride-hailing companies can collect from fares.
Many investors are concerned about rising costs associated with booking fees shared with drivers, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.
Morgan said this expense will only rise as the company increases sales and demand for drivers grow.
Investors have struggled to figure out how much Uber and Lyft are worth, given both companies have not estimated a timeline for turning a profit.
Lyft posted a $1.1 billion quarterly loss last week and forecast losses would peak this year as it controlled expenses and got more revenue from each customer.
Uber has warned in a regulatory filing that it may never be profitable.
Investors are questioning whether achieving profitability will require these businesses to either raise prices for consumers or reduce service levels, White said.
Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said investors need to be patient as Uber reaches full monetization potential with its ride-sharing platform and a broader growth engine with Uber Eats, Uber Freight and autonomous driving initiatives.

""While it will take time for the stock to settle and Uber must execute flawlessly over the coming 12 to 18 months, we believe a $100 billion+ market cap is warranted,"" said Arounian, who has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell to a two-year low of $225.81 before pairing some losses to trade at $226.05 at 1:09 PM ET (17:09 GMT).
Beijing announced Monday it was raising tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. imports from June 1. While the list of 5,140 goods subject to levies does not include autos, many fear the escalation in trade tensions would hurt production and manufacturing decisions within the industry.
The plunge in Tesla comes at a tumultuous time for the automaker as it faces scrutiny from Wall Street about falling vehicle deliveries.
During the first quarter Tesla reported a wider-than-expected loss after deliveries for the quarter fell short of expectations. The automaker said it was aiming to return to profitability in the third quarter and to ""significantly"" lower its loss in the second quarter."
683,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",U.S. drops plan to require vehicle brake-throttle override system,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said Monday it will drop rules first proposed in 2012 that would have required automakers to install brake-throttle override systems to prevent runaway vehicles.
The regulation was proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in response to a series of unintended sudden acceleration incidents in Toyota Motor Corp vehicles. It would have required that all motor vehicles' brakes be able to override the accelerator pedal.
The proposal was aimed at ensuring the driver could halt a vehicle by applying the brakes if a throttle pedal was trapped by a floor mat, shoe or other obstruction.
In 2012, NHTSA said some automakers had not yet made the systems standard. On Monday NHTSA said all automakers have voluntarily installed brake throttle override systems on all new vehicles and the agency does not anticipate any automakers removing the system.
But in dropping the proposed rule, NHTSA will not set braking distance requirements for the systems and other performance requirements.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Toyota, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and others, said the rule was no longer necessary.
""When the technology is in widespread use now, there is no need to continue a rulemaking,"" she said.
Brake throttle override systems work by the vehicle software cutting power to the throttle if both pedals are depressed.
NHTSA had also proposed extending its rules to require vehicles to return to idle when a driver stops pressing on the accelerator pedal or in response to a ""failsafe operation"" to include electronic throttle control systems.
On Monday, NHTSA said a ""broader understanding of safe design of vehicle electronic control systems is needed to make an informed decision on regulating return-to-idle.""
It said there were ""substantial challenges"" in designing objective tests for the operation of brake throttle override systems.
The agency in 2012 cited the August 2009 sudden acceleration crash that killed four people when a California Highway Patrol officer was driving a loaner Lexus ES350 that had the wrong floor mat installed.
Toyota recalled more than 10 million vehicles worldwide because of unintended acceleration issues in 2009 and 2010. Several government reviews found no evidence that electronic glitches were to blame for unintended acceleration — but blamed the issues on mechanical interference like floor mats.

In 2014, Toyota paid a $1.2 billion Justice Department fine after it admitted it misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about the extent of sudden acceleration problems.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Slack Technologies, the owner of a popular workplace instant messaging app, plans to go public on June 20, the company said on Monday, a test of investor appetite for loss-making technology stocks in the wake of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's underwhelming market debut.
The date could still be subject to change, Jesse Hulsing, Slack vice president of investor relations, told an investor event, which was streamed via webcast. 
Uber shares fell as much as 10% on Monday, more than doubling their losses since the ride-hailing giant's poorly received Wall Street debut last week and raising more questions about investors' faith in its ability to make profits.
Slack reported losses from operations of $143.85 million for 2018, a fraction of the $3 billion lost from operations by Uber in 2018.
San Francisco-based Slack is seeking to go public via a direct listing instead of an initial public offering (IPO), which has been the traditional route to the public markets for companies like Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Uber. 
Music streaming app Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA last year went public via a direct listing. Unlike a traditional IPO in which companies sell shares to raise proceeds, a direct listing is purely a way for existing shareholders to sell stock. 
Slack expects to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""SK"".

(Reuters) - European stocks continued their decline on Monday, on the heels of this year's biggest weekly loss, as an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war battered sentiment and prompted investors to shift into safer bets.
China said it would impose higher tariffs on most U.S. imports on a revised $60 billion target list, chilling risk appetite world over as it hit back at a tariff hike by Washington which came into force on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB] 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 1.2%, with all sub-sectors apart from utilities declining.
Germany's trade-sensitive DAX dropped 1.5%, while French shares fell 1.2%. London-traded stocks fell to a two month closing low, down 0.6%. (L)
Graham Secker, European equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said the near-term worsening in the risk-reward outlook for equity markets, amid rising trade tensions, may drive more traditional defensive sectors to outperform. 
Utilities stocks - oft-considered a defensive bet - rose 0.2%.  Centrica  Plc (LON:CNA) rose 3% as Britain's top energy supplier maintained its full-year outlook.
Oil and gas stocks dipped 0.1%, saved from a steeper fall by Brent crude futures rising following attacks on vessels off the United Arab Emirates' coast. [O/R]
Stocks of tariff-exposed auto-makers and their suppliers dived 2.7%, as all stocks on the sector index fell.
The slide on the day took the sector index from outperforming the STOXX 600 in the year to date to underperforming the broad benchmark. While the STOXX 600 has added 10.3% in 2019, auto stocks are now up 9.7%.
The telecommunications index slid 2.2% as all stocks on it fell.  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) led the decliners with a 5.2% drop.
Berenberg cuts its price target on the London-listed firm, which was reportedly going to cut its dividend to pay for auctions for mobile phone airwaves in Germany and Italy. 
Chemicals firms slid 1.3%, with polymer maker Victrex Plc diving 7.2% after warning annual growth could stall following a much weaker first half due to fewer automotive and consumer electronics contracts.
Banks slid 1.6%, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and UBS falling 2% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Talks between the German banking giant and the Swiss lender to tie up their asset management businesses have stalled, sources told Reuters, mainly over which bank would control the combined entity. 
DWS, Deutsche's asset management unit, fell 3.3% to its lowest closing level in a month and a half.

Production is expected to be implemented in Germany, one of the insiders said. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) declined to comment. The supervisory board was meeting in Berlin on the eve of the annual general meeting.
Battery cells are a key battleground in the automotive industry as it shifts to electric mobility. Currently the industry chiefly sources its requirements from Asian manufacturers.

Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess said last year the company was considering building its own solid-state battery cells, with possible serial production from 2024 or 2025.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) said on Monday its  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit, which is being investigated by French prosecutors for compiling files of influential people such as journalists in France, likely did the same across Europe, suggesting a potentially wider problem.
French prosecutors said on Friday they had opened an inquiry after newspaper Le Monde filed a complaint alleging that Monsanto - acquired by Bayer for $63 billion last year - had kept a file of 200 names, including journalists and lawmakers in hopes of influencing positions on pesticides.
On Sunday, Bayer acknowledged the existence of the files, saying it does not believe any laws were broken but that it will ask an external law firm to investigate.
""It's safe to say that other countries in Europe were affected by lists ... I assume that all EU member states could potentially be affected,"" Matthias Berninger, Bayer's head of public affairs and sustainability, told journalists on Monday.
While he did not say there had any illegal activity and added it was up to the external law firm to evaluate the conduct, Berninger said there were signs Monsanto had not played fairly in the use of private data.
""There have been a number of cases where - as they would say in football - not the ball was played but the man, or woman, was tackled,"" Berninger, who joined Bayer in January, said on a conference call.
""When you collect non-publicly available data about individuals a Rubicon is clearly crossed,"" regardless of whether data privacy laws were actually violated, he added.
He repeated an apology issued by Bayer over the weekend.
French public-sector research institutes Inra and CNRS on Monday said they would file criminal complaints over mishandling of personal data, after finding that some of their researchers and executives featured on the Monsanto stakeholder lists.
Bayer said in its initial statement on Sunday that ""Currently, we have no indication that the preparation of the lists under discussion violated any legal provisions.""
It added, ""Bayer will ask an external law firm to investigate the project Monsanto commissioned and evaluate the allegations. The law firm will also inform all of the persons on the lists of the information collected about them"". 
Work with the PR agencies that were commissioned by Monsanto for the project at the time has been suspended, it said.
Bayer already faces potentially heavy costs from U.S. class-action lawsuits in which plaintiffs argue that Monsanto's Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.
Bayer shares have shed more than 40 percent since a first adverse U.S. judgment on Roundup last August, leaving the company with a market capitalization smaller than the price it paid for Monsanto.

Shareholders delivered a rare rebuke to CEO Werner Baumann's management team at Bayer's annual general meeting last month, with a majority voting against ratifying the executive board's business conduct in 2018.

FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Talks have stalled between  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and UBS on a tie up of their asset management businesses due to differences over who would control the combined entity, people familiar with the matter said.
Such a tie-up still made strategic and financial sense and they did not rule out that talks may eventually be revived, three sources said, but both banks had wanted to drive the venture.
Deutsche Bank, its asset management arm DWS, and UBS declined to comment. 
DWS shares were down 3% at 1447 GMT, rebounding slightly from sharper losses after the news of the stalled talks emerged.
The idea of merging the businesses mushroomed in recent months as Deutsche Bank discussed a possible merger with smaller rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
A deal for Deutsche's DWS unit could have been a way to finance that merger, but with the Commerzbank talks ending in failure, the urgency to do an asset management deal fizzled out.
Any deal to merge DWS with a peer and give it additional scale could also be presented as a strategic revamp of Deutsche Bank after the failure of the Commerzbank talks. 
A GOOD FIT
A combined UBS asset management unit and DWS would have just more than 1.4 trillion euros ($1.58 trillion) in assets under management and was considered a good fit as the two are roughly the same size.
DWS chief executive Asoka Woehrmann has said he wants to actively participate in consolidation in asset management and early last year Deutsche Bank listed it as part of a broader overhaul to help Germany's largest bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals.
A structure under consideration was for UBS to hive off its asset management business and fold it into DWS, which is 79.5 percent owned by Deutsche Bank.
A deal could have led to more than 1,000 job cuts, one banker said. 
Deutsche Bank had also approached Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Amundi, the French asset manager mostly owned by  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), over a possible deal for DWS, other people close to the matter said.
As with the UBS talks, issues over who would be in driving seat of a merged entity led to the failure of the Allianz talks, two people close to the matter said. 
Allianz's interest in medium-sized deals such as this one was limited, one added. 

Allianz declined to comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - EssilorLuxottica declared an end to a feud between its French and Italian partners on Monday, saying it would drop all legal proceedings and focus on integrating the eyewear group formed by last year's 54 billion euro ($61 billion) merger.
The company, which brings together Ray-Ban maker Luxottica and lenses specialist Essilor, also reaffirmed its ambition to find a new chief executive by the end of 2020.
Shares in EssilorLuxottica, which have been rattled as the dispute was fought out in public, were up 0.27 percent at 1422 GMT, among the rare gainers on the Paris benchmark CAC-40 index, which was down 1.4 percent.
""The settlement allows a step forward in restoring a more constructive spirit between sides, (a) precondition to seize potential synergies of the merger,"" equity broker Equita wrote in a note to clients. 
The merger parties were supposed to have equal weight in the combined group's leadership, but the French and Italian sides have increasingly accused each other of trying to dominate in recent months.
Tensions surfaced in November when Luxottica's founder, Leonardo Del Vecchio, who is chairman of the merged entity and its largest shareholder, appeared to tap his right-hand man and Luxottica chief executive Francesco Milleri, as the next CEO.
The battle culminated in March when Del Vecchio's holding company Delfin said it would seek arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce, prompting Essilor to ask a Paris court to nominate an outside mediator.
EssilorLuxottica said in a statement on Monday that Del Vecchio and executive vice chairman Hubert Sagnieres had ""empowered"" Milleri and Laurent Vacherot, Essilor's current CEO, to focus on the integration process and define strategy.
As part of the agreement, neither Milleri nor Vacherot will apply for the future CEO role. 
Vacherot was also appointed as a director of EssilorLuxottica to ensure the board keeps a strict balance between the two companies. 
FOLLOW THE MONEY
EssilorLuxottica, now owner of a portfolio spanning brands including Oakley, Persol, Oliver Peoples and Varilux, is due to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, where some minority investors are expected to voice their frustration over the leadership row.
Some investors have also expressed concern that the leadership crisis might delay or scupper promised savings, at the very core of the proposed deal when presented in 2017.
Last week, however, the group confirmed 2019 targets, including a rise in sales of 3.5 to 5 percent, and pledged to deliver on planned synergies of up to 600 million euros annually in the next three to five years.
Before Monday's announcements, several minority shareholders including management companies Phitrust and Comgest, submitted resolutions to appoint additional independent directors at Thursday's annual meeting. EssilorLuxottica's board had advised shareholders to reject the proposals. 
""It is very likely that we will maintain our submitted resolutions,"" Denis Branche, managing director with Phitrust told Reuters.
Valoptec, a group representing more than 10,000 former and active employees which had also been pushing for the nomination of an independent director, said on Monday it was withdrawing its resolution. 
The association will join EssilorLuxottica's strategy and integration committee.

711,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Here Are the European Stocks Most Exposed to U.S.-China Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade war between the U.S. and China is raging once more and certain segments of the European stock market are feeling the pain.
The spat has riled a number of sectors in Europe, particularly cyclical names in the manufacturing and mining subgroups. Automakers have taken another hit as U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up threats and markets worry the talks could be headed towards a stalemate. The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index has tumbled 12% since its peak in April.
Exporters are also being hit by the euro rallying against the yuan, lessening the appeal of goods made by European companies for Chinese importers.
Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the sectors which have a significant exposure to the Chinese market and could find themselves suffering should trade tensions continue to rise.
Miners and Steelmakers
China is comfortably the most important market for metals demand globally, meaning that miners are very sensitive to tensions in trade with the country. For example, Kaz Minerals Plc gets 66% of sales from the Asian nation. Jitters in China can impact significantly on copper, iron ore and steel prices.
Luxury Goods
Wealthy Chinese consumers are a key end-market for luxury firms like  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Cie Financiere Richemont SA. The latter gets about a quarter of its revenue from China. The latest trading updates from the sector have indicated demand for their expensive handbags and watches has held up in the country so far, defying concerns that Chinese buyers were starting to rein in spending.
Cars
Vehicle demand in China has been slumping, hit not only by the trade tensions with the U.S. but also a slowing domestic economy. Potential car buyers in the country are also awaiting possible government incentives to revive the market. European and U.S. car companies have become more reliant on the Chinese market as demand in Europe and North America wanes.
Semiconductors
China is an essential part of the supply chain for companies that make the chips that go into smartphones and cars, among other products. Semiconductor manufacturers also derive a large portion of their revenue from the Chinese market, so are often very sensitive to trade angst. Infineon Technologies AG, Europe’s largest chipmaker, makes 40% of its revenue in the country.
Chemicals
Chemicals companies also sell a huge amount of products to Chinese customers. BASF SE’s boss has predicted China will represent half of all chemicals industry sales by 2030. These firms also supply products to other cyclical sectors like car makers, so any impact on those sectors can hit the industry. It’s the same story for industrial equipment suppliers and, more broadly, European industrial names.
Pharmaceuticals
Companies including U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc and Danish insulin manufacturer  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) A/S are increasingly eyeing the Chinese market. Their ambitions, however, have faced a speed bump from a local plan to start bulk buying drugs. But China remains a key growth market for the pharmaceutical industry. AstraZeneca already gets 18% of its revenue there, while Novo Nordisk gets about 10%.
Testing
Testing and inspection companies such as Intertek Group (LON:ITRK) Plc work on making sure goods that flow into the global market are safe and compliant with regulations. Broker Jefferies said in February that it estimates about 5% of Intertek’s revenue is from products imported into the U.S. from China which will be directly caught up in the tariffs.
Below are a few other individual names and the percentage of revenue they make from the Chinese market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

714,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2019 09:37AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Slides as China Increases Tariffs in Trade Retaliation,"Investing.com - U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower on Monday as China announced countermeasures against the U.S. in an escalating trade dispute.
Beijing indicated plans to raise tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports beginning on June 1 in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s instructions to Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to prepare 25% tariffs on virtually all Chinese products imported to the U.S., including those which were not currently covered by existing levies.
That presidential order came after the U.S. increased tariffs last Friday on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.
Fears that the growing escalation of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute threatens to derail the global economy shook risk assets on Monday.
The Dow Jones tumbled 457 points, or 1.8%, to 25,485.76 points by 9:33 AM ET (13:33 GMT), while the S&P 500 sank 52 points, or 1.8%, 2,829.38 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite slid 179 points, or 2.3%, 7,738.33 points.
Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China’s state-controlled Global Times, singled out Boeing among the Dow components likely to be targeted by the new round of tariffs.
“China may stop purchasing U.S. agricultural products and energy, reduce Boeing orders and restrict U.S. service trade with China,” he said in a tweet, adding that Chinese authorities could also consider dumping their holdings of U.S. Treasuries.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) sank 3.4%, topped only by the 4.7% decline in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), for whom China is an increasingly important market, and a 3.6% slide in industrial global bellwether  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT).
With no major economic data or company reports scheduled for Monday, trade will be driven by any developments with regard to the ongoing dispute.
“Lacking recent precedents, stocks are missing an anchor in the midst of escalating China-U.S. trade tensions,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economist at Allianz, said via Twitter. “As such, they continue to react to every statement from government officials.”
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, lost 0.3% at 96.83 by 9:35 AM ET (13:35 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 4 basis points to a six-week low of 2.41%.

715,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 09:36AM ET</span>",Canada's WestJet to be taken private in C$3.5 billion cash deal,"(Reuters) - Canada's second biggest carrier WestJet Airlines Ltd on Monday accepted a C$3.53 billion ($2.63 billion) buyout offer from private equity fund Onex Corp, ending a two-month long strategic review.
The investment will be led by Onex Partners, Onex's private equity platform focused on larger investment opportunities and WestJet's board has urged shareholders to vote in favor of the deal.
Onex first approached WestJet's board in March. Its last known investment in the aerospace industry was in 2005, when it bought Spirit Aerosystems from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. It exited its investment in 2014. 
As part of the deal, WestJet shareholders will receive C$31 for each share held, representing an about 67% premium to its closing price on Friday. Including debt, the deal is valued at about C$5 billion.
Canada's second-biggest carrier has had a rough start to 2019 as the worldwide grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets forced it to suspend its full-year outlook in March. 
It also scaled back capacity growth as it looked to cut costs and attract higher-paying customers to turn it around after a turbulent 2018. 
The deal is expected to close in the latter part of this year or early next year, the company said.
CIBC Capital Markets and BofA Merrill Lynch were the financial advisers to WestJet, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and RBC Capital Markets advised Onex.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities fell on Monday after their worst week of 2019 as hopes of an imminent U.S.-China trade deal were crushed, raising fears of a fresh round of tit-for-tat tariffs.
The impasse left investors bracing for retaliation by China for Washington's increase on Friday of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The move followed accusations by U.S. President Donald Trump that Beijing had reneged on earlier commitments.
Trump on Monday warned China not to retaliate against an increase in tariffs he imposed last week.
Escalation could tip the U.S. economy into recession, a risk flagged by the inversion in U.S. Treasury bond yield curve between three-month and 10-year rates for the second time in under a week. 
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession in the past 50 years. It gave a false signal just once.
""Overall, in the short term the chances of recession have increased, so equity markets will be priced on the back of that,"" said Justin Oneukwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 slipped 0.5%. S&P 500 futures shed 1.3%.
Chinese shares tumbled. The benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 indices shed 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively. 
The offshore Chinese yuan fell to its lowest in more than four months, 6.88 to the dollar.
Trade talks as Washington demanded promises of concrete changes to Chinese law and Beijing said it would not swallow any ""bitter fruit"" that harmed its interests.
""How far this escalates is what the market is really worried about ... The important thing is what's the impact on growth, and that's what the market is really fearing,"" Oneukwusi said.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News that China needed to agree to ""very strong"" enforcement provisions to secure a deal. He said the sticking point was Beijing's reluctance to put into law changes that had been agreed.
Kudlow said U.S. tariffs would remain in place while negotiations continued and Trump was likely to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan in late June.
""The risk of a full-blown trade war has materially increased, even though both sides seem to still want a trade deal and talks are expected to continue,"" UBS economist Tao Wang said.
Washington said it was preparing to raise tariffs on all remaining imports from China, worth about $300 billion.
""Our base case is for limited progress and Chinese retaliation,"" said Michael Hanson, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities.
Major currencies were relatively calm. The euro was steady at $1.1234 and the dollar little changed against a basket of currencies at 97.270.
""We've seen pretty restrained moves among currencies, despite some severe rhetoric between the U.S. and China so far. However, cause for concern remains a weaker yuan, which should be a warning sign for risk assets,"" said Marc-André Fongern of MAF Global Forex.
Emerging-market stocks were down 0.9 percent, hovering near January lows. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it had reduced its emerging-markets risk for the second time in as many months on Monday following the set-back in U.S-China trade talks.
In commodities, oil futures jumped on growing concern about supply disruptions in the Middle East. Brent crude futures rose 1.8% to $71.90 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 1.5% at $62.56 per barrel.
In digital currencies, Bitcoin hovered above $7,000 on Monday, close to nine-month highs, as the biggest cryptocurrency's 2019 rally gathered steam.

""The cost structure of the electric car is above that of the combustion engine car. We are working hard on lowering this,"" Kaellenius, who is due to take over from Dieter Zetsche after the company's annual general meeting on May 22, said. 
""We need to work on the cost of vehicle architectures. From where we are now, we need to make a significant step by 2025 in terms of cost,"" Kaellenius said, declining to provide specific figures.
The 49-year-old CEO designate said he would continue to rely on alliances to drive down development and procurement costs for Mercedes-Benz. 
""The intensity of cooperations will increase. The alliances will be not only with other carmakers and suppliers, but also with technology companies,"" Kaellenius said. 
Daimler has struck alliances with  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan and BMW to share development and procurement costs of trucks, buses and passenger cars. 
Daimler is also relying on increasing economies of scale for electric car batteries as a way to drive down costs. It is also working to cut the use of expensive raw materials from electric car batteries. The carmaker wants to reduce the use of cobalt in electric car batteries.
On Saturday Reuters reported that Daimler's Chinese joint venture partner BAIC was seeking to buy a stake of between 4% to 5%.
Upon being asked whether he would welcome BAIC as a shareholder, Kaellenius said: ""We welcome investors who see the future of mobility in Daimler and are invested for the long run."" 

Daimler plans to have a passenger car fleet composed of 50% electric and hybrid cars by 2030 and wants to have carbon neutral production by 2022, the carmaker said.

The ride-hailing giant dropped as much as 5.8% to $39.11 at 7:51 a.m. New York time in trading before U.S. exchanges opened. The San Francisco-based company sold 180 million shares at $45 apiece on Thursday, and on Friday it never traded above that price, ending the day down 7.6% at $41.57 even as other stocks gained.
The share slump reflects investor skepticism about the size of the ride-hailing market, Uber’s ability to execute on food and package delivery and its push into autonomous vehicles, said Ygal Arounian of Wedbush Securities. The IPO also comes as investors shy away from riskier assets given U.S.-China trade tensions, said the analyst, who has an outperform rating on Uber and sees the stock reaching $65 in the next year.
“Uber’s highly anticipated IPO coming out of the gates on Friday was clearly not a ‘storybook start’,” Arounian wrote in a note. Uber is a “prove me situation and thus not going to be an overnight success story.”
Ride-sharing peer  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). fell in sympathy with Uber on Friday, extending its losses to 29% since its March debut. That slide showed no sign of abating on Monday, with shares another 2.3% lower in early trading. Lyft had slumped as last week came to a close after its first set of results disappointed the market.
Uber must execute flawlessly over the next 12 to 18 months, and if it does a market value of $100 billion or more is possible, Arounian said. The company should be able to morph its ride-sharing platform into “a broader consumer engine including food and freight delivery, he said. The company had a $69.7 billion market value at Friday’s close.
Jitters in the broader market continued into Monday, with Asian stocks and European shares edging lower as the market awaits details on how China will retaliate to the U.S. hiking tariffs.

Following Volkswagen's 2015 admission that it had rigged engine software with ""defeat devices"" to cheat U.S. diesel tests, several European states launched investigations.
They found on-the-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions more than 10 times above regulatory limits for some Opel, Renault and Fiat Chrysler models, and widespread use of devices that reduce or shut down exhaust treatment during normal use.
French prosecutors opened criminal probes into Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Renault, PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler in 2016-17 that remain ongoing.
A Renault spokesman said the company could not comment on the latest report because it had not seen its findings.
""Renault vehicles are not equipped with defeat devices and are homologated in conformity with the regulations in force,"" the spokesman said.
The study by ISAT, a French transport research institute, confirmed earlier findings that engine software in Renault's Clio and Captur models shut down one form of emissions control outside a range of air temperatures covering official tests but not everyday use, Le Monde reported.

Another anti-pollution technology, the ""NOx trap"", did not run cleaning cycles below speeds of 50 kilometers per hour (31 miles per hour), according to the French daily. Without such periodic purges, the filters become clogged and ineffective.

The insurance industry has been slower to move to electronic trading than other parts of financial services. But Lloyd's, which relies heavily on face-to-face trading, this month announced that it plans to launch two electronic exchanges from next year, building on the existing platform.
Lloyd's, which is facing competition from cheaper rivals, introduced targets last year to speed up automation. Its syndicate members face charges if they fail to comply.
The target of a 40% switch of relevant business to Platform Placing Ltd (PPL) by the end of the first quarter was met or exceeded by 80% of members, PPL said.
The next target is for 50% of such business to transfer to the platform by the end of June.
However, a large chunk of business at Lloyd's, including some types of reinsurance, cannot be carried out on the platform.
Brokers also have to sign up to the platform by June, though some are reluctant.
""We have had a sharp increase in the numbers of brokers signing up,"" said Bronek Masojada, chair of the PPL Board.

""Nevertheless, the rate of growth is flattening and we cannot afford to get complacent.""

730,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2019 06:56AM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Set to Plunge at Opening as Trade War Escalates,"Investing.com - Wall Street pointed to a sharp decline at the open on Monday after the trade conflict between the U.S. and China took a sharp turn for the worse.
After no agreement was reached in last week’s negotiations, President Donald Trump instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to prepare 25% tariffs on virtually all Chinese products imported to the U.S., including those which were not currently covered by existing levies.
Trump warned China on Sunday that Beijing should reach a deal now instead of hoping he won’t win his 2020 reelection campaign. “Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting big tariffs,” the president tweeted.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang promised that China would “never surrender” to external pressure, although he stopped short of providing immediate details on planned retaliatory tariffs.
Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China’s state-controlled Global Times, indicated that the reason for the lack of details was because Beijing was “drafting a plan that will have precise effects, making sure it hits the US while minimizing damage to itself.""
Although Trump has said that China would pay for the tariffs, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow admitted in an interview with CNBC on Sunday that “both sides will pay."" However, he suggested that the hit to the Chinese economy would be big while the impact on the U.S. would be minor.
Kudlow said there is a ""strong possibility"" that Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan in late June. That, and the fact that China has invited U.S. officials to Beijing again this week, suggests that talks haven't broken down completely.
Even so, worries of a negative impact on a global level shook risk assets on Monday.
The blue-chip Dow futures tumbled 312 points, or 1.2% by 6:52 AM ET (10:52 GMT), the S&P 500 futures sank 37 points, or 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures slid 126 points, or 1.7%.
“The increase in U.S. tariffs, which is likely to remain in place for some time, will adversely affect consumer and business confidence in an already slowing global economy, pressure global growth, dampen trade flows and tighten financial conditions,” analysts from Moody’s Investor Service warned in their Credit Outlook. “Although the global economy has shown signs of emerging stabilization, the tariff increase will likely reverse that trend.”
With no major economic data or company reports scheduled for Monday, trade will be driven by any developments with regard to ongoing dispute.
Federal Reserve officials Richard Clarida, Eric Rosengren and Robert Kaplan are scheduled for appearances throughout the day.

732,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Uber Is a Market Bellwether for All the Wrong Reasons,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) initial public offering performed poorly in its first day of trading Friday, falling as the broader market rose.  Lyft 's (NASDAQ:LYFT) debut in the stock market didn’t do well, either. Is there something about internet-based, money-losing ride-hailing that makes it a bad business? In its modern incarnation, yes.
Unprofitable IPOs are nothing new. I came of age in the markets in the late 1990s when there were plenty of profitless companies going public. But the difference is that back then startups always had a plan to become profitable. Go far enough out in the pro formas and you could see a path to profitability. With Uber, there essentially is no plan, except some Hail Mary of an idea concerning self-driving cars, where Uber is way behind.
Uber can’t raise prices and can’t pay drivers less— they are protesting as it is. Everyone knows it is essentially checkmate. I like to call Uber and Lyft intractable businesses. There are plenty of others in the pipeline either looking to go public or seriously thinking about doing so, including a very silly one in flexible workspace company WeWork Cos. and a ludicrous one from venture capital firm Softbank Group Corp.
But Uber is the bellwether because it’s the first truly intractable company to go public. People have been saying for a while that this IPO could determine the direction of Silicon Valley for years to come. It could determine much more than that.
Uber does not charge enough for a few reasons. The biggest is that it wants to put its competition, taxis, out of business. In the old days, it would be impossible to do something as ambitious as putting all taxis out of business because no investor would put up with losses for the very long time it would take to accomplish that goal. But pre-IPO Uber investors have because of founder Travis Kalanick. He told an incredible story, and his sales pitch for Uber was about more than just cab rides. He would talk about things like the capacity utilization of a car and how the sharing economy was much more efficient. Visionary stuff. 
Then again, for investors in a private company, not having to mark to market helps when it comes to the patience needed to stick around as losses mount. The public markets are different, especially when there is the trading screens are full of red. 
But there’s something else to consider, and it has to do with the broader economy. In essence, investors allowing Uber to run at a loss is a massive consumer subsidy. Rides have been priced below where they should have been in its quest to put all taxicabs out of business, and those billions of dollars in losses at Uber were billions of dollars in gains for consumers. Uber lost and consumers won. 
Uber is far from the only company that subsidizes consumers. Robinhood Financial LLC is another example: its commission on stock trades is zero. Robinhood, of course, makes money in nontransparent ways, such as margin lending, but it still represents a huge consumer subsidy in an attempt to put E-Trade Financial Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. out of business. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). is a bit like a publicly-traded example of this phenomenon. In Amazon’s case, profits from its cloud business probably subsidizes the retail business, which on a standalone basis would be intractable. Still, Amazon is busy putting brick-and-mortar retailers out of business, and investors have tolerated little in the way of profits for 25 years (although Amazon is finally starting to show some profits).
The question you have to ask yourself is what would happen if investors suddenly lost their patience and demanded profits? Naturally, Uber and Robinhood and Amazon would have to raise prices, which is another way of saying that there could be a lot of inflation. We have had a hunch that technology is deflationary, but we didn’t really know why until now. Silicon Valley probably projects hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer subsidies into the economy every year
It’s possible that the Federal Reserve has a fairly poor understanding of inflation. It’s also possible that President Donald Trump is right and that lowering interest rates may not risk spurring inflation. In fact, lowering rates may have the opposite effect—driving more investment into venture capital and private equity, actually driving inflation rates lower. Maybe low interest rates aren’t the result of low inflation—maybe they’re actually the cause."

LONDON (Reuters) - Metro Bank shares fell on Monday after weekend social media postings led to customer queues at some London branches, prompting the British bank to reassure depositors and investors.
""We're aware there were increased queries in some stores about safe deposit boxes following false rumors about Metro Bank on social media and messaging apps,"" a spokeswoman said.
Metro Bank has been battling to shore up confidence after a major accounting error in January wiped more than 1.5 billion pounds off its market value and forced it into a 350 million pound ($455 million) fundraising.
Pictures on social media showed queues of customers at Metro Bank branches in West London, with Twitter users reporting that concerns about safety deposit boxes had been raised on community WhatsApp groups in the area. 
""There is no truth to these rumors and we want to reassure our customers that there is no reason to be concerned,"" the spokeswoman said as Metro Bank reiterated that it never takes ownership of customer items held in safe deposit boxes.
Metro Bank shares, which were initially down nearly 9% on Monday, were down 3.2% at 0945 GMT, giving the lender a market capitalization of 520 million pounds, Refinitiv data shows.
The bank also said in response to reports that it was struggling to raise capital that its plan was well advanced.
Customer deposits are guaranteed up to 85,000 pounds if a bank gets into financial difficulties, while post-crisis rules mean lenders are now structured to ensure deposits can be moved to another bank more easily to ensure continuity of service.
The Bank of England declined to comment on Metro Bank, which a source told Reuters is also considering selling around 1 billion pounds of loans where the risk-weighting had been miscalculated to help alleviate its financial stress.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said that while this would help, it would be tough to find an acceptable price as ""we would expect Metro Bank to currently be considered a distressed seller"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Chinese-Taiwanese group is delaying an up to 80 billion yen ($729.33 million) investment planned as part of a rescue deal for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Japan Display as it wants to reassess the target's prospects, the Japanese firm said. 
A prolonged delay could put at risk the survival of the cash-strapped smartphone screen maker, which has been hit by Apple's slowing iPhone sales and a late shift to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.
The buyer group, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group, had planned to formalize the investment decisions by mid-June.
The bailout deal, announced a month ago, would allow the buyers to become Japan Display's biggest shareholders with a 49.8 percent stake, replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund.
But the group has informed the company that they will make such decisions ""after re-examining the prospects for Japan Display's business performance"", the company said on Monday, adding there was no time frame for the review.
TPK and Harvest did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. 
A source familiar with the matter said that Japan Display's financial situation has changed since the deal was agreed, prompting the group to reassess the business. The source declined to elaborate on the change in the situation. 
Japan Display has estimated it will post its fifth straight year of net losses for the year ended in March, as disappointing sales of Apple's iPhone XR, the only model with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, dashed hopes for a turnaround. The company will announce its financial results on Wednesday.
Some analysts said the move could be deal tactics.
""The buyer group is apparently pressurising Japan Display to sweeten the offer,"" said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan, who is not involved with the deal. ""It's a good deal for the group as it gets solid panel technologies, but the cheaper the better.""
The Chinese group's investment is part of a 232 billion yen ($2.1 billion) bailout plan, in which INCJ will accept a debt-to-preferred equity swap totaling 75 billion yen and extend senior loans worth 77 billion yen.
Japan Display said INCJ has told the company it would not change the plan, although the final agreement will be made in line with the buyer group's investment decisions. 
Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp (T:6758) in a deal brokered by the government.

""BlackRock’s withdrawal does not bode well for the efforts to turn around the bank without public money,"" Moody's said in a note.
Italy in January approved emergency measures under which the government could inject up to 1 billion euros in capital into Carige by buying its shares.
The rating agency added that, based on its 2019 estimate, the money set aside accounts for just 0.06% of Italy's GDP. But Italy's public finances are already under pressure because of weaker-than-expected economic growth.
""The government will find it difficult to achieve fiscal targets agreed with the European Commission,"" it said.
""Further deviation from targets could reignite the confrontation with the European Commission that contributed to rising market tensions last autumn.""

737,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Impossible Foods raises $300 million with investors eager for bite of meatless burgers,"By Angela Moon and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Impossible Foods, which makes a meatless plant-based burger and is backed by celebrities like Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Katy Perry, said on Monday it has raised $300 million in the latest round of funding ahead of a possible initial public offering.
The fundraising underscores the growing appeal in plant-based food that tries to taste like meat with fewer environmental or health risks. Shares of competitor Beyond Meat Inc, which debuted on Nasdaq on May 2, have more than tripled.
The latest round for Impossible Foods brings the Silicon Valley-based startup's total raised to more than $750 million. Despite encouraging signs from investors, it is not in a hurry to go public, Chief Financial Officer David Lee told Reuters.
""We believe in self-reliance. Being ready to go public is a priority for the company because we need to be operating at the highest level of rigor,"" Lee said.
""But we are not in a rush, nor are we announcing an IPO filing.""
Celebrities have jumped on the investor bandwagon, including Jay-Z, Will.i.am, Jaden Smith and Katy Perry, who recently wore a vegan burger outfit to New York's annual Met Gala, making reference to Impossible Foods. Star athletes including Serena Williams, National Football League quarterback Kirk Cousins and National Basketball Association star Paul George have also opened their wallets.
Institutional investors include Khosla Ventures,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures, Horizons Ventures, UBS, Viking Global Investors, Temasek, Sailing Capital, and Open Philanthropy Project.
The fifth equity funding round since its launch in 2011 values Impossible Foods at $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. By comparison, Beyond Meat had a market capitalization of just under $1.5 billion in its IPO but now tops $4 billion. 
Lee said Beyond Meat's successful IPO did not change Impossible plans or timing to go public but was a ""validation.""
""I think their (Beyond Meat) IPO indicates that retail investors along with retail consumers are ready for something better than the meat they've been eating for decades,"" Lee said.
Impossible launched its first faux meat patty over two years ago. A genetically modified yeast creates the key ingredient, called heme, which makes the patties appear to be bloody and juicy and taste like real meat unlike conventional veggie burgers. Ingredients include wheat, soy and potato proteins. 
Fast-food chain Burger King has said it will launch ""Impossible Whopper,"" which uses Impossible Foods' plant-based patties, nationwide after a successful trial at limited locations.
Impossible Burger is sold at more than 7,000 restaurants worldwide including White Castle, Qdoba and Red Robin and at Disney theme parks.
'CRAVEABLE'
Impossible plans to launch its products in retail outlets in the second half of this year. Lee declined to give a more specific timetable or identify those partners but said the company is actively talking with ""top grocery chains in the nation.""
Beyond Meat's products are already sold at Whole Foods and Safeway stores.
As consumer appetites grow, competition is heating up in the global meat-substitute market, which is projected to reach $5.81 billion by 2022, according to a 2018 study by Grand View Research. 
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), the largest meat processor in the United States, will roll out meatless protein products in the coming months while McDonald's Corp began selling vegan burgers in Germany.
""We don't lead with the source of guilt that meat eaters have globally. We lead with what they want positively which is craveability with better options for the environment and their health,"" Lee said.

""It's the craveability that makes meat eaters find their own reason to come back for Impossible Burger.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Momentum is building for independent checks on the capital buffers of banks, a senior accounting executive has said, with Metro and Co-operative banks a reminder of what happens when things go wrong.
Following a request from the Bank of England, the ICAEW, a professional accounting body, designed a framework for independent checks on how banks calculate their ratio of capital to risky assets, a closely-watched measure of health.
Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW, said the idea of independent checks was gathering momentum.
""We have been talking to accounting firms about whether or not they have had any interest in using this framework to do specific pieces of work for banks, and we hope to share our insights in the next few months,"" Izza said.
Metro is seeking a rights issue for 350 million pounds to repair an unexpected dent in its capital ratio after admitting an error in how the ratio was calculated.
The error was discovered by the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (PRA), the BoE watchdog that asked the ICAEW to come up with its framework for checking ratios.
""The PRA has not endorsed or mandated the framework but they have been supportive of it being done,"" Izza said.
Checks could be done by external accounting firms, by a bank's internal auditors, or by using a Section 166, whereby the bank is required by its regulator to hire an external firm to make the checks, Izza said.
PRA's current rules do not require external auditors to provide assurance on capital ratios, and there is little sign that Metro's error is a sector-wide issue.
A PRA spokeswoman noted the watchdog's response to a report in March into the near demise of the Co-operative Bank in 2013. The report recommended that capital levels of banks should be externally checked.
The PRA said it agreed with this recommendation and will consider whether to introduce more formal third-party reviews after considering costs and benefits, whether all banks should be subject to such checks, and if the findings of checks should be published.
European Union rules for insurers already require independent ""validation"" of capital calculations, such as through the use of outside actuaries.

A review by former London Stock Exchange chairman Donald Brydon of auditing standards is also looking at checks on bank capital ratios and will report back by the end of the year.

740,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Treasuries Surge After Trump Gives China One Month to Agree Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasuries led a global rally in some of the world’s safest assets after President Donald Trump imposed a one-month deadline on China to agree a trade deal or risk tariffs on all of its exports.
Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds touched the lowest level since March, correlating with a slide in the offshore yuan, widely seen as the key barometer of risk sentiment over trade. The yen rallied, building on a four-week run of gains, while European stocks fell. Traders meanwhile boosted bets on a rate cut from the Federal Reserve this year.
“I can’t see a real deal before the G-20 summit in June,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of European rates strategy at Societe Generale in London. “The rally is more than justified. I am surprised that bonds are not rallying more.”
The conflict between the world’s two biggest economies has taken a turn for the worse over the past week, with Trump imposing another wave of tariffs on Chinese goods Friday. That has increased fear in markets that any further escalation could seriously jeopardize the global economic recovery before many of the world’s central banks have had a chance to normalize monetary policy.
The U.S. told China it has a month to secure a trade deal or face tariffs on all its exports, ratcheting up pressure after it accused President Xi Jinping’s government of backpedaling on promises. China has said additional duties imposed should be removed for an agreement, setting the stage for weeks of uncertainty in financial markets after investors had thought a pact was near.
“Markets have grown less optimistic about the U.S.-China trade negotiations after some news reports from China’s state-run media suggested a harder stance,’’ said Mayank Mishra, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. “The risk of protracted U.S.-China trade tensions may weigh down USD/JPY in the short term.”
Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell as much as five basis points to 2.41%, the lowest level since March 29. The yen strengthened against all of its major peers, rising as much as 0.3% to 109.60 against the dollar. Offshore yuan fell as much as 0.9% to 6.91 per dollar, a 2019 low. S&P 500 futures dropped 1.3%.
Fraught Relationships
The U.S. hiked tariffs on more than $200 billion of Chinese goods on Friday, with the Asian nation vowing to retaliate. A week of tense stand-off before crucial talks in Washington led to the yen strengthening by 1 percent. It touched 109.47 against the dollar on Thursday, its highest since February.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) estimated that should the current tariffs remain in place, the U.S. economy will be harmed to the tune of 0.25% over a two-to-three year horizon, compared with 0.5% in China. The impact globally will be 0.15%, while the imposition of tariffs on all Chinese goods could double the pain, O’Hagan said.
Trump piled on the pressure on Saturday, tweeting that “far worse” terms would be on offer for China if it doesn’t act now. While China has invited a U.S. delegation back to Beijing, no dates have been set for the next round of talks, according to White House economic director Larry Kudlow.

PARIS/OSLO (Reuters) - Euronext won approval from Norway's Ministry of Finance to buy up to 100% of Oslo Bors on Monday, effectively ending a five-month battle with Nasdaq for one of the last independent stock market operators in Europe.
While Euronext has already secured a stake of more than 50% in Oslo Bors, Nasdaq had argued that no takeover should be allowed unless a two-thirds stake was obtained in order to ensure that a buyer would have complete control.
Both had offered 158 Norwegian crowns per share for Oslo Bors, valuing it at around 6.8 billion Norwegian crowns ($779 million), but the view of the Norwegian government was crucial.
""Euronext welcomes the ministry's clearance to acquire up to 100% of Oslo Bors VPS's capital and looks forward to completing the next steps to close the transaction by the end of June,"" its Chief Executive Stephane Boujnah said on Monday.
""We are extremely satisfied the process is carried out in full respect of Norwegian law,"" Boujnah told Reuters.
Both Euronext, which runs exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Dublin, and Nasdaq are looking to expand their portfolios but opportunities are scarce as market operators either already belong to international groups or because their shareholders want to remain independent.
Given technological changes, size has become an important feature as big data allows larger market operators to squeeze costs and reduce transaction fees. 
Oslo Bors was one of the last potential target for Euronext in the region where Nasdaq and London Stock Exchange already control several platforms.
Shares in Paris-based Euronext, which is due to release first quarter results this week, traded 1.6% higher at 61 euros.
Nasdaq had won the support of more than a third of Oslo Bors shareholders including the Norwegian market operator's major shareholders DNB and KLP. The U.S.-based firm had been hoping to block Euronext's bid.
No such minimum ownership requirement will be imposed however, the Norwegian ministry said in a statement.
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR NASDAQ
Euronext's CEO said the offer filed by Euronext is open for the shareholders who supported the Nasdaq bid. 
He expects them to tender their shares to Euronext now since the offer filed by Nasdaq is unlikely to proceed. ""I don't think Nasdaq intends to be an minority shareholder in Oslo Bors,"" Boujnah said.
Nasdaq expressed its disappointment at the decision by the government, and said it would assess its options.
""The decision not to require a two-thirds majority of the shares to be obtained by any person seeking to acquire control of Oslo Bors VPS is disappointing,"" Lauri Rosendahl, president of Nasdaq Nordic, said.
Oslo Bors would diversify Euronext’s revenue from shares and derivative trading, given Oslo Bors’ leading position in seafood derivatives as well as oil services and shipping.
Euronext plans to appoint the CEO of Oslo Bors to its managing board, and set up a hub that would supervise all commodities transactions in the Norwegian capital.
""Euronext looks forward to supporting the Norwegian financial and business community, to working constructively with all key constituents and stakeholders to further drive the success of Oslo Bors VPS,"" Boujnah said.
The board of Oslo Bors, which had supported Nasdaq over Euronext, said it would work with the new owner.
""The board of Oslo Bors VPS takes note of the (ministry's) decision and will work closely with the new majority owner to maintain the company, its business and the employees in the best possible way,"" it said in a statement.

742,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>","China stocks fall, yuan at four-month low as U.S. trade talks stall","By Winni Zhou and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's main equity indexes finished lower on Monday and the yuan weakened to a four-month low as investors' hopes for a deal to end an escalating trade war between the United States and China were dashed by signs of a stalemate in trade negotiations.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite index ended the day down 1.2% and the blue-chip CSI300 index lost 1.7%, resuming the previous week's downward slide. 
For the month, the Shanghai Composite is down 5.7%, while the CSI300 has lost 6.2%.
The risk of U.S.-China talks breaking down and the two ""settling down into an indefinite economic war of attrition is now uncomfortably high,"" Arthur Kroeber, founder of Gavekal Dragonomics, said in a note.
""The deeper that both sides entrench themselves in their political story lines, the more that risk will grow,"" he added.
Losses in the CSI300 on Monday were led by financial firms, which dropped 2 percent. The consumer staples sector ended down 0.06 percent, the real estate index lost 0.43 percent and the healthcare sub-index fell 0.58 percent.
While they recorded sharp losses for the whole of last week, both the Shanghai Composite and CSI300 had surged more than 3% on Friday, lifted by hopes that the continuation of talks could bring an agreement between Beijing and Washington, despite President Donald Trump hiking tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
But those hopes ebbed on Monday as Beijing and Washington appeared to be at an impasse, as Washington demanded promises of concrete changes to Chinese law and Beijing said it would not swallow any ""bitter fruit"" that harmed its interests.
With no signs of a quick solution in sight, investors continued to await Beijing's response to the higher tariffs. 
On Monday, China's foreign ministry said the country will never surrender to foreign pressure, but declined to comment on what countermeasures Beijing planned in response to the tariff hike. 
Investors are watching to see how Chinese policymakers plan to offset the impact of the stiffer tariffs on both the economy and financial markets, analysts at Citi said, adding that Beijing's options include support for stock markets and the yuan, as well as monetary policy measures and liquidity injections.
The smaller Shenzhen index ended 1.1% lower and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index dropped 2%.
Markets in Hong Kong were closed Monday for a public holiday.
WEAKER YUAN
Worries over the trade impasse also hit China's currency, which was dragged lower by heavy corporate demand for the greenback. Prior to the market open, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the official midpoint of the yuan's daily trading band to 6.7954 per dollar, weaker than the previous fix, but much stronger than market expectations. The midpoint was 95 pips firmer than Reuters' estimate of 6.8049.
The PBOC had also surprised the market with a stronger-than-expected fix on Friday. In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 6.8459 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.8670 at 0747 GMT, 470 pips weaker than the previous late session close. ""Many market participants had hoped that Trump's tariff hike threats were just his negotiation tactics last week. But now tariffs are higher,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank, noting that the talks appeared stalemated. Selling pressure on the yuan was heavy in the morning, several traders said, as many corporate clients showed rising interest to load up on dollars. 
Companies that were debating whether to liquidate their long dollar positions last week were unwilling to sell dollars, awaiting better prices, they said. In the past, major state-owned Chinese banks have usually sold dollars to prop up a falling yuan. On Monday, traders said they did not see signs of such state bank action. 
Since the trade dispute blew up last week, some market watchers now believe the yuan is at risk of breaching the psychologically important 7 to the dollar mark, which it avoided last year.

But while Beijing has not yet outlined its response to higher U.S. tariffs, Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank in Singapore, said it was unlikely the country would use its currency as a trade war weapon. ""We think China is unlikely to engineer 25% depreciation to counter the impact of tariff as the cost of capital outflows amid the shrinking current account surplus may outweigh the benefit of supporting export,"" Xie said in a note. ""The pressure on RMB depreciation may depend on three near-term factors including the size of China's retaliation package, U.S.'s plan to impose tariff on the remaining $325 billion products and market's assessment on whether the setback is temporary or not,"" he added. Offshore yuan weakened past 6.9 to the dollar to a low of 6.9048 at one point in afternoon trade, its weakest level since Dec. 24.

Investing.com -- The U.S. is now preparing to widen 25% tariffs on all imports from China. Will Europe be next?
Autos aren’t the only sector faring badly after early trade Monday in Europe, but they’re clearly in the firing line after the U.S. demonstrated its willingness to use tariffs so forcefully over the weekend. A decision on whether to impose tariffs on European autos is due on Saturday and the signs aren’t good, with the U.S. administration's action against China over the weekend showing no sign of accepting conventional wisdom that tariffs choke growth and leave consumers worse off.
“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.
All of Europe’s big carmakers are down over 1% this morning, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down 2.8%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) down 1.4%,  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) down 1.7%, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) down 1.2% and BMW (DE:BMWG) down 1.1%.  Renault  (PA:RENA) is faring slightly better, down only 0.5% as a result of separate news of it making a formal merger proposal to Nissan (T:7201).
The escalation of the trade war is hitting markets generally, with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 down 0.7% at 374.86 points, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is down 0.1%, Germany’s Dax is down 0.9% and the French CAC 40 is down 0.7%.
The extent of the threat is best seen, however, in its impact throughout the supply chain. Parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) is at the bottom of the CAC 40, down 3.5%, tiremakers Continental (DE:CONG) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP) are also down sharply, and even chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) are being affected by the general malaise, due to their exposure to the auto sector.
All that said, the sector may get a stay of execution. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in an interview with the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung that “there are signs that (the deadline) could be extended because of the talks between the U.S. and China.”
“We’re prepared for the worst,” she added, noting that the EU has drawn up a list of U.S. products that would also have tariffs imposed on them if the U.S. goes ahead with its threat"
744,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 04:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bosch goes for platinum-light fuel cells,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) - Global automotive supplier Bosch expects platinum to play only a minor role in its new fuel cells, giving precious metal markets scant benefit even as the technology gains momentum for pollution-free transport.
According to Reuters calculations, Bosch would only need a tenth of the platinum used in current fuel cell vehicles. 
Hopes of reviving demand and prices of platinum increasingly hinges on widespread uptake of fuel cells in vehicles, ships and trains to make up for dwindling amounts used in each device, analysts say. 
The spot price of platinum has shed more than 40 percent in the last five years, burdened by persistent oversupply, before rebounding slightly in recent months.
But hopes that fuel cells will boost long-term demand may be dampened after Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH told Reuters that platinum was expected to play only a ""minor role"" in its plans to mass produce fuel cells.
Privately-owned Bosch, which last month signed a deal with Powercell Sweden AB to mass produce fuel cells, said its fuel cell design was not finalised, but it expects them to use only as much platinum as a diesel catalytic converter.
A catalytic converter in a diesel passenger vehicle typically uses three to seven grams of platinum compared with around 30-60 grams currently needed for a fuel cell for the same vehicle, according to analysts. 
""There has been lots of optimization work concerning platinum in fuel cells,"" Achim Moritz, product manager for mobile fuel cells at Bosch, told Reuters.
""If you look at a diesel catalytic system, there is about the same amount of platinum content you need for a fuel cell,"" he added.
He declined to give specific estimated figures for the S3 fuel cell system it is developing with Powercell and expects to launch by 2022, citing commercial sensitivities.
TOYOTA ALSO SLASHES PLATINUM
Bosch's fuel cell deal with Powercell, announced last month, was another signal that the technology is poised to be rolled out more widely as governments toughen emissions regulations. 
China is leading the way, targeting 2 million fuel cell vehicles by 2030.
Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction using hydrogen as a fuel and platinum as a catalyst, but comprise only a fraction of the electric vehicle (EV) market even though they allow vehicles to travel much longer distances between charges than battery powered cars. 
For years, fuel cells were expected to boost platinum demand dramatically, but doubts have increased due to reports that scientists have found ways to cut the amount of platinum they contain.
The best selling fuel cell vehicle, Toyota's Mirai, is expected to cut platinum by two-thirds to around 10 grams per vehicle in its next version, down from 30 grams in the current model, according David Hart, director of E4tech consultancy, based in Lausanne.
""They (fuel cell makers) all have a pathway of using less platinum, which is fairly clear,"" Hart said. 
Toyota Motor Corp declined to comment.
Hyundai Motor Co has cut the amount of platinum needed for the fuel cell stack in the latest edition of its NEXO, released last year, to 56 grams from 78 grams previously, a company spokesman told Reuters. 
Hyundai plans to invest over 6 billion euros to make 700,000 fuel cell systems annually by 2030. 
WIDER UPTAKE?
Fuel cells give EVs longer ranges and recharging takes a matter of minutes, a fraction of what is needed for batteries.
Hyundai's NEXO has a range of 380 miles compared to 226 miles for the best-selling battery electric vehicle, Nissan's Leaf.
That is especially useful for heavy goods vehicles and buses, which are expected to be the primary market for fuel cells initially.
""The heavy duty truck side is the biggest initial opportunity for fuel cells because they are very hard to electrify with batteries,"" said Mårten Wikforss, a consultant for Sweden's Powercell.
Batteries would take up more space in a heavy goods truck and would take hours to recharge. 
Once costs come down, fuel cells may also appeal to car buyers who do not want to worry about frequent and time-consuming recharging.
If fuel cells catch on in ships and trains as well as road vehicles, platinum demand may get a boost despite the lower loadings due to the sheer numbers, some analysts said.

Global demand for platinum for all fuel cells from vehicles is forecast rise to 366,000 ounces by 2030 but to surge to 965,000 ounces when including other fuel cell and hydrogen uses, said Jonathan Butler, head of business development at Mitsubishi Corp.

Markets are currently priced for a “Goldilocks” scenario of solid but non-inflationary growth, and America has outperformed -- but that’s all set to reverse, strategists including Andrew Sheets wrote in a May 12 note. Their skepticism rests on three factors playing out over the remainder of the year:
“Investors should hold a defensive tilt and a preference for ex-U.S. risk exposure,” the strategists wrote. “This is supported by where valuations sit versus fundamentals, forecasts that U.S. versus rest-of-world growth reverses and excessive investor confidence that there is little risk of the output gap closing.”
U.S. equities have outperformed so far this year, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% versus the 12% rise in the MSCI All-Country World Index. The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen about 25 basis points and the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is up 0.4% even after the dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve.
This backdrop ought to have spurred caution. Yet, “the predominant concern until two weeks ago appeared to revolve around whether markets could go up a lot more,” the strategists wrote, noting that the last week’s escalation in trade tensions have moderated some of the optimism.
Concerns about the narrowing of the output gap -- the difference between the capacity of the economy and its actual output -- relate to some measures of inflation not showing moderation even as markets appear to be pricing in a benign scenario, Morgan Stanley said.
December Clues
As for the gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world, Morgan Stanley is sticking to its idea outlined in November that there will be a reversal of America’s outperformance.
“The growth reversal story has been delayed, not derailed,” the strategists said.
In December, when expectations of U.S. versus RoW growth appeared to be reversing, the dollar weakened, stocks outside America outperformed and duration in the U.S. beat Europe, they wrote. “Over the next 12 months, we expect all those performance trends to apply.”
The investment ideas the strategists propose include:
“The question remains: is the performance pattern year-to-date a template for the rest of the year, or an aberration?” the strategists said. “We think the latter.”"

749,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",What Banks Think Will Happen in U.S.-China Negotiations,"(Bloomberg) -- As investors remain on edge in anticipation of Chinese retaliation for last week’s U.S. ramp-up in the trade war, economists and market strategists are scattered in their predictions for the path ahead.
It’s anyone’s guess as to whether the U.S. and China smooth things over by the time Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit gathering in Japan at the end of June. Speculation is rife over what an agreement would look like, and, importantly, how it would be enforced.
While an immediate tit-for-tat tariff acceleration was absent from China in response to the U.S. announcement Friday, the consensus is more solid around further policy stimulus from China to juice growth in a particularly high-pressure environment.
Here’s how analysts at banks across Asia see the way forward in U.S.-China negotiations, and what it means for markets and the economy:
Morgan Stanley
""Base case: We assume temporary re-escalation in trade tension,” wrote  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists including Deyi Tan. “Renewed U.S.-China trade tension raises the question of whether it could thwart any nascent recovery"" in Asia excluding Japan, they said. ""Growth risks are skewed to the downside. Our base case is for a gradual recovery. We see trade tension as temporary and continued talks/market weakness prompt both sides to reach a deal.""
DBS Bank
""Trade tensions will continue to keep the U.S. dollar firm against emerging Asian currencies,"" wrote FX strategist Philip Wee and rates strategist Eugene Leow at DBS. ""It is uncertain if negotiations will resume to get the trade deal back on track."" While there’s speculation that Trump and Xi will meet around the G-20 summit in June, ""the U.S. has started preparations to hit the remaining $300 billion of Chinese goods with a 25% tariff.""
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
“While we hope for the best, our baseline case is now for the U.S. and China to fail to reach a deal, meaning tariffs will get raised on the remainder of Chinese exports to the U.S.,” and ANZ’s Asian currency forecasts are “under review,” Khoon Goh, head of Asia research, wrote in a note. “China views the economic cost of a no deal to be more tolerable than the political cost of acceding to U.S. demands.”
Oversea-China Banking Corp.
""The sudden unexpected collapse is a surprise. However, it does not mean the end of U.S.-China trade talk,"" wrote Tommy Xie, OCBC’s head of greater China research. “Change is the only constant in trade talk, unfortunately. Market will continue to be driven by headline news going forwards.""
There are three options China may consider to counter the impact of tariffs, including yuan depreciation, monetary policy easing and fiscal stimulus, he said. ""We think China is unlikely to engineer 25% depreciation to counter the impact of tariffs as the cost of capital outflows amid the shrinking current account surplus may outweigh the benefit of supporting exports. This also suggests that monetary easing and fiscal stimulus will play a bigger role.”
 JP Morgan Chase  Bank
With an earlier-than-expected economic recovery in the first quarter and reduced policy buffers, ""we expect Friday’s tariff increase will not lead to a material policy response -- instead policy will likely be fine-tuned,” wrote Sin Beng Ong, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s chief economist for Southeast Asia. The policy reaction could include a symbolic tariff increase or expansion of tariffs for imported goods from the U.S., an accelerated roll out of fiscal subsidies to support consumption, further cuts to banks’ reserve-requirement ratios and credit easing, and ""perhaps most important, a weaker yuan, with the year-end USD/CNY forecast now at 6.80 from 6.65 previously.""
Citi Research
""Authorities’ support for equities, signaling via yuan fixing and intervention, monetary policy measures and liquidity actions will be monitored closely for cues on asset price action,"" wrote Citi analysts on the EM Asia team. In addition to possibilities for further talks ahead, ""USTR’s potential launch of investigation/public comment period for tariffs on the $325 billion of Chinese imports and report/comments on exchange rates will also be monitored.""
Maybank Kim Eng Research
""China’s response to retaliate to U.S. action was ‘restrained,’ suggesting it is still seeking to seal a deal by withholding countermeasures for now,” say Maybank analysts Suhaimi Ilias, Chua Hak Bin, and Lee Ju Ye.
""Last week’s actions point to stimulus and mitigation to domestic economy,"" they said, citing a cut to the amount of cash that some county-level rural commercial lenders must hold as reserves, the release of 280 billion yuan ($40.8 billion) of funds for SME funding and speculation that Chinese state funds propped up stocks. ""However, risk of a full-blown trade war has increased and will be a major negative shock to the global/regional economy.""

751,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 02:18AM ET</span>",Bar rises for shale takeovers as Chevron bows out of Anadarko fight,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Chief Executive Michael Wirth's decision to opt out of a bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) has raised the bar for deals, and dampened expectations that oil majors will drive a new wave of consolidation in U.S. shale.
Wirth last week ruled out increasing his $33 billion offer for Anadarko after being outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), walking away from a company he had described as a perfect match. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee that it will use toward share buybacks. 
The decision will make rivals think twice about splurging on companies operating in the largest U.S. oilfield, but will not put an end to shale deals given the weak valuations of independents, analysts said. 
Even Wirth refused to rule out another deal.
""We are always scanning the landscape for opportunities,"" Wirth said in an interview on Thursday.
However, Wirth added that Chevron has a ""rich queue"" of existing projects.
""We have no intention to do an acquisition unless it's exceptionally good for us,"" he said. 
Many companies with shale assets are trading at depressed prices and would ""be accretive to the larger caps or majors,"" said Geoffrey King, a portfolio manager at investment firm Macquarie Group.
Price-to-earnings ratios for producers' Carrizo Oil & Gas,  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) and  Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC) are in the single digits compared to the 14 to 17 times earnings multiple that  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, Chevron and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) trade. 
Weak shares prices have chilled deal-making among similar-sized oil producers. Last quarter, the value of U.S. energy deals fell to a 10-year low. 
Investor reaction to the Chevron-Occidental contest for Anadarko also may cause potential for the majors to think twice before getting involved in a bidding contest. 
Occidental traded on Friday at $54.97, down 9 percent from the day it launched its bid for Anadarko and at a 10-year low. Chevron was up 3.8 percent to $121.99 since withdrawing, but is down 5.3 percent in the last 52 weeks.
Chevron has been a poster-child for spending restraint and called the bid for Anadarko a reaction to the ""industrial logic"" of two companies with similar operations. It pledged to restrict annual capital spending to around $20 billion through next year to return more cash to investors.
Avoiding overspending on shale is ""what shareholders have been advocating for,"" said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. ""Chevron stock got a decent pop on a lousy day for the market."" 
Despite a large acreage position and the ""strongest royalty position of anybody in the Permian,"" Wirth said the No. 2 U.S. oil producer this year will restrict its drilling program in the top U.S. shale patch to just 20 rigs, less than half that of rival Exxon, while aiming to reach output of 900,000 barrels per day by 2023.
The issue for Chevron and other large producers thinking of expanding in the Permian is how much more production they can wring from an asset, said Kris Nicol, head of U.S. corporate research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
""A lot of companies are undervalued,"" Nicol said.
There is more involved to making an acquisition pay off than the purchase price. ""The question is, once you get that company, what can you do with it?"" Nicol asked.
Still, after years of letting small independents dominate shale, the majors have ""come around"" to the importance of the fields' fast-cycle production, said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager with Tortoise Capital.
Anadarko's agreement to be acquired by Occidental for $38 billion in cash and stock ""makes it more likely that others will want to do something big to compete,"" he said.

752,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2019 10:33PM ET</span>",Foreign investors flock to U.S. corporate bond market for yield,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign investors have had to pay up to hedge U.S. dollar-denominated assets over the last year, but this has yet to stop them from plowing money into the U.S. corporate bond market, the world's largest.
Robust returns for U.S. corporate debt assets and expectations of solid U.S. economic growth for the remainder of the year have outweighed concerns about costly dollar hedges for many foreign buyers.
A surprise shift in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance earlier this year from a tightening bias to a neutral one helped unleash foreign demand for U.S. corporate bonds, which have recovered strongly from last year's losses.
The U.S. investment grade sector showed total returns of 5.6% so far this year, after a 2.2% loss in 2018, while the U.S. high yield market had an 8.3% return, after last year's loss of 2.3%, according to the Bank of America corporate bond indexes.
GRAPHIC: U.S. investment grade and high-yield indexes - https://tmsnrt.rs/2LqiLhe
""The much more benign outlook for interest rates has contributed to very sizable returns on fixed income including corporate bonds in the first part of the year,"" said Hans Mikkelsen, head of high grade credit strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York.
The insatiable appetite for U.S. corporate bonds from foreign investors shows no signs of abating.
U.S. capital flows data from the U.S. Department of Treasury, which has a two-month lag, showed net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds to the tune of $11.3 billion in the first two months of the year after selling about $15 billion in November and December of 2018.
Another gauge from EPFR Global showed U.S. investment grade funds had more inflows than outflows from foreign investors in the January to April period. In contrast, there were more foreign outflows than inflows from June to December last year.
GRAPHIC: Foreign inflows into U.S. corporate bonds png - https://tmsnrt.rs/2LmhCap
U.S. Treasury yields have come down since the Fed flagged a change in monetary policy, reducing the extra premium investors are willing to pay to hold these bonds instead of safer U.S. Treasuries.
U.S. corporate bonds are worth less when interest rates rise. When new issues come to market with higher coupon rates than older securities, those older ones become less attractive.
FOREIGNER INVESTORS UNDETERRED
Despite the change in Fed outlook, dollar hedges have remained high, although they're off last year's peaks, stemming from higher dollar borrowing costs in the money markets. That, however, has not deterred foreign investors from buying U.S. corporate paper.
""The U.S. has been the shining star in the global economy and this is where you're seeing very strong growth and very strong fiscal support over the last year,"" said Robert Brauns, portfolio manager for multi-strategy fixed income at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in New York.
""I think that has enticed investors to put some more money to work in the U.S.,"" he added.
At the same time, foreign investors, rather than face expensive hedging costs, have opted not to hedge their currency risks at all and this has worked to their advantage because the dollar has strengthened. The investor does not only get the yield from the fixed income paper, but the currency gain as well.
European investors buying fixed-income debt are still faced with fairly high dollar hedging costs, at around 3.1% using euro three-month forwards, slightly lower from the roughly 3.4% in late November 2018, Reuters calculations showed.
Analysts said the net return for a European investor buying U.S. high-yield debt still comes to 3.1%, less the currency hedging cost. In comparison, European high yield has a return of around 3.5%.
""If you have the view that the U.S. economy is strong and you believe the U.S. dollar is going to do well, you're not going to hedge the currency risk,"" BNP's Brauns said.
Japanese buyers of U.S. debt, on the other hand, have seen lower hedging costs this year currently at 2.85%, from a peak of 3.25% in November 2018, using 12-month forwards, the BNP official pointed out.
GRAPHIC: Lucrative no more - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DLDNAy
Bank of America's Mikkelsen believes hedging costs are on the way down because of the Fed's neutral monetary policy stance.
""Six months ago when you bought U.S. corporate bonds, you would be expected to roll into much more expensive currency hedges in 2019. Our market did not look good,"" said Mikkelsen.
""And now foreign investors could rationally expect cheaper foreign hedges because the market is pricing a rate ease. That's a shift of a hundred basis points between expecting the Fed to hike three times and now an ease,"" he added.
Japanese investors have thus begun buying foreign corporate bonds again this year, most of it in U.S. fixed income debt including Treasuries.
Japanese insurers, in particular, are looking for higher returns abroad by diversifying into riskier corporate bonds in the financial year that began last month.
""Everyone is cognizant of hedging costs. But investors have almost no choice,"" said Wen Lu, interest rates and volatility strategist, at TD Securities in New York. ""The demand for yield across all asset classes is something of a necessity for a lot of investors.""

754,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",UK lawmakers square up to regulator over duty of care for banks,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A legal duty for banks to act in the best interests of their customers may be needed, British lawmakers said on Monday, piling pressure on regulators to step up protection of consumers after a string of mis-selling scandals spanning decades.
British lenders have paid more than 30 billion pounds ($39.03 billion) since 2007 in redress to customers missold endowment mortgages, pensions and payment protection insurance. 
Banks and other financial firms are not legally required to put customers' interests ahead of their own.
""All retail financial services, no matter which sector of the industry they operate in, should be acting in their customers’ best interests at all times,"" parliament's Treasury Select Committee said in a report on financial inclusion.
""If the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is unable to enforce such behavior in firms under its current rule book and principles, the committee would support a legal duty of care,"" it said.
Faced with a lack of consensus on the issue, the FCA said in April it has no plans to introduce a duty of care rule as there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all solution to any weaknesses in consumer protection.
The watchdog would instead review how it applies its existing rules and principles, but the lawmakers said the FCA should set out by autumn a clear timetable of when changes to its rule book, principles, or legislation, if needed, will occur.
LOYALTY PENALTY
The report also said that the FCA should make it mandatory for financial firms to publish the size of their ""loyalty penalty"" or the cost of being a long-standing customer compared with a new customer receiving the same products.
Consumer campaigner body Which? told lawmakers that an average customer could be paying a ""penalty"" of up to 1,000 pounds ($1,301) a year.
It also warned against more closures of bank branches, saying they hit vulnerable people, such as the elderly or those on lower incomes.
The number of branches in Britain has fallen to 9,690 in 2017 from 20,583 in 1988 as more customers bank online, the use of cheques declines, and as contactless payments overtook the use of cash in 2017.
Banking industry bodies say that customers can now use post offices for basic banking services.
""The Post Office provides this service at a loss. Taxpayers should not be subsidizing the big six banks' lack of branches,"" the report said.
Free-to-use cash machines must also be maintained to avoid Britain inadvertently becoming a ""cash less society"" which would hit vulnerable people, it added.
The FCA should also force banks to relax their restrictions on opening a basic bank account to make them accessible to all consumers.
""It can no longer be an option for banks to ignore financial inclusion,"" the TSC's chair Nicky Morgan said.

Kerkhoff ditched a restructuring plan on Friday, in which the merger was a key part, and resolved instead to transform the steel-to-submarines group into a holding company and list its profitable elevators business. 
He has since agreed on a way forward with labor unions for his new strategy, which foresees 6,000 job cuts, about 4% of the Thyssenkrupp workforce. The blueprint will go to a supervisory board vote on May 21.
Thyssenkrupp abandoned its long-planned merger of its steel business with the European operations of Tata Steel, which would have created the region's No.2 producer after ArcelorMittal, due to opposition from European Union regulators.
""Of course, with steel, we are looking to see what other consolidation options there are,"" Kerkhoff told the Handelsblatt business daily's online edition. 
""But with the current position of the European Commission, I don't see the possibility of bigger mergers. As a result, we will remain the majority shareholder.""
Thyssenkrupp, which has warned it would report negative cash flow this year, is seeking a financial shot in the arm from the partial float of its elevators division.
""We will get cracking on that as quickly as possible and then see what the right moment is,"" Kerkhoff told Handelsblatt.
Asked whether investors could expect a special dividend from the float's proceeds, Kerkhoff said: ""We want to strengthen the balance sheet of Thyssenkrupp to gain more room for maneuver on the restructuring. That has absolute priority.""

Activist investors have been clamoring for Thyssenkrupp to monetize its elevators business, which analysts estimate could be worth as much as 14 billion euros ($15.7 billion), twice the market capitalization of the parent company.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) said on Sunday it was hiring an external law firm to investigate French media complaints that  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), the U.S. seed maker it took over last year, had compiled a file of influential personalities.
The German life sciences and pharmaceuticals group said that, following an internal review, it understood that this initiative had raised concerns and criticism. 
""This is not the way Bayer seeks dialogue with society and stakeholders. We apologize for this behavior,"" Bayer said in a statement. It added, however, that there was no indication that compiling the lists was illegal.
French prosecutors opened an inquiry on Friday after newspaper Le Monde filed a complaint alleging that Monsanto had compiled a file of 200 names, including journalists and lawmakers, in the hope of influencing their positions on pesticides.
The French investigation is the latest fallout from Bayer's $63 billion takeover of Monsanto. It already faces potentially heavy costs from U.S. class-action lawsuits in which plaintiffs argue that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer.
Bayer shares have shed more than 40 percent since a first adverse U.S. judgment on Roundup last August, leaving the company with a market capitalization smaller than the price it paid for Monsanto.
Shareholders delivered a rare rebuke to CEO Werner Baumann's management team at Bayer's annual general meeting last month, with a majority voting against ratifying the executive board's business conduct in 2018.
Commenting on the French allegations, Bayer said its law firm would inform all of the individuals on the Monsanto list about the information collected about them. Bayer would also ""fully support"" the French prosecutor's investigation.
Matthias Berninger, Bayer's new head of public and government affairs, would evaluate the matter internally and assess the behavior of people involved, both inside and outside the company.
""Our highest priority is to create transparency,"" Bayer said, adding that the Monsanto manager responsible for the issue had left the company soon after the takeover.
""Bayer stands for openness and fair dealings with all interest groups,"" it added.

""We do not tolerate unethical behavior in our company. Of course, this also applies to data protection regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.""

Antinori, also an executive vice president, was responsible for commercial operations, products, the frequent flyer program and cargo division, according to Emirates' website.
The spokeswoman declined to comment when asked why Antinori resigned and when it was effective.
Antinori spoke to media in his capacity as an Emirates executive on April 24 in Dubai and was seen at the Emirates stand at a travel exhibition in Dubai on April 29.

763,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>",Bank Secrecy Rules Get a Rethink After Danske Laundering Shock,"(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S is turning into a case study for European regulators, legislators and bankers to rethink fundamental assumptions about how the finance industry should operate.
First up is the principle that bank clients should be protected by secrecy laws. The sheer scale of the Danske money-laundering scandal means those rules may now get a review. The financial regulator in Denmark, the bank’s home, has started lobbying counterparts elsewhere for a broader discussion.
Jesper Berg, director general of the Financial Supervisory Authority in Copenhagen, says it’s clear there are “huge privacy issues.” But “we need to figure out how to resolve this.”
Danske Bank faces billions of dollars in fines as it awaits the outcome of criminal investigations across Europe and in the U.S. The bank admitted last year that it was at the center of an unprecedented laundering scandal after failing to screen thousands of clients in Estonia. Much of the $230 billion of mainly Russian money that flowed through those accounts was suspicious, Danske acknowledged.
The case revealed potential loopholes in European legislation. While rules governing data protection and client confidentiality protect privacy, they also mean that nothing prevents a customer blacklisted by one bank from moving to another.
Crossing the Street
“The fact that the thousands of customers that left Danske could just cross the street and go somewhere else, to another country -- there was no sharing of information there -- that was really unfortunate and it should be avoided,” Berg said. He says letting banks share data would be a more effective tool than creating a single European entity to target money launderers.
His approach resonates in Finland, which will take over the rotating presidency of the European Union in July.
“The idea is extremely good and supportable,” said Samu Kurri, head of the financial analysis and operational risks department at the Finnish FSA. “But as always, the devil is in the detail and it would take very careful preparation to draw up.” It would also “represent a fundamental change to traditional tight banking secrecy on a philosophical level,” he said.
Parliament Support
In the European Parliament, too, the idea of allowing banks to share client information is finding some support. Jeppe Kofod, spokesman for the parliament’s special committee on financial crime, tax evasion and tax avoidance, says the balance needs to be tipped toward prevention.
“I don’t want to sacrifice privacy,” he said. But banks “should be able to share some of the data in a protected way,” he said. “Today, it is too easy for criminals to operate in a number of banks.”
At least two other Nordic banks have been caught up in the widening Estonian laundering scandal. Swedbank AB allegedly handled more than $100 billion in potentially suspicious funds, while Nordea Bank Abp may have enabled almost $800 million in questionable transactions. Both are accused of ties to the Danske affair.
Currently, banks must report suspicious behavior to their national financial intelligence unit, or FIU. Those units work with local law-enforcement authorities to investigate, but the information can’t be shared with other banks. Putting together a potential criminal case takes time -- and meanwhile, possible launderers are free to launder.
Berg says it’s worth considering whether banks should be allowed to share reports of suspicious customers before the police confirm illegal activity. Financial institutions already collect information to meet know-your-customer requirements, and in the Nordic region are working on a unified system to avoid customers being bombarded with multiple requests.
Such a common infrastructure, Berg said, could include ""customers that have been thrown out of one bank, so they’re not allowed to go to the next bank.”
Philippe Vollot, Danske’s head of compliance since October, says that while it makes sense to share general information, privacy concerns make it more challenging to distribute suspicious-activity reports. The subject of such a report may ultimately be found innocent of any involvement.
""To have somewhere in the system a capacity that criminals would not be able to move from one financial institution to another -- that would be something extremely effective to combat financial crime,” he said. “The issue here is the data privacy regulation, and it’s actually a philosophical debate about where does it start? Where do you draw the line?”

764,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2019 01:01AM ET</span>",From Pork to Pampers: Where Inflation Is Showing Signs of Life,"(Bloomberg) -- From pork in China to iron ore in Brazil, inflation is flickering in parts of the global economy.
While overall price growth remains largely subdued, the emergence of costlier items will encourage those who say it’s only a matter of time before inflation accelerates due to robust economic growth and tight labor markets.
For now, higher commodity prices rather than surging demand is a key factor. Upcoming earnings from the world’s biggest retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and from  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) will shed light on how consumers are faring.
Here’s a look at some current hot spots.
Supersized Inflation?
Meat prices are starting to climb. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp. is raising its forecast for food costs in the U.S. this year as protein prices start to tick up following the African swine fever in Asia. In the last quarter, restaurant menu prices were up about 2% in the U.S., McDonald’s said last month. Brewhouse chain BJ’s Restaurants Inc. said it’s expecting higher pork prices, while China’s KFC operator Yum China Holdings Inc. said surging poultry costs will weigh down margins for the rest of the year.
Pork Shock
Events in China are behind the jump in pork prices. An unprecedented outbreak of African swine fever has hammered the supply of pork. With stocks of pigs back at 2011 levels the government has warned that pork prices may climb 70%. The spillover effects will be noticeable.
Iron Ore
Keep an eye on steel prices. Iron ore has rallied after supplies in Brazil and Australia were hit by disruptions, potentially setting the stage for benchmark prices to extend gains toward $100 a ton.
Consumer Staples
Procter & Gamble Co. (purveyor of Pampers), and Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB). (the maker of Huggies) have raised prices as have Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. Europe’s consumer-goods giants Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) are also showing new signs of life by selling more food and cleaning supplies at higher prices. In April  Danone  SA (PA:DANO) forecast higher milk prices this year.
Oil
Oil prices have slid since hitting a yearly high in April, but they are still up around a third this year and a volatile geopolitical backdrop means the outlook remains uncertain. Speculation that Saudi Arabia and other producers will pump more to make up for lost Iranian barrels has helped curb the price gains. Still, economists say the cost of crude remains an issue to watch, especially for nations that rely on imported oil.
U.S. Jobs Market
U.S. employment costs enjoyed the strongest gains for the start of any year in the past decade. That’s the third consecutive year in which the annual pace of growth in the first quarter accelerated from the previous year, a clear sign labor costs are increasing, according to Bloomberg Economics.
Here’s their chart on the Employment Cost Index:
Emerging Pressures
A suite of emerging economies are all experiencing high inflation. Turkey’s consumer prices rose 19.5% in April from a year earlier, while economists project inflation will average 40% in Argentina in 2019. Iran’s inflation could average 50% this year, the highest since 1980, a senior International Monetary Fund official told Bloomberg News. Topping the list is strife-torn Venezuela, where prices are tipped to rise 8 million percent this year.

765,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2019 09:42PM ET</span>","U.S. states accuse Teva, other drugmakers, of price-fixing: lawsuit","By Diane Bartz and Doina Chiacu
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. states filed a lawsuit accusing Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc of orchestrating a sweeping scheme with 19 other drug companies to inflate drug prices - sometimes by more than 1,000% - and stifle competition for generic drugs, state prosecutors said on Saturday.
Soaring drug prices from both branded and generic manufacturers have sparked outrage and investigations in the United States. The criticism has come from across the political spectrum, from President Donald Trump, a Republican, to progressive Democrats including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president.
The 20 drug companies engaged in illegal conspiracies to divide up the market for drugs to avoid competing and, in some cases, conspired to either prevent prices from dropping or to raise them, according to the complaint by 44 U.S. states, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court in Connecticut.
A representative of Teva USA, a unit of Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, said it will fight the lawsuit.
""The allegations in this new complaint, and in the litigation more generally, are just that – allegations,"" it said in a statement. ""Teva continues to review the issue internally and has not engaged in any conduct that would lead to civil or criminal liability.""
The 500-page lawsuit accuses the generic drug industry, which mainly sells medicines that are off patent and should be less expensive, of a long history of discreet agreements to ensure that companies that are supposedly competitors each get a ""fair share.""
The situation worsened in 2012, the complaint said.
""Apparently unsatisfied with the status quo of 'fair share' and the mere avoidance of price erosion, Teva and its co-conspirators embarked on one of the most egregious and damaging
price-fixing conspiracies in the history of the United States,"" the complaint said.
With Teva at the center of the conspiracy, the drug companies colluded to significantly raise prices on 86 medicines between July 2013 and January 2015, the complaint said. 
Representatives of Sandoz, another company named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The drugs included everything from tablets and capsules to creams and ointments to treat conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy and more, they said. In some instances, the coordinated price increases were more than 1,000 percent, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit also names 15 individuals as defendants who it said carried out the schemes on a day-to-day basis.
""The level of corporate greed alleged in this multistate lawsuit is heartless and unconscionable,"" Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak said in a statement.
According to New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, more than half of the corporate defendants are based in New Jersey, and five of the individual defendants live in the state. 
The lawsuit seeks damages, civil penalties and actions by the court to restore competition to the generic drug market.
Generic drugs can save drug buyers and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year because they are a lower-priced alternative to brand-name drugs. 
""Generic drugs were one of the few 'bargains' in the United States healthcare system,"" the lawsuit said. 
However, it added, ""Prices for hundreds of generic drugs have risen – while some have skyrocketed, without explanation, sparking outrage from politicians, payers and consumers across the country whose costs have doubled, tripled, or even increased 1,000% or more.""
As a result of the drug companies' conspiracies, it said, consumers and states paid ""substantially inflated and anticompetitive prices for numerous generic pharmaceutical drugs"" while the drug companies profited.

The lawsuit filed on Friday is parallel to an action brought in December 2016 by the attorneys general of 45 states and the District of Columbia. That case was later expanded to include more than a dozen drugmakers.

766,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2019 07:00PM ET</span>",Germany's Thyssenkrupp agrees restructuring approach with labor leaders,"By Tom Käckenhoff
DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Management and labor leaders at Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) have agreed on a way forward after the industrial conglomerate announced a fresh restructuring drive that could lead to the loss of 6,000 jobs.
Agreement was reached in talks between management and workers overnight on recognizing the need for radical action, whilst ensuring fair treatment of employees at the Essen-based group, both sides said. 
CEO Guido Kerkhoff announced the overhaul on Friday, ditching plans to split the business into two and abandoning a European steel merger with India's Tata Steel. 
The group will adopt a holding structure and plans to list its elevators unit, its most successful business.
The decision, first reported by Reuters, triggered a 28% recovery in Thyssenkrupp shares - their biggest daily gain - as Kerkhoff abandoned a cross-shareholding structuring that had ceased to be financially viable.
""Now it is up to shareholders to decide whether Thyssenkrupp steers towards a (viable) future, or towards conflict,"" said Markus Grolms, deputy head of the Thyssenkrupp works council who represents the IG Metall industrial trade union.
Thyssenkrupp said in a statement the two steering committees of its supervisory board supported the new strategy, including the agreement with labor leaders, and recommended it be approved at a full board meeting on May 21. 
""The executive board's new strategy is to build a fundamentally new Thyssenkrupp,"" the company said.
Group companies would be given freer rein to be more entrepreneurial and flexible, it added.
The agreement also won the backing of the regional leader of North-Rhine Westphalia, the industrial western state where Thyssenkrupp is based.
""Thyssenkrupp is showing the true meaning of social partnership and co-determination in this day and age,"" Chief Minister Armin Laschet said after meeting Kerkhoff and Grolms.
""The concept that management and unions presented to me is convincing. It offers a chance for the future for Thyssenkrupp and for jobs in North Rhine-Westphalia.""
The restructuring will lead to the loss of around 4% of the workforce, with 4,000 jobs going in Germany. Personnel chief Oliver Burkhard, in a tweet, said Thyssenkrupp would seek to avoid forced layoffs, but could not rule this out.
Kerkhoff's reversal bowed to months of pressure from investors who have demanded more radical steps to turn around the steel-to-submarines group and realize shareholder value - in particular by floating its profitable elevators business.
They estimate the elevators business is worth 14 billion euros, twice the value of the parent, reflecting a so-called conglomerate discount that has already forced other industrials, such as Siemens and GE, to action to reduce corporate sprawl.

The French prosecutor said on Friday it had opened the probe after a complaint was filed by daily newspaper Le Monde. 
According to the newspaper and other French media, Monsanto built up a file of some 200 names that includes journalists and lawmakers in the hope of influencing their positions on pesticides.
The file, Le Monde reported, dates from 2016 and was leaked by U.S public relations and marketing agency FleishmanHillard.
In an emailed statement, Bayer declined to comment on the investigation, saying it did not know which documents the allegations referred to. 
""We stand for openness and a fair treatment of all interest groups. We do not accept any unethical behavior in our company,"" it said. ""That applies obviously for the data privacy regulations in the respective countries as well."" 
FleishmanHillard said on Friday it would investigate the allegations in Le Monde. The company will ""examine the questions raised by certain media outlets about the lists of stakeholders that included publicly available information,"" it said in a statement.
Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, faces mounting litigations over its weedkiller Roundup, a systemic, broad-spectrum glyphosate-based herbicide.
A U.S. jury in August 2018 found the company liable because Monsanto had not warned users of alleged cancer risks linked to Roundup.

Bayer suffered a similar defeat over the weedkiller last month, while more than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. The company said last month it intended to defend itself in all lawsuits.

768,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's BAIC seeks to buy 5 percent Daimler stake - sources,"By Yilei Sun, Edward Taylor and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - China's BAIC Group is seeking to buy a stake of up to 5 percent in Daimler as a way to secure its investment in Chinese Mercedes-Benz manufacturing company Beijing Benz Automotive, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
BAIC informed Daimler of its intention to buy a 4-5 percent stake in the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars earlier this year, two of the three sources said. 
BAIC has asked local authorities in Beijing to support a 4-5 percent stake purchase, two of these sources said.
BAIC has started acquiring Daimler shares on the open market, one source said. 
""Daimler's share price is currently being underpinned by a buyer who appears to be building a stake,"" a person familiar with the matter said. 
BAIC did not respond to repeated phone calls and text messages seeking comment outside regular business hours. Daimler declined to comment.
It remains unclear whether BAIC Group can raise the nearly 3 billion euros that a 5 percent stake in Daimler would cost, based on the German carmaker's closing market value on Friday of 57.6 billion euros, two of these sources said.
German regulatory filings do not show BAIC as a significant shareholder of Daimler. German takeover rules allow a buyer to acquire a stake of up to 3 percent before a regulatory disclosure is required.
Daimler has ruled out issuing new stock to help an outside party build a stake, forcing potential buyers to acquire shares on the market.
BAIC signaled its interest in buying a Daimler stake as far back as 2015, and has redoubled its effort after Li Shufu, chairman of rival Chinese carmaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group built a 9.69 percent stake in Stuttgart-based Daimler in early 2018.
By using Hong Kong shell companies, derivatives, bank financing and structured share options, Li kept the plan under wraps until he was able, at a stroke, to become Daimler's single largest shareholder.

The Germans in March agreed to build the next generation of Smart-branded city cars together with Geely, which is based in Hangzhou. Daimler has also reassured BAIC that any new industrial alliances involving Mercedes and a Chinese partner would only happen after a consensus is found with BAIC.

769,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Tesla Capital Timing a Hint on Demand?
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced in a regulatory filing last week that it now plans to raise about $2.7 billion in capital through equity and convertible bonds.
For some, it looked good that Tesla got the details out of the way and can get any cash it might need in the near term. But for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) it raises some questions about the demand for Tesla vehicles.
“Some question whether the timing so early in the quarter sends a less confident message around the (second-quarter) pace of deliveries, which some sources suggest is off to a sluggish start,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note on Monday.
But they also said Tesla had affirmed its guidance for second-quarter vehicle sales in the range of 90,000 to 100,000.
Still, the investment bank thinks those long the stock should be prepared for the possibility of 2019 deliveries coming in well below target.
“Tesla reiterated its full year 2019 target of 360k to 400k deliveries. Our forecast is 348k units,” Morgan Stanley said. In our opinion, an investor in Tesla shares must be comfortable with full year unit volume that could test the 300k to 320k mark as a realistic downside scenario.”
The electric automaker can gain share in China, but Morgan Stanley does “not anticipate significant Model 3 deliveries in China until 1Q 2020 at the earliest.”
2. Credit Caution
The latest findings from the Federal Reserve loan survey indicates worrisome signs on credit markets and the economic outlook.
Demand for commercial and industrial loans tumbled to levels not seen since the financial crisis.
Worryingly for stocks, the long-awaited capital expenditure boom, courtesy of President Donald Trump's tax cuts last year are not closer to being realized.
Major net shares of banks that reported reasons for experiencing reduced commercial and industrial loan demand mentioned ""decreases in customers' investment in plant or equipment, decreases in customers' merger or acquisition financing needs, and customers shifting their borrowing to other sources of credit as important reasons for the weaker demand,"" according to the survey.
The survey also showed banks had tightened standards across all three major commercial real estate (CRE) loan categories - construction and land development loans, nonfarm nonresidential loans, and multifamily loans - over the past three months, underscoring the fragile U.S. housing market.
But some on Wall Street suggest its too early to start sounding the alarm bells on the economy, insisting that the latest survey is consistent with guidance from banks over the past several months.
""Some tightening noted in CRE and cards that is generally consistent with bank guidance over the past 12-18 months, there is no broad-based tightening of underwriting standards in C&I, which is a key positive driver for economic growth,"" UBS said in a note. ""On the other hand, loan demand appears to be softer across most major categories. With the exception of auto loans, lower demand noted across C&I, CRE, and other consumer loans could lead to lower overall bank loan growth in the period ahead.""
3. Tighteness?
Are financial conditions tight or loose?
According to the latest National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) they couldn't be looser.
The definition of tight financial conditions is it is “associated with increasing risk and decreasing credit and leverage.”
“We use this pattern as the basis for the overall index’s interpretation: Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions,” the Chicago Fed, which runs the NFCI, said.
In the latest index, of the 105 indicators used on the index 104 indicated looser than average conditions. Of those indicators, 67 loosened from the last reading, and 38 tightened."

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the timing of its civil suit filed in March accusing Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG of defrauding investors and demanded the agency explain its rationale.
Volkswagen was caught using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 29 billion euros.
At a status conference on Friday in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer questioned the SEC's ""lateness"" in suing VW more than two years after the company settled the Justice Department's criminal probe, pleading guilty to three felonies and paying $4.3 billion in penalties.
""My basic question is what took you so long,"" Breyer said, adding he was ""totally mystified"" why the SEC waited until 2019.
A person briefed on the matter said the SEC served its first formal subpoena on VW in January 2017 and issued a formal Wells notice in June 2018.
""I want to remind you that the symbol of the SEC is the symbol right up there, of the eagle. It's not a carrion hawk that simply descends when everything is all over and sees what it can get from the defendant,"" Breyer said.
Daniel Hayes, a lawyer for the SEC, told Breyer the agency ""moved as quickly as we could"" and added there were settlement negotiations that did not result in a deal.
""We opened an investigation, we conducted an investigation that specifically focused on whether there were violations of the security fraud. That takes time,"" Hayes said.
Breyer directed the SEC to explain by July precisely when the agency learned of the factual allegations and to file a declaration detailing its ""reasoning for waiting until March of this year to file this complaint.""
Regulators and investors argue VW should have informed them sooner about the scope of the scandal, while VW says it was not clear it would face billions of dollars in fines and penalties as others had paid out much lower sums.
VW issued more than $13 billion in bonds and asset-backed securities in U.S. markets at a time when senior executives knew that more than 500,000 U.S. diesel vehicles grossly exceeded legal vehicle emissions limits, the SEC complaint says.
Volkswagen reaped hundreds of millions of dollars ""by issuing the securities at more attractive rates for the company,"" the SEC said.
The SEC suit also named former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, seeking to bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public U.S. company.

VW has said the SEC complaint “is legally and factually flawed, and Volkswagen will contest it vigorously.""

771,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2019 12:31AM ET</span>",Insys says it may be forced to file for bankruptcy due to litigation cash crunch,"(Reuters) - Insys Therapeutics Inc said on Friday that a cash crunch resulting from legal costs related to a U.S. Justice Department probe into sales practices for the company's powerful opioid medication and other litigation may lead the company to file for bankruptcy and prevent it from completing its settlement deal with the Justice Department.
Insys, which has been exploring strategic options and is in talks to divest its opioid product Subsys, said it was likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investments if the company is not able to sell its assets at the value they are booked in its audited financial statements.
Last August, Insys reached a tentative deal to pay at least $150 million to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into claims that the drugmaker paid doctors kickbacks to prescribe Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.
The Arizona-based company said it was uncertain about its ability to fulfill demands made by the DoJ, which includes the execution of a security agreement related to the assets of the company to collateralize payments under the settlement.
It said available liquidity was limited to $87.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of March 31 and the company expects to have continued negative cash flows from its operations.
""It may be necessary for the company to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring. Therefore, trading in our securities is highly speculative,"" the company said in a statement. 
Insys' founder, John Kapoor, and four other former Insys executives and managers were found guilty last week of participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Subsys in 2012 only for use in treating severe cancer pain. Yet prosecutors claimed doctors who took bribes often prescribed Subsys to patients without cancer, helping boost sales for Insys. 
The company said it had experienced recurring and increasing losses from operations over the previous 18 months due to significant declines in the transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) market and legal expenses resulting from investigation by the DoJ and other litigation.

The company said its first-quarter net revenue dropped 68% to $7.6 million, while the net loss widened to $123.8 million from a loss of $20.4 million a year earlier. It said the adjusted loss for the first quarter was 55 cents per share.

In a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Bodum said Starbucks had no basis to ""unilaterally"" conduct the May 1 recall because the Bodum + Starbucks presses were not defective and met required specifications.
Bodum also accused Seattle-based Starbucks of creating the impression that Bodum French presses in general are defective, causing a media backlash and ""significant brand damage"" to the Lucerne, Switzerland-based company.
The lawsuit seeks to force Starbucks to pay all costs for the recall and pay damages to Bodum for hurting its reputation.
Starbucks believes Bodum's claims are without merit. In a statement, it said it recalled the French presses because of customer complaints, and stood by the decision because it took employee and customer safety ""very seriously.""
Bodum is among the best-known makers of French presses, and has sold them at Starbucks under a 2002 purchasing agreement.
People use the presses by adding ground beans and hot water to a pot and, after steeping, pushing down on a plunger to make coffee.
Starbucks said it recalled presses sold from November 2016 to January 2019 for about $20 each after receiving nine reports of broken plunger knobs, resulting in lacerations or punctures.
According to the complaint, Starbucks recalled the presses even though laboratory tests found no evidence of product or design defects, because it had become ""particularly sensitive to recall issues"" after paying large fines in an earlier recall.
Bodum also said Starbucks plans to expand the recall to Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, an ""unwarranted"" action that is causing ""unacceptable damage to the Bodum brand worldwide.""

The case is Bodum Holding AG et al v Starbucks Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-04280.

773,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 11:39PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Philip Morris suspends social media campaign after Reuters exposes young 'influencers',"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - Cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) has suspended a global social media marketing campaign in response to Reuters inquiries into the company’s use of young online personalities to sell its new ""heated tobacco"" device, including a 21-year-old woman in Russia.
The company's internal ""marketing standards"" prohibit it from promoting tobacco products with youth-oriented celebrities or ""models who are or appear to be under the age of 25.""
The company told Reuters of the decision late Friday, saying it had launched an internal investigation into marketing posts and photographs that Reuters sent to the company for comment earlier this week.
They included a paid post plugging the tobacco product by social media ""influencer"" Alina Tapilina in Moscow - who listed her age as 21 on Instagram - alongside often seductive photos of herself drinking wine, swimming and posing with little clothing in luxurious settings.
""We have taken the decision to suspend all of our product-related digital influencer actions globally,"" the company told Reuters. ""Whilst the influencer in question is a legal age adult smoker, she is under 25 and our guidance called for influencers to be 25+ years of age. This was a clear breach of that guidance.""
""No laws were broken,"" the company told Reuters. ""However, we set high standards for ourselves and these facts do not excuse our failure to meet those standards in this instance.""
The company added: ""We were deeply disappointed to discover this breach and are grateful that it was brought to our attention.""
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month decided it would allow sales of the IQOS device in the United States after a two-year review process in which Philip Morris repeatedly assured the regulator that it would warn young people away from the product.
The FDA declined to comment Friday evening on Philip Morris's decision to suspend the marketing campaign. The agency earlier said it would ""keep a close watch on ... how the company is marketing its products.""
While most of the social media influencers hired by Philip Morris overseas did not list their ages on Instagram, a Reuters review of the firm's social media marketing of IQOS in Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Russia and Romania shows that Tapilina's online persona was typical of what the company called its social media ""ambassadors"" for the device - rail-thin young women who revel in the high life.
The company did not directly respond to additional questions Friday night regarding the intended audience for its digital influencer campaigns.
Many of the messages contained the hashtag ""#IQOSambassador,"" tying them into a network of social media influencers that the international tobacco giant has relied on to brand the IQOS as a safer alternative to cigarettes and a sexy fashion accessory.
""I finally have the new IQOS 3, and I can confidently say yes to change … the level of harmful substances is on average about 90 percent lower than in smoke,"" Tapilina wrote in an April post. ""You haven't yet switched to IQOS?""
One Romanian IQOS marketer is 25 years old, according to a separate actress biography, but did not list her age on Instagram. Tapilina and nine other IQOS marketers did not respond to requests for comment.
Philip Morris, in its statement to Reuters, said its suspension of the social marketing campaign is ""concrete proof"" of its ""conviction to achieve a smoke-free world through socially responsible practices.""
Matthew Myers, president of The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, had a different take upon hearing of the suspension Friday night. The advocacy group collected some of the IQOS marketing images reviewed by Reuters.
Philip Morris, he said, ""is changing their behavior only when caught red-handed.""
The company, Myers said, has historically been ""the single most successful across the globe in making cigarettes fashionable to young people.""
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!
Over the past year, Philip Morris has increasingly publicized its ""mission"" to prevent young people from using tobacco products. Last month, it issued a release calling on ""all tobacco and e-cigarette companies to do their part to guard against youth nicotine use.""
""Let me be clear: We at Philip Morris International do not, and will not, market or sell our products to youth,"" CEO André Calantzopoulos said during a speech in Boston earlier this month. ""For Philip Morris International, age matters.""
When Philip Morris submitted marketing plans with an FDA application for IQOS in 2017, its sample advertisements featured models appearing at least a decade older and wearing modest, professional clothes.
That application, which is still pending before the FDA, seeks approval to market the IQOS as less harmful than smoking and outlines company plans to ensure it doesn’t market the device to ""non-intended audiences."" The device heats up but does not burn packages of ground-up tobacco, which resemble small cigarettes, to create a nicotine-filled aerosol.
In Japan, the intended audience for IQOS marketing includes the Instagram followers of Ayame Tachibana, a 27-year-old DJ and model. In one post, she shows off a Valentine’s Day message for the IQOS device, lovingly scrawled with multicolored pens.
""Happy Valentine IQOS. Love you sooo much!"" reads the Instagram post from February.
Alina Eremia, a Romanian actress and singer, holds a gold-colored IQOS in front of a Christmas tree.
""My list of resolutions contains 95% fewer moments without a smile,"" says Eremia, who is 25 according to her actress biography on multiple movie and celebrity information websites.
Philip Morris says the IQOS - an acronym for ""I quit ordinary smoking"" – contains up to 95 percent fewer toxic compounds than cigarettes.
Vlad Parvulescu, a manager for Eremia, confirmed she had been hired to promote IQOS and said she had been contacted by a Romanian public relations agency. He did not respond to additional questions about the financial arrangement.
Marketing deals between companies and social media influencers vary widely, according to industry experts. But typically a company will work through third-party public relations or advertising firms that have relationships with online personalities. Compensation typically ranges from $20 to $25,000 or more for each post.
Corporations have become increasingly sophisticated in how they approach their social media campaigns in the past two years, said Joe Gagliese, co-founder of Viral Nation, a marketing and talent agency that works with influencers.
He once had to explain the basic concept of an ""influencer"" in pitch meetings. Now, companies approach him with ""tailor-made decision briefs saying, 'this is exactly what we want.'""
Reuters reviewed dozens of social media posts featuring the IQOS device. Many included hashtags such as #IQOSAmbassador, #paidad, and #notriskfree, indicating that they are IQOS marketing posts. 
Many of the Instagram influencers featuring the products had tens of thousands of followers, and a few had more than a million.
VIRAL CAMPAIGNS, BLURRED LINES
Devices such as IQOS and Juul hold potential as a way for cigarette smokers to transition to less harmful nicotine products, but some public health advocates worry the sleek new devices are addicting young people who would have never smoked cigarettes. Among traditional cigarette smokers, 90 percent start smoking before the age of 18, according to federal data.
Philip Morris said there have been ""no reports"" of ""worrisome levels"" of unintended use of IQOS.
As part of the FDA review process, Philip Morris pledged to market only to adult cigarette smokers once it begins selling IQOS this summer through a partnership with  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the U.S. IQOS delivers about the same level of nicotine as a traditional cigarette.
Altria did not respond to requests for comment.
Social media marketing has become a flashpoint in the debate over regulation of tobacco products, particularly the newest generation of products such as the wildly popular Juul e-cigarettes.
Some of Juul’s early social media and YouTube marketing included images of attractive young people, particularly at a 2015 product launch party. Twitter images from that time on Juul’s official account featured sensual images of a young woman breathing out Juul vapor in a group, next to the slogan, “Share a #Juulmoment.”
Those early campaigns sparked an explosion of video and photo posts from young people showing themselves using the product at school or with friends, often under the hashtags #doit4juul or #juullife. Juul Labs Inc has since said it stopped using social media influencers and requires anyone in its ads to be a former cigarette smoker older than 35.
Juul Labs Inc said in a statement it recognizes that ""some of our earliest marketing initiatives did not fully reflect the goal of our company,"" which it describes as helping cigarette smokers transition to its products. 
""As a young company, we learned from our experiences and instituted changes to help ensure that we are only reaching current adult smokers,"" the company said. 
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
U.S. laws governing tobacco advertising - which is banned on radio and television - were drawn up long before social media and digital advertising became a dominant force in consumer marketing.
Although no current state or federal law restricts tobacco advertising on the Internet - including for e-cigarettes and devices such as IQOS - the FDA can use its authority over new devices to assert sweeping control over a company's marketing.
As a condition for allowing the device to be sold, the FDA is requiring Philip Morris to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches through digital advertising. Philip Morris is also required to submit any new advertising campaigns, including digital and social media efforts, to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them.
Any paid influencers promoting the product also must disclose ""any relationships between you and entities that create labeling for, advertise, market, and/or promote the products, on your behalf, or at your direction.""
Those rules aim to restrict youth access to tobacco marketing, the FDA said in a statement, ""especially in shared digital properties such as social media sites.""

(Reuters) - A week of worsening fears on Wall Street leading up to Washington's increase on tariffs on Chinese goods has taken a toll on stocks that rely heavily on global trade. 
With U.S. President Trump saying he is in no hurry to sign a deal with China, the United States raised its tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10% on Friday, rattling financial markets already worried the 10-month trade war between the world's two largest economies could spiral out of control. China's Commerce Ministry has said it would take countermeasures against the increase in U.S. tariffs. 
""Investors have been getting a little less bullish over the last week or so, and if China does decide to retaliate with tariffs, that's when sentiment can take a dive,"" said Matt Watson, portfolio manager at James Advantage Funds in Alpha, Ohio.
(Graphic: U.S.-China tariff war and the S&P 500 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WA1LWX)
After Trump said last Sunday he was reversing a decision he made in February to keep tariffs at 10%, Wall Street descended from record highs reached at the start of the month.
Although the S&P 500 rose on Friday after more upbeat comments on trade from Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the index ended the week 2.17% lower. Trade-sensitive stocks were bogged down after having outperformed for most of 2019.

775,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>",French prosecutor opens investigation over suspected Monsanto file,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French prosecutor on Friday said it had opened a preliminary investigation into a suspected file assembled by Bayer's seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) to influence various personalities in France.
The probe was opened after a complaint was filed by daily newspaper Le Monde. 
According to Le Monde and other French media, Monsanto built up a file of some 200 names that includes journalists and law makers in the hope of influencing their positions on pesticides.
The file, Le Monde reports, dates from 2016 and was leaked by U.S public relations and marketing agency FleishmanHillard.
Officials at Bayer (DE:BAYGN) were not immediately available for comment.
""FleishmanHillard and our staff are committed to compliance with applicable laws and we are committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We continue to take that responsibility very seriously and will carefully examine the questions raised by certain media outlets about the lists of stakeholders that included publicly available information."" 
Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, faces mounting litigations over its weedkiller Roundup, a systemic, broad-spectrum glyphosate-based herbicide.
A U.S. jury in August 2018 found the company liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to Roundup.

Bayer suffered a similar defeat last month, while more than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. The company said last month it intended to defend itself in all lawsuits.

776,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 06:06PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO search hobbled by pay limitations: sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's hunt for a new CEO is being impeded by limits on how much the bank can pay its next leader, a person close to the search and several industry insiders told Reuters.
A handful of top candidates have already said they would not pursue the job because Wells Fargo is unlikely to meet their pay requirements, said the person, who spoke about private negotiations on the condition of anonymity.
Wells Fargo declined to comment on the search process.
The San Francisco-based bank has been looking for a new leader since March, when Tim Sloan became the second CEO to abruptly depart in the wake of a sales scandal that has badly bruised the bank's reputation and crimped its financial performance.
Wells Fargo's CEO pay package has trailed peers in recent years in the aftermath of a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. Wells Fargo is also the smallest of the top four retail banks by assets.
The board will likely pay the next CEO $15 million-$20 million a year, said Robin Ferracone, the chief executive of compensation consultancy Farient Advisors LLC. That compares with the $25 million that CEOs of top retail banks earned last year on average.
Wells Fargo may also need to set aside funds to match vested shares a candidate has at a current employer, compensation consultants and recruiters said. That could be difficult in an environment where politicians, regulators and investors are closely scrutinizing Wells Fargo.
""If you think about the Wells situation, it has a lot of distressed features to it,"" Ferracone said.
The banking industry faces special restrictions on compensation that regulators imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Relative to other sectors, a bigger portion of executive pay comes in deferred stock, and contracts feature clawback provisions, which require money to be paid back under certain circumstances.
Among peers, Wells Fargo's CEO pay package is at the bottom of the pack.
Sloan's $18.4 million pay package last year compared with $31 million for JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Jamie Dimon, $26.5 million for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's Brian Moynihan and $24 million for  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's Michael Corbat.
Executives in other industries, and even other parts of Wall Street, get paid significantly more.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman, for instance, earned $69.1 million last year. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, a former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) executive considered a solid candidate for a bank CEO role, earned $47.3 million.
Wells Fargo Chair Betsy Duke has said the board wants to attract the ""top talent in banking."" Directors want the next CEO to be an outsider, following critiques from lawmakers that company veterans are incapable of turning things around.
The board has discussed approaching JPMorgan's finance chief, Marianne Lake, as well as Citigroup's head of Latin America, Jane Fraser, Reuters previously reported https://reut.rs/2PvxOo0. They have unvested stock awards worth $18.4 million and $11.2 million, respectively, according to recent filings.
Offering a signing bonus to cover such awards is harder at banks than other types of companies because of heightened scrutiny on the sector, industry experts told Reuters.
Last year, UBS Group AG's Andrea Orcel left the Swiss bank to run  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA. But the deal fell apart after Santander refused to pay Orcel $50 million in deferred compensation he accrued at UBS.
There may be even bigger hurdles in Wells Fargo's case because of the sales scandal that erupted in late 2016. Regulators including the U.S. Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are also closely monitoring progress of its operational overhaul, including executive changes.
The new CEO's pay package is sure to be ""very carefully scrutinized,"" said Evan Stewart, who litigates compensation disputes as a partner at the law firm Cohen & Gresser.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Groups representing major U.S. airlines, airports and travel industry companies on Friday urged U.S. Senate leaders to back additional funding for Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers as the Trump administration said on Friday it was shifting additional officers to the southwestern border.
Airlines for America, representing American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, Fedex Corp and others, joined major U.S. airport groups, the U.S. Travel Association, Global Business Travel Association and the International Air Transport Association, to back additional emergency funding and warned of the impact of shifting more officers from airports and other ports of entry.
""While understandable, a robbing Peter to pay Paul staffing paradigm is unsustainable. The traveling and shipping public should not be subjected to excessive wait times, and we need to avoid inflicting damage on commerce and the overall U.S. economy,"" the letter said.
Last week, the White House sought $4.5 billion for southwestern border operations, citing an influx of people crossing the border.
The Trump administration earlier this year shifted 300 CBP agents to the southern border, the groups said. 
A spokeswoman for CBP confirmed on Friday that the agency ""is deploying an additional 186 CBP officers to assist Border Patrol agents at sectors on the Southwest border.""
The agency noted ""these include CBP officers from Northern border ports, seaports, and airports in order to lessen the impact at any one particular port of entry."" 
CBP informed the aviation and travel groups on Friday of the shift of the officers ""to the southwest border in the coming weeks,"" the letter said, adding CBP indicated ""there's potential for additional diversions.""
The letter noted that, with international travel increasing, a lack of funding ""will certainly put considerable strain on CBP ports, harming both passengers and cargo throughput.""

Major U.S. airports and other business, industry and union groups earlier this month backed Senate legislation unveiled in April that would hire at least 600 new CBP agents annually. The May 1 letter noted significant delays ""can increase supply-chain costs and cause passengers to miss their connections.""

The deal would be Goldman's biggest since the financial crisis and could be announced as soon as Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
The acquisition could be worth $700 million to $750 million, CNBC reported. 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment. United Capital did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
United Capital is a California-based investment advisory firm with independent financial advisers in roughly 90 offices in the United States managing about $23 billion of clients' money. 
Goldman has been ramping up efforts to grow its retail client base and deposits in an effort to diversify its revenue streams and lower its cost of wholesale funding. 
Marcus, the online retail bank Goldman founded in 2016, now holds $46 billion in customer deposits in the United States, a figure executives expect to grow by $10 billion annually.
Later this year, Goldman will launch corporate cash management, which will handle payments and transactions for its corporate clients. The bank will also use the service itself, saving it an estimated $100 million a year.
Acquiring United Capital would give Goldman several thousand affluent and high net worth clients, a wealth bracket the bank currently does not serve. Goldman's private wealth management division works with ultra-rich, and its Ayco business works with corporate executives. 

Ayco recently announced it was expanding an online personal finance service to try to gain the business of its corporate clients' employees.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork's $47 billion valuation as it heads toward what may be the year's largest initial public offering after ride-hailing firm Uber has made the flexible office space start-up the envy of landlords and the target of skeptics at a time when rents have barely kept pace with inflation.
To commercial real estate's old guard, many of whose stock prices have gone sideways or worse for half a decade, WeWork - the main unit of recently renamed The We Company - is a disruptor leading the charge toward the shrinking of workspace with a business model unhindered by property ownership.
To its doubters, WeWork is another unprofitable unicorn they question has the ability to flourish in anything other than a hot economy.
It is a debate that will gather steam in the months ahead should The We Company follow through with an IPO after filing the preliminary paperwork last week. Should it take that step by year end, it would likely be the largest IPO in 2019 after Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
Uber, which is asset light, was valued at about $82.4 billion after its IPO priced on Thursday at the low end of its targeted range. Uber shares closed down 7.6% in their debut on Friday.
WeWork owns little property, preferring instead to lease space others own. Yet its market value is more than twice Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) Inc's $20.2 billion. One of the largest U.S. owners and developers of Class A office buildings, with 196 properties, Boston Properties' share price has gained less than 15 percent in the past five years. 
Being broadly unencumbered by physical assets is a model that makes WeWork more valuable than conventional companies, said Zach Aarons, a co-founder of MetaProp, a New York-based venture capital firm focused on real estate technology.
""Everybody wants to get the same multiple that WeWork has,"" Aarons said. ""Every traditional landlord is saying: 'How do I get the Street to view me more like WeWork?'""
(Graphic: Office REITs vs. S&P 500 since May 2014 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DYFXgo)
'IT'S JUST THE MATH' 
WeWork appeals to start-ups and others that find traditional office leases prohibitively expensive and inefficient. Companies have had to lease more space than they needed to plan for growth and then paid for the space to sit vacant.
But WeWork's biggest impact has been to shatter the long-term lease model, allowing contracts as short as one year while also opening up workspace for individual professionals.
Its lofty valuation comes as the digital economy has slashed demand for office space, making it a renter's market despite robust leasing activity that has been spurred by a U.S. unemployment rate at 50-year lows.
Flex space, or co-working, has been one of the few sources of increasing office demand and its concentration in high-wage tech markets is almost double that of other markets, according to brokerage Colliers International Group Inc.
But WeWork's critics point to its persistent losses and to the risk of relying on revenue from its tenants' short-term contracts to cover its own leases with property owners that can run 10 years or more.
Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at real estate-focused CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia, said many of WeWork's tenants are unprofitable start-ups vulnerable to hard times.
A weak economy will likely reduce the client base and leave WeWork, which reported a $1.93 billion loss on $1.82 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2018, in a bind - much as the dot-com bubble exposed shaky finances in that era's start-ups, he said.
WeWork has been increasing its growing enterprise segment, which comprises companies with more than 1,000 employees, to about one-third of its members at the end of 2018. 
The 2003 U.S. bankruptcy of IWG Plc's Regus, the world's largest flexible workspace operator, is an example of what can go wrong, he said.
""We've seen this business model before,"" he said. ""They don't work well in downturns, it's just the math.""
WeWork declined to comment. 
'CULTURE IS THE NEW CAPITAL'
Nonetheless, flex space is now seen as a long-term feature of the market, brokerage  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE) said.
The ease of renting flex space has driven its acceptance among Fortune 500 corporations while large property owners such as Tishman Speyer and Blackstone's EQ Office now offer curated workplace services under flexible terms.
Today's office tenants have elevated expectations that must be addressed, said Lisa Picard, president and chief executive of EQ Office. ""We want everything, everywhere, all the time.""
The office building, once largely a statement of corporate identity, now is seen as a culture hub for prospective employees who increasingly expect a workplace to offer a range of services, she said. Those can make a difference in a tight job market.
""Talent is calling the shots,"" Picard told the Catalyst 2019 conference last week in New York. ""Culture is the new capital.""
Silicon Valley tech companies realized a decade ago if they wanted their employees to be at their most effective, they had to give them everything they wanted from one place, Rob Speyer, president and CEO of Tishman Speyer. 

""Tech companies built a community in the workplace and that became a critical employee recruitment and retention tool,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, we were all providing four walls and a floor.""

782,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Trump's China Fight Puts New Strains on His Rural Voting Base,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s promise to shield U.S. farmers from the economic pain of an intensified trade war with China indicates he’s ready to dig in on his demands for a deal, a stance that threatens an important part of his political base.
Trump said on Twitter Friday that the U.S. would use revenue from tariffs to buy the output from America’s farms “in larger amounts than China ever did,” even though the administration has yet to dole out all of the $12 billion in aid set aside last year after Beijing slapped retaliatory duties on agricultural products in the first round of the trade war.
The president said the government-purchased farm goods would get shipped “to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.” But he gave no details on how such a program would be administered. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who is in Japan for talks, said in a tweet that the president “directed @USDA to work on a plan quickly.”
The U.S. ramped up tariffs on $200 billion in goods from China Friday and threatened to put duties on more Chinese imports if the two countries can’t reach a deal in the coming weeks. China has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, and the agricultural industry was bracing for another hit.
“You know the retaliation is going to focus on rural areas because that’s his base,” Wallace Tyner, an agricultural economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, said in a telephone interview Friday. “That’s how these trade wars work, the other country always focuses on the adversary’s political base.”
China had made good faith purchases of soybeans as negotiations appeared to progress, Tyner said, but that may cease “if we don’t get a deal and Trump says ‘I don’t care how many months it takes.’"" In that case “agriculture is going to continue to bear the brunt,” he said.
Farm country voted solidly for Trump in 2016 and rural areas of the U.S. have been a backbone for his Republican Party. But residents there are already reeling. Net farm income is projected to total $69.43 billion this year, down some 44 percent from 2013 levels, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Expenses have increased in recent years and they’re saddled with record debt.
Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, the second-biggest U.S. general farm group, expressed concern with Trump’s tweet about buying up farm products.
“That’s a very different thing than assistance to farmers,” Johnson said. He said dumping supplies in other countries could further depress prices and also jeopardize those fragile largely agrarian economies.
Joseph Glauber, former chief economist at USDA, said corn and soybeans are typically animal feed and not food aid, which usually consists of wheat and rice. Such a move also would also invite further trade disputes, since they would likely be judged export subsidies prohibited by WTO, if they weren’t seen as humanitarian aid, Glauber said.
“You can’t just dump grain at concessional prices. That would constitute an export subsidy. That is something the WTO members agreed not to do,” Glauber said.
In the 2017 fiscal year, the Agency for International Development gave 3.12 million tons of foreign food aid valued at $3.62 billion, according to government figures.
Still, Trump’s political allies, and even some critics, are standing behind him in the confrontation with China.
‘Line in the Sand’
GOP Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said he fully supported the president’s stance even though the trade war was hurting businesses and farmers in his district.
""This is a line in the sand that needed to be drawn a long time ago, I’m proud he’s doing it and he deserves our support,"" said Cole, who predicted most Republicans would back the president.
Representative Brad Sherman of California, a longtime hawk on China trade, was among the Democrats who said he’s pleasantly surprised by Trump staying tough on China. He backed the idea of substantial tariffs and spending it on farm and other products impacted by Chinese retaliation.
""Of all the Trump policies, if I had to cheer one, this would be it,"" he said. ""President after president has done nothing.""
Farmers ‘Extremely Concerned’
There is some grumbling among agricultural groups, however.
The National Corn Growers Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers and the American Soybean Association released a joint statement Friday saying that “farmers across the country are extremely concerned by the actions taken today by President Trump and his administration.”
Ethanol, a source of domestic income for corn farmers, also faces steep tariffs from China, drying up exports to one of its largest buyers.
“It’s just one hit after the next for our industry and the rural economy. We will continue pressing the administration to reopen these critical markets,” said Chris Bliley, vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, an ethanol industry trade group.
Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, expressed similar concerns.
“News of the worsening trade conflict with China is yet another punch in the gut to the U.S. ethanol industry and our partners in agriculture,” Cooper said. “The escalating trade war just exacerbates the turmoil in our markets and pushes rural America closer to the precipice.”
Johnson, the National Farmers Union president, said that Trump still retains the support of farmers despite the financial pressures on them.
“There’s still a lot of them that support, but they’re still hurting,” Johnson said. “The bottom line is they’re going broke and they’re going broke fast.”"
783,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",New U.S. Tariffs Are a Setback for P&G Plant in Trump Country,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on goods from China could hurt exactly what the tax was intended to encourage in the first place: more manufacturing on U.S. soil.
Procter & Gamble Co. makes about 90% of the products it sells in the U.S. domestically, sourced from its 25 plants across the country. And it’s building its 26th and largest plant yet in Martinsburg, West Virginia. But an application last year to exempt some equipment for the plant from tariffs is still pending.
“There are a number of pieces of machinery and infrastructure that are made in China that will be subject to tariffs, that will increase the cost of building that new facility,” spokesman Damon Jones said Friday in an interview.
In a September 2018 letter, the company said it wanted “reservoirs, tanks, vats” and other parts for the factory exempt from tariffs. The additional costs would “undermine P&G’s manufacturing competitiveness and future investment decisions to expand U.S. production.”
Aside from 1,800 full-time employees, the plant -- which will stretch about nine Manhattan blocks when it’s completed in 2022 -- is projected to support 1,000 construction jobs, and additional tariffs would “negatively impact new P&G employment in West Virginia,” according to the the letter.
‘Administrative Challenge’
“P&G believes strongly in free trade, because it does help us serve consumers, and puts both us and our international competitors on equal playing ground. Tariffs create a barrier for that,” Jones said. Every time new levies are announced, the company has to go through the exemptions process again. “It’s an administrative challenge,” he said, adding that the company’s positions haven’t changed since the September letter.
Large corporations breathed easier a few months ago when Trump delayed raising tariffs on $200 million of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, on optimism for a deal between the two countries. But as talks broke down and that increase was imposed Friday, the sudden escalation in the trade war has forced companies to again review supply chains to limit their exposure to the higher taxes.
While some companies, like Coach parent Tapestry Inc., have already switched some sourcing to other countries, P&G isn’t likely moving in that direction. “We’ve already sourced for the lowest price, and best quality materials,” Jones said. “If you move things around, there’s also a cost to that.”
Besides the materials for the West Virginia plant, P&G also gets some parts from China for its consumer products including pump dispensers for its Pantene haircare line and some components in Oral-B power toothbrushes and Braun shavers, Jones said.
Whether the costs of higher tariffs will be passed on to customers is still an open issue, he said. “We need to maintain good value for our consumers.”"

But more cautious comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about future trade talks kept a lid on gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.44%, the S&P 500 gained 0.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.08%.
Mnuchin's somewhat sobering message on trade arrived on heels of positive remarks from Trump that trade talks would continue into the future. Trump also left the door open to possibly removing the latest round on hikes on goods imported from Beijing, which went into effect at midnight Friday.
""In the meantime, the United States has imposed Tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!,"" Trump said in a tweet.
The U.S. moved ahead with plans to hike tariffs on $200 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.
Trade-sensitive stocks like  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) ended the day flat.
Beyond trade, energy stocks ended the day modestly higher as U.S. oil prices recovered on bets for a potential drop in global supplies amid sanctions on Iran and ongoing conflict in Libya.
In tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) added to recent losses as investors worried that a rise in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing could hurt China's economy and dent consumer demand. Apple has slumped 6.9% over the last five days, its worst week of trading this year since Trump announced plans to hike tariffs on China.
On the earnings front, market participants had to contend with mixed quarterly results.
Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) plummeted 12.5% after CEO Greg Clark left the company in the wake of first-quarter earnings that fell short of Investing.com's consensus expectations and underwhelming guidance. Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) ended higher despite mixed quarterly results amid a beat on the top line.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded from early losses on Friday to snap a four-day losing streak after U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said trade talks between the United States and China were ""constructive.""
The benchmark S&P 500 index had dropped as much as 1.6% but rebounded from its session lows after Mnuchin spoke positively of the two-day negotiations between the United States and China. It added further to gains after Trump echoed that sentiment in a series of tweets. The index pulled back from the session's highs, however, after Mnuchin said no further trade talks were planned, according to CNBC.
Even with Friday's rebound, though, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their biggest weekly percentage losses of the year.
Recent developments in U.S.-China trade relations, including an increase in U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect on Friday, have led investors to brace for a potential escalation of the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies. That in turn has stoked fears of a global economic slowdown, prompting a flight to low-risk assets such as government bonds.
Yet Friday's comments from the White House kept some investors hopeful of an eventual trade agreement.
""The market is getting that the statements (from Mnuchin and Trump) are more political than indicative of a change in strategy,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. ""Nothing has changed in terms of our investment thesis. In the short term, China needs a trade deal more than the U.S. But in the long term, the U.S. needs it more than China. Effectively, that's a pretty good balance.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 114.01 points, or 0.44%, to 25,942.37, the S&P 500 gained 10.68 points, or 0.37%, to 2,881.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.35 points, or 0.08%, to 7,916.94.
For the week, the Dow fell 2.12%, the S&P 500 declined 2.17% and the Nasdaq shed 3.03%.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc shares dropped 7.6% after having opened below their initial public offering price in the ride-hailing company's long-awaited market debut.
 Symantec Corp  (NASDAQ:SYMC) shares plunged 12.5% after the antivirus software maker issued a profit warning and unexpectedly announced its chief executive officer would step down. 
Shares of chipmakers, which draw much of their revenue from China, finished higher to snap their four-day run of declines, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 5.8% for the week. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.85-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 107 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.44 billion shares, compared to the 6.9 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

But for most Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. financiers who joined at the tail end of its tenure as a private company, not so much.

787,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 04:12PM ET</span>",Mexico Detained 79% More Migrants in April Amid Trump Threats,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico detained thousands more migrants in April than a year ago after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to close the border, representing a shift in focus for the nation’s leftist president away from granting humanitarian visas.
Under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 20,564 people were presented to immigration authorities in April compared with 11,486 in April 2018, an increase of 79%. January to April numbers showed detentions rose 17%, according to data from Mexico’s immigration institute.
The spike in apprehensions comes after Trump threatened to close the border and then on April 2 backed away from the threat, saying he was satisfied that Mexico was rounding up ""large numbers of people at their southern border."" While detentions in March had begun to rise slightly compared to a year earlier, by 8%, they grew far more significantly in April.
The detentions mark a shift for Lopez Obrador, who had campaigned on promises to aid migrants and stand up to Trump, and who had begun his tenure in December promising to substantially increase the number of humanitarian visas he’d grant. AMLO, as he’s known, has still kept to his policy of working with Trump to boost funds to improve Central American development as a way to prevent immigration. And the country is still granting humanitarian visas, but the approval process has become more rigorous.

788,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 03:35PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators approve new Silicon Valley stock exchange,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday approved a new stock exchange that is the brainchild of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, a move that will give high-growth technology companies more options to list their shares outside of the traditional New York exchanges.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the creation of the Long-Term Stock Exchange, or LTSE, a Silicon Valley-based national securities exchange promoting what it says is a unique approach to governance and voting rights, while reducing short-term pressures on public companies.
The LTSE is a bid to build a stock exchange in the country's tech capital that appeals to hot startups, particularly those that are money-losing and want the luxury of focusing on long-term innovation even while trading in the glare of the public markets.
The stock exchange was proposed to the SEC in November by technology entrepreneur, author and startup adviser Eric Ries, who has been working on the idea for years. He raised $19 million from venture capitalists to get his project off the ground, but approval from U.S. regulators was necessary to launch the exchange. 
Friday's decision followed an uncertain fate for LTSE, which had faced SEC opposition before revising parts of its proposal.
Ries says the public market's focus on short-term results leads to a decline in innovation, something LTSE wants to reverse. A 2017 study by public policy think tank Third Way showed that going public was accompanied by a 40 percent decline in patents within five years after listing, the result of pressure to satisfy analysts' short-term expectations. 
""Everyone is incentivized to make the numbers quarter to quarter,"" Ries said in a recent interview with Reuters.
The new exchange would have extra rules designed to encourage companies to focus on long-term innovation rather than the grind of quarterly earnings reports by asking companies to limit executive bonuses that award short-term accomplishments. 
It would also require more disclosure to investors about meeting key milestones and plans, and reward long-term shareholders by giving them more voting power the longer they hold the stock.
LTSE would be the only stock exchange in California and the first in Silicon Valley since the shuttering of the Pacific Exchange in San Francisco at the end of the dot-com boom. It remains to be seen how well it would compete with the larger and better-resourced New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which often court tech companies with fanfare to persuade them to list. 
Ries wants companies to go public sooner and have the ability to continue experimenting. This way, he said, more value can be created in the public markets, giving retail investors a chance to cash in on high-growth startups. 
The median age of tech startups going public has stretched to 12 years, and by the time they list have achieved most of their growth, enriching only an elite group of investors.

Ries said LTSE would allow companies to dual-list their stock on other exchanges. He added that a number of technology companies and a mix of foreign and U.S. investors and asset managers had signed letters of intent to participate in the exchange, but declined to provide further details.

790,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 03:21PM ET</span>","After Tough Winter, Canada’s Economy Shows Signs of Strength","(Bloomberg) -- The Canadian economy is starting to come around.
A report Friday from Statistics Canada showed April was the best month on record. A day earlier, the agency released figures showing long-suffering exporters finally had a good month in March, and there are signs consumers are still spending, even amid concerns over bloated debt loads and the overall outlook.
“So much for the soft Canadian economy,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note to investors. “There was a spring in Canada’s step.”
The positive signals will be a relief to policy makers, who have been anticipating a rebound and waiting for the evidence to catch up. With an election five months away, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wasted little time touting his Liberal government’s role in the booming labor market.
Yet, until this week, the labor market had been about only thing giving policy makers comfort. Analysts had warned as recently as last month that Canada ran the risk of falling into a recession amid a perfect storm of negativity -- falling oil prices, volatile financial markets, higher interest rates, cooling housing markets and global trade tensions.
Global trade tensions, meanwhile, curtailed business spending. To cap it off, the country’s colder-than-normal winter chilled everything from rail transportation to home building.
The recent slump saw the economy grow just 0.1 percent in the final three months of 2018. While gross domestic product data for the first quarter won’t be released until later this month, the Bank of Canada believes there wasn’t any improvement to start 2019. There have been few more sluggish back-to-back quarters.
But the outlook is turning around.
Oil is recovering, housing looks to be stabilizing and the nation’s indefatigable consumers are still spending. For example, Thursday’s trade data showed a sharp increase in imports of consumer goods, a possible sign of healthy domestic demand.
“The Canadian consumer is really alive and well here, considering how indebted they are,” Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, said in a phone interview.
The surge in employment in April augurs well for more spending. Employment rose by 106,500 in April, Statistics Canada said, the biggest one-month increase in data going back to 1976. Canada has added 426,400 jobs over the past year and 700,000 jobs in two years.
That said, even if growth picks up in the coming quarters, no one expects a boom. The Bank of Canada sees growth maxing out at about 2 percent by next year, partly due to the constraints of high household debt levels. That’s a low rate of growth by historical standards, but much better than some had feared.

Tsipras, 44, reaffirmed his control, securing 153 votes late Friday in Greece’s 300-seat chamber, after a stormy debate in the parliament ahead of the triple ballot and a general election that must take place by October at the latest.
The vote was triggered after opposition leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the New Democracy party requested a censure motion against Alternate Health Minister Pavlos Polakis, when the latter launched an attack on Twitter against Stelios Kympouropoulos, a New Democracy candidate for the European elections. Tsipras decided to turn that motion into a confidence vote for the full government in order to protect his minister.
Polakis has said that Kympouropoulos, who suffers from spinal muscular disease and is confined to a wheelchair, was able to secure a job in the public sector as a psychiatrist only because of a law to help people with disabilities.
The ruling Syriza party is lagging in all polls. Tsipras on Tuesday, just a day before the confidence vote debate began, announced a number of handouts that the government claims will help the people who suffered the most during the economic crisis.
Tsipras is betting that the measures will help reduce New Democracy’s current lead in opinion polls. If the bet pays off, some government members say the premier should consider calling national elections as soon as late June or early July."
792,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 03:01PM ET</span>",Fed Officials Warn Rising Inequality Is Threat to U.S. Economic Vigor Long Term,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials offered a damning take on rising inequality in America and the corrosive effects it can have on the economy.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard told a conference audience in Washington on Friday that the long-term vigor of the U.S. economy may be at risk as middle class households are squeezed by slow growth in income and wealth and rising costs for housing, health care and education.
“An economy that delivers an increasing share of income gains to high-wealth households could result in less growth in consumer demand than one in which the gains are distributed more equally,” she said.
Addressing local bankers at a breakfast event in the Bronx, New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) sounded a similar note while responding to questions after a speech.
Rising inequality “is undermining, I believe, much of what makes our country great in terms of economics,” he said, pointing to a slowdown in business formation and productivity growth over the last few decades. “There are a lot of dimensions to this, but I think our economy really is not reaching its full potential because of these issues,” he said.
Declaring that the Fed’s mandate to deliver full employment has served the U.S. well, Brainard said wage growth has begun to pick up after years of slow gains. That’s especially important for middle class families which don’t have many other sources of income.
She said though it was “concerning” that the share of total national income going to wage earners has been in a long-term decline.
Multiple Challenges
Drawing in part on new data compiled by the Fed, Brainard sketched out some of the challenges confronting the middle class:
One bright spot highlighted by Brainard: Average Americans may be better prepared for retirement than previously thought. That’s because of new data that factors in the expected value of defined benefit pension plans.
Still, with employers shifting away from such plans, it’s perhaps not surprising that many middle-income adults voice concern about their readiness for retirement, according to Brainard.
“In recent years, households at the middle of the income distribution have faced a number of challenges,’’ Brainard said. “That raises the question of whether middle-class living standards are within reach for middle-income Americans in today’s economy.’’
It also raises broader questions about America’s future.
“A strong middle class is often seen as a cornerstone of a vibrant economy and, beyond that, a resilient democracy,’’ she said.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's shares made a disappointing market debut on Friday, marking a rocky start for the most anticipated initial public offering of the year as other high-profile startups such as Slack and WeWork look to go public.
The fall in shares undermined Uber's strategy of pricing its oversubscribed IPO conservatively at $45 per share to avoid a repeat of rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's stock market struggles following a strong debut in March.
The company's shares opened at $42 and fell as much as 9% to a low of $41.06 in early trading before recovering most of their losses to trade down 2.5% at $43.92 by 1805 GMT. Lyft was down 4%, well below its IPO price.
Uber's IPO comes against the backdrop of a spike in trade tensions between the United States and China that has weighed on financial markets and increased investor skepticism about its ability to turn profitable soon enough.
Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who was on the NYSE trading floor to mark the debut, tried to calm investors by pointing to the company's growth prospects and expansion plans.
""My reaction (to the share price) is if we build and build well, shareholders will be rewarded. We're certainly not measuring our success over a day, it really is over the years,"" Khosrowshahi said.
The IPO was a landmark moment for the decade-old company, which was started after its founders struggled to find a cab on a snowy night and grown into the world's largest ride-hailing company, making more than 10 billion trips.
Khosrowshahi was accompanied by a team of Uber officials at the NYSE to celebrate the start of the company's life as a listed entity. Co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned in 2017 under pressure from investors, was also seen on the trading floor.
The company's road to IPO was marred by several hurdles including increased regulations in several countries and fights with its drivers over wages.
Uber has said that it has the potential to grow not just in the cab hailing business, but also as a ""superapp"" to provide a variety of logistic services, such as grocery and food delivery, organizing freight transportation, and even financial services, much like Grab, its Southeast Asian counterpart.
But market experts have struggled to find value in a company that has consistently posted losses, and warned that it may never actually be profitable.
""The business is unprofitable, new entrants can enter the market, there is potential regulatory risk, and it is very price sensitive. What is there to like about this opportunity?"" Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Heider College of Business, Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska said.
Uber's debut and its coming days of trading will be closely watched by other high profile startups looking to tap into public money, including flexible office space firm WeWork and workplace messaging app-owner Slack Technologies Inc. Both companies have confidentially filed for IPOs.
As a private company, Uber has raised more than $15 billion from investors to fuel its growth and expansion into food delivery and freight hauling, with little regard for turning a profit. Uber reported a loss of $3.03 billion in 2018 from operations.
""We are willing to give quite a bit of rope and leeway on current profitability if you can show how you're going to get there,"" said Jordan Stuart, a portfolio manager at Federated Kaufmann who often purchases companies' shares during an IPO.
As a public company, Uber will have to deal with quarterly earnings reports and demands from shareholders to plot a path to profitability.

The company weathered controversies including the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, which culminated in the resignation of Kalanick. Uber eventually hired Khosrowshahi to lead the company.

Popolare di Bari, the largest bank in Italy's underdeveloped south, has long been seen as a potential headache for the Rome government, which already faces the risk of a state bailout of rival Carige after U.S. asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) pulled out of a rescue plan for the Genoa-based lender. 
Popolare di Bari said it had booked written down assets for 382 million euros last year, pushing its core capital ratio down to 7.86% compared with an 8.83% requirement set by the Bank of Italy.
As part of measures it will submit to the regulator to seek to beef up its capital reserves, Popolare di Bari said it had approved the sale of a portfolio of energy sector loans to Glennmont Partners and would also sell the risk on a home mortgage portfolio to Christofferson, Robb & Co.

On Friday, the United States increased its tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, rattling financial markets already worried the 10-month trade war between the world's two largest economies could spiral out of control.
So far this year, only two vessels have gone from the United States to China - one in January and one in February - versus 14 during the first four months of 2018 before the start of the trade war.
For a graphic on U.S. LNG shipments to China, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2LB9nXV.
The data, however, shows a handful of vessels from the United States are still sailing across the Pacific Ocean and some could end up in China.
In 2018, 27 LNG vessels went from the United States to China, down from 30 in 2017. Most of those, however, left U.S. ports before the trade war started, with 18 tankers going to China in the first half of the year and just nine during the second half.
Executives at Cheniere Energy Inc, which owns two of the three big operating U.S. LNG export terminals, said this week that the trade war is ""unproductive and creates some added costs for our Chinese consumers"" but ""hasn't had an impact on us"" and is not expected to have an impact going forward.
The United States and China started imposing tariffs on each other's goods in July 2018. As the dispute heated up, China added LNG to its list of proposed tariffs in August and imposed a 10-percent tariff on LNG in September.
The United States is the fastest-growing LNG exporter in the world, while China is the fastest-growing importer of the fuel.
U.S. LNG sales jumped 61 percent in 2018 versus 2017, making the country the fourth-biggest exporter in the world, while China, the world's second-biggest buyer of the fuel, increased its purchases by 39 percent last year as it weans its power and industrial sectors off coal to reduce pollution, according to data from the International Gas Union.

805,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 12:46PM ET</span>","Viacom profit beats on cost cuts, success of 'Bumblebee'","By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Media company Viacom Inc beat quarterly profit estimates on Friday, as costs fell and its Paramount Pictures division gained from the success of its movies ""Bumblebee"" and ""What Men Want"".
The Transformers movie spin-off ""Bumblebee"" has so far raked in more than $467 million globally, according to Box Office Mojo, while romantic comedy ""What Men Want"" has earned more than $72 million.
Since taking the helm in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish has focused on Paramount Pictures and the company's cable TV business, which like its sister company CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS), has been facing competition from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Prime video.
""Paramount CEO...has done a commendable job thus far in righting the ship, and view the move into TV production as a positive given the voracious demand for TV content by networks and streaming platforms,"" Cowen and Co analysts said.
However, revenue at the unit that houses Paramount Pictures fell 1% to $730 million and missed estimates, weighed down by lower licensing revenue that offset higher income from its movie business. 
Brokerage Cowen said it sees more challenges for Viacom's movie business, given that it has fewer successful films.
The profit beat, which was also helped by a more than 11% drop in costs, sent the shares of the company up 1.4% in afternoon trading.
Viacom also looks to benefit from its recent acquisition of its ad supported streaming service Pluto TV, which had 16 million monthly active users by the end of April.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) recently included Pluto TV in its internet streaming video service called Xfinity Flex and said its set top box that links TV and internet Xfinity X1 will also soon have the streaming service. 
Revenue from media networks, which includes advertising sales and affiliate fees, fell to $2.27 billion and missed estimates of $2.32 billion. 
Both Viacom and CBS, controlled by National Amusements, are expected to rekindle merger talks after CBS suspended the search for a permanent CEO and extended the role of its interim CEO Ianniello, sparking speculation about the company considering a tie-up with Viacom for the third time.
Net income attributable to Viacom rose more than 41% to 93 cents in the second quarter ended March 31. Excluding items, Viacom earned 95 cents per share and beat expectations of 80 cents. 
Total revenue fell over 6% to $2.96 billion and missed estimates of $3.06 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

LVMH said on Friday that the launch, rumored for several months, was ""fast approaching"", with the first looks set to be presented in Paris before the summer. 
The French group has increasingly exploited collaborations with celebrities as well as streetwear designers to attract young customers of luxury goods. 
But most ventures of the sort have been restricted to limited editions, and LVMH is looking to steal a march on peers by taking its pairing with 31-year-old Rihanna to another level. 
It is the first label the acquisitive group - also home to storied couture houses such as Christian Dior and Givenchy - has fully created since Christian Lacroix's eponymous brand launched in 1987, It eventually sold that on in 2005 after it struggled to ever turn a profit. 
Known for her bold fashion statements at red carpet events, Rihanna is followed almost as much for her style as her music, and had already worked with other labels including sportswear brand Puma on collections under the Fenty name. 
These included pastel-colured sneakers with large bows and cropped hoodies. The singer has collaborated with shoemaker Manolo Blahnik and has a lingerie range called Savage X Fenty. 
Fenty Beauty, launched under LVMH's umbrella in September 2017, had reached nearly 500 million euros ($562 million) in sales by the end of 2018.
Analysts attribute its success to an offering that included a very wide range of skin tones, catering to a more diverse audience than many make-up brands historically had. 
LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said in a statement that the group would support Rihanna with a team and resources, though it did not give any financial details. 
The group reported 46.8 billion euros ($52.58 billion) in sales in 2018, up 10% on 2017. 
LVMH had considered the project for the past three years, a source familiar with the matter said. The brand will be essentially an e-commerce-only venture, supported with temporary ""pop-up"" events rather than a store network. 
It will also be able to rely on Rihanna's social media credentials - the singer has amassed 70.5 million followers under her Instagram handle ""badgalriri"". 

""Thank you Mr Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island,"" Rihanna said on Twitter.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's stock slumped to a record low on Friday as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), another company hemorrhaging billions of dollars, fell in its Wall Street debut.
Uber fell 8% from the $45 price set in its IPO late on Thursday, which valued the company at roughly $82 billion, just above the $76 billion valuation it attained in its last private funding round
Smaller Lyft saw its shares drop 6% to $%51.79. Lyft's 27% slump from the price in its March 28 IPO, and Uber's drop immediately at the start of trading in its shares, underscore many investors' trepidation about the two ride-hailing companies that have not said when they will become profitable.
""Uber is considered the leader and the one in the strongest market position. If investors are not getting behind it on the lower valuation, that creates a challenge for the smaller Lyft in investors’ minds,"" said Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian. 
Uber lost $3 billion in 2018 from operations, while Lyft lost $1.1 billion in the March quarter of 2019.

Lyft's falling stock this week put pressure on Uber as it finalized the price of the most anticipated IPO since Facebook's debut in 2012.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's shares fell nearly 9% in their debut on Friday, marking a rocky start to one of the most high-profile U.S. initial public offerings since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's seven years ago.
The stock's opening at $42 undermined Uber's strategy to price its oversubscribed IPO conservatively at $45 per share to avoid a repeat of rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's stock market struggles following a strong debut in March.
The lackluster market response comes against the backdrop of a spike in trade tensions between the United States and China and increased investor skepticism about the company's ability to turn profitable soon enough.
The IPO marks a landmark moment for the decade-old company, which was started after its founders struggled to find a cab on a snowy night and grown into the world's largest ride-hailing company, making more than 10 billion trips.
Led by Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi, a team of Uber officials were on the NYSE trading floor to mark the start of the day's trading. Co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned in 2017 under pressure from investors, was also on seen on the trading floor.
The company's road to IPO was marred by several hurdles including increased regulations in several countries and fights with its drivers over wages.
Uber has said that it has the potential to grow not just in the cab hailing business, but also as a ""superapp"" to provide a variety of logistic services, such as grocery and food delivery, organizing freight transportation, and even financial services, much like Grab, its Southeast Asian counterpart.
As a private company, Uber has raised more than $15 billion from investors to fuel its growth and expansion into food delivery and freight hauling, with little regard for turning a profit. Uber reported a loss of $3.03 billion in 2018 from operations.
But as a public company, it will have to deal with quarterly earnings reports and demands from shareholders to plot a path to profitability.

The company weathered controversies including the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber to a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation, which culminated in the resignation of Kalanick.

810,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 12:06PM ET</span>","Etihad submits bid for India's Jet, eyes minority stake","By Stanley Carvalho, Abhirup Roy and Aftab Ahmed
ABU DHABI/MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Middle Eastern carrier Etihad Airways has submitted a bid for a stake in India's Jet Airways, the unit of State Bank of India (SBI) overseeing the sale of the stricken airline said on Friday.
SBI had invited binding bids for a stake in the airline, which is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion in bank debt. Binding offers were due by 1800 IST (1230 GMT) on Friday.
Etihad, which already holds a minority stake in Jet, is interested in re-investing in the airline, subject to certain conditions, a spokesman for the Middle Eastern carrier said earlier on Friday. 
However, he added that Etihad ""cannot be expected to be the sole investor"" and ""additional suitable investors would need to provide the majority of Jet Airways' required recapitalisation.""
Etihad gave no indication whether it was working with any other investors that might take a majority stake in Jet. 
Once India's largest private airline, Jet was crippled by mounting losses as it tried to compete with low-cost rivals IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd. 
Jet, which also owes vast sums to its lessors, pilots, fuel suppliers and other parties, stopped all flights from April 17 after its lenders, led by SBI, refused to extend more funds to keep the carrier flying.
Etihad was among four investors that submitted initial bids for the airline last month. The others were private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners and Indian wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).
SBI has also received two unsolicited, non-binding bids for Jet, the bank's Chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters, after a news conference on Friday, adding it had no plans at this time to drag the airline into a bankruptcy process
""(We've) made disproportionate efforts to keep Jet flying,"" Kumar said. 
Jet for several months tried to convince investors, including Etihad, to pump in money and save the airline. But several potential investors had at least one condition - Jet's founder and former chairman Naresh Goyal must cede control.
When Jet failed to garner interest, the banks, led by SBI, moved in with a rescue plan which was first announced in February and put into action in March after Goyal stepped down.
""A few unsolicited offers have also been received which the lenders may deliberate upon subsequently,"" SBI Capital Markets said in a statement without giving further details.
LOSSES AND LOANS
Analysts are sceptical the sale process will succeed.
""The process of bidding and winning isn't so easy,"" said HDFC Securities analyst Deepak Jasani. ""Day by day, losses and loans are rising at Jet, the more the process is delayed the more the situation becomes irreparable,"" he said. 
While the bid process was on, Jet was forced to vacate its offices at many airports across the country and employee access was revoked. Lessors also forced Jet to ground dozens of planes over non-payment of dues and it is left with just 13 aircraft, a senior SBI source told Reuters. 
At its peak, 26-year-old Jet operated over 120 planes and well over 600 daily flights, flying Bollywood film-stars, politicians and business tycoons across India and the world.

If a deal fails to materialise, the airline could be dragged into bankruptcy by creditors, putting thousands of jobs at risk.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission's plan for a wifi-based standard for cars endorsed by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) faces a two-month delay as EU countries wait for legal advice on the proposal, giving a glimmer of hope to backers of the rival 5G technology.
Envoys from the 28 EU countries met on Wednesday and agreed to extend their review of the Commission's plan by two months after 15 countries asked for more time to allow the EU Council's lawyers to examine the issue, people familiar with the matter said.
The extension will kick in on May 13 following formal approval by EU countries on that day. The delay is not expected to derail the Commission's proposal, with only Spain and Finland expressing concerns. 
Internet connected cars are expected to generate billions of euros in revenue for carmakers, telecoms operators and equipment makers once the market takes off.
Last month EU lawmakers gave the thumbs up to a wifi-based standard, which primarily connects cars to other cars. Supporters include  Renault  (PA:RENA), Toyota, NXP, Autotalks and Kapsch TrafficCom. 
Daimler, Ford, PSA Group, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Huawei, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Samsung (KS:005930) are lobbying for the 5G standard which hooks up to both cars and devices in the surrounding environment, and has a bigger range of applications.
Mobile telecoms operators lobbying group GSMA said there were a number of disputed points in the Commission's proposal.
""We expect the Council legal service (CLS) to be critical about this piece of legislation as it lays down a de facto mandate for wifi whereas the Commission should remain technology neutral,"" Joop Hazenberg, GSMA's director, said. 
""There are also other strong doubts of the CLS on the Delegated Act, such as the Commission giving itself powers it does not have.""
The Commission's proposal can only be overturned with a blocking majority of EU countries.

The carmaker, whose number of employees has more than doubled over the past decade to about 43,000, confirmed it was reviewing staff and other costs to ensure its business had the ""right skills"".
""As a growing company Volvo Cars is constantly reviewing its cost base. This becomes even more important in light of the headwinds the industry is facing and Volvo Cars is now increasing its focus on costs related to staffing and bought services,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
The jobs primarily affected were those of consultants and staff involved in factory production will not be affected, a Volvo spokesman said. 
He declined to specify the number of job cuts and savings expected from the layoffs.
Volvo's fortunes have come under renewed threat with the car sector facing one of its most challenging periods due to trade conflicts, hefty bills to develop electric and driverless cars, and an overall downturn in the industry.
The company, which has put its listing plans on ice due to the tariff wars and auto stock downturn, has reported lower first-quarter profit and warned that margins will remain under pressure this year.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tweets on Sunday night, threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese imports, upended the previously calm market and wiped roughly $2 trillion from global equities this week.
""Risk pullback since May 1st highs follows furious rally, initiated by less-dovish PBoC/Fed, accelerated by trade trauma this week,"" the bank's strategists said, referring to central bank policies of the People's Bank of China and Federal Reserve.
The cash leaving stocks in the week to May 8 was the third biggest outflow so far this year, the bank said, and came as Trump threatened further import tariffs on Chinese goods, ratchetting up the prolonged trade spat between the world's two largest economies.
U.S. equities had outflows of $14 billion, the biggest since Jan. 30, BAML said, citing data from flow tracking specialist EPFR. The S&P 500 has risen 14.5% year-to-date.
Investors, seeking shelter from the trade dispute, kept pumping money into bonds, which saw inflows of $7.3 billion, making it the eighteenth straight week of inflows.

817,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 11:48AM ET</span>",Berkshire's Brooks Running unit adapts as the science of running evolves,"By Jonathan Stempel
OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Preventing injuries from running shoes is a science for Jim Weber, the chief executive of Brooks Running, a unit of Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa)
""The worst nightmare is to get injured,"" Weber said in an interview during Berkshire's recent annual shareholder weekend.
""You can't run the marathon you signed up for, or you take away the thing that makes you sane, that makes your day better,"" he said. ""We've always been based on the biomechanics of your body, and building shoes around that.""
Weber, 59, became chief executive of the then money-losing Brooks in 2001, and quickly scrapped almost its entire product line, to focus only on running.
Berkshire's Fruit of the Loom unit bought Brooks' parent Russell Corp in 2006, and Seattle-based Brooks was spun out as a separate company in March 2012.
That left Weber reporting to Buffett, who could also call on guidance from the billionaire's portfolio managers Todd Combs, a triathlete, and Ted Weschler, a marathoner.
""Having his ear to talk about your brand and business is pretty powerful,"" Weber said, referring to Buffett. ""We had our 100th anniversary in 2014, and he came out to Brooks and did a town hall with 600 people. He got it. He just totally got it.""
CONTRARIAN
Weber said Brooks' success stems in part from its willingness to buck trends.
He pointed to 2009, when a book called ""Born to Run"" sparked a ""barefoot running"" frenzy where minimalist, slipper-like shoes weighing a few ounces began capturing market share.
""It blamed  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) for creating that 12-millimeter heel, and said everyone should be running barefoot and that injuries should come from shoes,"" Weber said. ""There was no research on any of that, but it created a big conversation.""
Brooks' reaction?
""In the 2008 financial crisis and recession that followed, we saw that people were still running,"" Weber said. ""Unemployment was booming in Europe, but running made the cut. What we did in a flattish year in a tough economy was double our investments.""
Brooks' next big contrarian move was in 2015 and 2016, as consumers began shopping more online and became more price-conscious. Eight hundred stores that sold Brooks shoes, including the Sports Authority chain, closed.
""We doubled down on performance, we doubled down on premium price, and we invested in R&D,"" Weber said. ""That reset was huge for us.""
Revenue, including apparel, rose 26% last year to $644 million, and Weber said it could near $750 million this year and $1 billion in 2021.
SHOE CHANGES
Many Brooks customers are now also seeing a big change in what they buy.
Pronation is the natural tendency of a foot to roll inward as it strikes the ground.
Brooks, like many rivals, long addressed this by putting firmer wedges on the medial side of many shoes' midsoles, using a ""progressive diagonal rollbar"" on its flagship Adrenaline.
Five years of research after the barefoot phenomenon has changed that thinking, Weber said.
""The No. 1 injury related to running is your knee,"" he said. ""If you deviate a lot when you put two or three times your body weight down, you need some support.""
Brooks' Adrenaline now addresses this with external supports, called GuideRails, to control excess movement. The Beast, among Brooks' most stable shoes, will get them later.
""All that research has led us to reinvent how we're building the geometry of the shoe,"" Weber said. ""GuideRails works better for that severe foot movement that causes knee torque than the rollbar did. GuideRails is a better system for running.""
Though recently injured, Weber normally runs 15 to 18 miles a week - ""I think I'm the slowest guy at Brooks"" - and has a common way to fuel up, though perhaps not wind down.

""Before and after, I love coffee,"" he said. ""Especially in the morning. And after, you've got to have a banana.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) will embark on a fresh restructuring and list elevators, its most successful business, after regulatory opposition sunk plans to hive off its steel division, unravelling its previous break-up proposal.
Under pressure from activist investors, Thyssenkrupp had tried to merge its steel unit with Tata Steel's European operations and split the rest of the conglomerate in two to highlight the value of its industrial businesses.
But after about three years in the planning, Thyssenkrupp and India's Tata ditched the steel joint venture on Friday, saying they were not prepared to offer further concessions to satisfy European anti-trust regulators.
At the same time, the steel-to-submarines group abandoned a plan to spin off its capital goods business - car parts, plant engineering and elevators - following a collapse in its share price since it announced the scheme in September.
""Under these conditions, a separation is no longer the best solution for Thyssenkrupp. We can no longer achieve the restart we intended,"" Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said.
Thyssenkrupp said it would now cut 6,000 jobs or 4% of its workforce, a third of them in the steel division, and pursue an initial public offering of the elevator business, worth an estimated 14 billion euros ($16 billion), twice the parent group's market value.
At the same time, Thyssenkrupp said it will be open to new ownership structures for its car parts, plant engineering and marine systems units, adding this could result in it owning a minority stake in them.
It expects to keep a majority of its steel and materials trading divisions in the long-term.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp jumped by as much as 28% on the news, first reported by Reuters, setting them on track for their best day ever. Tata Steel shares closed down 6.2%.
Thyssenkrupp has faced investor calls for a more radical group overhaul for years, with the criticism largely aimed at its sprawling conglomerate structure.
The company said its new plan, which involves introducing a holding structure to allow more flexible management of its varied portfolio and will be voted on by its supervisory board on May 21., would lead to a net loss for the year.
Meanwhile, Tata Steel said it would explore all options for its European business, including finding a new partner and selling assets.
FAILED STRATEGY
Thyssenkrupp counts activist investor Cevian, which has an 18 percent stake, and Elliott, which has a smaller holding in the conglomerate, among its shareholders, with both having long demanded operational improvements.
""It is clear that Thyssenkrupp's strategy of the past has failed,"" Cevian founding partner Lars Foerberg said.
The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Stiftung, Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder with a 21 percent stake, said it would assess the proposals, adding it wanted to safeguard jobs and a sustainable ability to pay dividends.
Thyssenkrupp's net debt had nearly doubled to 4.68 billion euros by the end of its fiscal first quarter, compared with the end of its 2017/2018 business year - more than 4 times its expected adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) for the current fiscal year. 
Its dividend has remained stagnant at 0.15 euros per share since 2014/15.
Pressure from investors seeking to realise greater value by breaking up conglomerates led  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) to spin off its healthcare business and Siemens to announce it will separate its gas turbines business.
Kerkhoff's idea at Thyssenkrupp was to separate higher quality capital goods operations of elevators, auto suppliers and core plant construction from its other more cyclical businesses.
He said he would now ""swiftly prepare"" but wait for the right moment for an elevators IPO, in which Thyssenkrupp would initially keep a majority. The group said it wants to be market-ready in the new financial year, which starts in October.
""All stakeholders now believe that a fundamentally new direction is urgently needed to give the company's businesses a future. There can be no historical or political taboos ... if Thyssenkrupp wants to sincerely tackle underperformance and get the businesses back to growth,"" Cevian's Foerberg said.
Specialised businesses are often more highly valued than conglomerates because in times of growth, high-potential assets do not have to compete for the combined balance sheet with businesses offering lower returns.
But rising trade tensions between the United States and China, and fears of a disorderly Brexit have dented share prices, forcing companies including Continental and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to review plans for spin offs and listings.
Thyssenkrupp said it now expects to post adjusted earnings before interest and tax of 1.1 billion euros to 1.2 billion euros, and to post negative cashflow in the high three-digit million euros range for the 2018/2019 year.

819,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>","Following opioid suits, family behind deadly OxyContin squabbles","By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A united front among members of the billionaire Sackler family behind painkiller OxyContin is showing signs of strain from litigation over who bears responsibility for the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic.
At least twice in recent months, eight members of the Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP have been at odds over how to respond to allegations implicating them in deceptive marketing of prescription painkillers that led to widespread fatal overdoses, said people familiar with the matter.
The family members have split into two groups that their advisers dub the “A side” and “B side,” the people said.
One point of contention centers on how aggressively former Purdue President Richard Sackler should disavow emails he had written years earlier that maligned opioid addicts, a debate that came to a head in anticipation of a critical segment on HBO’s news satire “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.”
Another disagreement surfaced over legal defense tactics, with a lawyer for one faction initially counseling against Purdue settling an Oklahoma case in favor of a bankruptcy filing that would halt lawsuits.
The family dynamics will likely influence how the Sacklers resolve roughly 2,000 lawsuits by cities, counties and states alleging Purdue pushed prescription painkillers on unsuspecting doctors and patients while concealing their addiction and overdose risks.
The Sacklers, longtime philanthropists worth an estimated $13 billion, are attempting to reach a settlement covering all the litigation and will need to agree among themselves how much to pay. U.S. communities are seeking billions of dollars in damages to address harm from opioids, and settlement discussions will help determine how much money they get.  
The lawsuits, which in recent months have targeted the Sacklers in addition to Purdue, claim the family and company contributed to a public health crisis that claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Family members declined to be interviewed by Reuters about their internal debates.
“In any family or business grappling with important choices, it is normal for a range of opinions to be discussed and options presented,” the two Sackler contingents said in a joint statement. “This internal discussion is necessary for reaching the right decisions in a collaborative way, and in no way signifies a split within our family,” the statement said.
“The reality is that we are united in both our deep desire to help address today’s crisis of drug addiction and in our knowledge that we did not cause this complex public health crisis. We all hope to resolve the many lawsuits through a fair global resolution” that steers settlement funds to affected communities, the family’s statement added.
This account of some of their deliberations is based on court records and interviews with several people close to the family’s discussions. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversations.
Purdue declined to address the Sacklers’ private talks. It has noted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved labels for the company’s opioids that carried warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied allegations in lawsuits that they contributed to the opioid crisis, and have pointed to heroin and fentanyl as more significant culprits than prescription painkillers.
“A SIDE” vs “B SIDE”
According to court records and people familiar with the matter, the two Sackler factions each comprise relatives of the late Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, two of three brothers, all doctors, who purchased a Purdue predecessor in 1952.

In a June 2018 lawsuit, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey named the eight Sacklers making up the two factions, targeting their role serving on Purdue's board. 
In January, she disclosed details of emails and other internal records that alleged the Sacklers masterminded aggressive opioid sales despite knowledge of their harmful effects.
The Sacklers together countered in court papers that they were typical, passive board members who approved routine management requests rather than micromanaging the marketing of OxyContin. Still, the allegations eventually prompted various renowned museums in New York and London to shun donations from the family.
In March, a critical family debate ensued about how to resolve a separate, longstanding lawsuit against Purdue brought by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter.
There were two options for averting a trial slated for late May. One was settling the lawsuit. The other was putting Purdue into bankruptcy court, which would halt the Oklahoma case and other litigation. 
David Bernick, a lawyer from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP representing the ""B"" side, initially counseled against settling the Oklahoma lawsuit, people familiar with the matter said. He was concerned thousands of other plaintiffs would seize upon a financial figure in any agreement and demand costly settlements themselves, they said.
The better option, he felt, would be for Purdue to seek bankruptcy protection and negotiate with Hunter and other litigants under the supervision of a judge in Chapter 11 proceedings.
Advisers on Mortimer’s ""A"" side of the family argued for settling, confident that the agreement’s structure would combat expectations from other plaintiffs for similar financial sums.
Ultimately, both sides of the family united to contribute $75 million toward settling the Oklahoma case, which helped finance a national addiction treatment center.
The family released a statement cautioning that the agreement, which totaled $270 million with contributions from Purdue, was “not a financial model for future settlement discussions.” Bernick declined to comment on the settlement discussions.
A subsequent family dispute was harder to resolve. It involved whether Richard Sackler should apologize more forcefully for disparaging opioid addicts in his emails.
On March 28, two days after the Oklahoma settlement, allegations that the Sacklers and Purdue were responsible for fatal overdoses resurfaced in an updated lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
In one email message with an undisclosed party nearly 20 years ago cited in the lawsuit, Richard said, “We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.” In another email exchange, he said opioid addicts “are criminals, and they engage in it with full, criminal intent. Why should they be entitled to our sympathies?”
The messages stoked tensions among other family members who felt they were less involved in details of Purdue’s operations than Richard, and that the publicity around the emails was unfairly tarnishing them, according to people familiar with the matter.
A spokeswoman for New York’s attorney general told Reuters that family members should “take responsibility for their destructive actions.” 
On April 11, the two Sackler contingents and their lawyers gathered in a Debevoise & Plimpton LLP conference room on the 35th floor of a Manhattan office tower to hash out their next moves. Richard dialed into the crisis-management session by phone.
By the end of the meeting, the two sides agreed on taking proactive measures in response to allegations against them, which included seeking media interviews.
But on April 12, just one day later, conflict erupted again as the family wrangled over how to respond to a request from HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.” A producer for the show had sought comment from the family and the company ahead of a segment critical of Richard’s conduct.
Mortimer’s ""A"" side of the family wanted Richard to provide a statement that would strongly repudiate his previous comments assailing addicts and call the messages “stupid.”
Up to that point, he had most recently apologized in a statement for “insensitive language” in “moments of frustration” regarding the email questioning whether addicts deserved sympathy.
Richard’s son, David, rejected the proposal, in part over concerns that Oliver’s satirical show was an improper forum for the stronger expression of regret, a person familiar with the matter said.
In the end, the show featured actor Michael Keaton reading from Richard’s “reckless criminals” email and other famous actors mocking the former Purdue executive.

However, Oliver also used material supplied by the family and Purdue. He said during the April 14 broadcast that Purdue and the Sacklers insisted the family did not cause the opioid crisis and that they vigorously denied claims in recent lawsuits. He also stated their view that Richard’s statements criticizing addicts had been taken out of context.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Nordic region's six major banks are joining forces to set up a customer checking center to crack down on money launderers, part of efforts to recover from a scandal that has shaken confidence in the finance industry.
Danske Bank and Swedbank have lost billions from their market value after becoming embroiled in a money laundering scandal involving their businesses in the Baltics.
The banks have promised to take steps to rectify shortcomings, such as their planned joint venture with rivals Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and DNB to perform common customer checks.
Regulators and banks see these so-called ""know your customer"" (KYC) checks as a safeguard against money laundering as the process of verifying the identity of customers, companies and business associates can help banks to spot or monitor suspicious clients.
""Preventing financial crime is a top priority and a strong driver behind this initiative,"" Fredrik Millde, project manager of the venture, known as Nordic KYC Utility, told Reuters.
The banks have not worked together previously, but the international nature of money laundering and the difficulties preventing it has persuaded them to join forces.
The new body is expected to create a standardized KYC process for large and midsize Nordic corporate customers across the six banks and Millde expects it to start providing services from 2020 and also sell its services to other banks. 
Five of the six banks first announced the venture in May 2018. Swedbank joined later in the year. The banks have not said how much they are spending on it.
The finance industry have been under pressure to take action quickly because of criticism by regulators of their anti-money laundering controls.
Last year, Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said lenders had insufficient customer due diligence measures in place from 2016-2017, indicating there was a lack of information about beneficial owners and inadequate documentation.
SEB spokesman Laurence Westerlund said people from the founding banks were testing various IT functions and systems for the utility, which is hoping to win European Union antitrust clearance in third quarter.
The new body could allow the banks to coordinate identity tracking, reduce KYC failures or misidentification risks due to use of different data sources and cut inhouse compliance costs, accounting firm Deloitte said in a paper on the Nordic project and other KYC measures prepared for UK banks.
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
The concept of these utilities is relatively new and there are only a handful in existence. 
Banking secrecy laws prevent banks from disclosing suspicious clients to each other and this has hindered the fight against financial crime, a paper published last September by independent consultancy the Tax Justice Network said.
But several groups are looking at potential industry-wide initiatives as the regulatory burden to police and report financial crime grows. 
Clipeum, a French project launched by Societe Generale's employees, with support from the bank, is building a platform where companies and individuals can upload KYC documents and authorize financial institutions to consult the documents.
""We thought it was smarter to collaborate on this matter instead of compete,"" said Eric Le Roux, one of the two co-founders of Clipeum, who also works for  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Societe Generale has so far convinced Allianz (DE:ALVG), Banque Postale, BpiFrance, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), Euler Hermes, Natixis, asset manager Tikehau and UniCredit to join Clipeum.
The initiative, which will become a joint venture with institutions that are part of it owning stakes, expects to be ready in 2020.
But such ventures have had varying success, with Singapore's Monetary Authority having shelved its KYC utility citing unexpectedly high costs.
Graham Barrow, an anti-financial crime banking expert, said in the past these utilities have not worked well because banks grade clients differently based on their individual risk appetites and also because the utilities did not often do qualitative analysis on KYC data.
But the Nordic banks' venture is looking to go one step further. Millde said it was looking at setting up a common ""onboarding"" process for the six banks. This would allow any of the banks to use the utility to assess whether to take on a customer. 

""There is no provider that can do the full scale of what we want to do and there is isn't any provider around that has done this cross border (work) in the way that this project has as its aim,"" Westerlund said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) shares leapt 20 percent on Friday as investors rushed to cover bearish bets after the conglomerate announced plans to list its best business, a move long hoped-for by investors. 
The stock was up 21% at 13.62 euros ($15.31) at 1407 GMT, set for its best day since the German firm's listing in 1991. They were the best-performing shares in Europe.
Thyssenkrupp is considering a carve-out or listing of its elevators business after abandoning plans to split itself up with a cross-shareholding structure and pulling the plug on a joint venture with Tata Steel.
The shares rose as investors scrambled to cover large bearish bets, analysts and traders said.
On Thursday, the level of short interest was 38.3 million shares, the largest amount in more than four years, according to data from FIS Astec Analytics. Around 6.1& of Thyssenkrupp's outstanding shares wee out on loan.
On the day the joint venture with Tata Steel was announced in Sept 2017, Thyssenkrupp shares were trading at 26.2 euros - nearly twice their current level.
That means even after today's jump, short sellers would still have made a 50 percent gain on their investment, if they went short on that day.
Conglomerates, viewed by some investors as inefficient and hard to value, are often saddled with a discounted valuation by investors. Specialized businesses can attract higher values when they do not have to compete on a combined balance sheet with other group businesses offering lower returns.
In similar moves to Thyssenkrupp,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) spun off its healthcare business and Siemens plans to separate its gas turbines business.
If Thyssenkrupp lists its elevators business at similar valuations to those Kone and Schindler trade on currently, it could deliver an enterprise value of 14 billion euros, Jefferies analyst Alan Spence said.
""There's significant value within the elevators business which the conglomerate discount placed on Thyssenkrupp has historically masked,"" he wrote.
The sharp share price reaction on Friday, such as the one seen recently when a new investor joined SAP, may also suggest investors are giving Europe Inc renewed attention after years of worries about slowing economic and earnings growth.

PepsiCo had sued nine farmers for cultivating the FC5 potato variety, grown exclusively for its popular Lay's potato chips. The FC5 variety has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips.
Soon after suing the farmers, PepsiCo came under political pressure from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and some of its allies who asked the U.S. company to withdraw lawsuits against potato farmers, who come from Gujarat, Modi's home state ruled by the BJP.
Bowing to pressure, PepsiCo on May 2 agreed to take its lawsuits back.
""It's a victory for us, but PepsiCo's decision to file lawsuits against the farmers has sullied their reputation and the company now must apologize,"" Anand Yagnik, the potato growers' lawyer told a news conference in Ahmedabad, the business hub of Gujarat.

The submission made in the court to withdraw lawsuits against the farmers ""is in sync with its publicly stated position,"" a PepsiCo spokesman said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday, as investors worried over the possibility of a long-drawn-out U.S.-China trade dispute, but hopes that the two sides could still reach a last-minute deal limited losses.
President Donald Trump said he was in ""absolutely no rush"" to finalize a trade agreement with China, after the United States increased duties to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods overnight.
But even as Beijing threatened retaliation, negotiators in Washington agreed to stay on for a second day, raising expectations that a deal would be reached.
""Everyone knows that the United States and China are talking, and are looking at the tariffs as a bargaining chip. It's all about leverage and who outmaneuvers whom,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. 
""In the end Trump will get a deal done, but in the interim we have to put up with his way of doing it. We are going to have a lot of volatility, until we have clarity."" 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, declined 0.7%, while  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) dropped 0.9%.
At 9:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77.76 points, or 0.30%, at 25,750.60. The S&P 500 was down 8.18 points, or 0.28%, at 2,862.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 20.37 points, or 0.26%, at 7,890.22. 
The spike in tensions has triggered a flight to safety and triggered a 2.8% drop in the S&P 500 so far this week, setting the benchmark index to post its worst weekly decline since December. 
Global equities have seen outflows of $20.5 billion in the past week as ""trade deal trauma"" pushed more money into bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a report.
Longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields were hovering at five-week lows due to the trade jitters and tame inflation data. 
Technology stocks fell 0.33%, and weighed the most on the S&P, dragged down by shares of iPhone maker and a plunge in  Symantec Corp  (NASDAQ:SYMC).
The antivirus software maker tumbled 15.2% after issuing a profit warning and unexpectedly announcing that its chief executive officer would step down. 
Amid market uncertainty, ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is set to make its market debut after raising $8.1 billion in the largest U.S. IPO since 2014.
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) Holdings rose 4 percent, the most on the S&P and Nasdaq indexes, after the online travel and restaurant reservation provider reported better-than-expected room bookings in the latest quarter.

827,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 09:53AM ET</span>",Fed Seen as More Likely to Cut Rates After Trump Boosts Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve probably will be more inclined to cut interest rates now that President Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to increase tariffs on U.S. imports from China. But it won’t rush into doing so.
While the higher levies will put upward pressure on inflation by raising import prices, the central bank will likely be more attentive to the potential drag they’ll exert on the economy by depressing consumer and business spending, Fed watchers said.
“We would expect the Fed to initially focus on the growth implication and look past the inflation impact,’’ Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). in New York, said in a May 7 note to clients.
Fed funds futures on Friday showed traders are fully pricing in a cut within the first few months of next year. That’s several months earlier than it was indicating a week ago, before Trump’s weekend tweets on tariffs. Meanwhile, a key part of the Treasury yield curve that many see as a recession sign, briefly went negative on Thursday.
On its own, the increase in import levies to 25% from 10% on $200 billion of Chinese goods shouldn’t have that much of an impact on U.S. gross domestic product. Feroli reckoned that the direct hit to growth would be about 0.2 percentage point.
What will be critical for the economy and the Fed is how the financial markets react to the heightened trade tensions and how that response -- and the uncertainty surrounding the issue -- affects business confidence and investment, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities chief economist Peter Hooper.
Equity markets slumped this week as investors’ hopes for a trade deal dimmed. Overall financial conditions though remain supportive of growth, albeit less so than they were a week ago.
Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, cautioned investors against expecting a quick rate reduction by the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee in the wake of Trump’s tariff increase.
“We do not see the Fed as inclined to take out immediate insurance against market/growth weakness associated with trade escalation, with the committee starting from a position in which it has just reaffirmed that it is not close to cutting rates,’’ he said in a May 9 note to clients.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Assuming there’s no speedy resolution and higher tariffs remain in place, forecasts for global growth will be shaded down, with the main blow landing on China and its Asian neighbors.""Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg EconomicsFor the full note click here
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues left interest rates unchanged last week, defying Trump’s call for a cut, and said they would be patient in deciding what action to take going forward.
“We don’t see a strong case to move rates in either direction,” Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, echoing a comment made last week by Powell.
Clarida said that the trade conflicts had “only had a very modest effect on the economy” last year.
He added though that the central bank will “certainly’’ take trade developments into account in setting policy in the future.

828,By Investing.com,"<span>May 10, 2019 09:48AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Drops Amid Tariff Increase, Uber Set to Debut","Investing.com - Wall Street fell on Friday as a well-flagged increase in U.S. tariffs on China did little to change this week’s bearish sentiment.
The Dow Jones lost 64 points, or 0.3%, to 25,764.63 points by 9:43 AM ET (13:43 GMT), while the S&P 500 fell 7 points, or 0.3%, 2,863.38 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded down 17 points, or 0.2%, 7,893.94 points.
The lack of any immediate detailed response from China, despite the promise of retaliation, appears to have protected a fragile peace in many markets, which have rebounded from oversold levels in both Asia and Europe, but which are still set for their worst week this year.
But Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, warned that expecting to hear the details may be a mistake.
“This is not always how China plays its hand. Sometimes, it skips the American-style big announcement and simply takes action, as it has with Canada recently and Japan in the past, for example,” he said in a note.
Optimism overseas has been supported by the knowledge that talks are continuing in Washington Friday, despite the latest developments.
The U.S. has also decided not to apply the increase to goods already on their way, providing a window of opportunity for Trump to backtrack if a deal is made.
Whether that optimism can be sustained is another question.
“The tariffs can be reversed. But until then, now the negotiations have a real cost that increases with every delay,” Dario Perkins, head of global macro research at TS Lombard in London, said on Twitter.
The day's big event will be the debut of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), which starts trading Friday after pricing its IPO at $45 a share, just above the bottom end of the expected range. The company sold more than $8 billion in stock at a valuation of just over $82 billion in the largest IPO since  Alibaba  's (NYSE:BABA) four years ago.
Among the day’s big movers, Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) nearly 16% after announcing the surprise resignation of its CEO Greg Clark late on Thursday, while real estate site Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) surged close to 6% after its first-quarter report surprised with a larger revenue contribution from its home-flipping business.
On the economic front, the consumer price index rose less than expected, but matched the Federal Reserve's target of an annual rate for the first time this year after three months of undershooting.
With Fed policymakers predicting no change in interest rates for the rest of the year while Trump clamors for cuts, the data was still no game changer, according to James Smith, developed markets economist at ING.
“The latest downside surprise on U.S. inflation won't help resolve market pessimism towards the Fed policy outlook. But with wage pressures continuing to build, we think a rate cut is much less likely than markets currently think,” he said in a note.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, fell 0.2% at 96.99 by 9:46 AM ET (13:46 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was little changed at 2.46%.

An earlier tweet was deleted and reposted with minor changes.
S&P 500 futures have been steadily pulling back since the tweet was first published, and are trading near the day’s low.

“The reason autos are very important to our trade picture is about half of our trade deficit comes from the single product, automotive, and about the other half of our trade deficit comes from a geographic area and that’s called China,” Ross said at a press conference in Luxembourg on Friday.
The Commerce Department sent Donald Trump its findings of a probe into the national-security risks of auto imports in February. Ross said he expects the U.S. president to rule on tariffs by May 18. Levies on cars and parts imported to the U.S. would especially hit Germany, and the European Union has vowed to retaliate.
Ross made it clear that the country’s trade balance is the driving motive behind the focus on the auto industry.
“In order to reduce our trade deficit -- one of the big objectives of this administration -- we need to deal with China as an entity, and we need to deal with automotives as a product line,” he said.
Trump roiled global markets this week by boosting tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and threatening more, prompting China to say it will be forced to retaliate. The renewed trade tensions could derail efforts by the countries to reach a deal. Ross said the U.S. would be fine if the negotiations fail.
Trade talks with China “will have either one of two outcomes: either we will reach a mutually agreeable arrangement, or we will impose the higher tariffs that were described by President Trump,” said Ross. “The United States is comfortable with the outcome whichever way it goes, but we would be happy if we could have an agreement with China.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's efforts to create a capital market to rival the United States have made little headway and the project needs a new push to remove barriers that hamper progress, bankers said on Friday.
The capital markets union or CMU seeks to encourage companies to raise money by issuing stocks and bonds, rather than continuing to raise loans from EU banks, some of which are still struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
The CMU, launched in 2015, has been a central plank of the current European Commission's mandate that ends in the summer. But after a reset of the project in 2017 and adoption of 11 new EU laws, most companies in Europe still get their money from banks.
This contrasts with the United States where companies tap financial markets instead, which have greater capacity to spread risk more evenly across the economy.
""We need a new push to reinforce the use of financial markets by companies in Europe,"" said Giovanni Sabatini, chairman of the European Banking Federation's executive committee.
""It is clear though that the European CMU project needs a reset. The fundamental and structural obstacles that stand in the way of an integrated Capital Markets Union need to be identified and removed,"" Sabatini said.
Barriers to a seamless cross-border capital market include differences in national tax and insolvency laws, a vested interests of some market participants in heading off competition, and duplication of services.
AFME, another banking lobby, said on Thursday that efforts to boost securitization, a fundraising mechanism that is one of the CMU's core objectives, have made little ground.
Brussels has sought to use Brexit to kickstart the CMU, warning that London, the region's biggest financial center used by companies across Europe to raise money, will be outside the bloc.
""CMU in general is a journey and we have not yet arrived,"" Marc Bayle, director general for market infrastructure at the European Central Bank, told an AFME conference this week.
Werner Frey, a managing director of AFME, told the same event that only the public sector could remove many of the remaining barriers to the cheaper financial plumbing that a CMU needs.
The CMU so far is probably a ""failure"", Frey said.

Analysts say more fundamental change is needed to make CMU a success, such as restoring public trust in markets after the global financial crisis a decade ago ushered in austerity.

837,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Foreign flows into Asian equities falter this week after strong April,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Foreigners were net buyers of Asian equities for the fourth straight month in April, but analysts doubt such inflows could be sustained amid an escalating tariff war between the world's top two economies. 
The United States raised levies on Friday to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and Beijing said it would strike back in the midst of last-ditch talks to rescue a trade deal.
Foreign investors have sold $2 billion worth of Asian equities so far this week after a net $11.23 billion purchase last month, data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam showed. 
""Heightened risk sentiment on the back of a twist in US-China trade negotiations certainly does not serve Asia equities well,"" said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist with financial services firm IG. 
Some market participants still hold out hopes of a Sino-U.S. trade deal as negotiators in Washington agreed to stay at the table for a second day. 
""The question would be how long negotiations would sustain and for how long we will have the latest tariffs in place,"" Pan said, adding that foreign outflows would likely be congruent with the time taken to resolve the trade spat. 
In April, Indonesian equity markets led the region with a foreign inflow of $3.75 billion, largely driven by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group's move to raise stakes in Bank Danamon Indonesia and Bank PT Bank Nusantara Parahyangan. 
India received about $3 billion of foreign money on expectations Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come back to power in the seven-phase election that winds up on May 19, and on hopes the central bank will cut policy rates further to prop up the economy. 
Foreigners invested $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion in South Korean and Taiwanese markets respectively, last month. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares posted its fourth straight monthly gain in April on optimism that the United States and China were inching toward a trade deal. 
But this month, the index has declined over 3 percent.

838,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>","Virgin Atlantic in, IAG out of race for Thomas Cook airline business","LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) ruled out bidding for Thomas Cook's airline unit on Friday, a day after rival Virgin Atlantic was reported to be interested in part of the business.
Lufthansa and private equity fund Indigo Partners are seen among the front-runners for Thomas Cook's airlines after the firm put it up for sale in February, to raise cash after a string of profit warnings in 2018.
IAG had previously been linked with the business, but on Friday, Chief Executive Willie Walsh said that his firm had not made a bid.
""In relation to Thomas Cook... we're not putting in any bid,"" Walsh told reporters. 
He added in an analyst call later in the day that the firm was not actively pursuing M&A at the moment but was in a strong position to do so if something attractive came up.
Virgin Atlantic has put in a preliminary offer for the tour operator's UK long-haul business, Sky News reported on Thursday. Thomas Cook and Virgin Atlantic both declined to comment on the report. 
Lufthansa is a bidder for Thomas Cook's German airline Condor with an option to acquire the remaining airlines of the British travel group, Lufthansa's CEO said on Tuesday.
Indigo Partners is also a likely suitor for Thomas Cook's airline business, sources said last week, adding that the deadline for initial bids was on Tuesday earlier this week.
An unexpectedly warm summer in northern Europe last year deterred holiday makers from booking lucrative last minute getaways, resulting in two major profit warnings for the world's oldest travel company.
Worries about the firm's ability to pay its debts pushed the yield on its euro-denominated bonds that mature in 2022 to a record high last Friday, and Thomas Cook said later in the day that it was in talks with its lenders about bolstering its finances.
Thomas Cook's half-year earnings release for the six months to March 31 is due next Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks gained on Friday after a battering this week as investors held out a sliver of hope for a trade deal amid last-ditch talks between the United States and China, even as a fresh round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.
European stock markets bounced off six-week lows, with Germany's trade-sensitive DAX index leading the charge with a 1% rise. 
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was up 0.24% by midday in London.
But the gauge was set for its worst weekly performance since late December 2018, with a loss of 2.75% as bets on an imminent trade deal between the U.S. and China unraveled after tensions unexpectedly flared up during negotiations between the two sides.
The Japanese yen was 0.1% lower to the dollar.
U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase to 25% from 10% on $200 billion of Chinese goods kicked in on Friday, and Beijing said it would strike back.
Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators are in talks to try to rescue a faltering deal aimed at ending a 10-month trade war between the world's two largest economies.
""Investors seem to have concluded this (tariff increase) is indeed only a negotiating ploy and remain hopeful that the situation won't escalate further,"" said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at online broker XM, adding that markets were pricing a deal as the most likely endgame.
""To believe that a deal can be sealed in a couple of weeks and that matters won't escalate any further before we get there seems like wishful thinking.""
(Graphic: China-US trade: monthly figures link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Lzed8e).
Others were even less sanguine: UBS Wealth Management cut its exposure to emerging market stocks late Thursday, changing its portfolio as the intensification of trade tensions took its toll on markets, the asset manager said in a note.
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index of stocks were down 0.3%, indicating a lower open on Wall Street. The VIX volatility gauge stood at 19.08, down from its highest level since January hit on Thursday.
The White House has said the two sides would resume negotiations on Friday morning in Washington after concluding the first of two days of talks on Thursday.
Asian shares lost some of their gains after the U.S. tariff hike, with investors worried that a protracted trade war could hamper global economic growth.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which dropped more than 1% early Friday, remained where they were when tariff increase kicked in, up 0.3%.
Japan's Nikkei was off 0.3%.
In currencies, the dollar was lower by 0.03% against a basket of peers. The Japanese yen was flat, having gained 1.2% this week. The euro was higher by 0.2% at $1.1232, set for a second week of gains. 
German 10-year government bond yields were headed for their biggest weekly fall in seven weeks in a sign that a ratcheting up in U.S./China trade tensions have exacerbated concern about the global growth outlook. 
Oil prices rose. Brent was up 0.6% to $70.80 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 0.5% to $62.02.
Gold ticked up 0.1% to $1,285.55 per ounce.

The lack of any immediate response from China despite the threat of retaliation appears to have protected a fragile peace in many markets, which have rebounded from oversold levels in both Asia and Europe, but which are still set for their worst week this year. Optimism has been supported by the knowledge that talks are continuing in Washington Friday, despite the latest developments.
Whether that optimism can be sustained is another question.
“The tariffs can be reversed. But until then, now the negotiations have a real cost that increases with every delay,” Dario Perkins, head of global macro research at TS Lombard in London, said via Twitter.
Dow futures were down 40 points or 0.2% by 7:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 8 points or 0.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 16 points or 0.2%.
The day's big event will be the debut of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), which starts trading Friday after pricing its IPO at $45 a share, just above the bottom end of the announced marketing range. The company sold over $8 billion in stock at a valuation of just over $82 billion in the largest IPO since  Alibaba  's (NYSE:BABA) four years ago.
Among other stocks poised for a lively opening, Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) is set to open down over 12% after announcing the surprise resignation of its CEO Greg Clark late on Thursday, while real estate site Zillow is indicated to open up over 7% after its first-quarter report surprised with a larger revenue contribution from its home-flipping business.
Elsewhere, crude oil futures are recovering and are on track to end the week roughly where they started it. U.S. crude futures were at $62.16 a barrel, up 0.8% on the day, while the international benchmark Brent was at $70.95 a barrel
Elsewhere in commodities, gold futures inched 0.1% higher to $1,286.25 a troy ounce, while in the currency market, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was a fraction lower on the day at 97.13."

The company has set up a special funding pool for the fundraising. All of CMIG's employees in its headquarters can put their own money into the pool and choose between buying CMIG's debt or equity, said the representative.
Debt-laden CMIG, once among China's most high-profile and acquisitive private companies domestically and globally, had missed payment and formed an emergency committee to deal with its liquidity troubles, raising investors' fears about financing pressures on China's overall private sector.
CMIG was set up in 2014 with a registered capital of 50 billion yuan and with the approval of the State Council. Its businesses spans leasing, new energy, airlines, construction and investment.
According to Refinitiv data, CMIG has 12 outstanding yuan bonds worth 29.75 billion yuan ($4.37 billion). It has also issued bonds worth $800 million through Boom Up Investments Ltd, a subsidiary domiciled in the British Virgin Islands.
This is not the first time for a Chinese private company to raise money from its employees. Indebted HNA Group Co had also sold investment products to staff but later missed some repayments under financial pressure.
Following the biggest-ever year for onshore defaults in 2018, Chinese corporate issuers again face a wall of bond maturities and more companies than ever are missing payments, raising risks for investors in the world's third-largest bond market.
Data collected by Reuters shows that Chinese issuers defaulted on bonds with a principal amount of 23.31 billion yuan ($3.46 billion) in the first four months of 2019, up more than 70 percent from a year earlier.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank hired ex-ABN AMRO banker Chris Vogelzang as its new chief executive on Friday as it wrestles to limit the fallout of its involvement in one of the biggest money laundering scandals.
Denmark's biggest lender is being investigated in Denmark, the United States, Britain and the Baltics after revealing that 200 billion euros ($224 billion) in suspicious transactions passed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Among the challenges facing Vogelzang, who was on the management board of Dutch bank ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) until 2017, are rebuilding investor and customer trust and keeping Danske Bank focused during the myriad inquiries into its conduct.
""In (the) short term, I don't think he will make big strategic changes because the bank has shown it knows where it wants to go and is succeeding with its strategy,"" Sydbank analyst Mikkel Emil Jensen said of Vogelzang.
""His focus will be on reestablishing trust.""
Vogelzang, 56, will take over on June 1 from Jesper Nielsen, who was appointed as interim CEO in October following the resignation of Thomas Borgen over the money laundering scandal.
""We have a big task ahead of us in continuing to rebuild trust,"" Danske Bank Chairman Karsten Dybvad said in a statement.
Shares in Danske Bank, which have more than halved since March last year, were trading 4.2% higher at 0849 GMT.
""He (Vogelzang) has extensive leadership and commercial experience within banking and has throughout his career managed difficult challenges and delivered good results,"" Dybvad added.
BEST CANDIDATE
Vogelzang's appointment was immediately welcomed by Danske Bank's largest shareholder, which put pressure on Borgen to leave when the full extent of the money laundering scandal became clear in September last year. 
""We have full confidence that the board has chosen the best candidate to lead the bank forward,"" a spokeswoman for A.P. Moller-Holding said of Vogelzang, who since 2017 has held advisory roles at Boston Consulting Group and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) as well as non-executive directorships.
Vogelzang will be reunited in Denmark with his former ABN boss Gerrit Zalm, who joined Danske Bank's board in March and sits on its nomination committee.
Vogelzang was the head of ABN AMRO's profitable retail banking division from 2009-2017, a crucial period for the bank after the Dutch government had nationalized it in 2008.
He assisted Zalm in merging the Dutch parts of ABN and Fortis into a single entity and when ABN returned to the stock market in 2015 was widely tipped as his successor.
But in 2017 the top job went to its then-CFO Kees van Dijkhuizen, who had also worked as a civil servant.
Vogelzang's appointment comes after it was revealed this week that Danish prosecutors have charged Borgen and eight former Danske Bank managers over the money laundering scandal, which has sent shockwaves across the Nordic region.
Sweden's Swedbank in March dismissed its CEO over allegations that its Baltic accounts were used to launder money.

Interim CEO Nielsen will continue in his position as head of banking in Denmark and a member of the executive board at Danske Bank, which last week lowered its outlook for 2019 after a poor first quarter, due in part to the money laundering scandal.

A successful market debut of Uber will be seen as a test of SoftBank's investment strategy, as other big tech firms in its almost $100 billion Vision Fund also head toward public listings.
Uber's listing is the most anticipated IPO since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's market debut seven years ago, and the world's largest ride-hailing firm hopes its conservative pricing approach will spare it the trading plunge suffered by rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT).
""(SoftBank) shares have gone up ahead of Uber's IPO, but some investors may have sold shares once the price was decided,"" said Tsutomu Yamada, a market analyst at Kabu.com Securities.
The value of Vision Fund's stake in Uber grew 418 billion yen ($3.8 billion) last year.
Shares in SoftBank tumbled as much as 5.5% on Friday, its biggest percentage drop in five months, wiping $6 billion off its market capitalization. The group is now valued at around $104 billion.
SoftBank's transition away from telecoms toward tech investments accelerated with the 2.35 trillion yen listing of a third of its domestic telco SoftBank Corp in December in what was Japan's largest-ever IPO.
That provided the funds for a share buyback that has helped drive up the parent group's stock by nearly 50 percent this year.

Pledging to enhance shareholder returns, SoftBank Group announced a stock split on Thursday, while leaving the per-share dividend unchanged for the current financial year, effectively doubling its shareholder payout.

(Reuters) - European shares rallied on Friday, recovering slightly from six week lows as investors hoped that United States and China would still be able to resolve their bitter trade dispute, even as a planned U.S. tariff hike on Chinese imports took effect.
The STOXX 600 index added 0.9 percent by 0840 GMT. The pan-European index, which has been bruised by trade worries most of this week, remains on track for its biggest weekly decline this year.
Trade-sensitive Germany's DAX was leading the charge with its 1.1 percent rise while the volatility gauge on euro zone blue-chips eased from a four-month high.
The tariff hike on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods came in the middle of two days of talks between top U.S. and Chinese negotiators to try to rescue a faltering deal aimed at ending a trade war between the world's largest economies.
""The fact that the two sides have agreed to continue negotiations on Friday is offering a glimmer of hope that the relationship between the two powers hasn't deteriorated beyond repair,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at futures brokerage London Capital Group wrote in a note.
Trade optimism and a jump in Bechtle shares after results helped technology lead the rally among European sub-sectors, all of which were higher.

Bechtle jumped 9 percent after the German IT-systems provider reported a nearly 30 percent rise in quarterly revenue and reaffirmed its full-year outlook.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) climbed about 10 percent after sources told Reuters it is considering listing of its elevators business after abandoning plans to split itself up.

849,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",China banks' first-quarter bad loan ratio largely unchanged at 1.8%: regulator,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese commercial banks' non-performing loan (NPL) ratio stood at 1.8% at the end of the first quarter, compared with 1.89% at the end of 2018, the banking and insurance regulator said on Friday.
The amount of NPLs at commercial banks rose to 2.16 trillion yuan ($317.66 billion) at the end of March, up 95.7 billion yuan from the start of the year, Liu Zhiqing, deputy head of the statistics department at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) told reporters.
The end-March total was the highest since the end of 2003, according to Reuters calculations based on official data.
Liu said Chinese banks disposed of 368.9 billion yuan in bad loans over the first quarter, an increase of 30.9 billion yuan compared with a year earlier. No details were provided on the form of the disposals.
The first quarter bad-loan data comes at a time Chinese authorities have been encouraging banks to increase their lending to small and mid-sized businesses, to help combat a slowdown in economic growth.
According to the data, lenders beefed up their capital strength in January-March to fend off risks. The average capital adequacy ratio at commercial banks at end-March was 14.18%, which the regulator said was 0.57 percentage point higher than one year earlier. The banks' provision coverage ratio rose 3.13 percentage points over the three-month period to 192.2%, it said.
The CBIRC, which also oversees the operations of China's 19.1 trillion yuan insurance sector, said insurers' premium income in the first quarter rose 15.9% from a year earlier to 1.6 trillion yuan.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are looking to end the week on a positive note, despite the entry into force of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, although they’re still on course for their worst week so far in 2019.
At 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 3.3 points, or 0.9% at 378.90, with the Swiss SMI leading the way up 1.1%, while the German DAX was up 0.9% and the FTSE 100 was lagging slightly, up 0.6%.
The strength of the German market was explained by a surprise rise in exports in March, which offered some reassurance that the traditional motor of Europe’s largest economy may be starting to emerge from its weak start to the year.
The second supporting factor was a 9% surge in industrial giant Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), which has reportedly abandoned its plans to split into two and merge its loss-making steelmaking division with  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC).
Instead, according to Reuters’ sources, the company is now considering a new approach, involving a holding structure and a carve-out or partial listing of its elevators division. Thyssenkrupp has yet to confirm the news. It's been the worst-performing stock in the DAX, down over 47% in the last 12 months even after this morning's rebound.
Elsewhere, International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), the parent group of British Airways and Iberia, is heading both the FTSE and IBEX 35 after upholding its guidance for the full year after a torrid quarter for airlines.
The company also updated with passenger numbers for April which showed the group’s two discount airlines Vueling and Level continuing to grow strongly, while Chief Financial Officer Enrique Dupuy told a conference call that BA’s key transatlantic routes were also performing well. At the time of writing, the company hadn’t addressed speculation that it may revive its bid for struggling discount carrier  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC)."
851,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 03:56AM ET</span>","In a sunset industry, economics of Adani's Australian coal mine questioned","By Melanie Burton and Henning Gloystein
MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A crash in Australian thermal coal prices is raising fresh questions about the viability of a controversial $4 billion coal mine just a week ahead of a national election in which climate change is a key issue.
Final approval of the Carmichael coal mine in Queensland, owned by India's Adani Enterprises, should come in ""a matter of weeks, not months"" following nearly a decade on the drawing board, the company's mining chief executive, Lucas Dow, told Reuters last month.
But a 40 percent slump in benchmark Australian thermal coal prices since mid-2018 to a two-year low last month, points to tight profit margins and questions as to whether the economics will support the launch of the mine as soon as next year.
Adani has said it is aiming to start producing 10 million tonnes a year of coal from March 2020, but analysts say the target date is optimistic.
""I think a lot of people are doubting as to whether it will see the light of day,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Victor Tanevski in Sydney.
Adani estimated in January that total costs of bringing the coal to port via rail would be A$54 a tonne ($39). Based on current market prices, the selling price for the mine's lower-grade thermal coal would be just over $47, suggesting a profit margin of $8-$12 per tonne.
Adani said the A$54 estimate takes into account royalties, processing fees and the cost of financing part of a rail line to the export terminal, although analysts suggest the company's figures are too bullish.
Tanevski suggests benchmark Newcastle 6,000 grade coal would need to be close to $100 a tonne for the mine to break even. The 6,000 benchmark was quoted at $86.20 on Thursday.
Analysts suggest the mine is unlikely to start commercial production until the middle of the next decade at the soonest, if at all. A profit margin of $8-$12 a tonne is half the averages of 2017 and 2018, highlighting how rapidly the market has turned since the Paris agreement on climate change.

Prices for Newcastle coal hit three year lows last month: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WBEjIC
Apart from the economics of the mine, Adani faces other headwinds, including an Australian coal boom that has probably peaked, analysts said.
As users move away from so-called dirty fuel sources, coal prices are set to drift lower, consultants AME Group say.
That scenario will impact producers of lower-grade coal first as they feel the pinch of competition from lower-cost miners like Indonesia and renewable or cleaner fuels.
""The boom period for Australian thermal coal exports has plateaued"" said Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in Singapore. ""A sharp reduction in coal use from export markets such as China, Japan, and India represents a considerable threat,"" he said.
Adding to uncertainty over the mine is an Australian general election next week which could return a Labor government, which has more aggressive targets towards cutting climate emissions.
To be sure, a growing reluctance among lenders to finance thermal coal projects could crimp supply and rally prices.
As an integrated producer selling to its own plants in India, Adani may also be able to offset small margins with gains elsewhere, such as giving other parties access to its planned rail line if authorities allow new mines in the same coal basin.
""The Carmichael Project's low-cost profile, the quality of the resource and forecast demand from our target markets of India and South-East Asia mean that the project's economics are strong,"" said an Adani spokeswoman in a statement, even when adjusting for the coal's quality.
""The IEA and other respected analysts are reporting an increase in demand for seaborne thermal coal, particularly from Indian and South-East Asia, which Carmichael is well-placed to meet.""
ARE COAL'S DAYS NUMBERED?
Australia is one of the world's biggest coal suppliers and its miners face an increasingly competitive future as buyers shift towards cleaner or renewable fuel sources, underlining the view that the country's coal boom is topping out.
The Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science expects thermal coal imports from Japan, Australia's biggest buyer, to shrink to 131 million tonnes a year by 2024 from over 140 million tonnes last year.
Ports in China, another big buyer, have been restricting imports from Australia this year, claiming environmental concerns. Many analysts say the restrictions are down to political tensions between Beijing and Canberra over issues of cyber security and China's influence in Pacific island nations.
Australian producers are struggling to make inroads in coal's remaining boom markets of South Asia in the face of lower-cost competition from Indonesia.
Shipping data showed Indonesia supplied 149 cargoes, carrying 8.9 million tonnes of thermal coal to India and Pakistan in April alone, while Australia has only shipped sporadic cargoes to these large and growing markets.

Coal remains the most-used source for electricity generation, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects renewables to overtake coal as the most important power generation source by the mid-2020s.

852,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 03:40AM ET</span>",Danske Gets ABN Amro Veteran to Run Bank Amid Laundering Saga,"(Bloomberg) -- Danske Bank A/S has named Chris Vogelzang as its chief executive officer, ending months of speculation over who will steer Denmark’s biggest bank through the continuing fallout of its money-laundering scandal.
The 56-year-old Dutchman and ABN Amro Group N.V. veteran will start June 1. He replaces Jesper Nielsen, who has been running Danske on an interim basis since October, when Danske’s dirty-money saga ended the career of Thomas Borgen.
Russell Quelch, an equity specialist at Redburn in London, said that “the market will welcome the fact that it’s an external candidate. The bank needs to start afresh, post the money laundering saga.”
Shares in Danske rose almost 3% after trading started in Copenhagen.
Vogelzang “brings many years of management experience from the financial sector,” Danske said, including a stint from 2000 to 2017 at ABN Amro, the last eight years of which were as a member of its management board and head of its global retail and private banking activities.
Danske has purged large chunks of its upper ranks after last year taking center stage in what may be Europe’s worst ever dirty money scandal. Denmark’s biggest bank revealed in a September report that a “large part” of around $230 billion that flowed through a non-resident Estonian unit over a nine-year period was suspicious.
The saga wiped out almost half the bank’s market value last year, and triggered criminal investigations in the U.S. and across Europe. Borgen, who was ousted in October, had previously been in charge of Danske’s Baltic operations. Shortly after he left, Danske’s biggest shareholder got rid of the chairman, Ole Andersen.
Danske had tried to replace Borgen earlier, but failed to get its initial candidate approved. The Financial Supervisory Authority rejected a proposal to have the bank run by Jacob Aarup-Andersen, a 41-year-old who runs Danske’s wealth business and who used to be the chief financial officer, citing his lack of relevant experience.
Quelch at Redburn said he has questions about the choice of CEO. “The fact is that he has no previous CEO experience and turning Danske around isn’t going to be a simple task,” he said. “So in my view, the appointment is a tick-box exercise -- getting someone in the seat so that the group can start to move forward with the new strategy. But I don’t think he’s going to excite investors in terms of his experience. He obviously does have experience, but not CEO experience.”
Vogelzang was once a candidate to become CEO at ABN Amro, to succeed Gerrit Zalm in 2017, who joined Danske’s board in March. But the Dutch state, which is a majority shareholder, and the supervisory board blocked the move. Not long after that, ABN cut several management jobs and Vogelzang left.
Danske faces years of investigations as prosecutors across multiple jurisdictions sift through the evidence. Investors are hoping that having a new CEO will allow Danske to focus on its business amid fears that the scandal is driving away clients and investors.
“Despite its current challenges, Danske Bank has all the prerequisites to continue to be a strong and competitive bank that creates value for all its stakeholders,” Vogelzang said in the statement.
Borgen, 55, is reportedly among 10 former Danske bankers to have been met with preliminary charges as the laundering investigation continues. The development comes as Denmark takes several steps to tighten its anti-money laundering laws, including the possibility of prison sentences and considerably tougher fines.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The world's biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, filed plans on Friday to spin off its Asian business via a Hong Kong initial public offering, in a deal which two sources with knowledge of the matter said could be worth at least $5 billion. 
The move comes as the Belgium-based giant is working to reduce a $102.5 billion debt pile accumulated following the late 2016 purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB) for around $100 billion. 
It has already halved its proposed dividend and warned any payouts would grow only slowly as it works on cutting its ratio of net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) - a key measure of leverage - over time to about 2 from 4.6 at the end of 2018. 
The brewer said the IPO of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd would involve a minority stake and that it would continue to maintain a significant holding in the listed entity.
No details of pricing, timing or deal size were given in the filing. AB InBev said the timing would depend on market conditions, but that its current expectation was to complete the deal over the summer. 
The company said too that it could not comment on valuation or deal size. However, sources said the offering was likely to be at least $5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have said that $40 billion-$50 billion would be a reasonable valuation for the Asia-Pacific business.
AB InBev said on Tuesday that an IPO of its Asia business, which includes a portfolio of 50 beer brands, could help create a brewing champion for the region, where increasingly wealthy consumers are trading up to higher-margin premium beers, such as Budweiser or Corona.
Asia is the largest beer consumption region by volume, accounting for 37% globally, and also one of the fastest-growing markets, the company said in its draft prospectus filed on Friday.
The region produced 18% of AB InBev's sales by volume and 14% of its underlying operating profit last year from sales worth $8.46 billion, according to the prospectus.
HONG KONG BOOST
At $5 billion, the IPO would be a welcome boost to Hong Kong, and the largest public offering in the city since China Tower Corp Ltd raised $7.5 billion from its Hong Kong stock float in August last year. 
Companies have raised just $4.5 billion through Hong Kong listings so far this year, lagging the $12.1 billion raised on the New York Stock Exchange and the $9.4 billion raised on Nasdaq, Refinitiv data as of Friday showed.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the joint sponsors of the proposed float.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group cut fixed mortgage rates on Friday, the last of the country's growth-starved big banks to do so in recent weeks as they chase new customers amid lower funding costs.
With profit growth weakening along with property prices, the lower fixed rates are a cheaper way to lure new borrowers than more costly cuts to variable rates, which are a much bigger part of their mortgage book.
Australia's biggest lenders are competing to win back the market's trust after suffering significant reputational damage over the past year in the fallout of a landmark misconduct inquiry.
The four majors have been experiencing sluggish below-market mortgage growth rates, with all except for Commonwealth Bank of Australia losing market share in their key domestic home loan market to smaller banks and non-bank lenders, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research. 
ANZ, the country's third-biggest lender, is offering the biggest cuts to its three- and five-year fixed-rate products for owner-occupiers paying interest only, according to an ANZ statement sent to Reuters.
Macquarie banking analyst Victor German said banks were lowering rates to attract new clients amid sluggish credit demand and a fragile outlook for the country's once-booming property market. 
""In a subdued credit growth environment, we expect banks to remain competitive on pricing,"" German said.
Fixed rates are often used by borrowers to lock-in a price for a portion of their mortgage. The rate cuts apply mainly to new fixed-rate loan products, which represent about 20% of inflows, according to brokers CLSA.
The lower funding costs are not generally being passed on to variable rate mortgages that account for about 80% of the major banks' A$1.7 trillion ($1.2 trillion) home-loan books.
The country's major home-loan lenders, which include ANZ, CBA, Westpac Banking Corp and National Australia Bank, have all now reduced some of their fixed rates by between 10 and 30 basis points for loans of between two to five years.
CENTRAL BANK MOVES
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates at record lows on Tuesday while signaling future cuts if the unemployment rate failed to nudge lower.
If the RBA does cut rates this year, as rate traders expect, banks would come under pressure to move variable rates lower, analysts say.
""Absent the Reserve Bank of Australia cutting rates, they don't see that there is a solid argument that they should pass on the entire (funding cost) cuts,"" CLSA banking analyst Brian Johnson said.
For every quarter of a percentage point cut by the central bank, earnings at the four major banks are likely to decline by up to 2.5%, according to a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysis.
Even as the central bank has kept its policy rate at a record low of 1.5% since August 2016, bank funding costs have fallen sharply.
The benchmark bank-bill swap rate BBSW, a key measure of banks' funding costs, has fallen about 39 basis points this year to about 1.69%, its lowest level on record. 
Nearly two thirds of Australian banks' funding is linked to the BBSW.

""(The banks) are using this period to sharpen the pricing pencil to attract new business,"" said Steve Mickenbecker, group executive at rate comparison company Canstar.

857,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>","Cashing out in Uber's IPO: China, Russia and the Middle East","By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In 2015, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc went on a fundraising spree in China, tapping venture capitalists and state-backed corporations for cash and connections to try and navigate the Chinese regulatory environment. 
Uber ultimately pulled out of China, but the investors it gained in the country became part of a gallery of far-flung Uber financiers that include U.S. geopolitical rivals under intense regulatory scrutiny by the U.S. government.
Uber's investors come in all stripes: state-owned banks and corporations from China and Russia; sovereign wealth funds from Qatar, Singapore and Saudi Arabia; a Russian businessman arrested last year on embezzlement charges; venture capital funds from across Europe and the United Arab Emirates; and Indian conglomerates and a Malaysian public pension fund.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2DTDVxS) 
Many of these investors will likely have made a bundle this week in Uber's long-awaited initial public offering. The company on Thursday priced its shares at $45 a piece, raising $8.1 billion in the largest U.S. IPO since 2014, and will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.
The ride-hailing company's aggressive pursuit of capital and international presence from early on gave executives greater access to foreign investors compared to other U.S. startups. Uber was also seeking cash at a time of frenzied growth, with global investment into U.S. startups jumping 50 percent from 2013 to 2014, according to PitchBook Inc data.
That helped it raise nearly $14 billion in venture capital, making it the fourth best-funded startup globally. Uber has also raised more than $6 billion in debt, according to PitchBook. 
Uber, more than almost any other Silicon Valley company, symbolizes the glut of foreign money that has helped fuel a tech investing frenzy. 
But replicating its feat today would be an improbable task in the current regulatory climate, analysts and legal experts say.
In August, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a law to expand the powers of a government group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is tasked with reviewing foreign investments for potential national security and competitive risks.
It gives CFIUS a mandate to probe transactions previously excluded from its purview, including attempts by foreigners to purchase minority stakes in U.S. startups. It must approve deals between U.S. companies employing sensitive technology and foreign investors with influence over the startup, such as a board seat.
CFIUS has so far approved only about 10 percent of the deals submitted under the new law, according to attorneys' estimates. 
""What happened (with Uber) in 2015, you certainly could not do that again,"" said an attorney who advises clients on CFIUS cases and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. Previously, Uber's former chief executive Travis Kalanick spoke publicly about the need to raise large sums quickly to buy market share and find local investors who would help smooth the regulatory path in different countries.
CRACKING DOWN
The lion's share of Uber's fundraising was completed prior to the new CFIUS law, and there is no indication any of these investments were in any way unlawful. Chinese state-backed funds have invested in dozens of Silicon Valley companies, from drones to self-driving cars and cyber security.
But the challenge of a tech company replicating Uber's fundraising today highlights just how much U.S. regulators have cracked down on foreign investment.
Attorneys who work on CFIUS cases say a business like Uber's would be highly scrutinized if fundraising today. The company has a trove of personal data on customers, including who they are and where they go, which CFIUS has indicated is a national security matter.
""The Uber product is its users,"" said the CFIUS attorney. ""So when you look at it from that way you can see why CFIUS would be interested in it.""
That's not to say it is impossible to raise money from overseas, and investors from ally countries have an easier time getting clearance for their tech investments.
But state-owned or state-backed investors from China and Russia in particular would be a no-go for CFIUS, say attorneys. 
CFIUS earlier this year unwound the acquisition by a Chinese gaming company of dating app Grindr, calling its ownership a national security risk. Grindr collects personal information on its users and data on their whereabouts.
Uber's autonomous driving business would also likely cause problems with CFIUS today. Autonomous driving is considered important technology for the military, making it a national security concern for CFIUS.

Uber last month raised $1 billion for its autonomous vehicle unit from a consortium of investors including Japan-based SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp. It remains to be seen if that investment receives CFIUS' blessing.

858,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks Rise After Brutal Week as Tariff Hike Kicks In,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s stocks rebounded and the yuan fluctuated before the U.S. raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.5% at the mid-day break, just before the new tariffs kicked in, with volume 32 percent lower than the 30-day average. The gauge is on course for a weekly loss of 6%, the steepest in almost seven months. Hong Kong-traded shares were also higher.
The offshore yuan fluctuated after rising as much as 0.29%. The currency has already busted through its 200-day-moving average this week, en route to the 6.9 per dollar level that it hasn’t touched all year.
“The market was oversold in the past four days in both mainland and Hong Kong,"" said Louis Tse, Hong Kong-based managing director at VC Asset Management Ltd. “You can’t say investors are turning optimistic now, but since the trade talks are continuing there is some sense of ease. The market deserves a rebound.""
The Trump administration’s tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% took effect Friday. Traders were caught off guard by the U.S. president’s threats earlier in the week, rushing to protect against further losses in the yuan after the currency suddenly sank the most in more than three years. Overseas investors have been fleeing China stocks at a record pace.
The central bank set the yuan fixing at 6.7912 per dollar, stronger than forecast by analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg. Pressure on the yuan came from the country’s banks on Thursday, according to traders, who said their proprietary desks were the most active sellers.
Investors are watching for developments after Trump insisted it was still possible to reach a deal this week and said he may hold a phone call with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Delegations from the U.S. and China are in Washington for the latest round of talks.
"
859,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Trump Should Let the World Join Fight Against China,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Whatever one thinks of Donald Trump’s trade negotiating strategy -- which has largely relied on tariffs that have hurt U.S. companies and consumers most of all, many of them from parts of the country that are both economically fragile and that supported Trump in the last election -- he’s right about one thing. A global trading system meant to benefit everyone has wound up disproportionately benefiting the People’s Republic of China.
Trump is hardly alone in believing this. The problem is that he behaves as if he is.
Across the world, similar resentments have built up against Beijing’s trade practices. Country after country is convinced that persistent trade deficits with China are larger than is strictly natural -- that the mainland’s complex system of subsidies and support for state-owned companies gives them a competitive edge that local producers can’t match.
Yet, if every economy tried to address the problem unilaterally, as Trump has done, then not only would consumers across the world suffer. The entire global trading system would be put under unprecedented pressure.
Shared problems need global solutions. The trading system has to be reworked to address the Chinese challenge, not abandoned. Ideally, the U.S. would be taking the lead in coordinating this global effort instead of fighting a misdirected and unilateral trade war.
It is true that the beginnings of a joint effort to reform global trade are visible. In September last year, as the United Nations General Assembly was meeting, so were trade officials from the U.S., Japan and the European Union. In a statement afterwards that never once mentioned China, they laid out their complaints: that “some countries” followed “non-market-oriented” policies; that state-owned, subsidized “national champions” distorted global markets; and that the classification of developing countries was “overly broad.”
In January, the three nations met again and restated their concerns, adding that they would have something to present to other WTO members on industrial subsidies soon. They also once again had a few sharp things to say about “advanced developing countries.”
What the three big developed-world trading powers don’t seem to understand is that pretty much all developing countries other than China are concerned about these problems, too. By not clearly stating the purpose and direction of the reforms they seek, those powers are raising fears among those emerging economies that they’ll be caught in a net meant to snare China.
For example, a group of developing countries are meeting in New Delhi in a few days to work out how to protect the “special and differential treatment” for poorer nations that’s baked into all WTO deals, meant to allow them the space to adjust to open competition. They fear the U.S. wants to eliminate such provisions in future trade agreements dealing with areas such as fisheries and e-commerce.
This would be both unfair and, more importantly, a mistake. If China is the problem, as most would agree, then any solution needs to be tightly targeted. Failing to do so increases the chances of Beijing building alliances across the developing world to block any effort to make it change its ways. There should indeed be an objective way to determine if a country has “graduated” away from developing status -- as China certainly has -- but it is one that developing countries should agree on as well.
Bringing other developing nations onboard will make any reforms more acceptable politically. They’ll then be the product of broad-based agreement across a large swathe of WTO members, rather than unilateral U.S. action. That will reduce the chances they’ll be seen as an attempt by the developed world to water down hard-won privileges assigned to poorer countries.
The simple truth about Trump’s trade war is that it is the wrong war being fought in the wrong way -- even if against the right target. The U.S. should instead reach each out to both developed and developing countries; form a coalition of the willing; and then make it clear that China must open its markets properly, stop hidden subsidies to its exporters and national champions, and generally abide by the implicit contract that brought it into the WTO. The best way to convince China to change is to show the People’s Republic just how isolated it really is."

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese shares and the yuan strengthened on Friday on signs Beijing and Washington might still be able to avert a trade deal collapse, though confidence was fragile less than an hour before a planned U.S. tariff hike on Chinese goods takes effect.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked for 90 minutes on Thursday in Washington, and were expected to resume negotiations on Friday.
Higher tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect at 0401 GMT Friday. While Asian markets were higher, investor confidence is expected to remain fickle and driven by news headlines.
""Market sentiment has improved following the progress of the latest round of Sino-U.S. trade talks, leading to a rebound from recent falls,"" said Zhou Liang, founder of Shanghai Minority Investment Management. ""Although facing an escalating trade war, the market has been much stronger this year than last, reflecting the improved confidence of Chinese investors.""
In late morning trade, the benchmark Shanghai Composite index was up 1.3 percent, having ended at an 11-week closing low in the previous session. But that was down from earlier highs that saw the index rise as much as 2.6 percent.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index was up 1.5 percent, having earlier risen more than 3 percent. 
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.5 percent while H-shares added 0.6 percent.
The smaller Shenzhen index was up 1.8 percent and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was higher by 2.1 percent.
China's yuan was up 0.1 percent at 6.8191 per dollar, despite China's central bank setting the midpoint of the currency's daily trading band at its weakest level in 3-1/2 months before the market open, at 6.7912 per dollar.
""The market is not in as much fear anymore. The scale of the rally depends on whether the tariff increases will still go ahead at noon, whether two sides agree to carry on talking, and whether the U.S. president will meet with Liu He,"" said a Shanghai-based trader at Chinese bank, commenting on the yuan.
The soft fix came after a tariff war-inspired sell-off in the spot market on Thursday, although traders had expected it to come in even lower.
The offshore yuan strengthened in early trade, but by late morning had given up all its gains to trade at 6.8430 per dollar. It had weakened to a low of 6.8363 per dollar on Thursday.
Zhou Hao, senior EM economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore said rises in the yuan were largely triggered by changes in the market sentiment. 
""Trump is very fickle-minded. And investor sentiment had switched from overly optimistic to overly pessimistic,"" he said.""Without these twists and turns, a tariff hike would be negative for the market, but now investors think that even if there are higher tariffs, as long as trade negotiations continue it's a good thing,"" he added.

Zhou said he did not think the rebound would be sustainable, and expects the yuan to trade in a range of 6.75 to 6.9 per dollar.

862,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 11:02PM ET</span>","After U.S. complaint, Canada to soften rules for jet competition to allow Lockheed Martin bid: source","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is softening the rules of its multibillion-dollar competition for 88 new fighter jets to allow  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) to submit a bid, following a complaint by Washington, a Canadian government source said on Thursday.
The source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said Ottawa was acting after the United States told Canada the regulations would exclude Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, the plane the Canadian air force wants.
The complaint was the latest challenge for a trouble-plagued process that has dragged on for more than a decade.
Canada initially said bidders for the contract - worth between C$15 billion and C$19 billion ($11.1 billion to $14.1 billion) - must commit to give Canadian businesses 100 percent of the value of the deal in economic benefits.
But that contradicts rules of the consortium that developed the F-35, a group to which Canada belongs. The U.S. military's F-35 office wrote to Ottawa last December saying it would not bid unless changes were made.
""The U.S. government told us they were unable to offer contractual guarantees of economic benefits,"" said the source.
Ottawa is therefore dropping the requirement that firms give a legally binding promise they would spend the value of the fighter contract in Canada.
""A bidder that is not willing and able to sign a contract and guarantee them (the benefits) can still bid and still be competitive but they will get less points in the economic benefits category"" than firms that offer a watertight commitment, said the source.
The planes will be judged on capability, which makes up 60 percent of the points available, as well as price and benefits, which make up for 20 percent each. The final requirements for the jets are due out in July, said the source.
The policy change could prompt protests from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Airbus SE and Saab AB, the three other contenders. Industry sources have long predicted that Lockheed Martin's rivals could pull out if they felt Ottawa was tilting the race in favor of the F-35.
The source added that Canada had made changes that benefited the other firms. For example, Ottawa initially insisted the European planes be fully compliant with strict U.S. rules on exchanging secure data.
The rules now say European bidders need only outline how they planned to meet the U.S. security requirements.

Airbus, Saab and Lockheed declined to comment. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 1.4% and 2.3% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.6%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.1% after data showed the country’s household spending rose more than expected in March but real wages slumped the most since 2015.
South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.2% higher.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was unchanged at 6,294.85.
Overnight, Trump said China President Xi Jinping wrote him “a beautiful letter” and that he would “probably speak to him by phone.""
""Let's work together, let's get something done,"" Trump said, describing the letter.
He then said his administration might reverse its decision to hike tariffs on Chinese goods depending on progress in this week’s negotiations, although tariffs are an ""excellent"" alternative to a trade deal.
""It's an alternative I've spoken about for years. We'll take in well over a hundred billion dollars a year. We never took in 10 cents from China,"" Trump said, referring to additional tariffs he promised to impose. ""And I think it'll be a very strong day, frankly. But we'll see.""
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin kicked off two days of talks on Thursday in Washington. Officials have ended their Thursday session and are set to continue Friday, Reuters reported.
Ma Jun, a Chinese central bank advisor said in an article published by the Finance News, a state-owned paper run by the central bank, that U.S tariffs could cut China's GDP growth by 0.3%.
""The negative impact of this scenario on China's gross domestic production would be around 0.3 percentage points, this is within a controllable range,"" he said.

The currency climbed as much as 0.23% in offshore trading, following a four-day slide that was its biggest since August. The yuan has already busted through its 200-day-moving average this week, en route to the 6.9 per dollar level that it hasn’t touched all year. While the Shanghai Composite climbed as much as 2.5% on Friday, it’s still on course for a weekly drop of 5.1%.
“Markets will be in a holding pattern as we await the outcome of the meeting,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. ""If there is a breakdown and the tariffs go up, then we will see a risk-off tone in markets with the offshore yuan heading higher.”
Traders are preparing for the possibility that the Trump administration will raise duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent. They were caught off guard by the U.S. president’s threats earlier in the week, rushing to protect against further losses in the yuan after the currency suddenly sank the most in more than three years. Overseas investors have been fleeing China stocks at a record pace.
The central bank set the yuan fixing at 6.7912 per dollar, stronger than forecast by analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg. Pressure on the yuan came from the country’s banks on Thursday, according to traders, who said their proprietary desks were the most active sellers.

The filing in a state court in Utah relates to a dispute originally filed in Texas in which Travelpass accused the hotel chains last year of agreeing with each other, and with online travel groups like Expedia, to not advertise to consumers who searched for another company's hotel. 
This means, for example, that a traveler who searches online for a Marriott in Dallas would not be shown advertising for competing hotels, the Travelpass lawsuit alleges.
The Utah attorney general's office indicated that it and an unspecified number of other state attorneys general were investigating Travelpass' complaints against Expedia and hotel chains.
The chains named in a document filed with the court included Hyatt, Marriott, Caesars Entertainment Corp and Choice Hotels International Inc. 
""With respect to the investigation at issue, a multistate group has formed, but other states may be reluctant to join if there is a risk of future disclosure of their confidential communications,"" the Utah attorney general's office said in the filing.
According to the filing, the Utah investigation was opened in 2017 and remains active.

867,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 08:58PM ET</span>",GE's rising bonds offer another endorsement of CEO Culp,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co shareholders offered their latest endorsement of new Chief Executive Larry Culp this week when they approved a 2018 pay package worth $15 million. 
But perhaps the more notable endorsement of Culp's efforts to turn around the fortunes of the 127-year-old conglomerate has come from a more skeptical crowd: bondholders. 
GE's 10 largest outstanding U.S. bonds are up an average of 11.73% in the new year, besting the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BAML index of bonds rated BBB, which has a total return 6.5 3% in that time. That's a stunning turn around for a basket of debt that had swooned so heavily last year that the bond market was rife with chatter that GE might lose its investment-grade credit rating.
Earnings on April 30 showed the Boston-based company still had a way to go in its turnaround efforts, but Culp's plan to reduce the company's $110 billion debt load has nevertheless spurred interest from bondholders.
The rise in bond prices is ""definitely a recognition of the fact (Culp) does have a plan and that maybe things have bottomed out for GE,"" said Mark Jackson, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital. 
""They have someone who recognizes that they need to delever and adjust cash flows and become a better operating company... Now there's someone in charge who has a plan to actually accomplish those two very pressing needs.""
Culp was appointed last October just before GE was downgraded by credit rating agencies to just three notches above ""junk"" status on the grounds that its debt load looked untenable as its earnings faltered. GE's share price has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016 and last year it reported a $23 billion loss. 
Since taking over, Culp has sold GE assets including its biopharma business to rival U.S. conglomerate Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) for $21.4 billion. Culp in March forecast that 2019 earnings would be below analyst expectations and reiterated on Wednesday the company will likely have weaker quarters for the rest of the year after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter. 
For now, the plan to delever may be enough. 
""We started (buying the debt) when they announced the sale of their healthcare unit,"" said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital. ""They're doing the right things, but it remains to be seen whether it all works out or not.""
Jackson also said he had bought the debt recently at least in part because of Culp's potential to revive the company. ""Yes I do have some exposure,"" he said.
""I wish I could say that I got in at the wides, but that would not be true,"" said Jackson, referring to the moment when GE's credit spreads were the most aggravated.
GE is not the only company under pressure to reduce its debt balance. 
From 2015-2018, as low interest rates enabled companies to take on more debt, U.S. non-financial company leverage rose to 15 times earnings from 12 times just after the 2008 financial crisis, according to research from Moody's Investors Service.
Like GE, some of those companies are now looking to lighten that load. AB InBev has announced plans to reduce its $100 billion debt load, and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC),  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have all put themselves on debt diets this year.

While the risk of distraction may be high now that the Federal Reserve has paused its rate hikes, ""companies that did these big mega-deals and levered up to do them,"" said Jackson, now must ""live up to their commitments to delever.""

869,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 08:15PM ET</span>","Facebook rejects co-founder call for breakup, senator urges U.S. antitrust probe","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) quickly rejected a call from co-founder Chris Hughes on Thursday to split the world's largest social media company in three, while lawmakers urged the U.S. Justice Department to launch an antitrust investigation.
Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices as well as hate speech and misinformation on its networks. Some U.S. lawmakers have pushed for action to break up big tech companies as well as federal privacy regulation. 
""We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,"" Hughes, a former college roommate of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a lengthy New York Times opinion piece. 
Facebook's social network has more than 2 billion users. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. 
Facebook rejected Hughes' call for WhatsApp and Instagram to be made into separate companies, and said the focus should instead be on regulating the internet. Zuckerberg will be in Paris on Friday to discuss internet regulation with French President Emmanuel Macron.
""Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the break up of a successful American company,"" Facebook spokesman Nick Clegg said in a statement. 
""Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.""
Late on Thursday, Senator Mike Crapo, the Republican who chairs the banking committee and Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat, asked Facebook to answer questions about a potential cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network and its data collection.
The letter also asked questions about consumer privacy protections and if it had information about users' creditworthiness. 
U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, told CNBC he thinks Facebook should be broken up and that the Justice Department's antitrust division needs to begin an investigation.
Antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T (NYSE:T) being the two biggest examples.
SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 at Harvard with Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz. He left Facebook in 2007, and has said in a LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) post he made half a billion dollars for his three years of work.
""It's been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven't worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility,"" Hughes said.
Facebook lost several executives after a bruising series of privacy and disinformation scandals since 2016. The founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left, as has the executive who took over WhatsApp last year.
Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had been at the company for 13 years and was one of Zuckerberg's closest lieutenants, stepped down in March around the same time Facebook announced a pivot toward more private messaging.
He later cited ""artistic differences"" with Zuckerberg as his reason for leaving, without elaborating.
Critics say the company's pivot to privacy, which will introduce more encrypted communications, will restrict Facebook's ability to police propaganda, hate speech and other abusive behavior. Cox focused on improving tools to catch banned content in recent years.
Despite its scandals, the company's core business has proven resilient. Facebook has blown past earnings estimates in the past two quarters and its stock price barely budged in response to Hughes' opinion piece.
Hughes suggested Zuckerberg should be held responsible for privacy and other lapses at the company, echoing a call earlier this month by Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden to hold the CEO individually liable for ""repeated violations"" of privacy.
""The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive,"" Hughes said.
LAWMAKER PRESSURE 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, has vowed to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google if elected. 
""Today's big tech companies have too much power—over our economy, our society, & our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,"" Warren said on Twitter on Thursday. 
Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in a statement he agreed in retrospect that U.S. regulators should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.
""The way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,"" Khanna said. 
In one of a number of scandals to hit the company, Facebook is accused of inappropriately sharing information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook has been in advanced talks with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle a year-old investigation and said last month it expected to spend between $3 billion and $5 billion.
On Monday, Republican and Democratic U.S. senators criticized reported plans for the settlement, calling on the FTC to impose harsher penalties and more restrictions on Facebook's business practices.
Hughes said he last met with Zuckerberg in the summer of 2017, several months before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.
""Mark is a good, kind person. But I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,"" Hughes said. 
Adam Mosseri, Facebook's previous head of news feed who recently took over Instagram, responded to Hughes on Twitter.

""Regulation is important and necessary, but I'm not convinced breaking us up is the right path. Would love to chat about it if you're open,"" Mosseri said.

870,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 07:22PM ET</span>",Chevron drops Anadarko takeover battle after Occidental raises bid,"By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) abandoned its takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) on Thursday, outmaneuvered by Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's higher, $38 billion offer that included more than three times as much cash.
With a financing assist from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Occidental, which is one-quarter the size of Chevron, is the likely victor in a contest that again proved the allure of U.S. shale.
Occidental has said it plans to shed most of Anadarko's non-shale properties in a deal that would cement its position in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field.
Chevron declined to raise its initial offer after Occidental boosted the cash portion of its $76 per share bid and Anadarko's board deemed it a superior offer. Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, received a $1 billion breakup fee, which it has said it will apply to a $5 billion share repurchase program.
Chevron shares closed 3.1 percent higher on Thursday at $121.19 while shares of Occidental fell 6.4 percent to $56.33, the lowest in a decade.
Anadarko shares fell 3.3 percent to $73.39.
Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the company decided at a board meeting on Wednesday to walk away from the takeover battle, even though it could have matched or beaten Occidental's offer and saw Anadarko as a strategic fit.
""Make no mistake. We have the financial capacity to outbid Occidental, but we concluded that an increased offer would have eroded value to our shareholders, and it would have diminished returns on capital,"" Wirth said. ""The bar is high. We don't have a need to do anything. We are not desperate to do a deal.""
Chevron's decision demonstrated strong capital discipline, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.
""I am a bit surprised that they walked, but am pleased that they didn’t get caught up in a bidding war with Oxy, who comes across as willing to fight to win at all costs,"" Rowland said. ""Anadarko was a unique fit for Chevron, so I don’t expect them to go on a shopping spree in the Permian.""
Anadarko's major assets - in U.S. shale, the Gulf of Mexico and an liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique - were seen as a logical fit for Chevron, but not something the company needed. ""Chevron has no objective need to acquire Anadarko - or, for that matter, engage in any other large-scale (mergers and acquisitions),"" said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James.
Analysts said they do not expect another bidder for Anadarko to emerge. 
""The industry is trying to show investors more capital discipline and if another suitor comes in that would be significantly counter to most companies' strategies,"" analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday. 
PERMIAN BASIN
Investors have sold off shares of oil companies that increased spending on drilling instead of returning cash to shareholders. They have called for capital discipline, defined as increasing production by 4 percent a year and maintaining a 4 percent dividend.
One result: The value of U.S. oil and gas mergers and acquisitions fell to a 10-year low in the first quarter as investors sold shares of companies that spent more on drilling than on buybacks and dividends. 
The contest for Anadarko underscored the value of its assets in the Permian Basin, the vast shale field with oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.
The region's soaring production has propelled U.S. oil production to 12 million barrels per day (bpd), more than that of Russia or Saudi Arabia. 
Anadarko said on Thursday it had signed a definitive agreement with Occidental and expects the merger to be completed in the second half of the year. The deal still faces antitrust reviews.
Chevron holds 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin and has vast mineral ownership there, which reduces its royalty rate. It expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 bpd by the end of next year, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023.
Occidental outmaneuvered Chevron by gaining cash and allies.
It got a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and struck a deal with French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) to take most of Anadarko's international assets, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. Total agreed to pay $8.8 billion for the assets once the merger goes ahead.
Several Occidental investors oppose the deal, including its sixth-largest shareholder, T. Rowe Price Group Inc, because they consider it too large a risk if oil prices falter, or if Occidental cannot produce the $3.5 billion a year in cost savings it has promised.
Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevailed in the takeover, noting the deal would add $46 billion of debt before any sale of assets.

Several investors also have criticized Occidental's decision this week to secure Anadarko's endorsement by excluding a shareholder vote on the deal.

871,By Investing.com,"<span>May 09, 2019 07:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Uber to Debut at Low End of Its Range
Ride-share company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) played it cautious when it priced its IPO at $45 per share tonight, the low end of its expected range, despite an oversubscribed offering.
The company still raised $8.1 billion and is valued at more than $80 billion, but underwriter nerves were evident after the  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) IPO debacle.
""Uber is basically Lyft 2.0. Good model, growing sales. But, yet again, here comes California math once more. It is still losing a ton of money,"" said Brian Hamilton, a tech entrepreneur and founder of data firm Sageworks.
""If you buy, you are buying a bull market, not a company,"" he added.
Who gave Uber’s bankers the idea of playing it safe is beyond me(at).
2. CPI Seen Rising
Inflation numbers continue to arrive tomorrow, this time on the retail front.
The Labor Department will issue the consumer price index (CPI) for April.
On average, economists expect that the CPI rose 0.4% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to have risen 0.2%.
Wholesales inflation rose as expected last month, but the producer price index (PPI) rose less than anticipated.
3. Dwindling Earnings Season Still Has Some Names
Most of the big, attention-grabbing earnings are done, with the big retailers starting to come in starting in the next week. But Friday brings three reports of interest.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) reports before the open. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the hotel management giant to report $1.34 a share in earnings, unchanged from a year ago.
Revenue is expected to rise 2.4% to $5.13 billion. Marriott makes its money these days by operating properties that others build or own. The 12-month target price is $135.24, up just 0.6% from Thursday’s close. But the shares have climbed nearly 25% this year.

872,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Sticker shock from Trump's new trade tariffs months away,"By Nandita Bose, Lisa Baertlein and Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - It may take three or four months for American shoppers to feel the pinch from President Donald Trump's latest round of tariff increases, but retailers will have little choice but to raise prices on a wide range of goods to cover the rising cost of imports before too long, according to economists and industry consultants.
The impact will not end there. Trump’s plan to lift tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent is almost certain to slow U.S. economic growth and, if they stay in place for an extended period, could cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs, one forecaster said.
Angered over China reneging on previously agreed elements in the two countries' latest trade talks, Trump has ordered the new levies to take effect as of 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on Friday and would hit goods leaving Chinese ports after that time.
The new duties would affect nearly 6,000 products, including many consumer items such as furniture, handbags, electronics, clothing, personal care products such as perfumes and shampoos, luggage, bedsheets and cereal.
The tariffs could cost an average U.S. family of four $767 a year, a study from Trade Partnership, an international trade consulting firm, estimated. By the end of 2020, they could lead to a loss of 200,000 jobs, according to forecasting firm Oxford Economics.
So far, U.S. retailers have dealt with the tariffs either by absorbing some of the expenses, persuading their Chinese suppliers to cut costs, spreading the added fees across many products to minimize the impact, or by importing more goods before the first round of duties took effect. 
But the 25 percent increase will make it much harder to find new ways to absorb the cost, forcing most retailers to pass it on to consumers.
There will not be an immediate impact on price labels in stores and online. The lead time - between an order being negotiated with a supplier to being manufactured, shipped to U.S. ports and delivered to retail shelves - will save consumers pain, for now.
""There is at least a 90-to-120-day lead time... so three to four months before any new pricing can go into effect,"" said Brian Ehrig, managing director at Accenture's retail consultancy Kurt Salmon, who advises apparel and footwear retailers.
BICYCLES, HANDBAGS 
Arnold Kamler, Chief Executive of Kent International, which sells bicycles that retail from $80 to $200 at major retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, imports about 200 containers a week from China this time of year. 
""We would like to raise prices immediately,"" he said, but Kent's major retail partners have policies that prevent that. Most major retailers require about 60 days for new prices to work through their systems, he said.
""We will need to raise prices, if it goes through, in 60 to 90 days,"" said Kamler, adding that the company has less than two months of inventory on hand. 
Sherrill Mosee, owner of Philadelphia-based MinkeeBlue, which sells work and travel tote bags for women on websites like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), said her company cannot absorb the new 25 percent tariff on top of the 10 percent tariff hike last year, which itself added to the existing 17.6 percent tariff on synthetic leather used to make her bags. 
Mosee, who put in a new order for 1,500 bags from China just days before Trump announced plans to increase the tariff rate to 25 percent, said she plans to raise the price ""a little"" on the new bags, which are scheduled to arrive by early July.
The National Retail Federation said hundreds of thousands of businesses around the country will be burdened by the China tariffs. The trade group and others like the Retail Industry Leaders Association have repeatedly said tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. businesses and consumers, not by China.
Trump's levies on shipments from China have so far barely been a blip for the U.S. economy, trimming growth by an estimated tenth of a percentage point for all of 2019, according to Oxford Economics.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said increasing the tariff on the $200 billion in imports to 25 percent would triple the impact to three-tenths of a percentage point, taking a substantial bite out of U.S. growth that many economists forecast at about 2.2 percent this year.
Many are still hopeful a resolution will emerge. Lauren Goodwin, portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments, said she expects a result that would prevent a full imposition of tariffs for a lengthy period of time.

It would take six to nine months for the tariffs themselves to fully impact prices, she said.

873,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>",Dow Texas lockout may end after fire-hit tank farm reopens: sources,"By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The reopening of a portion of a Deer Park, Texas, petrochemical tank farm after a massive mid-March fire may lead to the end of a lockout of union workers at a neighboring Dow Inc plant, said four people familiar with the matter.
A March 17 blaze at Mitsui & Co's Intercontinental Terminals Co (ITC) site halted customer access to its undamaged storage tanks and its docks. The fire led to wider disruptions that limited the operations at chemical and refining plants along the Houston Ship Channel. 
While the ITC site was out of commission, Dow locked out about 230 hourly workers represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW) on April 22 amid labor contract talks. The plant had relied on ITC for chemical feedstocks and shipping services.
On May 2, authorities allowed ITC to reopen its docks. Dow, which has been operating with primarily salaried employees since the lockout, began boosting production a few days later, the sources said. 
""We will continue with our current staffing model as we respond to improved conditions post the ITC tank terminal event,"" said Dow spokeswoman Ashley Mendoza.
Dow and USW officials met at least twice this week with a federal mediator in an attempt to restart negotiations, Mendoza said.
""The company is willing and has offered to negotiate with the union on a continual basis until our differences are resolved,"" she said. Union workers will be able to return once an agreement has been reached, she said.
USW officials declined to discuss the negotiations. 
The two sides have not met since an April 30 meeting with a federal mediator did not break the impasse. 
Prior to the lockout, workers at the Dow plant twice voted to reject the company's proposed contract terms. In the first vote, 96 percent of the members rejected the company's proposal, and that widened to 98 percent rejection on the second try, the union has said. 
Local, state and federal agencies are investigating what caused the ITC fire, which spread from a single storage tank on March 17 to 10 other tanks over the next two days and required hundreds of emergency workers and fire specialists to extinguish.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Vale said on Thursday that it plans to invest $2.5 billion over the next five years in technology that removes the need for tailings dams, the waste facilities responsible for two deadly mining disasters in the past four years.
The funds will be mainly used to convert Vale's Carajas mining complex in northern Brazil to disposing of 100 percent of its tailings through dry processes, Vale's director of ferrous planning and development, Fabiano Carvalho Filho, said in an email response to questions from Reuters. 
Overall, the world's largest iron ore exporter is aiming to boost the use of so-called dry processing to 70 percent of its output by the end of 2023, from 60 percent today. 
Of the 17 processing lines of Plant 1 at Carajas, 11 are already dry and the remaining six wet lines will be converted by 2022, Carvalho Filho said.
In addition, the funds will be used in two projects in Brazil's mining heartland of Minas Gerais, he said. One is a new processing complex for iron ore and the other is a previously operational mine which Vale is seeking to reactivate.
Vale said the investment is not directly related to the Brumadinho disaster, which left 237 confirmed dead, or the 2015 collapse of another dam at the Samarco joint venture with BHP Group Ltd, that killed 19 others and also caused what is widely considered the worst environmental disaster in Brazil's history.

The dry tailings spending plan is part of an existing program under which Vale has invested almost $17.5 billion over the last 10 years, Carvalho Filho said.

875,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 05:38PM ET</span>","Uber valued at $82 billion in IPO as market jitters, Lyft woes weigh","By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc priced its initial public offering on Thursday at the low end of its targeted range to value the company at $82.4 billion, hoping the conservative approach would let it avoid the market chaos suffered by rival  Lyft .
Uber, the most high-profile U.S. listing since  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) seven years ago, raised $8.1 billion, pricing its IPO at $45 per share, compared with an expected range of $44-$50 per share. 
Uber's IPO came against a backdrop of turbulent financial markets, fueled by the trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as the plunging share price of Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), which is down 23 percent from its IPO price in late March.
Uber's valuation is almost a third less than the valuation of up to $120 billion that its investment bankers predicted last year. 
The IPO was oversubscribed, but Uber settled for a lower price to avoid a repeat of Lyft's IPO in late March, which priced strongly then plunged in trade. Uber also wanted to accommodate big mutual funds, which unlike hedge funds put in orders for a lower price.
Lyft's stock slumped nearly 11 percent on Wednesday to a record closing low of $52.91, well below the $72 per share IPO price, after the ride-hailing company reported a $1.1 billion quarterly loss.
Some still consider the stock overpriced. 
""Uber is basically Lyft 2.0. Good model, growing sales. But, yet again, here comes California math once more. It is still losing a ton of money,"" said Brian Hamilton, a tech entrepreneur and founder of data firm Sageworks. ""If you buy, you are buying a bull market, not a company,"" he added. 
In meetings with potential investors the past two weeks, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, argued that Uber's future was not as a ride-hailing company, but as a wide technology platform shaping logistics and transportation.
The company is hoping this pitch, coupled with any fear of missing out what is expected to be the biggest IPO of 2019, will support demand. 
The IPO pricing is a balancing act for Uber's team of underwriting banks, led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), to negotiate a good price while leaving some upside to ensure the stock trades up on its market debut.

Uber lost $3.03 billion in 2018 from operations, and reported a net loss attributable to the company for the first quarter of 2019 of around $1 billion on revenues of roughly $3 billion.

Trying to offset declines in print advertising, News Corp has been focusing on its book publishing business, which includes the famous HarperCollins brand, and its digital businesses.
""News Corp reaped rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audio book sales,"" Chief Executive Robert Thomson said. 
The company, controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said HarperCollins' core earnings rose 29 percent in the quarter, helped by strong sales of audio books and new releases such as 'Fing by David Walliams'.
Revenue from book publishing rose about 6 percent to $421 million, and the segment's earnings before interest, tax, amortization and depreciation jumped 29 percent to $53 million.
Analysts' were expecting revenue of $414 million from the unit, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.54%, the S&P 500 slipped 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.41%. It was the third loss in four days for the Dow and sixth loss in seven days for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. But the close was a big improvement over an ugly slump earlier in the day. The Dow was down as many as 450 points during the session.
The U.S. and China are set to get trade talks underway at 5:00 PM ET (21:00 GMT), but market participants were seemingly wary of betting on a positive outcome, with analysts expecting Washington to move ahead with planned tariffs on Beijing at midnight.
“We continue to believe the tariff rate on the $200 billion tranche of tariffs is likely to officially increase to 25% at 12:01 AM ET Friday,” said Goldman Sachs, placing the odds at around 60%.
But the bank also touted some reason for optimism as it suggested that the U.S. tariff hike may have a lesser impact than many expect as exports that have already left Chinese ports before May 10 will not be subject to the increase.
The softer deadline leaves the door open for further trade talks in the coming weeks and differs from the 10% tariff the U.S. implemented in September, which didn't exclude goods that were already “in-transit,” Goldman added.
Moreover, President Trump cheered the market in a brief press opportunity, saying he still expects a trade deal to get done. The comment helped trim stock losses.
Trade-sensitive concerns of the market were seemingly unconvinced, with Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), bellwethers of global trade, ending the day lower.
Tech stocks, meanwhile, were dragged lower by a slump in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as Wall Street turned negative on the chipmaker following its warning Wednesday of low-single-digit revenue growth for the next three years.
BMO downgraded Intel to market perform from outperform, warning that semiconductor stocks do not do well in a decelerating gross margin environment.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also dragged tech into the red, falling 1.1%, after Bernstein indicated the iPhone maker may be sporting a frothy valuation with its shares trading at 17 times forward price-to-earnings.
Boeing, 3M, Intel and Apple combined to contribute 79 points to the Dow's loss.
But energy stocks eked out a gain as a rise in  Chevron  helped offset lower U.S. oil prices.
Chevron (NYSE:CVX) rose more than 4% after it pulled out of the running to acquire Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), saying it would not submit a new offer to acquire the company. This came after Anadarko said the offer from rival oil company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) was superior to Chevron's. Wall Street booed the potential deal, pushing Occidental down 6.4%.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors had to contend with mixed results that did little to improve sentiment on stocks.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), operator of a television streaming platform, reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss, sending its shares more than 28% higher.
But Etsy tumbled 10.75% after the online crafts retailer reported first-quarter revenues that slightly missed Investing.com’s consensus estimates.
In other company news, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOX) ended the day 3% higher after after it invested hundreds of millions of dollars on a sports-betting platform that it hopes will diversify its revenue streams and expand the reach of the Fox Sports brand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell on Thursday ahead of critical trade negotiations between the United States and China, though they pared losses significantly after U.S. President Donald Trump said reaching a deal this week was possible.
U.S. stocks had fallen more than 1% earlier in the session but recovered much of those losses after Trump said he had received a ""beautiful letter"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Negotiators will meet at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) on Thursday, Trump said. They are set to continue talks through Friday.
Still, the United States has not backed down from hiking tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% on Friday. Trump also said that paperwork had been initiated to levy 25% tariffs on a further $325 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Even with the possibility of further tariffs going into effect, some investors remained optimistic that a trade agreement was within reach. That likely kept Thursday's declines in check, said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management.
""We may very well see tariffs put in place tomorrow, but it's going to get resolved,"" Stoltzfus said. ""It's too impractical for either side to extend this into a protracted trade war.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 138.97 points, or 0.54%, to 25,828.36, the S&P 500 lost 8.7 points, or 0.30%, to 2,870.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.73 points, or 0.41%, to 7,910.59.
The S&P 500 index briefly slipped below its 50-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of momentum, during the session but ended above that level.
Materials and technology stocks posted the steepest declines among the S&P 500's sectors, dropping 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively.
Shares of chipmakers, which get a large portion of the revenue from China, continued to slide, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index ending 1.2% lower. The index has fallen 6% so far this week and is on pace to post its biggest percentage weekly loss since December.
Chipmaker shares were also pressured by an underwhelming profit growth forecast from  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel shares fell 5.3% and were the biggest drag on the S&P 500.
Trade-sensitive industrial bellwethers were also hit, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares falling 1% and 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co shares dropping 1.9%.
The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, rose for the fourth consecutive session and is at its highest level in more than three months.
In a bright spot, Tapestry Inc shares jumped 8.5%, the most among S&P companies, after the Coach handbag maker beat quarterly profit estimates and announced a $1 billion share buyback plan.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) shares gained 3.1%, providing the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500, after the oil company said it would not raise its $33 billion offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).

885,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>",Scaramucci celebrates hedge funds in Vegas at SALT with less glitz,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - After a one-year pause, the hedge fund industry schmooze fest organized by Anthony Scaramucci, the investment manager who briefly served as President Donald Trump's communications director, returned to the Las Vegas strip this week.
But the atmosphere at the 10th annual SALT Conference was much more subdued than in past years, when celebrity hedge fund managers rubbed shoulders with former U.S. presidents at private dinners, poolside parties and late-night gambling at the Bellagio hotel.
This time, organizers and attendees said they ditched that party vibe to debate investment ideas and listen to former White House officials talk geopolitics.
""The vast majority of institutional investors would rather be sitting around and having a discussion about structured credit tranches instead of going to splashy parties,"" Eric Nierenberg, chief strategy officer at the $74 billion state pension fund for Massachusetts, said in an interview at the event.
""What we are trying to do is very sober,” he added.
For the first time, investors attending SALT outnumbered hedge fund managers, said Ray Nolte, co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge Capital, the investment company Scaramucci founded and which is affiliated with the conference. There were also more panels at the expense of longer networking breaks.
The superstar managers who previously attended – including Daniel Loeb, David Tepper, William Ackman, Ken Griffin and Steven A. Cohen - did not come. Avenue Capital Group’s Marc Lasry said he opted to watch the Milwaukee Bucks, a team he co-owns, beat the Boston Celtics, instead of flying to Vegas.
And at the pool party where musical artists like the Gipsy Kings once performed, there was a disc jockey spinning tunes. In the past there were also private concerts featuring One Republic and Duran Duran.
""We want to replace the perception that this is a boondoggle with the reality of what is being offered here,"" Nolte told Reuters.
The conference has taken on new importance as hedge funds are making a comeback of sorts.
After facing criticism for more than a decade over high fees and lackluster returns, some institutional investors are returning to hedge funds that pursue niche strategies, in which performance is less correlated to market moves.
Among those paying $8,000 per ticket to hear some of those ideas were representatives of the Canadian Pension Plan Investments Board, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), the Public Employees Retirement Association of Colorado, known as Colorado PERA, the City of El Paso Employees Retirement Trust and the West Palm Beach Police Pension Fund. Many had come for the first time.
Others were Scaramucci’s friends and business associates, celebrating SALT’s relaunch after two tumultuous years.
Scaramucci joined the Trump administration in 2017 as communications director, a job that lasted only 11 days. He also tried to sell SkyBridge, which invests $10 billion, to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, but the effort failed.
In reviving his signature event, Scaramucci was thrilled to report that he drew the second-highest attendance in its history.
""The country has to fix a lot of problems,” he said in an interview. “I don't know if we'll fix them here, but we will certainly talk about them.”
Panelists included President Donald Trump's former chief of staff, General John Kelly, who fired Scaramucci, as well as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul.
Much of the confab focused on concerns that economic growth may slow, that volatility will pick up and that the stock market boom will come to an end.
Nolte is betting that investment grade debt will lose value while assets like residential mortgages will perform well. Amy McGarrity, chief investment officer of Colorado PERA, likes multi-strategy funds focused on Asia. MassPrim's Nierenberg is scouring emerging markets for opportunities.
On one panel, economist Nouriel Roubini described cryptocurrencies as ""the mother and father of all bubbles."" On another, former Countrywide Financial Corp CEO Angelo Mozilo https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-mozilo-newsmaker/angelo-mozilo-from-housing-hero-to-subprime-foe-idUSTRE69E5ZU20101015 once again defended himself against accusations that he was a key architect of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. ""Somehow, for some unknown reason, I got blamed for it,"" he said. 
Several attendees told Reuters they liked the faster-paced program and felt the subdued tone was more appropriate for the current times.
""The real test will be if there are jugglers and fire eaters at the pool party,"" one hedge-fund manager joked.

There were not.

The fund will be renamed Evercare Health Fund, it said in a statement.
Abraaj, once the Middle East and North Africa's biggest buyout fund, had a row with investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the International Finance Corp over the use of money in a $1 billion healthcare fund.
The row led to months of financial turmoil at the Dubai-based firm which filed for provisional liquidation last year. 
Last month Abraaj's founder Arif Naqvi was arrested in Britain and is awaiting potential extradition to the United States where he faces charges of defrauding investors. He has maintained his innocence.
TPG said the healthcare fund will continue with its critical mission of providing affordable and high-quality healthcare across Africa and South Asia.
The investors include Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, IFC, CDC Group, Proparco, Philips and  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT), it said.
Liquidators for Abraaj, which at its peak managed $13.6 billion in assets, are trying to reach deals for some of the private equity funds managed by the collapsed firm.
Colony Capital Inc has agreed to buy Abraaj's private equity business in Latin America, while Actis is the front-runner for the $1 billion Abraaj Private Equity Fund IV, but it still needs to convince investors in the fund to vote for the deal. 
(Makes clear fund will be renamed, rather than become a new fund)

887,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>",Corporate currency hedging slows as FX volatility slumps,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The striking calm in foreign exchange markets in recent months has led some U.S. multinational companies to scale back on guarding against currency gyrations, potentially leaving them vulnerable if volatility rebounds from near five-year lows.
Muted price moves across all asset classes, relatively benign economic data and a lack of big divergence in monetary policies around the globe have crushed currency turbulence as measured by the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) FX Volatility Index.
""If you look at periods of distress like the financial crises, the internet bust, the Greek debt crises or Brexit, those are always times when banks see a rapid pickup in hedging activity by their clients,"" said Mark Wendling, senior managing partner at Cincinnati, Ohio-based Bannockburn Global Forex LLC.
""With the lower volatility that we have seen in FX recently, some customers do get lulled to sleep and hedging activity drops,"" he said.
Companies that generate a large part of their sales overseas use strategies including forwards and options to guard against currency moves.
Low FX volatility, which makes for relatively cheaper options prices, and increased one-off demand for hedges due to a substantial pickup in dealmaking this year, should have boosted corporate hedging activity, currency strategists said. 
Instead, FX corporate hedging flow from U.S. multinationals has been notably lighter than expected, said Andrew Scott, head of flow strategy & solutions at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York.
""For those hedging incoming non-dollar revenue streams, one plausible argument is perhaps the fact that no one actually quite believes that this dollar strength is sustainable,"" said Scott.
The dollar rose 6.2% on a trade-weighted basis in the first quarter compared to a year ago, its strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data. 
A rallying dollar is usually a negative for U.S. multinational companies, whose foreign currency revenues are worth less when the dollar is stronger.
While some companies have well-defined systematic approaches to FX hedging, others employ substantial discretion, analysts said.
Typically companies have preset hedge ratios but still have some room to maneuver within those ranges, Chuck Brobst, managing director at OANDA Treasury & Analytics in Chicago, said.
""Their strategy might require them to hedge between 60% and 80% of next year's foreign sales. Within that range, they have discretion of how much to hedge, so during periods of low volatility in currency markets, they act with less urgency, and remain less hedged,"" he said.
""At the margin, when volatility is low, more corporates are prone to take a directional view and wait to see which way the market breaks,"" he said.
Hedging activity has stalled over the last few months, with clients unwilling to take a bet on currency movements due to uncertainty about how long-running political conflicts will shake out, according to a trader with the foreign exchange group of a major bank who did not wish to be identified because of a lack of clearance to speak to the media.
The U.S.-China trade tiff, uncertainty about the outcome of Britain's efforts to leave the European Union and the potential impact on oil prices from a political crises in Venezuela are keeping clients on the sidelines, the trader said.
(Graphic: Foreign exchange volatility - https://tmsnrt.rs/2DFGyTJ)
However, volatility can return fast. This week saw an uptick in market gyrations driven by worries that Washington and Beijing could fail to reach a trade deal.
While interest in FX hedging has risen in general as companies grow and do more international business, there is room for activity to pick up once FX markets get choppier, said Amanda Breslin, head of Chatham Financial’s corporate treasury advisory group, in Denver, Colorado, that counts Fortune 100 companies among its clients.
""There's usually a little bit of a time lag from the time volatility spikes to the time corporates are actually feeling it flow through to their financials, getting heightened sensitivity from their board and then having a much shorter time frame to implement a solution or at least a go-forward risk reduction program,"" said Breslin.
That delay in actually putting hedges in place could mean increased volatility in corporate results, analysts said.
LOW VOL, NOT LOW RISK
""Currencies can trend and still have low FX volatility,"" said Amo Sahota, director at foreign exchange risk management consultancy Klarity FX in San Francisco.
""You see the low volatility and think I am not going to do anything about it, but it's like death by a thousand cuts,"" he said.
Steady foreign currency moves in one direction can still work against a company in times of low volatility, with the potential to impact results significantly. 
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which does hedge its FX risk, said currency moves were partly to blame for slower revenue growth in the first quarter and expects FX moves to dent revenues again in the second quarter.

North American companies reported $20.84 billion in negative currency impacts in the fourth quarter of 2018, the most since the since the fourth quarter of 2015, according to corporate treasury and cash management solution provider Kyriba.

890,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>","U.S. FCC Bars China Mobile, Reviewing Other Chinese Carriers","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Federal Communications Commission barred China Mobile Ltd. from the U.S. market over national security concerns and said it was opening a review of other Chinese companies amid friction between the world’s biggest economies.
The FCC voted 5-0 to deny China Mobile’s request to enter the U.S. market, after being urged to do so by the Trump administration. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai after the vote said the agency is “looking at” authorizations granted earlier to China Telecom and China Unicom. He declined to say what that process entails.
The FCC said it had determined China Mobile is controlled by the Chinese government.
“The Chinese government could use China Mobile to exploit our telephone network to increase intelligence collection against U.S. government agencies and other sensitive targets that depend on this network,” Pai said. “That is a flatly unacceptable risk.”
The vote came as senior Chinese officials were set to visit Washington for negotiations Thursday and Friday. President Donald Trump is locked in a trade dispute with China and has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods as early as Friday.
The Trump administration also is trying to persuade allies to shun Huawei Technologies Co., the Shenzhen-based network-gear maker that U.S. officials call a security risk. Huawei officials dispute the accusation. The FCC is considering whether to allow Huawei to operate in the U.S. and is awaiting a recommendation from the Trump administration, Pai said.
The FCC vote rejected an application filed in 2011 by China Mobile International (USA) Inc. The agency said parent company China Mobile is 100% owned by the Chinese government.
Parent China Mobile is the world’s largest mobile phone operator by customers, with about 899 million subscribers. It wanted approval to be listed as a “common carrier” that would let it to carry international voice traffic between the U.S. and foreign countries, and to connect that traffic with the U.S. telecommunications network. China Mobile told the agency it wouldn’t provide domestic telephone or mobile services in the U.S.
Granting the request would have given China Mobile greater access to telephone lines, fiber-optic cables and cellular networks, raising concerns about its ability to alter, block and re-route traffic, the White House told the FCC.
“They consider the risks to be unacceptable,” the FCC said in a document prepared for Thursday’s vote. “The Chinese government could use China Mobile USA to conduct or to increase economic espionage and intelligence collection against the Unite States.”
U.S. concern focused on Chinese law that requires companies to cooperate with state intelligence agencies, which the U.S. has said could be used for economic espionage or intelligence activities. China Mobile’s size and technical resources make it particularly vulnerable to such demands, the government said.
China Mobile said it wouldn’t be required to comply with such requests and said it “is no more vulnerable to exploitation” than any other U.S. or foreign carrier that uses “best-practices” measures.
“We comply with all applicable laws in the course of operations and have not engaged in any behavior that causes ‘substantial and serious national security and law enforcement risks,”’ China Mobile said in an emailed statement prior to the vote.
Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr said the agency should go further and investigate China-owned carriers that received approval to connect with U.S. networks earlier, citing concerns that at least one of them “has been hijacking U.S. traffic and redirecting it through China.”
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, the agency’s senior Democrat, said the Republican-majority FCC is doing too little to ensure network security.
“This application has been in these halls for more than eight years,” Rosenworcel said in a written statement. “So while I support this vote, it does nothing to change the status quo.”
The U.S. and China have signaled hardening positions as they prepare for high-stakes talks in Washington to try and avoid an escalation in a year-old trade war that has cast a long shadow over financial markets and the global economy.
China’s top trade envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, was due to arrive in the U.S. capital on Thursday afternoon and go immediately into discussions with Trump’s top negotiator, Robert Lighthizer. U.S. tariffs on some $200 billion in Chinese goods are set to increase to 25% just hours later in a move that economists and businesses say risks being the most economically consequential of all of Trump’s tariff moves so far.

891,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>","Canada Lawmakers Demand Facebook’s Zuckerberg, Sandberg Testify","(Bloomberg) -- Politicians in Ottawa want to question Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg after a watchdog found  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). violated Canadian privacy law -- but it’s unclear if they’ll ever get the chance.
Canada’s Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics issued the summons Tuesday, according to minutes published after the closed-door session. The demand comes ahead of a May 28 meeting, to be hosted in Canada, of the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and ‘Fake News.’
The social media giant says it will be “appropriately represented” at that meeting. However, the U.S. firm is staying silent about whether the top executives themselves will comply with a summons to testify.
In a report last month, Canadian privacy watchdog Daniel Therrien said Facebook committed “serious contraventions” of the country’s privacy laws -- and alleged the company had flatly declined to accept the findings. That angered Canadian lawmakers, who accused Facebook of thumbing its nose at Parliament.
“This is a highly unusual step to take but Facebook’s disregard for the rights of Canadian citizens and the recent finding of the Privacy Commissioner that Facebook broke Canadian law has necessitated our decision,” lawmaker Charlie Angus, who put forward the motion to summon the executives, said by email Wednesday. “We will see if they are willing to respect the Parliament of Canada and the presence of legislators from around the world.”
Ethics Committee Chairman Bob Zimmer said notices of the summons were sent to Facebook’s representatives. If Facebook ignores them, Canada’s parliament could vote on whether to hold them in contempt, he said.
“We’ve been sitting listening to testimony for almost two years, first of all, about how their platform is used as a weapon” in conflict zones and “how much it’s been impactful to democracy shifts around the world as well,” Zimmer said in an interview. “All we’ve seen is a lack of action, or very limited action, to fix that problem.”
Facebook has preached a focus on privacy recently, which has politicians calling on them to show up to the committee and prove it. Lawmakers say Zuckerberg declined an earlier invitation to appear before the multi-nation committee.
“Since that time he’s sort of done a mea culpa, said I care about privacy, Facebook cares about privacy,” said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, another lawmaker on the committee. “The first opportunity he had to take it seriously, he declines an invitation from the parliaments and his company refuses to cooperate with our privacy commissioner.”
The issue has wide support among Canadian lawmakers. Zimmer, Angus and Erskine-Smith all hail from different political parties.
In a statement Thursday, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company would work with lawmakers to make sure it’s represented, but didn’t say who would go.
“Over the last year, we have participated in numerous meetings and hearings with government bodies around the world,” the Menlo Park, California-based company said. “We will work with the Committee to ensure Facebook is appropriately represented at the May 28 meeting.”

893,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 01:17PM ET</span>",FCC votes to deny China Mobile bid to operate in U.S.,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously on Thursday to deny China Mobile Ltd's bid to provide U.S. telecommunications services and said it was reviewing similar approvals held by two other Chinese telecom firms.
China Mobile, which is owned by the Chinese government, sought approval in 2011 to provide interconnection services for phone calls between the United States and other countries. The approval would have given it enhanced access to U.S. telephone lines, fiber-optic cable, cellular networks and communications satellites.
The FCC voted 5-0 to deny the application, citing risks that the Chinese government could use the approval to conduct espionage against the U.S. government. China Mobile had not sought approval to provide wireless services to U.S. consumers.
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said on Thursday the United States should also take ""additional action"" and investigate whether to revoke similar prior approvals for other Chinese-owned carriers, including China Unicom and China Telecom Corp, to operate in the United States. The carriers could not immediately be reached.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the commission was ""looking"" at the authorization for those two companies, but declined to elaborate.
The FCC cited reports that ""China Telecom has been hijacking U.S. traffic and redirecting it through China,"" Carr noted.
Pai said ""there is a significant risk that the Chinese government would use China Mobile to conduct activities that would seriously jeopardize the national security, law enforcement, and economic interests of the United States.""
Pai added ""the Chinese government could use China Mobile to exploit our telephone network to increase intelligence collection against U.S. government agencies and other sensitive targets that depend on this network.""
FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said Thursday ""the national security environment has changed since those applications were granted"" to other Chinese carriers. He said it was a ""top priority"" to address national security concerns regarding other carriers.
Starks noted that if China Mobile had won approval, it ""could even end up carrying the communications of U.S. government agencies"" if it offered the least costly path to carry traffic on a particular route.
The vote come amid a broader U.S. campaign to limit the role of Chinese telecommunications firms in the build-out of 5G networks as Western governments grapple with the national security implications of moving to 5G, which promises to be at least 100 times faster than the current 4G networks.
Pai said Thursday the FCC will examine the security of 5G infrastructure and technology. The announcement came after a bipartisan call from members of Congress.
For more than a year, the White House has been considering an executive order to declare a national emergency that would bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by China's Huaweiand ZTE (HK:0763).

The FCC has also been considering for more than a year whether to require carriers to remove and replace equipment from companies deemed a national security risk. Pai said he is waiting on the Commerce Department for a list of companies that would be covered by the order.

898,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>","The Population Bomb Is Fizzling, But That Won’t Save the Planet","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For more than two centuries, thoughtful people have been worrying that rising populations would overtax the world’s resources. “The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race,” English clergyman Thomas Robert Malthus wrote in his “Essay on the Principle of Population” in 1798. A hundred and seventy years later, Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich argued pretty much the same thing in “The Population Bomb”:
Each year food production in undeveloped countries falls a bit further behind burgeoning population growth, and people go to bed a little bit hungrier. While there are temporary or local reversals of this trend, it now seems inevitable that it will continue to its logical conclusion: mass starvation.
Malthus and Ehrlich were both right that population growth was accelerating. England’s population doubled in the half century after 1798; the world’s population doubled from 3.5 billion in 1968 to 7 billion in 2011, just six years later than Ehrlich had predicted.
Mass starvation did not follow in either case, though, thanks to advances in agricultural productivity and world trade. This turn of events has done much to discredit the arguments of Malthus and Ehrlich. So have the solutions they proposed to population growth: Malthus opposed aid to the poor, on the grounds that it would just encourage them to have more kids; Ehrlich pushed for population-control measures ranging from luxury taxes on diapers to forced sterilization. 
Lately, matters have taken an interesting turn. The population bomb is giving indications of fizzling. Yet concerns that we humans are overtaxing the environment seem only to be growing.
On Monday, for example, a United Nations scientific panel issued a new report(1) documenting that plant and animal species around the world are going extinct at an accelerating rate. A key cause, according to the report, is that “in the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly 4-fold and global trade has grown 10-fold, together driving up the demands for energy and materials.”
On Monday, I also happened to finish reading “Empty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline,” a book published early this year that extrapolates from current fertility trends to argue that the biggest challenges facing the world in the second half of the current century will have to do with falling population. The authors, pollster Darrell Bricker and journalist John Ibbitson (both Canadians, for whatever it’s worth), are mainly interested in the impact on economic growth, politics, social relations and international affairs. But when they do discuss environmental matters, they are awfully sanguine about them. “It will be cleaner, safer, quieter,” they write of the post-peak-population earth. “The oceans will start to heal and the atmosphere cool — or at least stop heating.”
So … problem solved, right? Not exactly.
Bricker and Ibbitson’s forecast of a coming population decline is not grabbed out of thin air. In affluent countries and a lot of not-so-affluent ones, population growth is slowing and in some cases going into reverse, thanks to fertility rates that have fallen below the 2.1 births per woman that keeps population steady over time. Worldwide, the fertility rate is now an estimated 2.4 births per woman — less than half what it was when Ehrlich issued his warning in 1968 — and falling.
It is not falling evenly. This lends drama to Bricker and Ibbitson’s book, which envisions a shrinking China, a troubled Europe and, thanks to immigration, continued U.S. strength and a rising profile for Canada. (Did I mention they’re Canadian?) Europe, East Asia and North America have had below-replacement fertility rates for decades now. Latin America recently joined this club, and the Middle East and South Asia seem inexorably headed for membership. The one big outlier has been sub-Saharan Africa, where the fertility rate was still 4.8 in 2017 and hasn’t been falling as fast as some experts expected. Those experts may have had unrealistic expectations, though, and Bricker and Ibbitson figure that the same logic of urbanization and education that has driven steep birth-rate declines elsewhere will apply in more and more African countries in the coming years.
Below-replacement fertility rates don’t immediately translate into population declines — lengthening lifespans work against that, and if a country has a large enough cohort of young people, even with smaller families their kids will keep driving population higher for a while. The United Nations’ “medium variant” population projection from 2017 assumes that the global fertility rate will drop below replacement by 2070, but that world population will keep growing through the end of the century. Still, past UN projections have consistently overshot (albeit not by a huge amount), and one can’t really fault Bricker and Ibbitson for choosing instead to go with the projections of Austria’s Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital, which depict global population peaking in 2070 in the medium scenario and in 2045 in the “rapid development” scenario, in which urbanization and educational gains in developing countries drive even quicker fertility declines.
As the spread between these projections indicates, long-run population forecasting is quite the uncertain endeavor. “The future of world population growth will largely be decided in Africa,” the creators of the Wittgenstein forecasts write in a recent European Union report, “with the future education of women as a main determinant of fertility playing a key role.”
Still, let’s assume that their lowest population projection is correct, and global population will peak in 2045. That’s still a quarter-century from now, and population wouldn’t return to current levels until the 2090s — more than enough time for us to drive hundreds of thousands of plant and animal species extinct and perhaps boost global average temperatures enough to bring polar-ice-cap-melting chaos. The “rapid development” scenario behind that population forecast also requires that poorer countries, well, develop more rapidly, which in the past has meant rising per-person environmental stress. If India’s population were to stop growing tomorrow but its per-capita carbon emissions kept rising to current U.S. levels (a nearly tenfold increase), that would lead to a 59 percent rise in global carbon emissions, all else being equal. If U.S. per capita emissions were to fall just to German levels, meanwhile, that would cut global emissions by 7 percent.
Clearly, population isn’t the only important variable here. Malthus and Ehrlich focused on it to the exclusion of all else and were blindsided by technological innovation and economic progress. Now it looks as if it will take technological innovation, political innovation, and maybe a different way of thinking about economic progress to keep the human-imposed stresses on the earth’s environment from becoming unbearable.
The possibility that our numbers could stop growing within a few decades admittedly does add a certain light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel aspect to the difficult project of reducing the environmental damage we cause. That light could turn out to be the oncoming train of accelerating population decline — once set in motion, downward trends in fertility rates have proved awfully hard to reverse. But after two-plus centuries of worrying about the opposite, can we maybe wait a few years before freaking out about that?

899,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 12:47PM ET</span>",Gucci owner Kering agrees to 1.25 billion euro Italy tax settlement,"PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - French luxury goods group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) said on Thursday it had agreed to pay 1.25 billion euros ($1.40 billion) to settle a dispute with Italian tax authorities centered on its fashion brand Gucci. 
The settlement, first reported by Reuters last month, is the highest ever agreed by a company with Italian tax authorities.
Kering, which had denied avoiding tax, has a cash pile estimated by analysts at more than 10 billion euros, meaning it was equipped to absorb the cost.
The company said under the settlement it would face an additional tax charge of 600 million euros in its 2019 financial accounts. 
""The settlement will involve the payment of 897 million euros in additional taxes, along with further payment for penalties and interest,"" Kering said, adding that the total came to 1.25 billion euros. 
The allegations centered on Gucci, which Italian tax authorities accused of evading taxes on more than 1 billion euros in revenues over several years. Gucci offices in Milan and Florence were raided by Italian police in late 2017.
Gucci revenues were booked through Kering's Swiss-based subsidiary Luxury Goods International and Italian prosecutors argued that tax should therefore have been paid in Italy, not Switzerland.
Kering said in its statement that it acknowledged prosecutors' claim that Gucci had a ""permanent establishment"" in Italy during the 2011-2017 period under scrutiny.
Gucci is Kering's star brand and drives most of its profits after a flamboyant remake under designer Alessandro Michele.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's first ""simple"" asset-backed security was issued in the first quarter of the year under new rules aimed at reviving a market that turned toxic in the financial crisis a decade ago, banking lobby AFME said on Thursday.
Asset-backed securities based on subprime U.S. home loans turned sour in 2007, leading to a global markets meltdown that forced governments to bail out lenders with the securities on their books.
The market, where home loans are bundled into an interest-bearing security, is still struggling in Europe.
The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) said 32.4 billion euros ($36.4 billion) of securitized products were issued in Europe in the first quarter, down 63 percent from the fourth quarter of 2018, and down 44.6 percent from 58.5 billion euros in the first quarter of 2018.
The European Union has approved a law to encourage issuance of a new breed of more stringently regulated securities, known as STS or simple, transparent and standardized.
The aim is to revive the market and offer companies a capital market alternative to bank loans for funding growth.
AFME said a delay in fleshing out the new EU law contributed to the sharp decline in issuance in recent months.
""However, in March, the European securitization market saw the first transaction aimed to be compliant with the new STS regime, with further STS-compliant transactions currently in the pipeline,"" it added.
In April the first STS-compliant securitization in Britain was issued and, in a further first, it referenced Sonia, the Bank of England's overnight rate which is replacing the tarnished Libor interest rate benchmark.
Securitization in the United States recovered more strongly from the financial crisis, with 292.7 billion euros of issuance in the first quarter of this year, AFME said.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - The chief executive of International Dairy Queen Inc is counting on the 79-year-old brand, owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, to adapt to changing consumer tastes rather than latch onto the latest fad, while ensuring that rising labor and food costs don't squelch its franchisees.
Troy Bader, who became chief executive in January 2018, said his company wants to ensure that devotees keep ordering their Blizzards and chicken strips, without turning off customers seeking newer products or with specific dietary needs.
""About 5 percent of disposable income is spent on away-from-home dining occasions,"" Bader, 54, said in an interview during Berkshire's recent annual shareholder weekend. ""Transactions in the restaurant industry have been flat, so even if wages are going up, what I have for disposable, discretionary spending is not. That's why you're seeing so much competition.""
Berkshire, whose 88-year-old chief executive favors the Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar, paid $590 million for the Bloomington, Minnesota-based company in 1998.
Dairy Queen's more than 7,000 locations, including 2,000 in the United States and Canada, recorded more than $4.5 billion of sales in 2018. Bader said 2019 has been ""good so far"" despite bad U.S. and Canadian weather.
""Bomb cyclones and polar vortexes don't bode well ... when 50 percent of your sales are ice cream,"" he said. Bader named McDonald's Corp and Chick-Fil-A as key rivals.
Labor is the fastest-rising cost for franchisees, especially when rising minimum wages, an issue on which Bader said Dairy Queen has no position, squeeze margins as customers favor such menu items as the $5 Buck Lunch. Also rising is the cost of branded candies that Dairy Queen adds to ice cream.
Bader said adapting to changing consumer habits is not a new idea.
""It's actually evolutionary, it's not revolutionary,"" he said. ""When we look at trends, you have to decide which you're going to lead in, which you're going to follow, and which you may not participate in at all because they may not be right for or important for your brand.""
He said Dairy Queen, despite its name, is exploring desserts for people who avoid dairy, but won't dive into plant-based food, despite the frenzy last week when Beyond Meat Inc went public and its stock price soared.
""If appropriate for our brand, we will move in later,"" he said. ""Right now, the biggest opportunity is in our chicken strips, our burgers and other products.""
Another major initiative is technology, including the creation of a single electronic point-of-sale system.
Bader, a self-described ""recovering lawyer,"" had interviewed with Buffett before the billionaire gave Vice Chairman Greg Abel oversight over Berkshire's non-insurance operating units. He now reports to Abel. 
Buffett ""was asking as many questions as we were. He wanted to know what you knew that he did not,"" Bader recalled.

""What I find interesting with Greg was, he's the same way. I'm not trying to say Greg is Warren. Nobody will ever be Warren. But he is really smart, and he is a really good study.""

Thursday's proposal, which is subject to a 60-day public comment period before it can be adopted, excludes smaller-reporting companies of less than $100 million in annual revenues from an outside auditor review of a firm's internal controls.

Industry advocates are likely to praise the proposal as an incentive to boost the number of smaller companies seeking to raise capital in the public capital markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Reckitt Benckiser is working to resolve both its search for a new chief executive and its position relating to U.S. charges of wrongdoing at a former business, its chairman told investors at its annual general meeting on Thursday.
The maker of Lysol cleaners and Durex condoms is ""well under way with a comprehensive process"" to select a successor to Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, Chairman Christopher Sinclair said at the meeting in London. 
""I'm hopeful that in the not-too-distant future, we'll have something significant to report here,"" Sinclair said. 
This year's meeting was likely to be the last for CEO Kapoor, who plans to retire at the end of 2019, after more than eight years at the helm and more than three decades with the consumer goods company overall.
Kapoor, who sought to transform Reckitt from a British maker of household cleaners into a global consumer health giant, thanked both shareholders and his colleagues.
""Even though I might not have been able to do everything I wanted to do, I want to thank some of my team members who are right here, for supporting me and helping me in doing as much as I possibly could for you and for the company as a whole,"" he said.
Sinclair also sought to clarify Reckitt's position regarding U.S. criminal charges brought against drugmaker Indivior, which Reckitt owned until 2014. Indivior is accused of illegally increasing prescriptions for its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone.
Reckitt has set aside a provision of $400 million in case it is charged.
""We were not named in the U.S. Department of Justice indictment and we've not been accused of any crime. Reckitt Benckiser believes strongly that we've done nothing wrong and we see no evidence of impropriety by any of our group employees,"" Sinclair said. 
""Having said all that ... we are working toward a resolution,"" he added. 
""We think that's the right course in this environment and we'll have something more to say when something material develops.""
The chairman also laid out Reckitt's future priorities, which include reigniting organic growth and completing both the integration of the Mead Johnson baby formula business and the separation of its two business units under one roof, which CEO Kapoor said creates ""the possibility of having structural independence"". 
At the same time, Sinclair said acquisitions remained a priority that the company ""continues to pursue actively"".

BERLIN (Reuters) - Zalando says style advice and a personal shopping service are encouraging customers to spend more on their orders, as the German company makes progress halting a fall which had hit its profitability.
Average order sizes at Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer have fallen in recent years as people shop more often on their smartphones but spend less each time, pushing up Zalando's logistics costs.
Zalando, which last week said it had managed to slow that decline, launched its free Zalon curated shopping service in 2015 and employs 700 stylists who put together outfit suggestions for several hundred thousand customers a year.
Zalon ships an outfit of between five and 12 items, carefully tied with ribbon and packed in a special box. Although this means higher costs, to pay the stylists as well as delivery and other costs, it results in a higher average order value.
""Customers who engage with outfits are twice as likely to buy something and their baskets are bigger,"" Rob Manzano, Zalando head of user research, told journalists on Thursday.
Zalon's average order value is ""much higher"" than at Zalando, because the service is seen as a premium offering so stylists can include higher-end items and fewer discounted goods, Zalon Chief Executive Ivo Scherkamp said.
The service is disproportionately used by customers looking for plus size and maternity clothing, he added.
Zalando started suggesting outfits to all its regular customers in November, using algorithms that scour their shopping history as well as the millions of styles put together by Zalon's fashion experts.

It scans the full Zalando catalog and is enhanced by human expertise so that it knows which particular shade is in fashion.

U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Beijing “broke the deal” and stood firm on plans to raise tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports, while China said escalation was not going to help either side but promised to retaliate.
As top trade officials from both countries meet for two days in Washington little hope of a renewed truce was evident despite calls from China for the U.S. to meet it halfway.
Investors scrambled to take risk off the table amid worries that a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest companies would damage the global economy and corporate profits.
The Dow Jones sank 238 points, or 0.9%, to 25,729.28 points by 9:42 AM ET (13:42 GMT), while the S&P 500 lost 28 points, or 1.0%, 2,851.38 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite traded down 95 points, or 1.2%, 7,848.61 points.
The S&P 500 has undergone four straight sessions of losses and is currently down 3.4% from its all-time high of 2,954.13 points, reached on May 1.
Dow heavyweight Boeing (NYSE:BA) hit a four-month low in early trading while  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which like Boeing is sensitive to Chinese demand and to tariffs, hit its lowest since mid-February.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell by 5.3%, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 4.5% and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) by 3.3%, after China said it intended to extend preferential taxes for some domestic chipmakers. The three companies had stood to gain from improved access to the Chinese market under the mooted agreement.
Not all the corporate news was bad.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) surged nearly 3%, leading advancers on the Dow, after it dropped its bid for Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), avoiding a bidding war with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Chevron will get a $1 billion break fee from Anadarko under the terms of its original offer.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) also saw shares edge forward thanks to a better-than-expected earnings report.
Nearly lost in the headlines, producer prices rose in April, but the annualized reading unexpectedly held steady at 2.2%. Muted inflation has been key to stopping any further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve this year. In other news, weekly jobless claims fell less than expected, but had little market impact.
After the data, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six developed-market currencies, was little changed at 97.35 by 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 2.44%, unchanged from before the news but down 4 basis points from late Wednesday.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Wednesday said a $377 million charge it incurred recently was tied to a solar generation company that U.S. authorities have linked to fraud.
Berkshire said in its first-quarter report on Saturday it had invested $340 million in various tax equity investment funds from 2015 to 2018, before learning that federal authorities had alleged ""fraudulent income conduct"" by the funds' sponsor.
""We now believe that it is more likely than not that the income tax benefits that we recognized are not valid,"" and took the charge for ""uncertain tax positions"" related to its investments, Berkshire said.
Buffett's assistant Debbie Bosanek confirmed that the charge related to DC Solar. Bloomberg News earlier reported its identity.
Berkshire's report had not identified the sponsor by name, and Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has not been accused of wrongdoing.
Lawyers for DC Solar did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
DC Solar, whose products include solar generators as well as light towers that can be used at sports events, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February in Reno, Nevada.
In a Feb. 8 affidavit related to those proceedings, an FBI agent said the manner in which the Benecia, California-based company appeared to have operated reflected ""evidence of a Ponzi-type investment fraud scheme.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused DC Solar's owners by name of engaging in a Ponzi scheme, according to a separate court filing.
Berkshire's charge reduced first-quarter operating profit to $5.56 billion, up 5 percent from a year earlier.
This year's results excluded the impact of Berkshire's 26.7 percent stake in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, which has yet to report audited quarterly results.

Berkshire's $340 million investment is small relative to its $738.7 billion asset base, which includes $191.8 billion of equity investments and $114.2 billion of cash. The company also has its own renewable energy projects.

Banco do Brasil did not immediately comment on the matter. 
Also authorities said 28 search warrants were executed in the states of Goiás, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, Paraná, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro as well as in the federal capital Brasília.

Subsequently, the companies involved returned part of the money to the bank as compensation for participating in the fraud, police said.

At its annual general meeting a day earlier a journalist from Denmark's TV2 alleged that Loomis was implicated because it had cooperated with a foreign exchange bureau, company CEO Patrik Andersson told Reuters. 
Loomis has not been contacted by regulatory authorities and its previous internal checks turned up no evidence to indicate that it had been part of systematic money laundering, he added.
The Danish authorities convicted the owners of several exchange agencies in Copenhagen in 2016 for having helped criminal networks launder million of dollars of suspicious funds by using 500-euro banknotes. Loomis had not previously been linked to the case.
Companies in Scandinavia are under scrutiny for their anti-money laundering policies after Danish lender Danske Bank became embroiled in a scandal over suspicious transactions channeled via its branch in Estonia. 
Shares in Loomis, which was trading ex dividend on Thursday, were down 8.7 percent at 315 Swedish crowns at 1240 GMT. The dividend payment was 10 Swedish crowns.
Andersson said the journalist did not provide any documentation or proof to support but added that Loomis had begun work to hire an external agency to carry out an independent inquiry and would update the market in due course.
""From what I know, there is nothing,"" Andersson said in response to a question about where any checks had indicated that Loomis had participated in systematic money laundering. 
""But... we take these allegations very serious... What we've done is immediately started to look into the matter.""

920,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 08:46AM ET</span>",Shares sink as U.S.-China trade talks go to the wire,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares tumbled for a fourth day running on Thursday after a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that a long-worked-on trade deal with China was in serious danger.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was heading to Washington for two days of talks, but Trump's insistence that China ""broke the deal"" and Beijing's response that it would retaliate against a planned U.S. tariff increase raised the stakes.
Europe's main stock markets and Wall Street futures sank 0.5 to 1.3 percent (EU) after a torrid day for Asia saw more than 1.8 percent taken off China and more than 3 percent off South Korea, seen as the bellwether for the trade war.
Both countries' currencies were hit too, the won skidding to a more than two-year low and the yuan to a four-month trough, all of which sent the traditionally safe Japanese yen and U.S. and German bond prices higher. [/FRX]
""Markets remain on edge ahead of the Chinese vice premier’s visit to Washington,"" Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen said. 
""Doubt that this tariff increase can be avoided is growing,"" he added, as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also raised its chances of a hike to 60 percent.
If talks do falter, Washington has said it will lift tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT) on Friday.
Economists worry that would further slow the global economy and Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at RIETI, a Japanese government-affiliated think-tank, said the outlook for the trade talks now looked fragile. 
""I would suspect the U.S. will just hand China an ultimatum,"" he said. ""No wonder the U.S. yield curve is almost inverting again.""
The closely-watched curve - measuring the difference between the yields on different-length bonds - turned negative in late March, spooking investors who read the development as portending a recession.
The yield gap between three-month U.S. government bonds, at 2.42 percent, and benchmark 10-year notes was just 3 basis points, compared with about 15 basis points a few weeks ago.

Wall Street was expected to start 0.7-0.8 percent lower after a choppy day on Wednesday saw the Dow Jones nudge fractionally higher but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq drop 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent respectively. (N)
As well as the trade headlines, traders will be closely watching the pricing on ride-hailing firm Uber's initial public offering which is set to be the biggest of the year so far and value it at up to $90 billion.
""In the event of a complete breakdown in (trade) talks and higher tariffs, we would expect this to see U.S. stocks trade 10–15 percent below their highs and a fall of around 15–20 percent in the Chinese market,"" Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at Global Wealth Management at UBS, said. 
In the currency market, the Japanese yen surged to a three-month high of 109.58 yen to the dollar before steadying, while China's yuan fell half a percent to hit a four-month low of 6.838 and notch its biggest four-day drop in a year.
Turkey's lira was taking blows again too, hitting an eight-month low as traders remained concerned about a decision to re-run Istanbul's mayoral election.
To squeeze supply and steady the currency, the country's central bank called off a funding auction on Thursday. It took similar action in March when the lira plunged before local elections, but that also created worries about trading it.
""These are all stop-gap measures, when the fundamental concern is that there is zero faith in Turkey's macro policy management at the moment,"" said BlueBay Asset Managment's Timothy Ash.
Sterling, meanwhile, was trying to brush off concerns that Brexit talks between Britain's government and the main opposition party may soon collapse to claw back above $1.30.
Commodity markets also felt the U.S.-China trade strains.

922,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 09, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Anadarko Is Said to Seek Chevron Bid at Least Matching Rival,"(Bloomberg) -- Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). is looking for a revised takeover offer from  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) that matches or exceeds the $38 billion proposal from Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY)., according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.
The board on Monday deemed the Occidental takeover bid “superior” to a $33 billion proposal it accepted last month. That gives Chevron until May 10 to increase its bid, seek an extension or walk away from the industry’s biggest deal in at least four years. The company has yet to say what action it will take and a spokesman didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday. Anadarko declined to comment.
“It would be foolish for Chevron to assume they could come underneath the Occidental bid,” said Bill Nygren, chief investment officer of Harris Associates LP, which manages $120 billion and owns about 3% of Anadarko. “We would fully expect the Anadarko board to accept the highest offer, and if that wasn’t the outcome, we would be very vocal in our dissent.”
Anadarko’s board accepted the original Chevron bid even though it had the higher offer from Occidental on the table. The Woodlands, Texas-based company was concerned about Occidental’s ability to get shareholder approval for its offer and about the amount of cash versus stock. Occidental on May 5 issued a revised proposal that boosted the cash portion and removed the need for a shareholder vote.
Analysts have said there is room for Chevron to increase its bid. The company probably needs to raise it from $65 to $70 or $72 a share to stay in the running, but doesn’t need to surpass Occidental’s bid because its stock is a more valuable currency, Lysle Brinker, executive director of companies and transaction research at IHS Markit, said on Tuesday.
Anadarko would be the largest deal of Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth’s 15-month tenure and be the biggest transaction in the oil industry in four years. A new offer from Chevron would also make the tussle for Anadarko one of the most contested takeovers in years for the U.S. oil patch, where bidding wars are unusual.
The Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico is key to Anadarko’s appeal. Chevron and Occidental both see acquiring the driller as a way to bulk up their positions in the region, where production has more than doubled since 2015.
Shares of Anadarko were untraded in the pre-market as of 7:34 a.m. in New York. Occidental dropped 0.7 percent to $59.80 and Chevron was little changed at $117.34."

That’s the view of Oxford Economics, which found that the top risk is the trade dispute damping growth. The slowdown in China and a U.S. recession ranked second and third in the Global Risk Survey.
Since the poll of 189 businesses was conducted before the latest round of duties on Chinese goods threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump, the figures may actually understate the risk companies see.
Bloomberg’s own economists calculate that a 25 percent tariff on all imports from China would shave 1.5 percentage points off U.S. growth -- a cut that would halve the rate seen in the first quarter. Trump’s backers argue the sacrifice is worth it in the context of what they see as an existential innovation war with an increasingly muscular China.

Owned by a prominent Swedish family, Bonnier's brands include Sweden's biggest commercial broadcaster, TV4, and streaming service C More and Finnish MTV. It competes with state broadcaster SVT.
Telia offered concessions to the European Commission last month but these were not sufficient to allay regulatory worries, the sources said.
The EU competition enforcer and Telia declined to comment.
The Commission is set to announce the opening of its in-depth investigation on Friday, the sources added, giving it 90 working days to examine the deal.
The deal is politically sensitive for Sweden since the government owns 37 percent of Telia.

927,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 07:26AM ET</span>",China to bid on D.C. Metro rail deal as national security hawks circle,"By Alexandra Alper and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - China's CRRC plans to bid on a big Washington D.C. subway project as it doubles down on a charm campaign in the United States to quash a rising chorus of critics who have cast the rail car maker as a threat to cyber security and U.S. industry.
The world's largest maker of passenger trains has roared into the U.S. market in recent years, clinching contracts in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles by underbidding rivals - including Canada's Bombardier - by hundreds of millions of dollars. 
It plans to bid this month on the D.C. Metro rail car contract, worth more than $500 million, Dave Smolensky, a spokesman for the company's Chicago-based CRRC Sifang subsidiary told Reuters. And it has also set its sights on winning an order to supply 1,500 cars as part of New York City's massive subway system upgrade, according to an industry source familiar with the matter. 
    While there are no U.S. passenger-car builders, CRRC's success has fueled a backlash by American freight companies, which fear the company will encroach on the country's far bigger freight car market. Raising questions about whether China could spy on passengers if CRRC gets the D.C. project, the freight lobby helped U.S. lawmakers craft a bill that would prevent transit agencies from spending federal dollars on projects awarded to the firm.
While some experts have described the purported cyber threat as fear mongering, CRRC is taking steps to counter those concerns, telling Reuters it plans to hire a new lobbyist, engage a cyber security adviser and host an industry summit to explore tougher cyber regulations and take a critical look at its own protocols.
The upcoming bid and charm offensive show how some China-based companies have not been deterred in their quest to grow U.S. market share, despite an ongoing trade war between the two countries and growing concerns about Chinese technology's spying capabilities. 
""We want to take this time to say, ""Hey, we are willing to sit around the table with you, we want to demonstrate...there are no vulnerabilities in what we provide you,"" said Lydia Rivera, a spokeswoman for CRRC's Massachusetts unit. 
    The U.S. Department of Justice has been aggressively pursuing cases of Chinese espionage, elevating the issue to front page news and creating a fresh rationale to oppose CRRC's bid for Washington D.C.'s 8000-series car tender in the military and intelligence hub of the United States.
A STRAW MAN? 
    The Rail Security Alliance, a freight lobbying group made up of manufacturers, suppliers, and steel workers, formed three and a half years ago to oppose CRRC's rapid expansion in the U.S. passenger rail market. 
When trains become driverless in the near future, ""you are going to have...the ability to control it from here or Beijing or wherever,"" said RSA lobbyist Erik Olson. 
    If CRRC won the contract, he added, it could also track the movements of members of Congress and intelligence officials, and steal user data if WIFI is installed. 
    Some transport industry and cyber security experts reject many of Olson's concerns. Robert Puentes, president of the Eno Center for Transportation, said strong transit agency oversight means it would be very hard for ""even the most sophisticated espionage"" to work for CRRC, adding that it was unclear why the company would seek to spy on passengers. 
    ""It is kind of a straw man,"" he said.  
As long as the cars do not communicate with the manufacturer, there would be no risk of remote control, beyond the normal hacking risk that comes with offering Wifi, said James Lewis, Director of the Technology Policy Program at think tank CSIS.
""If you are going to spy on somebody would you really use a metro car?"" he asked.
""The Chinese government is not trustworthy and that is part of why we are going through all this,"" he added, noting that CRRC used predatory pricing to hurt its rivals, which ""is different from cybersecurity."" 
Bombardier, which benefits from a joint-venture with CRRC in China, has lost out to the Chinese giant in Chicago, but recently beat the company for a separate order in New Jersey.
""We welcome the competition, but we’re not going to lie down and let anyone take our market,"" Bombardier Transportation President Danny Di Perna told Reuters last week. 
Facing public fears of their trains being hacked, Washington's metro agency WMATA updated its tender in February to beef up cyber security requirements. 
Meanwhile, CRRC says it uses non-Chinese suppliers, including  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), Siemens and Ansaldo STS for sensitive technology such as the Automatic Train Control Systems safety feature for U.S. models.
    Still, CRRC may pose a bigger economic risk if it does make a foray into the U.S. freight market. Australia saw its domestic freight industry obliterated a decade after CRRC arrived.
RSA's influence may be growing. A measure last year to keep cities from allocating federal funds for rail projects led by Chinese companies failed. But Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, where freight company and RSA-member Trinity Industries is based, has proposed a similar bill again this year.
Last month, Atlanta transit agency MARTA passed over CRRC to award a 127 car project to Switzerland’s Stadler, after RSA visited them twice. 
The bill's passage is far from guaranteed in a deeply divided Congress, where some legislators support CRRC for its affordable trains and local factories with American workers. 

    ""Even though there are these alarms that folks have set off about national and economic security, there is a flip side to it,"" said Puentes. ""It is a major cost saver and a good value for these procurements for these cities around the country.""

928,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 07:25AM ET</span>",German auto suppliers downbeat as trade dispute simmers,"By Caroline Copley and Jan Schwartz
BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) - German automotive suppliers Continental and Bosch do not expect a speedy recovery of the global auto market, as an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China threatens to compound already weak car demand.
Automakers and their suppliers are grappling with a downturn in vehicle demand, particularly in China, the world's largest car market, which saw sales slow down for the ninth month in a row in April.
Continental said on Thursday it was not expecting a market upturn until the second half of this year as it reported a 22 percent slump in first-quarter net profit, while Bosch said it expected sales to stagnate this year.
The outlook could darken further after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up the stakes ahead of a visit by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to Washington for two days of trade talks, saying China ""broke the deal"" and vowing not to back down on imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports.
Continental Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer told Reuters that production in China remained volatile after falling 13 percent in the first quarter. After a slightly stronger March, April was weaker again, he added.
He said it was hard to make predictions due to the uncertainty surrounding U.S-China trade talks, but he expected only a ""sideways development"" in the second quarter.
Privately-owned Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier, said sales were nearly level with the previous year in the first three months of this year.
Chief Financial Officer Stefan Asenkerschbaumer said he expected sales to only be ""slightly better"" than last year in 2019 as Bosch grapples with a downturn in the global economy and headwinds from trade conflicts and Brexit.
Bosch forecast car production would fall by 3 percent this year to just under 95 million vehicles. ""This will be the first time that production figures have contracted in two successive years since the financial crisis,"" Asenkerschbaumer said.
It expects another sharp decline in China and much slower growth in India, as well as a considerable decline in automotive production in Germany. It forecast slightly weaker production for North America.

Shares in Continental were down 3.7 percent at 1042 GMT, the second-worst performance on Germany's blue-chip index.

MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. packaged food giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) has launched the sale of its baby food brand Plasmon with preliminary bids due by the end of next week, two sources close to the matter said.
Private equity firms and food groups are looking at the business, both sources said, adding it could be worth about 700 million euros ($783 million).
Another source said PAI Partners was among investors expected to present a preliminary bid, adding that rival private equity firm Cinven could also be interested. 
Plasmon is mainly based in Italy and Kraft intends to sell it to focus on its global brands, one of the sources said.
According to Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Kraft Heinz has hired U.S. bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to advise on the sale.
Kraft Heinz, PAI Partners, Cinven and JPMorgan declined to comment.
Plasmon, founded in 1902, sells a range of baby foods including first milk, pasta and fruit compote. It is best known for its baby biscuits made with powdered milk, vitamins and minerals.

Its annual revenue is more 200 million euros and core earnings are around 50 million euros.

TOKYO/ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis is buying dry-eye drug Xiidra from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co for up to $5.3 billion as the Swiss drugmaker refreshes its ophthalmic medicines portfolio with a potential blockbuster.
The deal, announced early on Thursday, calls for $3.4 billion up front and milestone payments up to $1.9 billion, Novartis said.
The acquisition from Takeda, which is jettisoning the medicine to reduce debt, adds to several big Novartis transactions over the last year as the Basel-based company both beefs up its portfolio and sheds non-core assets to focus on prescription drugs.
It is also the latest Japanese-European deal in the pharmaceutical sector following British drugmaker Astrazeneca's $6.9 billion agreement in January to work with Daiichi Sankyo on an experimental breast cancer drug. 
Expected to close after July, the transaction includes 400 Takeda employees, which analysts from Bank Vontobel in Zurich said gives Novartis a marketing team to sell not only Xiidra but another prospective eye drug entrant, RTH258 for macular degeneration, now awaiting regulatory approval.
""Despite generic competition...we think that Xiidra is sufficiently differentiated,"" Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said. ""The market (is) big enough for it to reach blockbuster status, justifying the price.""
Xiidra, with $400 million in 2018 sales and approval in markets including the United States, Canada and Australia, competes with Allergan's older Restasis. 
Generics maker Teva has a generic version of Restasis in Canada and is planning a launch in the United States, as is Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL), pending resolution of legal disputes.
Xiidra has yet to get European regulatory approval. 
""Following closing, we will explore the opportunity for the other territories acquired,"" a Novartis spokesman told Reuters.
BLOCKBUSTER BOUND?
For Takeda, this is its first divestment since its leveraged takeover of Shire in January, part of a flurry of multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical deals as drugmakers seek to buy other companies to combat expiring patents on their blockbuster medicines and renew their drug pipelines. 
Japan's biggest drugmaker aims to dispose of $10 billion worth of assets to cut debt, and also said it is selling TachoSil, a surgical patch for bleeding control, to Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon for $400 million.
""We are working to strategically simplify and optimize our portfolio, while also rapidly deleveraging,"" Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said in a statement.
For roughly 34 million U.S. dry eye sufferers, tears fail to adequately lubricate their eyes, and the condition can become painful, potentially leading to eye damage, Novartis said.
Xiidra, which treats signs and symptoms of dry eye by controlling inflammation, won U.S. regulatory approval in 2016 under Shire's watch and was considered then its most important new medicine.
""We look forward to leveraging our well-established commercial infrastructure to bring this medicine to more patients,"" said Paul Hudson, who heads Novartis's drugs business, adding the company sees Xiidra ""well positioned for blockbuster potential"" topping $1 billion annual sales.
Novartis just shed its eyecare division Alcon into a separate publicly listed company in a $30 billion shareholder spin-off, but only after moving Alcon's prescription eye drugs into Novartis's main pharmaceuticals business.

Novartis shares were down 0.7 percent at 0812 GMT. Takeda shares closed up 0.2 percent in Tokyo.

931,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 07:17AM ET</span>",U.S. campaign against Huawei hits a snag south of the border,"By Julia Love
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - After a long push in Mexico, China's Huawei landed a coveted job in 2017: supplying equipment for the country's so-called ""red compartida,"" an ambitious telecommunications network built for carriers delivering the latest generation of technology.
The contract came with a catch.
Altan Redes, the company developing the network, announced that the most delicate work – involving the system's ""core"" and sites near the U.S. border – would go to Nokia (HE:NOKIA), and awarded Huawei southern and central Mexico. Political sensitivities around Huawei, which the United States has denounced since 2012 as an untrustworthy agent of the Chinese government, factored into the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
But limiting Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's role was easier said than done. While sites along the U.S. border remain with Nokia, Huawei has since gained work in three cities in northern Mexican regions that Altan had said publicly would go to Nokia, according to four other people with knowledge of the matter and messages viewed by Reuters. Huawei began working in the cities late last year, one of the people said.
The three cities - Tampico, Torreon and Culiacan – are located in northern Mexico but are not close the border. Altan's plans for the network are fluid and could change, the sources noted. 
Altan said in a statement that its decision to divide the work between Nokia and Huawei in that way was made ""exclusively on technical and economic optimization criteria,"" adding that it was not informed of U.S. concerns about Huawei. The company said no cities awarded to vendors were reassigned, and Huawei and Nokia ""equally delivered their plans.""
A U.S. State Department official said the department remains concerned that Chinese equipment in 5G networks could give the Chinese government access to sensitive data. A Huawei spokesman described the U.S. campaign as an effort to ""attack and contain Huawei, without presenting any concrete evidence.""
Huawei's northward expansion in Altan's network, previously unreported, underscores the Chinese firm's combination of speed, manpower and technological sophistication, Mexican telecom executives say. 
""It's too late"" to reverse Huawei's strong presence in Mexico, said Marco Galvan, a senior director for trade group GSMA.
Huawei's potent appeal also shows how telecom operators globally are trying to balance the need for the Chinese company's affordable and reliable equipment with the U.S. campaign to steer countries away from using its gear, Mexican telecom executives say.
After acquiring two local wireless companies, AT&T (NYSE:T) removed Huawei equipment from sensitive parts of its Mexican network. But AT&T still uses the Chinese firm’s gear in the country, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That is due in part to Huawei’s deep bench and swift execution, the people said. 
“When we upgraded our Mexico network to 4G LTE, we replaced Huawei in our data core network because we wanted a data core network design like we have in the United States,” AT&T Mexico said in a statement.
The approaches taken by Altan and AT&T, detailed in interviews with two dozen people familiar with Huawei's operations, point to new ground rules for working with the Chinese company in Mexico: Limit use of Huawei gear in ""the core"" - the brains of the cellular network that processes data from towers - and tread carefully along the border. 
But some telecom experts say it is harder to wall off the core in the coming fifth generation, or 5G, networks.
In its statement, Altan said the nearest Huawei cell site equipment is 1,549 km from the border town of Tijuana and 499 km from Matamoros, which neighbors Texas.
""The equipment disperses a signal with a radius of 15 kilometers, so there is not even remotely close contact with the northern border,"" Altan said. 
Three people familiar with the decision said Altan gave the northern cities to Huawei following some problems with Nokia's performance, including delays submitting documentation and slow response times. 
Dimitri Diliani, Nokia's global head of end-to-end solutions, said in an interview that the company met all key objectives and its share of the Altan project has not changed.
""You always have hiccups and delays,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we passed all of the hurdles."" 
Specific cities were not assigned in the contract, Diliani said. It is not unusual for some cities to shift within large projects, a Nokia spokeswoman added.
Cesar Funes, a Huawei vice president, said Mexican customers have asked the company for its response to the U.S. allegations, but business remains strong. He said he was not aware of whether Huawei had won work in the three cities but noted the company has managed to extend its reach in past projects.
Vendors typically start with a certain share of a project, ""but based on your performance, you could get more,"" he said in an interview. ""I have experienced that already in this country.""
The U.S. government has intensified its fight against Huawei as countries prepare to deploy 5G networks, which will serve as the gateway to new technological frontiers such as self-driving cars and internet-connected appliances. Altan’s wholesale network, which offers capacity to retail telecom competitors in Mexico, is prepared to quickly transition to 5G, the company has said.
TENSION AT THE BORDER
As early as the 1990s, Huawei executives began pitching their services in Mexico. Competing aggressively on price and recruiting talent, Huawei eventually won big swaths of the market, supplying virtually all major players, including Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's America Movil.
The wholesale network, part of a 2013-14 telecom reform aimed at promoting competition, was an enticing opportunity for Huawei to build a cutting-edge network from scratch, Funes said.
Backed by a fund managed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Infrastructure and IFC Asset Management Company’s China-Mexico Fund, Altan won a tender to launch the network in 2016. 
The prospect of Chinese participation in a sophisticated national telecom network attracted U.S. scrutiny early on. The U.S. State Department met with Mexico's ministry for communications and transportation twice in 2016 to voice concerns about Huawei's potential involvement in the project, according to a former senior U.S. State Department official. 
The State Department did not ask Mexico to ban Huawei, but it did warn Mexican officials of security risks posed by the Chinese firm, the former official said.
Some Mexican officials questioned why the United States was so concerned since AT&T was working with Huawei in the country, the former official recalled.
Salma Jalife, Mexico's undersecretary for communications and technological development, declined to comment.
The State Department also met with Mexico's Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), which regulates the industry, in late 2016 to discuss concerns regarding Huawei's potential participation in the network, especially along the border, according to a Mexican official.
A U.S. State Department official said the government works closely with Mexico and declined to comment on specific meetings.
An IFT spokeswoman declined to comment. The Huawei spokesman stressed the company's independence from the Chinese government.
Altan ultimately struck its compromise, tapping both Huawei and Nokia.
""The balance of the allocation of infrastructure between the technological providers is optimal, avoiding an exclusive dependence on either one,"" Altan said in a statement.
Most carriers in Mexico are still sold on Huawei, said Galvan of GSMA.

""(Huawei) brought as many resources as necessary to Mexico from China,"" he said. ""They did what it takes.""

China’s Commerce Ministry said overnight it would take 'necessary retaliatory measures' if U.S. tariffs are raised – a step that now seems near-certain since the publication of the measures in the Federal Register on Wednesday.
Dow futures were down 168 points or 0.6% by 6:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 19 points or 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 61 points or 0.8%.
The escalating trade conflict has sent shudders through global markets all week, with traders now revising earlier optimistic assumptions that President Donald Trump’s messages over Twitter at the weekend were more PR than substance.
“With Trump's unpredictable, petulant and often bizarre reaction function, nothing can be ruled out,” said ADM ISI strategist Marc Ostwald in a note to clients.
Ostwald pointed out that China’s announcement that it would extend ""preferential taxes for integrated circuit and software companies"" made it harder to reach a deal this week, given that ending subsidies has been one of the U.S.’s key demands. U.S. chipmakers Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU), which would suffer from such subsidies to local rivals, were both down in premarket trade.
Elsewhere, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) was indicated down 0.5%, slightly ahead of the broader market, after posting strong first-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday. The numbers beat expectations slightly.
Meanwhile smart TV maker  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) was indicated up 9.4% after its first-quarter revenue and profit raced past expectations, reflecting the increasing pace of streaming adoption by consumers.

MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. fund manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has pulled out of a proposed rescue of Italian bank Carige, a move that could push Rome's fragile government into another costly state bailout.
BlackRock's decision, which highlights investor concerns about Italy's uncertain political environment, was confirmed by the fund manager and Carige following a report on the move in La Repubblica newspaper. They did not give a reason.
A source familiar with the matter said political infighting and speculation that the government could collapse were among factors that persuaded the fund to back out.
BlackRock also wanted to keep its Carige stake below 25 percent but that had become impossible, the source added.
Under the plan, based on a 720 million euro ($806 million) capital injection, Italian banks were set to take up some of Carige's shares by converting a bond into equity. But without more investors, BlackRock's stake would have exceeded the 25 percent limit.
The rescue aimed to help the state avoid its fourth major bank bailout in two years. The government has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares if it cannot find investors.
Carige, which has been put under special administration by the European Central Bank, said it was looking at other market solutions to its capital shortfall after BlackRock's move but said it could also seek government financial aid.
""We will evaluate other market solutions aimed at ensuring the stability and turnaround of Banca Carige,"" the lender said in a statement, adding it could still make a ""request for a precautionary recapitalization to the economy ministry.""
The ECB has set a mid-May deadline for investors to submit binding bids for Carige, sources have said.
The ECB said on Thursday it had been informed of developments at Carige and was in contact with its temporary administrators. 
Carige has been laid low by years of mismanagement and an excessive exposure to the depressed economy of the northwestern Liguria region.
Italian bond yields have risen in recent days on concerns over tension within Rome's ruling coalition, with the gap between its benchmark bond yields and safer German Bunds increasing on Wednesday to the widest in more than two months. 
In another sign of jitters about political risk and a weak economy, Italy's biggest bank by assets UniCredit said this week it would reduce government bond holdings. 
But Unicredit (MI:CRDI) Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said on Thursday the bank remained strongly committed to the euro zone's third largest economy.

936,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>","SoftBank Group unveils stock split, rakes in $3.8 billion gain on Uber stake","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp announced a stock split while keeping the per-share dividend unchanged for the year, effectively doubling its shareholder payout, as it also reported a $3.8 billion valuation gain on its stake in Uber. 
The news comes at a time when SoftBank and its almost $100 billion Vision Fund stand at a possible inflection point with some of its big tech bets like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) headed toward public listings, in what investors and industry experts see as a test of SoftBank's investment strategy.
The group is also considering listing the Saudi-backed Vision Fund, which has invested roughly $80 billion in around 80 tech firms, a source told Reuters last week.
A second Vision Fund will be announced soon, SoftBank Group founder and CEO Masayoshi Son said at a news conference on Thursday, adding it would be similar in size to the first fund with SoftBank likely to be the only investor initially. 
The value of Vision Fund's investments in 69 companies had risen to $72.3 billion by end-March, from their $60.1 billion acquisition cost, driven by gains at companies like Uber and Indian hotels startup OYO, SoftBank said on Thursday.
The fund's stake in Uber, which is set to make its market debut on Friday, grew 418 billion yen ($3.8 billion) in value, while its share in OYO added 154 billion yen in value.
Overall, the fair value rose for 29 firms and fell for 12 over the period, SoftBank said, with the rest unchanged. 
The value of its stake in Guardant Health, a Vision Fund portfolio company listed last year, grew 203 billion yen. 
Aided by the soaring valuations of its tech investments, the Japanese conglomerate's operating profit for the year ended March jumped 80.5 percent to 2.4 trillion yen ($22 billion). 
That was above a 2.1 trillion yen SmartEstimate that gives a greater weighting to top-rated analysts, Refinitiv data shows.
SHAREHOLDER PAYOUT
The tech and telecoms group said its common stock will be split at a two-for-one ratio on June 27, while its dividend will remain unchanged at 44 yen per share. 
""We are finally in a phase where we can meet shareholders' expectations,"" Son said.
SoftBank's transition away from telecoms towards tech investments accelerated with the 2.35 trillion yen listing of a third of its domestic telco SoftBank Corp in December in what is Japan's largest-ever initial public offering.
That provided the funds for a share buyback that has helped drive up SoftBank Group's stock by nearly 60 percent this year. The shares closed up 0.7 percent ahead of the earnings. 
On Wednesday, the group said it would sell down its share in Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan as SoftBank Corp hiked its stake in the internet firm to 45 percent. 
The deal will function as a transfer of funds from the telco to its parent. Part of the proceeds will be used to fund the second Vision Fund, Son said on Thursday.
The market welcomed the news, with SoftBank Corp's shares up 7 percent on Thursday and Yahoo Japan's shares up 9.4 percent. 
SoftBank Group did not provide a forecast for the current financial year, citing uncertain business factors.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp forecast on Thursday a 19 percent fall in operating profit this year as it reins in aggressive growth amid slowing global car demand and charts a new course after the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn. 
Japan's sixth-largest automaker, in which Nissan Motor Co holds a controlling stake, expects profit to fall to 90.0 billion yen ($821.02 million) in the year to March, after a 14 percent rise to 111.8 billion yen in the year just ended.
Mitsubishi said the need to invest heavily to develop and market new, on-demand transportation services and lower-emissions vehicles to comply with tighter regulations would put pressure on the automaker's growth prospects in the coming years. 
It expects global sales to rise 4.9 percent to 1.31 million vehicles in the current year, slowing from the 13 percent growth seen in the year ended March as it sees sales growth slowing in Southeast Asia, a key market which has more than doubled in the past decade. 
Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko said that the automaker would accept slower sales growth by easing the pace of expansion in ASEAN countries and growth markets of China and the United States in the coming years to ensure sustained profitability. 
""We need to drastically revise our strategy even if we experience a temporary stall in performance,"" Masuko told reporters at a briefing.
""It's not realistic to adopt a strategy based only on expansion. We need to prioritize healthy growth.""
Masuko said that he would resist relying on discounting and fleet sales to grow overall sales, a strategy which has stung partner Nissan in the United States. 
Mitsubishi is contending with slowing demand for cars, ongoing global trade frictions and the need to develop new technologies just as it and its partners Nissan and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) grapple with the fallout from the arrest of Ghosn, the group's former chairman who is facing charges of financial misconduct in Japan.
Ghosn has been accused of enriching himself at a cost of $5 million to Nissan. Since his initial arrest in November, he has also been charged with temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books and understating his salary during his time at the helm of Japan's No. 2 automaker.
He has denied all charges against him.
Masuko said he was unaware of plans by Renault to propose the creation of a joint holding company that would give the French automaker and Nissan equal footing, as media had reported late last month.

    He added that the three companies had not discussed management integration, an idea which Nissan has long opposed.

These bring the number of so-called virtual banking licenses issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority this year to eight. 
The introduction of online-only banking has the potential to be the biggest shake-up in years in the city's retail banking sector dominated by old-guard lenders such as HSBC,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and a slew of Chinese banks. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said the newly licensed banks plan to launch their services in six to nine months. 
The regulator said it would closely monitor the operations of the virtual banks, including customer reactions and the impact of these services on the banking sector in general.
""Eight new ambitious and well-capitalized ""challenger"" banks coming to market in or around the same time have the potential to inflict considerable damage on incumbent players - as well as on each other,"" said James Lloyd, EY's fintech leader for Asia Pacific. ""Expect fireworks,"" he added. 
The latest four companies to receive a license are Ant SME Services (Hong Kong) Limited, Infinium Limited, Insight Fintech HK Limited and Ping An OneConnect Company Limited. 
Infinium Limited is a JV between Tencent, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) - a unit of Chinese banking giant ICBC, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing - the operator of the Hong Kong stock exchange, private equity firm Hillhouse Capital, and Adrian Cheng, executive vice chairman of New World Development and executive director of Chow Tai Fook. 
""Opening up critical banking services to retail consumers and SMEs will fundamentally change the way that businesses in Hong Kong operate,"" Jie Liu, partner at Hillhouse Capital, said in a statement.
Insight Fintech is a JV between Xiaomi, which holds 90 percent, and independent investment bank AMTD Group. 
""Our virtual bank will enable every user to enjoy the pleasure of using fintech,"" said Hong Feng, Xiaomi's co-founder and senior vice president in a statement.

940,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 06:20AM ET</span>",Britain to consider airline seat levy to cover costs of failures,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Airlines operating in Britain should pay a seat levy to cover the costs of getting passengers home in case a carrier goes bust, a government commissioned review said on Thursday.
The recommendations seek to even out anomalies in protection for British travelers, highlighted when Monarch collapsed in 2017, but airlines rejected the review's proposed ""airline seat levy"" which it said would cost less than 50 pence per passenger.
""Although airline insolvencies are relatively rare... they do happen – and at times have required government to step in to repatriate passengers at great cost to the taxpayer,"" Peter Bucks, who chaired the review, said in a statement.
British transport minister Chris Grayling said he would consider the proposals by the Airline Insolvency Review, which was set up by finance minister Philip Hammond after the government and the Civil Aviation Authority had to step in to help repatriate Monarch customers.
British holidaymakers who are booked onto a package holiday have what is called Air Travel Organiser's License (ATOL) protection, ensuring they can return home and do not lose money.
Monarch, which had both ATOL-protected and flight-only customers, highlighted the discrepancy in British law.
The CAA did not assist in repatriating customers of airlines such as Flybmi when it went bust earlier this year.
Instead, airline passengers often have to rely on their banks, payment card issuers or insurers for refunds, with other airlines often cutting fares in offers to stranded passengers.
The review also suggests that airlines should provide a security to be called on in the event of its insolvency.
But Airlines UK, which represents Britain's carriers, said that any tax would make travel more expensive.
""50p may not sound much but airlines operate on wafer thin margins,"" Tim Alderslade, its chief executive, said, adding that voluntary rescue fares worked well.

""The chances of booking with an airline that goes bust remain extremely small,"" Alderslade added.

942,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",Australia TPG's fate tied to courts after watchdog scuppers $10 billion phone deal,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian internet firm TPG Telecom Ltd's best bet to recover from the serious blow dealt by regulators who blocked its $10 billion merger bid with a rival lies with the courts, with analysts doubting any alternative plans can succeed.
The nation's anti-trust regulator blocked the A$15 billion ($10 billion) merger of TPG and a local venture of Britain's  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc on Wednesday citing competition concerns, sending TPG's shares tumbling as investors worried about its future growth.
TPG and the Vodafone venture said they will challenge the decision of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in federal court and gave themselves time until end-August next year to complete the deal.
Analysts and investors, including TPG's second-largest shareholder, said a court victory was more likely to resuscitate the company's fortunes than if it were to tap alternatives like reviving plans for its own A$1.4 billion mobile phone network that it scrapped in January.
Robert Millner, chairman of investment company Washington H Soul Pattinson and Co Ltd which owns a quarter of TPG, said the company was counting on a court victory and had no plans to revisit building a mobile network.
""We just don't have the financial capabilities to do that. We are stretched to the limit in our borrowings,"" he said in a telephone interview on Thursday.
Though the ACCC first raised antitrust concerns about the mega-deal in December, investors and analysts were surprised when the regulator blocked it on grounds that it may impede competition in the future.
Since TPG is a fiber internet company and Vodafone mainly sells mobile phone services, investors believed the companies had shown they were sufficiently different to be allowed to merge.
Their confidence appeared to be boosted in January when TPG scrapped plans for its own mobile phone network, citing an Australian government ban on the controversial Chinese parts supplier it had contracted, Huawei.
The ACCC ruling noted TPG's exit from the mobile phone market but said the company had ""the capability and commercial incentive to resolve the technical and commercial challenges it is facing"".
Competition lawyers and analysts said the companies might succeed in court.
""TPG doesn't currently compete, and the ACCC's theory that absent the merger they would be likely to enter and compete aggressively, that is a difficult hurdle,"" said Elizabeth Avery, a partner at law firm Gilbert & Tobin's antitrust group who is not involved in the case.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said the companies' prospects ""will likely be better in the Federal Court ... however any favorable outcome for TPG remains uncertain, with potential for the court process to drag on over the next 12 months"".
ACCC Commissioner Rod Sims told the Australian Broadcasting Corp the government body ""always understood the prospect of court action ... and we believe we've got a very strong case to put"".
PLAN B
Options that TPG has include resuming the rollout of the network at a higher cost, pursuing a joint venture with Vodafone rather than joining the companies, or selling A$1.1 billion of mobile spectrum it previously bought to a competitor, possibly Vodafone.
""TPG could also shift its focus to Singapore and to try and become a significant player in the SG mobile market (where) it could be more competitive,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts wrote in a note.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested TPG could re-visit plans to build a mobile phone network with another parts supplier and go after the customers of the No. 1 and No. 2 players, Telstra Corp Ltd and Singapore Telecommunication's Optus.
Rival parts suppliers Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), which analysts have said are more expensive than Huawei, declined to comment.
""The court's decision will likely determine TPM's fate as a business as we don't see many other favourable options for the company if the court rules in ACCC's favour,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note.

Shares of TPG closed flat on Thursday, after falling to a five-month low the previous day and losing 13.5 percent, a sign investors remained uncertain about the outcome.

943,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",The answer to Uber's profit challenge? It may lie in its trove of data,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Over the past two years, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has used his peace-making and political skills to settle battles with lawmakers and rivals and endear himself to employees who had suffered through a wretched period of corporate scandal.
To Wall Street, it may not matter much. The company's growth rate slowed to 2.3% in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter, which makes its annual loss of more than $3 billion all the more worrisome.
And ahead of the largest U.S. public stock listing since 2014, Uber executives have cautioned IPO investors that losses could grow amid bitter competition from rivals. The company is set to price shares Thursday and is expected to raise up to $9 billion at a valuation that could top $90 billion.
To find new customers, Uber has tried a range of marketing tactics, including paying media personalities such as talk radio host Dave Ramsey to discuss the company on air, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. And it is challenging the law from Chile to South Africa to grow market share.
But digging out of a $3 billion hole will not be solved simply by finding more Uber passengers, say analysts, investors, fund managers and former Uber employees.
""There is no evidence the core ride-hailing business is profitable,"" said Steve Blank, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, startup adviser and Stanford University professor. The question becomes, ""Where is the next billion dollars coming from?""
Analysts and Uber insiders point to a possible answer: its treasure trove of trip data.
Uber has ""a wildly successful data collection on who uses it and how they use it and where they go,"" said a person familiar with the business, who declined to be named. All of this data ""can become profitable,"" the person said.
A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. In its IPO filing, Uber says that adding new riders and getting passengers to make more frequent trips are key to improving its growth rate and profit margin.
UBER'S DATA PLAY
Uber has a fraught history with data collection. It has used geolocation data to spy on customers and journalists, deceive regulators and recruit drivers away from competitors. The company paid $148 million in a U.S. settlement last year over the cover-up of a 2016 data breach, and the terms included a revamp of Uber's data security practices.
Current and former Uber employees and analysts say the company is better positioned now to build a legitimate business from its vast quantity of data. 
The longer-term opportunity for Uber involves extracting value from that data rather than ""simply the economics of traditional ride sharing,"" said Mark Hargraves, head of global equities at AXA Investment Managers.
Exactly what that data business ultimately looks like remains to be seen. But data collection and machine learning are vital for Khosrowshahi to realize his vision for Uber as the ""Amazon for transportation,"" inferring where people want to go and how they want to move around much like online retailer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) predicts customers' future purchases.
That could make the company more efficient and sell more rides, driving up margins.
Or, Uber could do deals with partner companies such as consumer finance firms to roll out new products and services that are targeted to specific customers based on the data Uber has collected. Last month, Uber announced a collaboration with payments company PayPal Holdings to expand Uber's digital wallet offerings. 
Under Khosrowshahi, Uber has expanded and elevated its data science teams, according to current and former employees. He better integrated them with the rest of the company, which led to improved machine learning throughout.
Privacy concerns remain, however. In March, drivers in Britain accused Uber of violating a European data protection law.
Khosrowshahi hired the company's first chief privacy officer, Ruby Zefo, to set clear standards for data privacy, ""drawing red lines"" on what rider data is collected and how it is shared, said a current employee close to the security team. Zefo presents on these matters to the board of directors several times a year, reflective of the higher status Khosrowshahi has given the team.
Uber has other ideas for how it can get to profitability, pointing investors to its mobility services including scooters, food-delivery and freight-hauling. But the food-delivery service loses money and the freight-hauling business is heavily subsidized. 
In its IPO filing, Uber also named ""pursuing targeted investments and acquisitions"" as key to its growth strategy. As a public company, Uber will have more equity, debt and cash at its disposal than startups do. That could enable it to make acquisitions that could turbocharge revenue growth - not unlike how Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc found new lucrative businesses by buying Android, YouTube and Nest Labs.
As CEO of travel booking company  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), Khosrowshahi gained a reputation as a savvy dealmaker, completing 15 acquisitions during his 12-year tenure, according to PitchBook Inc data. His largest at Uber has been the $3.1 billion purchase of Middle Eastern rival Careem, which could help stem Uber's losses in the region but does not solve the underlying profitability problem. 

""I think Uber has an enormous number of moves as a public company,"" Blank said. ""They have a CEO who is exactly the right guy for the transition to Wall Street. All they could do now is screw it up.""

944,By Investing.com,"<span>May 09, 2019 04:27AM ET</span>",StockBeat - ArcelorMittal Warning Deepens Market's Trade Fears,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- President Donald Trump may put his trust in tariffs as an instrument for good, but the world’s biggest steelmaker isn’t so sure.
ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT) shares have fallen 4.5% in early trading on Thursday after the company announced weaker-than-expected earnings and cut its forecast for steel demand outside China this year. It blamed the global economic slowdown and higher input costs – notably from an iron ore market suffering from supply bottlenecks in Brazil and Australia.
ArcelorMittal’s warning plays to a general mood of doom and gloom in Europe this morning, dominated by fears that the U.S. -China trade war is about to escalate. Beijing on Thursday threatened retaliation if the U.S. actually implements the tariff increase on imports from China that it has now formally announced for Friday. Analysts see the trade conflict as one of the biggest risks to global economy in the near term.
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 4.12 points, or 1.2% at 378.36, its lowest in six weeks. France’s CAC 40 was the worst hit, falling 1.5% not least due to ArcelorMittal’s heavy weighting in the index. Germany’s Dax was down 1.0% while the U.K. FTSE 100 was outperforming, down only 0.6%.
ArcelorMittal said earlier this week it was ‘temporarily’ shutting steel mills in Poland and Spain, not least because the European Commission’s ‘safeguard tariffs’ of 25%, imposed in February, had failed to stop higher imports into the EU.
The only bright spot in the global market, according to CEO Lakshmi Mittal, remains China, where government stimulus programs rolled out earlier this year have supported prices.
“Although we are somewhat encouraged by the firmer price environment in China, this is not being reflected in Europe,” Mittal said as he unveiled a weak set of first-quarter results.
ArcelorMittal’s revenue was flat at $19.2 billion, as sales of its own iron ore offset lower prices for finished steel. But its basic operating earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) fell 15% to $1.65 billion, below estimates."
945,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 04:05AM ET</span>",European shares tumble amid trade tensions,"(Reuters) - European shares dropped broadly on Thursday as investors shunned risky assets while waiting to see whether United States and China manage to avoid a trade war which would damage the global economy.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index had dropped 0.7 percent by 0720 GMT, touching a fresh four-week low.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that China ""broke the deal"" it had reached in trade talks with the United States, and vowed not to back down on imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports.
As the world's largest economies resume two-day trade talks on Thursday in Washington, investors were on the edge to see if a last minute truce could avert a sharp increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday.
More than seven major sectors lost above 1 percent. Tariff-exposed auto stocks slid 1.6 percent decline while semiconductor stocks also lost ground.
Adding to chipmaker's woes was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Corp's uninspiring full year outlook.
Losses in heavyweight bank stocks weighed the most, with results from some of the biggest Italian banks in focus.
Italy's third largest lender, Banco BPM dropped nearly 6 percent after reporting a halving of loan-loss provisions for the first quarter.
Meanwhile, the country's biggest bank by assets UniCredit dipped even after it reiterated its 2019 targets and posted a net profit above analyst expectations.
Among the biggest decliners were shares of ArcelorMittal after the world's largest steelmaker cut demand forecast for its key markets and said it was facing the twin challenges of lower steel prices and reduced consumption in Europe.
German wholesaler Metro slid after reporting another quarter of falling sales at its Russian business and its Real hypermarkets, which the company is in the process of selling. 
Swiss drugmaker Novartis dipped on a deal to buy Takeda Pharmaceutical's eye drug assets for $3.4 billion.
Shares of Norway's Equinor came under pressure after wage talks between Norwegian oil firms and their employees broke down.
Investors sought safety in defensive stocks such as telecom, utilities and real estate which eked out the smallest losses.

Germany's Rheinmetall was the top percentage gainer on the STOXX 600 after it confirmed its outlook and reported a rise in revenue in the first quarter, mainly driven by its booming defense unit.

Brazilian Lucas Moura completed a sensational hat-trick in the ninety-sixth minute of play in Amsterdam to wipe out two first half Ajax goals and send the English Premier League side to the final by virtue of scoring more away goals, with the teams tied 3-3 across two games.
Ajax’s stock fell as much as 21% in early Amsterdam trading, erasing a rally of about the same amount that followed the team’s 1-0 win in London last week. Defeat cost the club at least an extra 15 million euros ($16.8 million) in prize money, equal to about 16% of its 2018 adjusted revenue.
But despite crashing out of the competition in the cruelest manner, Ajax shares remain up about 52% over the past year. In addition to an increased share of tournament revenue awarded by European governing body UEFA, the unexpected run to the semi-finals has put the side back among European soccer’s elite, which will likely give it added leverage when negotiating commercial deals with sponsors.
It’s also fueled speculation of big transfer payments as other teams come scouting for Ajax’s young stars. FC Barcelona have already snapped up 21-year-old midfielder Frenkie de Jong for 75 million euros."

“The ebb and flow of U.S.-China trade negotiations during the past 12 months have had a more dramatic impact on the performance of goods-producing companies compared with services-providing firms,” Goldman strategists led by David Kostin, wrote in a note. Last year’s trading “suggests services-providing stocks will outperform goods-producing stocks as long as the trade dispute continues.”
Investors got a fresh reminder this week of the market turmoil that U.S.-China tensions can cause, as risk assets swooned on threats by President Donald Trump to hike tariffs further on Chinese goods. The U.S. and China are set to resume trade negotiations only hours before the new duties are scheduled to take effect.
Read about Goldman saying higher U.S. tariffs on China are coming
Within the S&P 500 Index, Goldman classified 260 stocks as being in services, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) The strategists labeled 240 companies as goods producers, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
Services stocks benefit from fewer foreign input costs, a favorable inflation outlook, better growth and steady margins as well as stronger balance sheets, the Goldman strategists said.
Even if the trade dispute is ultimately resolved, “faster sales and earnings growth and more stable gross margins should support the outperformance of services stocks,” they wrote.

951,By Investing.com,"<span>May 08, 2019 11:06PM ET</span>",Asian Markets Fall as Trump Says China “Broke the Deal”,"Investing.com - Asian markets fell on Thursday in Asia as U.S. President Donald Trump said before crucial trade talks tomorrow that China “broke the deal.”
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 1.1% and 0.7% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 1.6%.
Although not a major directional driver, data showed this morning that China’s consumer price index in April jumped 2.5% from a year ago, in line with expectations but slightly higher than the 2.3% year-on-year rise in March.
A spike in pork prices (+14.4% year-on-year) contributed to higher food prices, the National Bureau of Statistics data showed.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 1.2%. South Korea’s KOSPI declined 1.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 edged up 0.3%.
Trade-related news are expected to dominate headlines for the rest of the week as markets await the outcome of the much anticipated negotiations on Friday.
Overnight, Trump said China ""broke the deal"" in the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks.
""By the way, you see the tariffs we're doing? Because they broke the deal. They broke the deal,"" Trump said. ""So they're flying in, the vice premier tomorrow is flying in — good man — but they broke the deal. They can't do that, so they'll be paying.""
The discussions with China were moving ""too slowly"" as Beijing tried to re-negotiate, the President claimed. That came as a shock as multiple major newswires that cited insider sources reported as recently as last week that the two sides were moving closer to a trade agreement and that a deal could be signed this Friday.
Trump added that the U.S. ""won't back down until China stops cheating our workers and stealing our jobs.""
""That's what's going to happen. Otherwise, we don't have to do business with them,"" he said. ""We can make the product right here if we have to — like we used to.""
""If we don't make the deal, nothing wrong with taking in over $100 billion a year, $100 billion, we never did that before,"" he said.
China, for its part, said that Beijing will retaliate if the U.S. follows through with its threat to hike tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
""The escalation of trade friction is not in the interests of the people of the two countries and the people of the world,"" the Ministry of Commerce said. ""The Chinese side deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are implemented, China will have to take necessary countermeasures."""

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's theme parks lifted quarterly earnings past Wall Street targets on Wednesday, helping offset big investments to support the media and entertainment company's bid to draw audiences to streaming media. 
Shares of Disney rose 1.5 percent to $137 in after-hours trading.
""Avengers: Endgame"", the end of a decade-long superhero series with $2.2 billion in box office sales worldwide, will stream exclusively on Disney+ starting Dec. 11, the company announced.
Growth at Disney parks in the United States boosted results above analyst expectations. From January to March, Disney reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.61, ahead of analyst estimates of $1.58, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Heavy investment accounted for a 13 percent drop from a year ago by that measure. 
Revenue rose 3 percent to $14.92 billion. Analysts had been expecting a small decline.
Disney is trying to transform from a cable TV leader to a streaming media powerhouse that, like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), sells subscriptions directly to consumers. Costs to build digital services will weigh on profits for several years, the company has said, but the stock has risen 15% since the Disney+ announcement in April. 
Its biggest streaming bet, the family-oriented Disney+, is set to launch in November. The company told analysts in April that it expects Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.
The just-ended quarter reflected the purchase of film and TV assets from 21st Century Fox, which brought Disney more content for its streaming future. 
For the quarter, the direct-to-consumer and international unit recorded a loss of $393 million from streaming costs.
Disney also recorded a $353 million impairment charge from its ownership stake in media startup Vice. 
In the theme park unit, net income hit $1.5 billion as more visitors showed up at Walt Disney World in Florida and at Hong Kong Disneyland, and occupied hotel nights increased. 
""Increased ticket prices haven’t put visitors off, and hotels continue to be a major driver of additional spending,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""It’s easy to get caught up in the hype surrounding new films ... but it’s the less glamorous Media Networks and Parks that pay the lion’s share of the bills."" 
Overall net income jumped 85 percent, to $5.4 billion, thanks to Disney's acquisition of a controlling stake in Hulu through the Fox acquisition.
Media networks, a division that includes ESPN and ABC, reported $2.2 billion in operating income for the quarter. 
The movie studio reported profit of $534 million, lifted by ""Captain Marvel,"" which was a global hit but did not reach the level of ""Black Panther"" and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" a year earlier.

953,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 10:08PM ET</span>","Under pressure from Trump, GM in talks to sell idled Ohio plant","By David Shepardson and Tyler Choi
WASHINGTON/TORONTO (Reuters) - Under pressure from President Donald Trump, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Wednesday it was in talks to sell an idled northeast Ohio plant to a cash-strapped electric truck-building company.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million in three other plants in Ohio - a state important to Trump's re-election chances in 2020 - and maintain some operations at a Canadian factory that had been slated to close by year end.
The decisions came after GM faced months of criticism over its plan announced in November to close five North American plants and cut 15,000 jobs. GM's decision to close the small-car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, had become fodder for Trump and several Democratic presidential candidates.
Trump, who disclosed GM's plans for Lordstown in a Wednesday tweet, said the deal with Cincinnati-based Workhorse Group Inc will require the approval of the United Auto Workers union. However, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine expressed caution.
""This is a step, but we have a long way to go,"" DeWine told reporters. He also cited Workhorse's ongoing efforts to win a truck supply contract with the U.S. Postal Service as a key step. 
Loveland, Ohio-based Workhorse is a small electric truck and drone startup that has reported losses totaling almost $150 million since its launch in 2007, according to the company's financial documents. It had just $2.8 million in cash on hand at the end of March and reported first-quarter sales of $364,000.
UAW OPPOSES DEAL
Workhorse and a newly formed entity, in which Workhorse holds a minority stake, would initially employ ""hundreds"" at the plant building a commercial electric pickup truck, Workhorse officials said. As recently as 2016, GM employed 4,500 people at the plant and in March cut the final 1,500 jobs when production of the slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze ended.
Of the 2,800 hourly employees affected by the plans to end production at the four U.S. plants, 1,350 have accepted transfers to other GM plants, the company said. At Lordstown, about half of those employed when production ended have transferred elsewhere.
GM also said on Wednesday it will invest $700 million and add 450 jobs at its Toledo, Parma and Moraine, Ohio, operations. ""Great news for Ohio,"" Trump tweeted. 
GM is not reversing the bulk of its restructuring efforts, including its decision to slash 15 percent of its salaried workforce and end vehicle production at three North American plants, including Lordstown. Last week, GM ended production at a plant near Baltimore that built transmissions. 
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said Workhorse ""could help preserve Lordstown’s more than 50-year tradition of vehicle assembly work.""
The UAW said on Wednesday in a statement GM should add a new product at Lordstown ""and continue operating it,"" adding it would continue with its federal lawsuit against GM to protect the contractual rights of its members. Workhorse officials said they intend to work with the union, but a previously unionized plant it bought from Navistar in 2013 now operates with a non-union work force, according to the company's annual report.
The fate of the Lordstown plant has been a big focus of Trump's. He spoke to Barra earlier on Wednesday before the Detroit company announced its plans in Canada. 
Trump in June 2017 advised workers in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, that factory jobs were not leaving. ""Don't move, don't sell your house,"" he said.
It likely would take at least a year before the plant, which halted production in March, could reopen after a deal was reached, Ohio's governor, DeWine, said.
""This potential agreement ... will help solidify the leadership of Workhorse's role in the EV community,"" Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes said in the GM statement, referring to electric vehicles.
Workhorse shares jumped 190 percent to $2.45 on the news, while GM's shares were almost unchanged, down 5 cents at $38.48 in late afternoon. 
CANADIAN PM: 'GOOD NEWS' 
Separately, GM and the largest union representing Canada's auto workers have reached a deal to partly rescue an Ontario assembly plant by turning it into a parts-making facility, the automaker said in a statement.
The transformation of GM's Oshawa site, which would also be used to conduct advanced vehicle testing, would save 300 jobs and have ""the potential to grow and generate significant additional jobs in the coming years,"" GM said.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the announcement ""good news for our autoworkers.""
Canadian union Unifor, which had fiercely opposed the shuttering of the plant, had previously said the closure was contrary to a contract that stipulates there would be no plant closure.

""There are 300 families that are better off than they would have been in December,” said Unifor President Jerry Dias in Toronto.

954,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 10:07PM ET</span>",Automakers expect White House to delay decision on auto tariffs: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump to delay a decision due next week on whether to impose steep tariffs on imported cars and auto parts on national security grounds for up to six months as talks continue with the European Union and Japan.
In February, the Commerce Department submitted its ""Section 232"" national security report. Trump has until May 18 to act, but four auto executives who have spoken to administration officials say he is likely to extend that deadline by another 180 days. He may also announce a specific date to impose new duties if no deal is reached.
Administration officials say Trump could still opt to impose the tariffs by May 18, but believe that after a series of investment announcements by automakers - including one by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Wednesday of $700 million in three Ohio plants - he will likely delay the tariffs amid a trade battle with China.
The auto tariffs face wide opposition in Congress. The White House refuses to turn over the Commerce report to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who has been demanding to see it. 
On Wednesday, 159 House of Representatives members led by Ways and Means Committee Vice Chair Terri Sewell wrote White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow to urge him to advise Trump against ""imposing trade restrictions that could harm the auto sector and the American economy.""
The letter from 79 Democrats and 81 Republicans seen by Reuters warned that imposing tariffs on parts in cars ""may overlap with motorcycles, recreational vehicles, construction equipment, heavy-duty trucks, farming equipment, powersports vehicles, and others.""
The White House did not immediately comment.
Administration officials have said tariff threats on autos are a way to win concessions from Japan and the EU. Last year, Trump agreed not to impose tariffs as long as talks with the two trading partners were proceeding in a productive manner.
The industry says tariffs of up to 25 percent on millions of imported cars and parts would add thousands of dollars to vehicle costs and potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses throughout the U.S. economy.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Toyota Motor Corp and others, said automakers adamantly opposed new tariffs.
""At the end of the day, you can either have tariffs or investments, but you can't have both,"" she said.
The Commerce Department started its investigation in May 2018 at Trump’s request to determine the effects of imports on national security.
U.S. light-duty vehicle prices would increase by $2,750 on average, including U.S.-built vehicles, reducing annual U.S. sales by 1.3 million units and forcing many consumers to the used-car market, according to a think tank report released last year.

Major automaker groups said last year the cumulative effect for the United States would be an $83 billion annual price increase and argued there was no evidence auto imports posed a national security risk.

The risk of being removed to a jurisdiction that doesn’t provide the same protection or rule of law will lead people to reconsider whether to choose Hong Kong as their base of operation or regional headquarters, ICC Hong Kong secretary Keith Brandt wrote in a letter to members of the Legislative Council.
The American Chamber of Commerce last month also said the legislation would reduce the appeal of Hong Kong, while opponents of the new law staged one of the largest mass protests since the 2014 pro-democracy Occupy movement. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam says the bill is needed, citing challenges in pursuing a 2018 murder case against a man who confessed to killing his girlfriend in Taiwan. The confession came after the man returned to Hong Kong, which doesn’t have an extradition agreement with Taiwan.
Brandt said that particular case should be treated separately. “There are simpler ways to deal with this case as legal experts have pointed out, without having to complicate matters, and use a sledgehammer,” he wrote.
The ICC Hong Kong’s executive committee includes Lippo Ltd. board member Jark Pui Lee and Bank of East Asia Ltd. senior executive Leung Kwok Yau, according to its website.
“We oppose the proposed changes and ask that the legislative process should halt pending a thorough and proper public consultation,” the ICC said in a separate statement to the media."
956,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 07:57PM ET</span>",Huawei CFO to seek extradition stay citing Trump comments,"By Evan Duggan and Karen Freifeld
VANCOUVER/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Huawei's chief financial officer intends to seek a stay of extradition proceedings in part based on statements by President Donald Trump about the case, which her lawyers say disqualifies the United States from pursuing the matter in Canada.
CFO Meng Wanzhou, 47, the daughter of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at Vancouver's airport in December on a U.S. warrant and is fighting extradition on charges that she conspired to defraud global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran.
After the arrest, Trump told Reuters he would intervene in the U.S. case against Meng if it would help close a trade deal with China.
Meng’s defense lawyers said in a document presented to the British Columbia Supreme Court on Wednesday that they intend to apply for the stay of the extradition proceedings based on abuses that go beyond Trump's comments.
The lawyers also claim Meng was unlawfully detained, searched and interrogated at the airport, with her arrest delayed under the guise of a routine immigration check. 
In addition, Meng's counsel argued there is no evidence she misrepresented to a bank Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran called Skycom, thereby putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions law, or that the bank relied on her statements to its detriment. 
The lawyers claim the bank understood the relationship between Huawei and Skycom. 
A spokesman for HSBC, which has been identified as the bank, declined to comment. 
Huawei has previously said Skycom was a local business partner in Iran. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.
Meng defense lawyer Scott Fenton told the court that during Meng's three-hour detention at the airport in December, Meng's rights ""were placed in total suspension.""
NEXT COURT APPEARANCE
The lawyers also argue Meng cannot be extradited because the conduct at issue would not be criminal in Canada. 
The bank and wire fraud charges do not meet that criteria because Meng is accused of misrepresenting HSBC to engage in transactions that violate U.S. sanctions laws, the lawyers said. They also note that, under 2019 Canadian sanction law, there would be no risk of fines or forfeiture for any bank in Canada.
""Put another way, the alleged offense could only exist in a country that prohibits international financial transactions in relation to Iran,"" the lawyers said in court documents. ""Canada is no longer such a country.""
Meng's lawyers did not say when they would apply for the stay of the extradition hearing, whose date has not been set. She will next appear in court on Sept. 23, when her defense will make more applications for further disclosure surrounding her arrest at the airport. The process could take years.
Meng's case has attracted global attention and sparked a diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Ottawa. China has repeatedly demanded Meng's release.
Huawei said in a statement on Wednesday that the criminal case against Meng is based on allegations that are simply not true, adding that the U.S.-ordered arrest was ""guided by political considerations and tactics, not by the rule of law.""
Huawei and Skycom are also defendants in the U.S. case, accused of bank and wire fraud, as well as violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Meng was released from jail in December on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail and must wear an electronic ankle bracelet and pay for security guards. She has been living in a Vancouver home that was valued at C$5 million in 2018.
Meng arrived at court on Wednesday wearing an elegant full-length black and gray weave-pattern dress, with the ankle monitor prominently visible.
At the hearing, her lawyers requested she be allowed to move to a second Vancouver mansion, one which has been under renovation and was assessed at C$13 million last year. Justice Heather J. Holmes granted Meng's request to move to the larger home for security reasons.
The relocation is sure to deepen the anger of some Canadians at the difference in her lifestyle and how two Canadians are being held in a Chinese detention center, said Paul Evans, a professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs.
Chinese police detained the two Canadian citizens after Meng's arrest. 

In recent weeks, China has upped the pressure on Canada and halted Canadian canola imports and suspended the permits of two major pork producers.

LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber drivers in London and major U.S. cities held a series of strikes on Wednesday to protest the disparity between gig-economy conditions and the sums that investors are likely to make in Friday's blockbuster stock market debut.
Protests were sparsely attended in London, New York and California, and rides appeared easily available in some cities where strikes were called.
Drivers and regulators around the world have long criticized the business tactics of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. The expected valuation of up to $90 billion in its initial public offering on Friday is proving to be the latest flashpoint. 
Unions in Britain said support for the strike was strong, with drivers staying at home and passengers using the #UberShutDown hashtag to pledge solidarity on social media. The Uber app indicated fares were higher in London during a rainy morning rush hour due to increased demand. 
""Stand with these workers on strike today, across the UK and the world,"" said Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party.
A few dozen protesters gathered at a rally in London. Another dozen attended a protest at about 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) near Wall Street in Manhattan. At Uber's headquarters in the borough of Queens in New York City, about 100 people gathered in the morning, but their numbers dwindled to a few dozen or so at 1 p.m., when a rally was scheduled. Uber has 3 million drivers globally.
Around a hundred people attended a rally in San Francisco, Uber's home town. Driver and organizer Rebecca Stack-Martinez said that widespread media coverage made the strike a success, adding that organizing in the gig economy of part-time, contract labor was difficult.
""There is no directory out there of who's driving, how many drivers, how we can reach them,"" she said. ""And so we have to be really creative about how we get to drivers and get them involved in the movement.""
Many drivers work part time for the services and often divide their time between platforms, delivering food and goods as well as giving rides. 
The public calls for higher pay underscored that some drivers want more from Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi, who was hired to help move the company past a series of scandals, improve driver relations and manage the IPO.
Uber is paying more than a million drivers about $300 million in one-time bonuses, for instance, and has changed policies such as allowing riders to tip.
""Whether it's being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we'll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers,"" the company said.
'BROKEN PROMISES'
Uber has steadfastly, and mostly successfully, beaten back attempts to compel it to treat drivers as employees, arguing that its main business is a platform that brings riders and drivers together. And the money-losing company is under pressure to cut costs.
Many drivers want better pay from Uber rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) as well. 
Syed Ali, an Uber driver and member of the striking New York Taxi Workers Alliance, in a statement said, ""They have grown and grown and gotten richer and richer, but I haven't grown with the company. My condition as an Uber driver has gotten worse and worse.""
Uber and Lyft have cut back on incentives and bonuses in more established markets to attract new drivers. They have also devised more complicated formulas for determining what riders pay and what drivers earn.
Both companies recently slashed the per-mile rate for drivers in Los Angeles and San Francisco, while increasing some other factors, such as per-minute rates. Some drivers estimated a loss of 10 percent to 20 percent in earnings. 
The company and its critics are divided over how much drivers can make. Classified as independent contractors, they lack paid sick and vacation days and must cover their own expenses, such as car maintenance and gasoline. 
U.S. representatives for Uber and Lyft did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Ahead of the actions, Lyft said its hourly wages have risen over the last two years and average over $20 per hour. 

Uber noted that a recent study whose authors included current and former Uber employees showed driver gross earnings averaged $21 an hour. But a study by left-leaning Washington think tank Economic Policy Institute calculated that after costs, Uber drivers earned $9.21 an hour.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co is creating a new unit tasked with satisfying U.S. regulatory requirements, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Derek Flowers, who has been with the San Francisco-based bank for more than two decades, will become head of strategic execution and operations and will focus on the bank's regulatory priorities, said the memo, sent by interim chief executive Allen Parker on Wednesday.
In his current role as chief credit and market risk officer, Flowers would have had frequent contact with regulators.
The new unit, whose creation was reported earlier on Wednesday by the Financial Times, will be charged with working through the more than a dozen regulatory consent orders the bank is operating under - agreements between regulators and the bank that it will work to satisfy certain requirements. It will also implement new business and risk-management processes.
Parker has said he wants to ""redouble"" the bank's efforts to satisfy and exceed regulatory expectations. 
Regulators have demanded change from Wells Fargo after employee whistleblowers revealed it had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts in 2016. Internal and regulatory probes have since discovered other issues in each of the bank's primary segments, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.
The bank has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has so far payed out tens of millions of dollars.
However, regulators including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have publicly criticized the bank's progress within the past month. 

Wells Fargo has added more than 1,000 jobs to its risk management team and plans to add an additional 1,300 employees this year to help strengthen its compliance efforts, it has said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) shares declined 2.5 percent on Wednesday after executives forecast modest profit growth over the next three years, signaling it is likely to lag big rivals as the once-dominant chipmaker catches up in technology.
Intel once dominated the most important chip market with more than 90 percent share for the brains of personal computers. As PC sales have stagnated, it has expanded into data center processors, memory and networking chips.
That positions Intel as a smaller player in a bigger market. The company said on Wednesday it expects to have just 28 percent market share by 2023, or about $85 billion in sales in a $300 billion addressable market for the chips it makes, according to the company's forecast.
Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on Wednesday the company sees both revenue and earnings per share growing in the ""single digit"" percentage range over the next three years, with flat PC chip sales offset by ""double digit"" percentage revenue growth in data center chips.
Swan also said operating margins would remain relatively steady at 32 percent, but that gross margins would decline as the company ramps up its 10-nanometer chip-making technology, which makes chips faster by making their features smaller.
Intel shares dropped in late trading on Wednesday as executives gave the presentation and closed 2.5 percent lower at $49.24. 
Kinngai Chan, a Summit Insights Group analyst, said Intel's forecast means it might grow more slowly than other large chipmakers, especially in terms of profit.
Intel ""is admitting to gross margin pressures in the next 2.5 years and that earnings will only keep pace with topline growth,"" Chan said. Chan said Intel's peers were likely to report 5 percent revenue growth in coming years, but with profits growing faster than revenue rather than along with it as Intel has forecast.
Swan gave the long-term outlook less than two weeks after Intel cut its 2019 sales forecast, citing weak data center sales in China.
“We let you down. We let ourselves down,” Swan said of the quarterly results last month.
Swan told investors the primary driver of gross margin pressure was the transition to new chip-making technology. Intel struggled with delays for its 10-nanometer technology, losing its lead in making the smallest chips to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC). Intel plans to launch 10nm chips for high-end PCs later this year, and for servers early next year.

Swan said Intel plans to deliver even smaller 7nm chips by 2021.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Foreign companies operating in Cuba's tourism sector said at an industry fair this week they would continue investing in the Caribbean's largest island despite new U.S. sanctions designed to choke its already beleaguered economy.
The Trump administration said last month it was tightening U.S. travel restrictions on Communist-run Cuba and allowing U.S. citizens to bring lawsuits against foreign companies profiting from property taken from them after Cuba's 1959 revolution.
The administration is seeking to pressure Cuba's Communist government into giving up its support for embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
""It's obviously a very awkward situation but we will keep on advancing,"" said Juan Antonio Montes, general director of the Spanish hotel group Barcelo, which has been based in Cuba for two decades.
Regarding the implementation of the long-dormant section of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act allowing U.S. lawsuits against companies using confiscated property, he said Barcelo would seek a legal way ""to be more protected.""
""But we do not have any kind of intention to leave or to modify any current plans,"" he said.
The European Union and Canada, whose companies are the top investors in Cuba, particularly in the tourism and mining sectors, have denounced the Trump administration's implementation of Title III of the Helms-Burton Act. They say it is not valid under international law and their companies could dispose of blocking legislation, for example, to make counterclaims for any U.S. suits they may face.
""Our aim is to keep investing in Cuba and for our companies to have the willingness to contribute to the development of the island,"" Spain's tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, said at the opening of Cuba's tourism fair on Tuesday.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who replaced Raul Castro last year, met on Tuesday with foreign businessmen, including the head of Canadian mining company Sherritt, to reassure them about the security of their investments under Cuban law.
Cuba has sought to attract foreign capital ever since the fall of former benefactor the Soviet Union, hoping it could help vitalize its beleaguered, still heavily centralized economy.
""This was an important sign for all companies working in Cuba,"" said Alessandro Benedetti, an executive for Swiss-based Kempinski Hotels SA, which runs the luxury Gran Hotel Manzana in Havana, which opened in 2017.
Cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp became the first company sued for profiting from expropriated Cuban property last week under Title III of Helms-Burton by U.S. citizens who hold titles to the Santiago de Cuba and Havana ports.

The ports are used by numerous U.S. cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines, which therefore could also face suits.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.01%, the S&P 500 lost 0.16%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26%.
China’s commerce ministry said it will take ""necessary retaliatory measures"" if the U.S. moves ahead with plans to raise tariffs on Friday, raising some doubts over President Donald Trump's message that the Chinese trade team was looking to make a deal at talks set for this week.
Trump tweeted that Chinese negotiators ""just informed"" the White House they are ""coming to the U.S. to make a deal"" on trade.
Analysts said that the rhetoric on trade will be ramped up heading into the final stages of the talks, but ultimately cooler heads will prevail and a deal will be struck.
""(W)e believe an agreement will be reached soon, even if the rhetoric is ratcheted up even further over the next few days and the U.S. increases tariffs temporarily,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
Trade-sensitive stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) ended the day mixed, suggesting market participants are not yet convinced that an escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions will be averted.
Energy stocks closed roughly flat, even as U.S. oil prices settled higher on the back of an unexpected draw in domestic supply.

966,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:23PM ET</span>","Lyft shares hit record low, piling pressure on Uber ahead of IPO","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's stock slumped nearly 11% on Wednesday to a record low after the ride-hailing company posted a deep quarterly loss, putting pressure on Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc as it prepares to price its initial public offering. 
Lyft lost $1.1 billion for the March quarter, the company said on Tuesday, although analysts applauded its revenue growth. With the latest drop, Lyft shares are now down 27% from their March 28 IPO price, giving the company a market capitalization of about $15 billion. 
Lyft's sharp decline since its Wall Street debut will weigh on investors considering whether to buy shares of larger rival Uber, which is slated to price its own IPO on Thursday. 
Uber, which like Lyft is unprofitable, is willing to price conservatively within its stated range of $44 to $50 per share to avoid repeating Lyft's poor performance since its IPO, which was aggressively priced at the top of its range, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Uber, the world's largest ride-hailing company, is aiming for a valuation of $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion. That is as much as a third below what the startup's insiders had hoped for last year.
Uber will need to convince potential investors that it is different from the Lyft, and that could include highlighting its international operations and Uber Eats food delivery service.
Lyft's loss of $48.53 per share in the first quarter was largely due to stock-based compensation and payroll tax related to is IPO. It forecast that losses would peak this year, but did not say when it would make a profit.
Lyft's revenue rose 95% to $776 million, more than analysts on average expected, according to Refinitiv data.
Investors have struggled to figure out how much Uber and Lyft are worth, given both companies have not estimated a timeline for turning a profit. Some investors believe the eventual adoption of autonomous cars will help make the companies profitable.
Lyft did not disclose its quarterly bookings, riling some investors. Those figures include the portion of each ride's fare that goes to the driver as well as the part that goes to Lyft, a metric the company had called a key indicator in its IPO prospectus.
Twenty-three analysts cover Lyft, mostly with positive ratings, according to Refinitiv. Their median price target is $77, 44% above Lyft's record low closing price of $52.91 on Wednesday.
Lyft expects revenue growth to slow to 52% or 53% for 2019 after doubling last year. That would value Lyft's stock at 4.75 times its 2019 sales. Applying that multiple to Uber, based on revenue estimates of three analysts who have already initiated coverage, would value it at around $68 billion.
Uber was most recently was valued at $76 billion in the private fund-raising market.
Analysts from brokerages including Canaccord, Stifel, Wedbush, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) published upbeat notes reacting to Lyft's report. 

""We believe Lyft will be both a catalyst and beneficiary of the growth of ridesharing and autonomous tech over the next 10+ years,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson wrote in a client note, maintaining his ""overweight"" rating and $78 price target.

968,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",JPMorgan shareholders advised to vote against executive compensation by ISS,"By Elizabeth Dilts
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy advisory group ISS has advised JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) shareholders to vote against the bank's executive compensation at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, according to a report the firm published this week that was seen by Reuters.
This is the third time the group has advocated voting against JPMorgan's executive compensation since the Dodd-Frank law mandated shareholders be given a say on pay in 2010. Each time, ISS has cited discretionary compensation as a concern.
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, did not immediately provide comment on the ISS view.
The bank's board of directors recommended in its proxy filing that shareholders vote to approve executive compensation at its shareholder meeting next week in Chicago, based on the company's strong business results, risk controls and conduct, customer and stakeholder focus, and leadership in 2018. 
The influential proxy advisory firm said that although JPMorgan's compensation committee uses performance assessments to guide the amount of discretionary compensation awarded, certain ""factors assessed were described only vaguely and appear subjective.""
""Investors increasingly prefer an incentive program structure that constrains discretion in favor of emphasis on objective and transparent determinations that are more compatible with pay-for-performance,"" ISS wrote.
ISS said it was also concerned about the vesting of one part of the pay plans described as performance share units. 
ISS previously advised voting against executive pay in 2015 because it objected to a discretionary cash bonus, and in 2011 because it said the chief executive pay was ""significantly above-median"" and the discretionary components reduced the focus on performance.
JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has led the bank since 2005, received a total of $31 million in compensation for the year 2018, $1.5 million more than in 2017. His compensation included an annual base salary of more than $1.5 million and performance-based incentives of $29.5 million. 
The shareholder vote on executive compensation next week is ultimately nonbinding. However, the bank's board said in its 2019 proxy statement that it will consider the results of the vote when making future compensation arrangements.
In Britain,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) faced investor criticism at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday after roughly a third of votes were cast against its executive compensation plans. 

Standard Chartered's pay plans differ significantly from U.S. banks. ISS and another advisory firm, Glass Lewis, had advised shareholders to vote against the plans.

969,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 03:57PM ET</span>","GE CEO expects weaker quarters for rest of 2019, higher China tariff costs","By Alwyn Scott
TARRYTOWN, N.Y. (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co Chief Executive Larry Culp said on Wednesday that the company will likely have weaker quarters for the rest of the year after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter.
The 127-year-old Boston-based conglomerate is struggling to recover from a $23 billion loss last year and Culp, who was named CEO in October, asked investors for patience during a turnaround that he expects will take two more years. 
GE's results will balance out through 2019 and its profit and cash flow forecasts are unchanged, Culp said at his first annual meeting as the company's CEO. GE faces several hundred million dollars in increased costs because of tariffs on imports from China, he said, in response to a question from former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, who was among about 200 attendees. 
Shareholders elected GE's slate of 10 directors and all management proposals passed, company officials said at the meeting. 
But an executive compensation proposal passed with 70.5 percent of the vote and 29.5 percent against, GE said, which was a relatively low level of support for such measures. 
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had recommended shareholders vote against top executives' pay, citing concerns about directors' discretion to set pay. 
Shareholders approved allowing GE to trim its minimum board size to seven members from 10, though GE intends to appoint two more directors. Culp said a smaller board is more flexible and can talk more easily ""around a smaller table."" 
A measure to keep KPMG as GE's auditor passed with a wider margin than last year, despite concerns that KPMG did not raise alarms about aspects of GE's accounting that regulators are now investigating. 
A shareholder proposal to split the CEO and chairman roles won about 27 percent of the votes. ISS had recommended a vote for the proposal, saying GE ""would benefit from the most robust form of independent boardroom oversight.""
GE set its 2019 financial targets last week, which call for a cash outflow of up to $2 billion. 
""It's still tough for me to say that out loud,"" Culp said on Wednesday, referring to the $2 billion figure. ""But that is our reality.""
The meeting, held at a hotel about 30 miles north of New York City, was smaller and less contentious than last year's meeting at a GE 3-D printing factory near Pittsburgh, where about 225 attended and union members protested outside.
Before the meeting, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller told reporters that one of the biggest changes under Culp is that GE is focusing on operations in quarterly reviews of its business. 
In the past, such reviews were more high level and focused on financial results first and operations second, she said, noting she and Culp met with aviation on Monday, healthcare on Tuesday and plan to meet with the power business in about two weeks.
During the tail end of former CEO Jeff Immelt's 16-year tenure, GE spent more than $15 billion building up its industrial business only to see most of those investments sour in 2017 and 2018. 
GE also sold most of its capital business, which had supported its earnings growth, while demand for its power business has fallen sharply.
One investor said Immelt's actions had cost shareholders dearly and asked the company to try to recover money paid and still being paid to the former GE leader.

""Clawbacks would be in order"" if the board found serious misconduct, Culp said, but not for poor business decisions.

970,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 03:35PM ET</span>",Exelon to close Pennsylvania Three Mile Island nuclear plant in September,"By Scott DiSavino
(Reuters) - U.S. energy company  Exelon Corp  (NYSE:EXC) said Wednesday it will shut the last reactor at the Three Mile Island power plant, site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, on Sept. 30 due to legislative inaction on a nuclear subsidy bill in Pennsylvania.
""With only three legislative session days remaining in May and no action taken to advance House Bill 11 or Senate Bill 510, it is clear a state policy solution will not be enacted before June 1,"" Exelon said in a release, referring to the proposed nuclear subsidy bills.
Exelon said it had to make a decision by June 1 to purchase fuel for the plant for its next operating cycle. The company announced in May 2017 that it would shut the 45-year-old reactor in 2019 without policy reform to support the plant.
Analysts at Height Capital Markets said in a report that the shutdown, which will come 40 years after the 1979 meltdown of another reactor at the plant, will increase pressure on Pennsylvania legislators to pass a nuclear subsidy bill in the autumn to protect the state's remaining eight reactors from early closures.
In recent years, electricity prices have been depressed by cheap natural gas from shale fields, including the Marcellus in Pennsylvania, and increased use of renewable power. This has made some nuclear plants uneconomical, and forced generators to shut several reactors over the past five years.
Several states, including New York, Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey have already adopted nuclear subsidies to keep their reactors in service to help meet carbon reduction goals.
Lawmakers in Pennsylvania and Ohio are considering legislation, while officials in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration have proposed programs to keep nuclear and coal plants operating longer.
In late April, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf released a plan to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve those goals, Wolf recommended implementing policies to keep the state's nuclear reactors in service. Nuclear plants do not emit carbon dioxide, one of the major causes of global warming.
Nuclear power plants generate 42 percent of Pennsylvania's electricity and provide 93 percent of its zero-carbon power.
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Exelon operates two reactors at the Peach Bottom and two at Limerick, FirstEnergy Corp (NYSE:FE) operates two reactors at Beaver Valley and Talen Energy owns two at Susquehanna.

FirstEnergy's bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions unit said it would shut Beaver Valley in 2021 unless the reactors receive some financial support from federal or state programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Donald Trump's choice of three new board members of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, filling vacancies that had long prevented the agency from financing large sales of exports such as commercial aircraft.
The Senate voted to confirm Kimberly Reed as the new president of EXIM and board member Judith Pryor for terms that expire Jan. 20, 2021. It also approved a board seat for Spencer Bachus, a former Alabama congressman, for a term ending in January 2023.
Each candidate won more than 70 votes, indicating bipartisan support for the 85-year-old institution.
The vote restores a quorum to the EXIM board that allows the agency to resume financing and loan guarantees for sales and projects over $10 million for the first time since July 2015, when conservative Republicans in Congress waged a battle to shut down the bank.
It was a victory for U.S. manufacturing giants including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, who have been unable to offer overseas customers government-backed export financing for aircraft and large equipment orders.
EXIM acting president Jeffrey Gerrish said in a statement that the bank has nearly $40 billion worth of export deals in the pipeline waiting for approval that can now proceed. 
""The Senate’s bipartisan votes today renew opportunities for U.S. exporters to compete on a level playing field in markets and industries where China and other nations are aggressively supporting their exporters,"" said Gerrish, who also serves as deputy U.S. Trade Representative.
He said U.S. exporters would have a ""fighting chance"" to win export sales on quality and price rather than the availability of government-backed financing.
The 85-year-old bank had become a popular target for conservatives, who branded it as a provider of ""corporate welfare"" and ""crony capitalism"" in 2015 when they sought to block renewal of its charter.
That effort failed, but conservatives could again try to kill EXIM this year, as its charter must be renewed by Sept. 30.
But President Donald Trump and other members of his administration have voiced strong support for the bank as a tool to boost exports, grow manufacturing jobs and compete more effectively for international projects with China, whose state-backed financing dwarfs that provided by the United States.

974,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",Daimler CEO says successor will have tough job,"By Edward Taylor
OSLO (Reuters) - Daimler's next chief executive will have a tough job to restore margins at Mercedes-Benz, current boss Dieter Zetsche told Reuters on Wednesday, as Mercedes-Benz launched a new luxury electric car to rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Zetsche, who bows out as CEO on May 22, said the German luxury carmaker needed to find a way to rebuild margins after research and development (R&D) costs at Mercedes-Benz ballooned.
""There are many challenges ahead. We are in a situation of an economic slowdown. It is not going to be easier going forward,"" he said on the sidelines of the launch event near Oslo.
Pressure to develop electric and autonomous cars has led R&D costs at Mercedes-Benz passenger cars to rise to 14 billion euros ($15.7 billion) from around 8 billion euros four years ago, Zetsche said.
At the same time, China, the world's largest car market, has seen sales momentum slowing for nine months in a row, with a 5.2 percent fall in sales in March.
Mercedes-Benz's large electric car will hit showrooms this summer, years after Tesla launched its Model S in 2012.
Daimler has been cautious about embracing mass production of electric vehicles at Mercedes-Benz amid concerns about operating range and customer acceptance.
The company took a 9.1 percent stake in Tesla for around $50 million in May 2009 to learn about battery technology, but sold its stake for a $780 million profit in 2014. 
Daimler launched an electric car under the smart brand in 2010, but waited until 2014 to build an electric Mercedes-Benz B-Class.
Daimler, like other manufacturers, has struggled to make electric cars profitable, although the cost of battery packs is expected to fall as they invest in ramping up battery cell production.
ING analysts say the total cost of ownership, including fuel prices, could reach parity between electric and combustion engined vehicles by 2025. 
In an effort to make a profit with electric cars, Daimler has opted to manufacture the Mercedes EQC in a way that enables it to be built on the same production line as a combustion engined car, retooling existing plants.
Daimler is investing more than 10 billion euros to expand the electric EQ model range and is building battery cell production facilities.
The Mercedes EQC will have an operating range of 445-471 kms, with a base version costing below 60,000 euros to make it eligible for Germany’s electric car environmental bonus.
Asked whether Daimler was too late to the electric vehicle trend, Zetsche said: ""For the past 40 years I have heard that German manufacturers have missed all the important trends. But apparently customers still like cars from manufacturers that have missed the boat.""
Zetsche took over as CEO of DaimlerChrysler in 2006 and took the decision to sell Chrysler, returning Mercedes to the top selling luxury brand globally in 2016 and defending the title ever since.
Zetsche said Daimler's future hinged on making electric cars profitably.

""We need to prove that we can earn adequate margins, and the capital market wants to proof points. We are working on making this a reality.""

980,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",Walmart raises U.S. tobacco purchase age to 21 starting in July,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Wednesday it will raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 across its U.S. stores starting July 1, responding to growing regulatory and political pressure to curb a surge in teenage use of e-cigarettes. 
It also pushed the world's largest retailer to say it discontinue the sale of fruit-and dessert-flavored electronic nicotine delivery systems.
In March, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) put 15 national retailers, including Walmart, Kroger (NYSE:KR), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Family Dollar Stores, on notice for allegedly selling tobacco products such as e-cigarettes to minors. In April, Walgreens and Rite Aid said they would raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21.
Last month, U.S. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said he plans to introduce legislation to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco products, including vaping devices, to 21 from 18.
E-cigarettes have been a bone of contention in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.
The increased pressure on retailers comes at a time when states and cities across the United States have moved to raise the legal age for purchasing tobacco in an effort to prevent addiction at young ages. A 2015 study from the National Academy of Medicine found that among adults who became daily smokers, about 90 percent started using cigarettes before they were 19.
The study found that raising the minimum legal age to 21 would prevent 223,000 premature deaths.
So far 12 states have enacted laws to raise the minimum age to 21, including New Jersey and California. Lawmakers in New York state and Maryland have also approved legislation.
Walmart said the FDA had conducted approximately 12,800 compliance checks involving minors at Walmart stores and Sam's Club locations around the country since 2010. Over that period, Walmart stores passed 93 percent and Sam's Club cleared 99 percent of those checks. 
In 2018, the Walmart stores cleared 94 percent of the 2,400 FDA checks and Sam's Club passed 100 percent of its 15 checks.
""While we have implemented a robust compliance program, we are not satisfied with falling short of our companywide goal of 100 percent compliance,"" John Scudder, U.S. chief ethics and compliance officer, said in a letter to the FDA.
""Even a single sale to a minor is one too many,"" he said.
In the letter, Walmart also assured the regulator that it would remained focused on improving its compliance rates and any sale-to-minor violation would be dealt with promptly.
Walmart said it had increased disciplinary action against store workers who failed to check ID's for shoppers who appeared to be under 40. It will also use internal and external data, including FDA data, to implement alerts, controls, training and monitoring to reduce the risk of a sale to an underage customer.
In 2019, the retailer said it would conduct 8,000 secret-shopper visits, and stores and that workers who fail the checks would be required to complete a ""corrective action plan.""

""Going forward ... a cashier who fails a secret-shopper check will be subjected to disciplinary action, up to and including termination,"" Scudder said in the letter.

984,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 11:41AM ET</span>","Wirecard eyes share buybacks, sales leads from Softbank alliance","By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German payments firm Wirecard is considering buying back shares following its partnership with Japan's Softbank Group which it said on Wednesday had already created leads for potential cooperation in digital payments. 
Wirecard will pay out to shareholders ""a substantial portion"" of the proceeds of a 900 million euro ($1 billion) convertible bond issue that Softbank will buy as part of the alliance struck last month, CEO Markus Braun said.
""We have already started very quickly to make this partnership happen,"" Braun told analysts on a conference call after Wirecard reported a 41 percent increase in first-quarter core profits, helping to lift its shares price.
Braun made the bullish statements as he seeks to shake off allegations of fraud and false accounting made in a series of Financial Times articles that shook investors and wiped up to $10 billion off Wirecard's market value in January and February.
The quarterly results come two weeks after Wirecard published full-year 2018 accounts, delayed by an investigation by its own law firm that concluded staff in Singapore may have committed crimes but absolved head office in Munich.
Wirecard won a 'clean' opinion from auditor EY for its annual results, but said it would tighten up on compliance after finding shortcomings in the handling of software licenses issued to its partners.
Braun said Wirecard was in talks with six to eight companies in Softbank's portfolio - in Asia, Europe and the United States - to cooperate on digital payments. 
He declined to elaborate but said Wirecard would share an analysis of the alliance's potential in invites for its June 18 annual general meeting that go out this Friday. Shareholders are being asked to vote on the Softbank deal.
PROFITS GROWTH ACCELERATES
Softbank, the world's biggest venture fund which runs the $100 billion Vision Fund, counts ride-hailing players Uber (NYSE:UBER), Grab and Didi, along with shared office space provider WeWork, among its properties. 
Uber, on the brink of a $90 billion U.S. market listing has, however, just taken a $500 million investment from rival payments company Paypal.
Wirecard lifted its outlook for earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to between 760 million euros and 810 million euros ($851-$907 million) this year. The mid-point implies that the acceleration in the early months of this year will persist.
The company, which operates both as an acquirer, processing payments on behalf of 293,000 merchants, and as an issuer of real and 'virtual' payment cards, sees plenty of momentum ahead.
Its shares rose 4 percent in Frankfurt trading following the results with some analysts also hailing the potential from the Softbank alliance.
Wirecard has long been a target of 'short' sellers who seek to expose accounting irregularities and profit from ensuing share price declines - triggering probes by German prosecutors who suspect illegal market manipulation.
The stock is strongly supported by equity analysts, however, with 19 out of 25 who cover the firm rating it a 'strong buy' or 'buy'.
""The partnership with Softbank is a game changer,"" said Robin Brass at private bank Hauck & Aufhaeuser, estimating it could boost Wirecard's EBITDA by 100 million euros.

Scientific Games (NASDAQ:SGMS) stock jumped 18%.
The company reported mixed quarterly results after the bell yesterday.
It said it lost 26 cents per share, much wider than the 4 cents per share expected by analyst forecasts compiled by Investing.com. But revenue of $837 million was better than the forecast of $834 million.
The loss was also much narrower than the year-ago figure of $2.24 per share.
The company also gave bulls something more to hang one, saying it raised $301 million following an IPO for a minority stake in its social gaming business SciPlay. The money raised will go to pay down debt.

The plan would help save some union jobs at GM's Oshawa car-making plant, even though the operations would be scaled down and it will no longer produce cars, the source added.
""Oshawa stays open,"" said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""It's a small foot in the door, but it stays open."" 
A spokesman for GM declined to comment before an 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) press conference at which the company and the union are expected to make an announcement about the plant. A Unifor spokeswoman also declined comment before the press conference.
GM, which has been increasing its footprint in connected-car development in Canada, will also make an announcement on advanced automotive technologies, the source said.
CBC cited a brochure given to members of Unifor that outlined the plans for employees of the GM plant in Oshawa. In November, GM announced plans to close the plant by the end of 2019, affecting almost 2,600 workers.

Unifor said the closure was contrary to a contract that stipulates there would be no plant closures prior to Sept. 21, 2020.

987,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 11:06AM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters profit tops Wall St. forecasts, shares hit all-time high","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by demand for information it sells to legal professionals, and reaffirmed its forecast for the rest of this year and 2020. 
Its Canadian-listed stock rose 1.9% to C$83.76 after earlier hitting an all-time high of $C84.45. The shares are up more than 60% over the past 12 months. 
The news and information provider and parent of Reuters News reported earnings excluding special items of 36 cents per share, compared with 28 cents per share a year ago, helped by lower interest expenses and by stock repurchases. 
That beat the average analyst estimate of 25 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
First-quarter revenue rose 8 percent to $1.49 billion, slightly below analysts' average estimate of $1.5 billion. 
For 2019, the company repeated its forecast for revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% before the effect of currency, and growth of about half that pace in 2020. 
Currency exchange rates slightly reduced sales across the company's operations but excluding that effect, each of the company's units reported higher revenue. The largest business, Legal Professionals, reported a 3-percent rise in sales in constant currency to $594 million and a 19-percent jump in adjusted earnings. Law firms account for the bulk of the segment's customer base. 
""What’s driving our business is the ever-increasing regulatory environment that our clients have to deal with and needs for efficiencies and tools to help our professional customers do their job,"" Chief Executive Jim Smith said in an interview.
Last year, Thomson Reuters sold a 55-percent stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit, which provides data and news primarily to financial customers, to private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP. The F&R unit is now a standalone business called Refinitiv. 
Thomson Reuters, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, has said it set aside $2 billion of the $17 billion proceeds from the Blackstone deal for purchases to help expand its Legal, Tax & Accounting and Corporates businesses.
Asked for an update on that acquisitions strategy, Smith said: ""We are still hunting. We are actively exploring the market.""
Reuters News revenue more than doubled to $155 million in the latest quarter, due to a 30-year agreement for Reuters to supply news and editorial content to Refinitiv, which began in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Thomson Reuters in November appointed Michael Friedenberg as president of Reuters News. The senior leadership team just reviewed Friedenberg's strategy and will share it with the board in June, Smith said on Wednesday.

Like other European banks, Spanish lenders are struggling to lift earnings as low interest rates squeeze financial markets. They are increasingly focusing on trimming costs and boosting efforts to sell services on digital platforms.
Spain's third-largest lender said about 60 percent of the 2,023 planned job cuts would take place during the second half of the year and the rest in the second half of 2020. It expects to incur the financial charge in the current quarter. 
Assuming a full take-up, the cuts are expected to generate around 190 million euros in annual savings. The bank said the figures were consistent with targets set out in its 2019-2021 strategic plan. 
Caixabank last year said it was planning to cut almost a fifth of its branches in Spain over the next three years in a drive to boost profitability while pursuing its digital transformation. 
Fellow Spanish lender Santander (MC:SAN), the euro zone's largest lender by market capitalization, is also in negotiations with unions on shutting branches and potential layoffs as part of the integration process with Banco Popular.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets need to push more trades through the European Central Bank's settlement system to cut costs, an ECB official said, dismissing industry criticism that the new system was failing to deliver promised benefits.
The ECB built a pan-European TARGET 2 Securities, or T2S, platform for settling securities trades, to help create a cheaper European Union capital market to compete better with the United States -- and with Britain after it leaves the EU.
Opened in June 2015, T2S has been in full operation for about 18 months but had to raise fees earlier this year.
Volumes remain too low to allow the ECB, which is still recouping its investment cost, to cut fees. Some national settlement systems that T2S was meant to replace still remain.
""The cost remains too high,"" Cecile Nagel, chief executive of EuroCCP, a clearing house for share trades, told a conference organized by banking lobby AFME on Wednesday.
Guido Wille, a board member of Deutsche Boerse's settlement arm, Clearstream, said T2S has not delivered lower costs or ease of access to pan-European settlement.
""It has added another layer,"" he said.
Andrew Douglas, managing director of government relations at DTCC, which settles share trades in the United States, said U.S. settlement costs were a fraction of those in Europe.
The system has suffered delays and cost overruns since its inception in 2008, when total development costs were put at 203 million euros, an estimate that rose to 256.4 million euros within two years.
Marc Bayle, the ECB's director general for market infrastructure and payments, said T2S has fully delivered on what was expected.
""The price at which we charge today has increased this year because the volume was lower than expected,"" Bayle told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.
Settlement fees in Europe would be far higher without T2S because national systems would have had to invest in cyber defenses, Bayle said.
""It's up to the market ... If the volume would increase we would decrease the price,"" Bayle added.
Volumes would be boosted if Clearstream and Euroclear, the two big international settlement houses, gave up more settlement business to T2S.
""We are not necessarily greatly in favor of forcing market participants to move volume from one place to another,"" Wille said.

All three indices held close to the unchanged mark by 9:53 AM ET (13:53 GMT) with the Dow Jones at 25,972.55 points by 9:35 AM ET (13:35 GMT), the S&P 500 at 2,884.48 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite holding at 7,970.18 points.
The market has been under pressure since President Donald Trump surprisingly announced that he intended to raise tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods from Friday. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer subsequently repeated the threat and a notice posted on the Federal Register on Wednesday confirmed the country will hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10 to 25% effective Friday. 
The move has left China’s trade negotiators, who arrive in Washington later today ahead of a fresh round of negotiations on Thursday and Friday, little leeway to make the concessions wanted by the U.S. without losing considerable face at home.
Despite President Trump’s insistence that Chinese companies will absorb the higher levies through their profit margins, American firms that have high revenue exposure to China, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or chipmakers AMD and Nvidia have all seen shares pummeled. Companies such Boeing (NYSE:BA) or  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which are sensitive to Chinese investment spending and to any retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that Beijing may levy, have also suffered.
The morning's earnings haven't been strong enough to reverse the trend. 
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and TripAdvisor registered steep declines in their stocks as both companies missed quarterly revenue forecasts.
Also in the red,  Lyft 's (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares sank on a wider-than-expected loss in its first quarterly report as a public company. The results may serve as a warning sign for those investors considering rival Uber’s (NYSE:UBER) stock market debut on Friday.
Not all the news was bearish as shares in Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) surged on better-than-expected quarterly figures.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, fell 0.2% to 97.24 by 9:55 AM ET (13:55 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was little changed at 2.45%.

992,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Barrick CEO Expects to Raise $1.5 Billion in Asset Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), which completed its acquisition of  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. at the beginning of the year, has identified $1.5 billion in assets the miner intends to sell, Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said.
“Our focus is realizing $1.5 billion through next year,” Bristow said Wednesday in an interview in Toronto. The assets will be sold once they are optimized enough to create sufficient value for shareholders, he said.
The gold sector has been anticipating a wave of asset sales in the wake of Barrick’s $5.4 billion acquisition of Randgold and a second mega-merger that created Newmont Goldcorp Corp. The newly combined giants were expected to put several unloved mines up for sale, leaving lots of room for maneuvering by company executives who have missed out on the dealmaking.
The objective is for the sale process to be well advanced by mid-2020, Barrick said in its first-quarter earnings statement, its first results since its acquisition of Randgold was completed.
“It’s not a fire-sale, it’s a considered process,” Bristow said in a separate interview with Bloomberg TV. “We’ll work with those stakeholders, and we will let the market know when we’re ready to let them know once we’ve got a way forward for each of those assets.”
Barrick climbed 1.8 percent to $12.95 at 9:43 a.m. in New York. That pared the shares’ decline this year to 4.3 percent.
Barrick will focus on finding the right buyers for its assets and is willing to help them manage the mines during a transition period, if required, Bristow told BTV. Some of the assets Barrick is selling are in countries that the company still wants to invest in, he says.
In the meantime, the Toronto-based miner also won’t hesitate to “pick up other assets” that may be available.
Barrick said its joint venture agreement with Newmont is expected to close by the end of the quarter. In March, Barrick withdrew a $17.8 billion hostile bid for rival Newmont after negotiating the joint venture combining most of their assets in Nevada. Barrick has a 61.5 percent stake in the JV to Newmont-Goldcorp’s 38.5%.
Barrick also said it will declare a dividend of 4 cents a share.

993,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>","Nordic, Baltic regulator boost anti-money laundering cooperation","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nordic and Baltic financial regulators said on Wednesday that they would establish a permanent working group to boost joint efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
The establishment of the new group, which will include regulators in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden, follows a number of high-profile money laundering scandals in the region.

994,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",Adding More Customers Won't Fix This Bank,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Good things come to those who wait. If you’re a  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) shareholder, that could be a very, very long time.
The German lender is midway through a revamp that aims to revive profitability, in part, by gaining customers. On Wednesday, Commerzbank showed it has been steadily winning those new clients. But it’s still far from clear whether the company can actually increase revenue, let alone returns.
So Chief Executive Officer Martin Zielke is right – a tie-up with  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) may not be what the firm needs, but another deal almost certainly is.
In a highly fragmented and competitive market, turning even the most attractive of customers in Germany – the Mittelstand companies that fuel Europe’s biggest economy – into respectable profits looks to be a mirage.
True, Commerzbank’s effort to win business by investing in technology are paying off. In the corporate division, it has added 9,700 relationships since 2016, close to its target of more than 10,000 new clients by 2020. It’s also on track in the consumer and small-business unit. Loan volumes and assets under management are in line with, if not ahead of, the firm’s targets.
But revenue fell 1.2 percent to 2.19 billion euros ($2.45 billion) in the first quarter, even if the bank expects it to increase by 3 percent over the full year. Net income dwindled to 120 million euros, less than half the figure for the year-earlier period. It’s no surprise the firm abandoned its profitability target earlier this year: return on tangible equity fell to a measly 1.9 percent in the first three months of 2019.
Chief Financial Officer Stephan Engels tried to reassure doubtful analysts, saying that he’s comfortable with the revenue guidance given the strength in net interest income, which was up 12 percent from last year. He was less bullish on commission income, down 4.2 percent. MiFID II has prompted clients to cut back on securities dealing, he explained.
The reality is Commerzbank’s business model – like most German lenders – is highly sensitive to interest rates. The bank estimates that a 100 basis-point increase in the cost of borrowing would yield an additional 500 million euros in net interest income over the first year alone. By year four, that would grow to 900 million euros.
The possibility of rates remaining low in Europe and continuing to squeeze margins, as has happened in Japan, is something that the bank will have to address as part of its strategic update planned for the autumn, the CFO said.
In the meantime, the lender still faces the same old problem: on its own, it doesn’t have the market share needed to make costly investments pay off. For shareholders, the hope must be that one of Commerzbank’s mooted international suitors follows through.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, UniCredit SpA and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV have at various times expressed interest, lured by the bank’s Mittelstand clientele. A combination with any of those peers would be preferable to a long, hard slog alone.

996,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2019 08:29AM ET</span>",The Mighty U.S. Consumer Is Struggling,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s no secret the U.S. economy keys off consumption. On that count, it’s beginning to look less and less like an expanding economy. Whether it’s the internals of the first-quarter GDP report or the source of March personal spending, the trend is not the friend of growth in coming months.
Some of it comes down to the state of U.S. workers’ paychecks. Adjusted for inflation, personal income excluding government transfers peaked in December and has declined at a 3 percent annual rate over the past three months. That helps explain consumption’s punk 0.8 percent contribution to first-quarter GDP, the lowest in a year.
Digging into March’s personal spending data, the headline once again belied strength. On the surface, spending of 0.9 percent was as robust as it gets even after adjusting for inflation, which took it to 0.7 percent. Net out the biggest savings drawdown in six years, however, and you arrive at a decline of 0.2 percent for March.
As for what’s pushing households to tap into their rainy-day funds,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) recently pointed to the 15 percent year-on-year increase in household interest payments. Levels of payments rising at a similar pace preceded the onsets of the last two recessions.
Is it any wonder credit-card issuers are bolstering their cushions to absorb future losses? And it’s not just Capital One that caters to lower-credit quality borrowers. All seven of the largest U.S. card issuers boosted their charge-off rates in the first quarter to an average of 3.82 percent, an almost seven-year high.
Mortgage lenders are reporting similar strains. According to Knight Black's latest Mortgage Monitor, a typical first quarter sees the national delinquency rate decline by 15 percent as borrowers use tax refund proceeds to catch up on their household finances. The first three months of 2019, however, marked the smallest drop in delinquency rates since 2009.
It’s almost as if the tax cut never happened.
While that’s a bit of a stretch (there’s no denying the bump to take-home pay for millions of Americans) 2019’s tax season was nevertheless been a shock of historic magnitude to household budgets. Add up what Uncle Sam did not pay out in tax refunds and how much more households paid up in income taxes vis-à-vis 2018 and you arrive at $29 billion.
While that figure may not seem sufficient to move the needle, it was likely a surprise to households. That’s $29 billion less in the way of splurging or righting your financial ship, depending on the circumstances. Either consumption takes the hit or households that had planned on catching up remain uncomfortably in arrears.
One way to fortify fragile finances is refinancing a mortgage to reduce monthly payments. The March decline to 4.06 percent in 30-year fixed mortgage rates, almost a full percentage point lower than 2018’s highs, sent homeowners swarming to lenders with refinancing activity up 58 percent over the prior 12 months. Three short weeks later, rates had edged up by a tenth of a percentage point, sufficient to slow the year-on-year rate increase in refinancing activity to 11 percent.
Accentuating households’ sensitivity to the slightest moves in borrowing rates, Knight Black noted that the recent low in rates increased the pool of mortgages eligible for refinancing by 1.6 million in a single week to 4.9 million. As per the Mortgage Monitor: “Rates bumped up less than one-eighth of a point and knocked one million of those folks out of the running.”
Looking forward, TS Lombard Chief Economist Steven Blitz notes that two-thirds of April’s new jobs were generated in lower-wage services industries such as administration and support services, health and social services, leisure and hospitality, among others. The flip-side of this dynamic is that high-paying job growth has been nearly halved to 1.6 percent since peaking in 2015.
Little wonder that according to the Federal Reserve’s latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks tightened lending standards for credit cards in the first quarter. This belt-tightening should come as no surprise given the four largest U.S. banks booked $4 billion in credit card charge-offs in the first quarter. That compares to $656 million across all other consumer loans, representing the widest gap since at least 2009.
The economy may be going gangbusters as job gains defy estimates, but something is amiss in the household sector, the driving force behind the world’s biggest economy. The Fed may want to look beyond the headlines before making its next “solid” assessment of the economy backed by a labor market that “remains strong.”

998,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 08:04AM ET</span>",JPMorgan poised to be first foreigner to get majority in China fund venture,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) could become the first foreign company to own a majority stake in its Chinese mutual fund business, after its joint venture partner put a crucial 2 percent of the business up for sale that analysts expect the Wall Street bank to lap up.
A move by JPMorgan towards that goal would come at a tense time in U.S.-China ties, as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is set to continue trade negotiations with the United States that were roiled after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would raise tariffs. 
Under new rules announced in late 2017, foreign asset managers can own up to 51 percent of their Chinese mutual fund joint ventures, though, so far, no company has managed to do so. 
J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) currently owns 49 percent of China International Fund Management (CIFM), while Shanghai International Trust, belonging to Shanghai Pudong Development Group, owns 51 percent. 
Shanghai International Trust said in a posting on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange website it is auctioning a 2 percent stake. 
""This is a very, very critical step because this potentially could open the doorway for a number of other deals to begin working their way through the process,"" said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
Alexander added he had ""a high conviction level"" that JPMorgan will be the buyer and that the purchase price will be watched closely, as it will offer a guidance on the “premium” foreign firms need to pay for control of a Chinese fund venture.
The open bidding process begins on May 8, and will continue until June 4. 
Last year, JPMorgan said that its asset management unit was ""pursuing its desire and intent to increase its current joint venture stake in China International Fund Management Co Ltd to a majority interest."" 
A spokeswoman for JPMAM declined to comment on Shanghai International Trust's move.
Were JPMAM to win the auction, it would still need approval from Chinese regulators to reach 51 percent.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) became the largest shareholder last month in its joint venture, but remains short of majority control.
A number of foreign asset managers, including JPMAM, wholly own companies in China which hold private securities fund management licenses. However, these licenses do not allow them to sell products to mass market retail investors, something that is allowed for mutual fund management joint ventures.
Lack of access to the China market for foreign companies, including financial services firms, is one major area of contention in the trade dispute between China and the United States, and Z-Ben Advisors' Alexander said that the stake auction by JPMorgan's Chinese fund partner could be seen in the context of the trade talks.
""You know this could have been done ages ago. Why now? I don't believe in coincidence,"" he said.

In October, the refiner said it planned to assess options for the two master limited partnerships, which could include either one buying the other.
Under the terms of the agreement, Andeavor shareholders will receive 1.135 common units of MPLX for each common unit held and Marathon will receive 1.0328 MPLX common units for each ANDX common unit held.
The deal has a total enterprise value of $14 billion.
By buying rival Andeavor last year for over $23 billion, the refiner gained more exposure to the areas where Andeavor Logistics held its assets, including the Bakken region and the largest oilfield in the United States, the Permian basin.
Mike Hennigan will remain President of the combined entity and lead all midstream activities, the company said.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 07:07AM ET</span>",Australia competition watchdog blocks $11 billion Vodafone unit-TPG Telecom merger,"By Tom Westbrook and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator blocked a proposed A$15 billion ($11 billion) merger between TPG Telecom Ltd and a  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) unit on Wednesday, sending shares of companies on both sides of the deal tumbling.
The merger was to combine Australia's third and fourth-largest telcos to create a big player boasting TPG's fiber network and Vodafone's mobile system.
Its rejection on competition grounds, which was accidentally uploaded by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) a day earlier than expected, unraveled that prospect and drove a chaotic selldown across the sector in late trade.
The firms said they would contest the decision in court. But the rejection heaps pressure on the growth plans of both companies, weighing on TPG in particular to resume investment in a mobile network it abandoned in January.
Mathan Somasundaram, Market Portfolio Strategist at stockbroker Blue Ocean Equities in Sydney, said the merger was of mutual interest since Vodafone's growth had stalled and TPG remained a small player.
""Both of them are really out of plan B,"" he said. ""Vodafone needs a dancing partner and TPG needs scale."" 
Vodafone mainly runs a mobile phone business in Australia in a joint venture with Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd, and it had struggled with reliability, while TPG mainly runs an internet business with a low-cost reputation.
The deal would stop both from competing in each other's markets, the ACCC had said in December, concluding on Wednesday it would reduce rivalry in the sector as a whole.
It is the largest deal the regulator has blocked for years, and it could now grind through the courts for a long time, much like the ultimately successful tie-up between gambling houses Tabcorp Holdings and Tatts Group in 2017.
TPG shares dropped as much as 15 percent and closed at a five-month low, more or less where they were before the deal was agreed, while thinly traded Hutchison stock dropped 28 percent to its lowest since February.
'WE WILL DEFINITELY CONTEST'
TPG abandoned building its mobile telephone network in January because it relied on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd equipment, after the Chinese telco was banned by Australia's government on security grounds last year. 
The regulator believes the company may revisit the plan to build the network and that rivalry in the industry depends on it.
""TPG is the best prospect Australia has for a new mobile network operator to enter the market, and this is likely the last chance we have for stronger competition in the supply of mobile services,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.
""TPG has the capability and commercial incentive to resolve the technical and commercial challenges it is facing.""
TPG did not mention the network in a statement, which said the merger would improve competition. Vodafone Hutchison Australia said it remains committed to the deal. The companies agreed to extend the deadline for implementing the merger until August 31, 2020.
""It is extremely difficult for us to understand this decision,"" Vodafone Hutchison Australia Chief Executive Officer Inaki Berroeta said on a conference call with journalists.
""It looks like the ACCC has created an ideal market structure ... and they are trying to compare that with reality, which I believe is a fallacy,"" he said. ""This is something that we will definitely contest.""
MISFIRE
The regulator's decision caught traders, analysts and the companies unawares since it was not due to announce its final verdict until Thursday, after twice delaying the decision date, when it inadvertently published a note on its website.
""This information was inadvertently published online on our mergers register briefly this afternoon,"" the ACCC said in a statement.
The news sent both firms into a tailspin and shares sliding until the market closed 25 minutes later and the regulator published a fuller note explaining its reasons.
TPG and Vodafone only responded after the close of trade, likely making for a bumpy open on Thursday.
Some analysts said the merger was not doomed yet.
""Currently there are a number of unknowns and many variable valuation outcomes,"" Nick Harris, an analyst at Brisbane stockbroker Morgans, wrote in a note to clients after ACCC's decision was published on Wednesday. Morgans retains a hold rating on TPG.
""Approval or denial of the merger remains the key short term risk/reward for TPG shareholders.""

1006,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 07:05AM ET</span>",Lyft results underscore importance to Uber of life beyond ride-hailing,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor disappointment at  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's growth outlook underscores the pressure for rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc to show potential backers of its initial public offering that it can expand services such as food delivery even as its core ride-hailing slows down. 
Lyft posted its first results as a public company, one of the last data points for investors ahead of Uber's IPO this week. Lyft, a smaller company, said growth was slowing and losses would shrink after this year. 
Uber, though, has bet on a broader range of services and markets than Lyft, comparing itself recently to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) , which did not turn a profit until several years after its IPO. 
""If you believe in the Amazon model, you basically believe that Wall Street will fund these companies indefinitely with almost zero cost of capital, as long as they post these extraordinary growth rates,"" said Renny Ponvert, CEO of independent research firm Management CV. ""If that dynamic changes... things could get rough really quickly.""
Uber Eats, he said, was an example of a market that is similar to ride-hailing and can make for a relatively fast ramp-up of services and improvement in margins, he said, describing Lyft as playing catch-up. Uber also has expanded into freight hauling, for instance.
A person familiar with Uber's discussions with investors said the potential for Uber Eats in particular was resonating with investors. Uber's IPO is more than three times oversubscribed, the person familiar with the matter said.
Uber is scheduled to price share in the IPO, expected to be the biggest of 2019, on Thursday, and then begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
Uber declined to comment.
The company currently plans to sell 180 million shares in the offering to raise up to $9 billion. 
Uber is going public just over a month after Lyft, which priced very well in the IPO but has since struggled in trading. 
Uber and Lyft are racking up enormous losses, both reporting first-quarter net losses of around $1 billion.
Lyft also raised some questions about Uber's focus on growth when Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said competitive pressure from promotional offers to riders ""has recently receded"". 
That could suggest Uber scaled back promotions, which could slow growth while making it easier to turn a profit, said Tom White senior research analyst D.A. Davidson. ""If you prefer growth, then fewer incentives could have an impact on growth. But it certainly will impact profitability."" 
Uber, the world's largest ride-hailing company, is aiming for a valuation of between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion in the IPO. This is as much as one-third below what the startup's insiders had hoped for last year, with Uber adopting a more cautious approach in the wake of Lyft's post-IPO struggles.
""They're driving a little more carefully as they navigate their IPO process,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equities research at Wedbush Securities.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) on Wednesday played down the prospects of an immediate takeover approach by a foreign bank following failed merger talks with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Commerzbank's finance chief Stephan Engels, speaking to journalists after a sharp fall in first-quarter profit, said he didn't hear anyone knocking at the door, as he put it.
Both Italy's UniCredit and Dutch  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) have expressed interest in Commerzbank, which is Germany's second largest lender and 15 percent owned by the government, sources have said. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and ING have declined to comment.
A strategy of continuing as a standalone bank remains an alternative, Engels said. ""It was before and it is now. I can't say if it always will be.""
Talks with larger rival Deutsche Bank ended last month after six weeks of negotiations. The banks attributed the failure to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
German government officials, led by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, had pushed for a tie-up to create a national banking champion and end questions over the future of both banks, which have struggled to recover since the financial crisis.
Chief Executive Martin Zielke told staff during the merger talks with Deutsche that Commerzbank does not have the market share for costly investments, fuelling speculation of an alternative tie-up if talks fell through.
Doing nothing is ""not an option"", Zielke has told his staff, 82 percent of whom were against a merger in an internal survey.
Commerzbank is working on a new strategic plan that it will present later this year. 
""We are addressing the right issues with our strategy,"" Zielke said in a statement on Wednesday. The bank has been focusing on shifting its processes to a digital model.
Commerzbank posted a 54 percent drop in net profit in the first quarter, blaming a higher tax burden for the decline.
Net profit of 120 million euros ($134.4 million) was slightly above the 115 million euros expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. It fell from 262 million euros a year earlier.
Commerzbank shares slipped 1.3 percent to 7.64 euros by 1040 GMT.
Revenues also declined to 2.156 billion euros in the first quarter, from 2.217 billion a year earlier. But the bank forecast that underlying revenues would be higher in 2019 than in 2018.
Engels said business remains on a positive track.
""The challenge now is to build on this progress,"" he said.

Dow futures were indicated down points 103 points, or 0.4% by 6:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 11.9 points or 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures was down 39 points or 0.5%.
The market has struggled to stabilize since U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed the U.S. intends to raise tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods from Friday. The move has left China’s trade negotiators, who arrive in Washington later today for a fresh round of negotiations, little leeway to make the concessions wanted by the U.S. without losing considerable face at home.
The negative mood music got louder overnight as Iran said it would start enriching uranium again in two months if China, Russia and the European signatories to a UN-backed 2015 agreement didn’t protect it from U.S. sanctions.

By contrast, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is set to open down over 7% after missing first-quarter sales estimates.  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) is indicated down 1.0% after reporting a net loss of over $1 billion in the first quarter, inflated by costs related to its IPO. It said losses would peak this year.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>","Toyota, Honda plan to attack costs to free up cash for new tech","By Naomi Tajitsu and Kevin Buckland
TOKYO (Reuters) - Two top Japanese automakers said they planned to tighten their belts in the years ahead to free up cash to develop electric cars and ride-sharing services, underscoring the hard task ahead as traditional automakers face a rapidly changing industry.
Toyota Motor Corp, the country's top automaker, said that higher costs to develop new technologies like connected cars was ramping up pressure to generate savings wherever possible, while Honda Motor Co said it would strip down its vehicle lineup to cut production costs.
""We still weren't able to improve our costs enough last year,"" Toyota CFO Koji Kobayashi told reporters, adding that mounting investment required for new technologies and other R&D costs was making cost-cutting efforts more challenging. 
""We need to work to find new ways to reduce costs this year,"" he said, adding that penny pinching would apply to all aspects of the business, from producing lower-cost prototypes to limiting the number of pencils employees use at any given time. 
Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo said Japan's No. 3 automaker would cut the number of car model variations to a third of current offerings by 2025, reducing global production costs by 10 percent and redirecting those savings toward advanced research and development.
""We recognize that the number of models and variations at the trim and option level have increased and our efficiency has declined,"" he told reporters at a briefing.
BUSINESS MODEL OF THE FUTURE?
Toyota expects cost reduction efforts will help to lift operating profit by 3.3 percent to 2.55 trillion yen ($23.20 billion) in the year to March 2020. In the year just ended, Toyota posted an operating profit of 2.47 trillion yen. 
The profit outlook for one of the world's biggest car makers was slightly lower than the 2.61 trillion yen average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Toyota also announced a 300 billion yen share buyback.

Honda forecast cost reductions would help boost operating profit by 6 percent to 770 billion yen in the year to March. That is less than the 834 billion yen average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Profit fell 13 percent to 726 billion yen in the year ended March due to currency fluctuations and costs related to Honda's plan to shutter production plants in the UK and Turkey in 2021.
(For interactive charts on Honda's financial year, click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ix5Zep) 
Toyota expects to sell a record 10.74 million vehicles globally in the current year, up 1.3 percent on the year and lifted by higher sales in Asia as it continues to grow sales in China despite an overall slowdown in the world's biggest auto market.
But sales in North America are expected to struggle for another year due to weak U.S. demand for its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry as drivers continue to shift to larger, higher-margin trucks and SUVs. Toyota expects sales in the region to slide 1.6 percent.
Kobayashi said Toyota wanted to raise its operating margin in North America to 8 percent in 2020, in line with the global margin, from around 1 percent, but acknowledged it was not confident of meeting the target.
To do so, the automaker would need to further ramp up its sales ratio of SUVs and trucks from around 60 percent of total vehicle sales in 2018 and slash discounting, he said. 
Toyota, Honda and their rivals are facing stiff competition as ride-sharing technology and the race to develop self-driving cars has caused rapid - and costly - disruption to the auto industry.
These new technologies have opened the industry to tech firms and other players, forcing traditional automakers to rethink their strategy of selling gasoline-powered passenger cars to individual drivers, a business model which has been essentially unchallenged for the past century. 
""From here on will be an age in which the difference between victory and defeat will be decided by the last one mile, which will be our contact point with customers,"" Toyota President Akio Toyoda told reporters.
""Merely depending on the business model of the past will not lead to the future.""

1011,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>","Big Four miners languish amid demand, ESG, capex concerns","By Barbara Lewis and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest diversified miners have yet to see their share prices reflect their role as providers of the minerals needed for a shift to a low-carbon economy.
Mining companies provide minerals such as cobalt used in electric vehicle batteries and copper for increased electrification, and the sector's balance sheets are in rude health. 
Still, many investors are wary. Concerns include the demand outlook from China, the world's biggest consumer of metals; the sector's history of wasting shareholders' money on mergers and acquisitions that never deliver returns; and a patchy record on environmental, social and governance-related (ESG) issues.
Reminders of the dangers include a disaster in Brazil at a Vale tailings dam in January that killed an estimated 300 people, and a U.S. corruption investigation into  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), announced in April.
Refinitiv data shows the Big Four diversified miners -  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), BHP,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and Glencore - trading at a lower forward 12-months price-to-earnings multiple than Britain's FTSE 100.
""All the large mining companies are trading on high free cash flow yields relative to the broader market when you adjust for capital spending on growth projects,"" said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM).
""This is indicative of the market's scepticism about the sustainability of those cash flows, the robustness of capital allocation by management and the sector’s challenges around ESG issues.""
James Clunie, fund manager at Jupiter Fund Management, which holds shares in Rio Tinto and BHP, agreed uncertainty around medium-term commodity prices was a deterrent.
""A whole class of people say 'I'm out' because of that uncertainty, and that leads to (the stocks') undervaluation,"" he said.
(For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2GSDbei)
The same attitude is reflected in the ratings given to the four companies by brokers, with most favoring a fence-sitting ""hold"" recommendation. 
(For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2DIaVsN)
On the flipside, others focus on how the miners have transformed their balance sheets and improved governance.
""Compared to the past, the resources sector is carrying a fraction of the leverage it used to, which should reduce the volatility of the shares,"" Evy Hambro, manager of the world's largest actively managed mining equity fund, BlackRock's BGF World Mining Fund, told Reuters.
""In addition, the improved capital discipline combined with lower levels of reinvestment has increased the free cash flow available to shareholders and resulted in rising distributions to shareholders.""
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is the world's largest money manager, with some $6 trillion in assets. Hambro manages a combined $11.9 billion across several funds.

LGIM's Stansbury said the sector was wrestling with several paradoxes. 
""They are one of the most crucial industries in the fight against climate change,"" he said, referring to the minerals they can produce to roll out electrification and renewable energy.
But extracting those minerals results in high levels of emissions, volumes of water consumption and fatalities, despite promises from major miners to eliminate harm.
Mining can also lift large numbers of people out of poverty by providing well-paid jobs and helping to roll out electrification in emerging economies, but operating in the fragile democracies where some of the richest resources are found can expose miners to corruption allegations.
""It is essential the sector makes further progress on transparency and corruption. Investors need to be confident that the government take from resource extraction is used for the benefit of the local population,"" Stansbury said.
Another concern is that the sector's financial health could be setting it up for a fall.
""Counterintuitively the risks around misallocation of capital are greater now that the sector has largely resolved their balance sheet problems,"" Stansbury said.

""At the bottom of the last cycle the sector just didn't have the money to spend unwisely on bad projects. Now they do, so it's no surprise that these concerns are rising again in investor's minds.""

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) could face a shareholder rebellion on Wednesday over the bank's pay plans for senior executives, the latest in a series of potential revolts over bosses pension payouts at top British firms.
Investor advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have advised shareholders to vote against increases in Chief Executive Bill Winters's pension payouts, as part of a wider campaign against so-called stealth pay increases that see executives' pensions boosted more than ordinary workers.
Shareholders are set to vote on StanChart's 2019 pay policy at the lender's annual shareholder meeting in London.
The bank this year is planning to award Winters 474,000 pounds ($618,522.60) in pension allowance, up from 460,000 pounds the year before and on top of a fixed salary in cash and shares of 2.4 million pounds.
Glass Lewis advised voting against the bank's pay plans because it has failed to cap pension contributions as a percentage of base salary, instead calculating against a bigger total salary base, and that payouts to executives are in any case at risk of being excessive.
StanChart rival  Barclays  (LON:BARC) last week saw nearly 30 percent of votes cast against its executive pay plans at its annual shareholder meeting, and other firms including Ocado (LON:OCDO) Group and  Hammerson  Plc (LON:HMSO) have seen similar revolts.
While StanChart's shares have rallied this year, they are down 33 percent since Winters took over on June 10 2015, as the former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) banker's restructuring efforts took a toll on revenues.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd on Wednesday shut down its test version of global blockbuster ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" in China and shifted users to a similar, more patriotic video game which, unlike PUBG, has regulatory approval to generate revenue.
The Chinese video gaming leader has waited in vain for over a year for approval to earn money on PUBG via in-app purchases, having given the gory, South Korean-made game a socialist makeover to meet stringent government rules.
In a post on the game's official account on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, Tencent said it would end testing for PUBG. It also said it had launched an anti-terrorism-themed ""Game for Peace"", for which it gained monetization approval in April.
""With PUBG Mobile having around 70 million average daily active users in China now, we expect Game for Peace could potentially generate 8 billion yuan to 10 billion yuan ($1.18 billion to $1.48 billion) in annual revenue"", said analysts at China Renaissance.
Tencent shares were up about 2 percent in afternoon trade.
In a website statement, Tencent described Game for Peace as a tactical shooting game developed in-house which ""pays tribute to the blue sky warriors that guard our country's airspace"", in reference to the Chinese air force.
IHS Markit games analyst Cui Chenyu said user reviews indicated that Game for Peace was very similar to PUBG, a PC game from South Korea's Krafton, previously known as Bluehole. Tencent licensed PUBG in China and created a mobile version.
""It's almost exactly the same,"" she said. ""The game play, the background, the graphic design and the characters, they're almost the same.""
Some Weibo users said on starting Game for Peace, they found themselves at a place in the game that strongly resembled the place they left off in PUBG, complete with PUBG gaming history.
Tencent told Reuters ""they are very different genres of games"".
A spokeswoman for Krafton said the firm was looking into PUBG's status in China and declined to comment further.
Global game distributor Steam named PUBG one of its highest-grossing titles of 2018. On Wednesday, ""PUBG is gone"" was the one of most viewed topics on Weibo, with over 300 million clicks and close to 90,000 posts.
""I was scared to death,"" said one Weibo user of his feelings when he realized that PUBG had been shut down in China, explaining he had spent many nights to reach a certain level.
""But I didn't expect that once I updated it to Game of Peace it returned me back to the same level. The game changed its name and became very socialist to gain approval.""
Others commented on the absence of gore, which regulators have all but outlawed in new titles following a public outcry over perceived excess in video games.
""I'm going to die of laughter,"" said another Weibo user. ""When you shoot people, they don't bleed, and the dead get up and wave goodbye!""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese telco SoftBank Corp said on Wednesday it would spend $4 billion to up its stake in Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan Corp and turn the internet company into a subsidiary, a move that would help boost its profit by 24 percent this year.
The telco said it would buy 456.5 billion yen ($4.2 billion) worth of new shares to be issued by Yahoo Japan, increasing SoftBank Corp's stake to 45 percent from 12 percent.
With that addition, SoftBank Corp, which listed in December in Japan's largest-ever initial public offering, forecast its operating profit would rise to 890 billion yen in the current financial year through March 2020.
SoftBank Corp will buy the shares at 302 yen each, or a 2.3 percent discount to Wednesday's closing price. 
Separately on Wednesday, SoftBank Corp's parent SoftBank Group Corp said it would sell its 36 percent stake in Yahoo Japan back to the internet company.
The deal will strengthen cooperation between SoftBank Corp, Japan's third-largest telco, and Yahoo Japan, an internet heavyweight in areas such as news and shopping.
The closer relationship will help drive growth at shared ventures such as QR code payment app PayPay, SoftBank Corp Chief Executive Ken Miyauchi said at a news conference.
Concern over the outlook for Japan's telcos, which face government pressure to cut carrier fees as well as competition from new entrant Rakuten Inc, has kept SoftBank Corp shares below their IPO price. The stock closed up 0.6 percent ahead of the earnings.
Some analysts see the telco as well positioned to weather the price squeeze as it targets data-heavy smartphone users with premium-priced plans while offering low-cost options for thrifty customers under separate branding.
The telco reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter operating profit to 84.5 billion yen from a year earlier, even as revenue grew. The result missed the 93 billion yen average of three analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
SoftBank Corp, with its ample cashflow, is a key indicator of the health of parent SoftBank Group, which reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>",World shares near five-week low before make-or-break trade talks,"By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares held near five-week lows on Wednesday as renewed trade tensions and fears for the global economy drove investors into the safety of bonds and the Japanese yen, with the latter rising to a six-week high against the dollar.
European shares inched higher in an effort to shake off the gloom of dismal session in Asia and sharp slides on Wall Street, where the trade-sensitive industrial and technology sectors were hit especially hard by fears that a potential trade deal between the United States and China could unravel.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is due to visit Washington on Thursday and Friday for trade talks in a last-ditch bid to avert a sharp increase in tariffs on Chinese goods ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump.
MSCI's Asia-Pacific share index excluding Japan, fell almost one percent to touch its lowest level since late-March, while the pan-European EuroStoxx index was flat, clawing its way back from multi-week lows.
Markets are on tenterhooks given the importance of the talks to world growth, especially given the mixed nature of recent economic data from China.
""I think it's a major risk that Trump raises tariffs,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief strategist at the Market Securities brokerage in Paris. 
""If that happens we can imagine that negotiations will break down, implying another few months of uncertainty... All-in all, bonds as well as other safe-havens such as yen, look set to benefit from this situation in the short-term.""
Adding to market jitters was Chinese trade data showing solid imports but an unexpected fall in April exports. The numbers follow lackluster economic data in Europe and signs of steep inventory build-ups in the United States.
""Chinese exports were negative which suggests the world economy remains weak,"" Barraud said noting that the latest manufacturing surveys had painted a subdued picture of new export orders worldwide.
""As we saw with New Zealand today, central banks will remain tilted to the dovish side. They are trying to buy some kind of insurance against negative shocks.""
BONDS BENEFIT
New Zealand became the first country in the developed world to cut interest rates since the Fed turned tail on policy earlier this year, though other central banks, from Sweden to Canada have hinted at policy easing.
New Zealand's central bank governor Adrian Orr cited the U.S.-China trade dispute as a major risk for his country's economy.
The decision pushed the kiwi dollar to a six-month low, while government bonds jumped, sending yields 5-7 basis points lower across the curve. 
On currency markets, investors' demand for safe-havens boosted the Japanese yen which firmed 0.2 percent against the dollar at 110.07 yen, taking its gains to more than 1 percent this month.
Bonds too have benefited from the worries for growth and trade, with 10-year yields on U.S. Treasuries, German bunds and Japanese government bonds (JGBs) languishing at near one-month lows.
Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the bloc, hovered near five-week lows at -0.04 percent, not far from the 2-1/2 year low of -0.094 percent while Japan's 10-year yield burrowed deeper into negative territory and last stood at minus 0.055 percent.
There are concerns also for Germany, the euro zone's largest economy. While industrial output rose unexpectedly in March, the economy ministry warned that the outlook remained subdued.
The data also follows weak industrial orders figures, and a downward revision of euro zone growth by the European Commission . All that reinforces a weak backdrop for the euro zone economy and a perception that the European Central Bank will keep rates at record low levels for longer than expected.
While the growth gloom can be expected to weigh on commodity prices, oil prices were bolstered by U.S. sanctions on crude exporters Iran and Venezuela, supply cuts by producers and data showing a surge in Chinese crude imports,

Brent crude oil futures at $70.31 per barrel, 43 cents, or 0.6 percent above their last close.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",Occidental seen as a rare victory for hedge funds tracking corporate jets,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Hedge funds paying upward of $100,000 per year to track the flights of corporate jets were vindicated when Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) announced two deals last week that matched locations the U.S. oil and gas company's private plane had recently visited.
Yet Occidental's example may represent the exception rather than the rule.
Tracking corporate jets often fuels speculation that makes predicting where a company's next deal may come from harder rather than easier, according to several hedge fund analysts interviewed by Reuters. 
""Historically, flight tracking services have not been that useful,"" said one hedge fund analyst who asked not to be named because he was not permitted to speak with the media. ""But they hit two home runs back-to-back on Occidental, which makes them look pretty good right now.""
Research firm Gordon Haskett Research Advisors wrote a note on April 29 speculating that Warren Buffet's investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc may be preparing to invest in Occidental, citing data from Quandl, which tracks corporate jet flights and identified Occidental's plane as visiting Buffett's hometown of Omaha. 
The following day, Berkshire announced a $10 billion cash infusion into Occidental to back its $38 billion cash-and-stock offer for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
Last week, a flight by Occidental's jet to Paris preceded an announcement that Occidental planned to sell $8.8 billion worth of Anadarko's assets in Africa to  Total  SA (PA:TOTF).
Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the correlation between the deals and the routes of its corporate jets.
Flight tracking services have been gaining prominence, partly because they helped some hedge funds foresee Johnson & Johnson's $30 billion acquisition of drugmaker Actelion in 2017, but their track record before and after this success has been somewhat spotty.
Corporations can evade monitoring by hedge funds by scheduling deal-related meetings in locations where neither the target or acquirer are headquartered or by using jet leasing services like NetJets Inc - the luxury plane unit of Buffett's Berkshire - rather than flying their own private planes.
And even when hedge funds do dredge up usable data, there is no guarantee that a corporate flight out to a particular city means that the company intends to do a deal there. 

""We recently got excited when we saw that a company's jet was flying out to New York,"" one analyst said. ""Until we realized that they were holding an investor conference there that week, where we were already scheduled to meet with them.""

1017,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>","Foreigners turn sellers of China A-shares on worries over trade war, less stimulus","By Luoyan Liu and Noah Sin
SHANGHAI/Hong Kong (Reuters) - Foreign buying of Chinese stocks has slowed significantly since March and turned negative in April, as investors worried that Beijing is turning more cautious about further stimulus amid signs that the economy is starting to stabilize.
Uncertainty over Sino-U.S. trade talks have also played a part in shifting global appetite for Chinese equities, with the country's major indexes taking a beating this week after an unexpected escalation by Washington threw prospects for an agreement into doubt. 
Net flows into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets via the Stock Connect scheme totaled 4.4 billion yuan ($649.95 million) in March, down sharply from 60.4 billion yuan in February. 
In April, there were outflows of 18 billion yuan, snapping a five-month streak of inflows since November, 2018. 
The selling continued in May, with net outflows reaching about 11 billion yuan as of Wednesday, according to Refinitiv data. 
""For large international institutional investors, the return had been pretty satisfactory for the year. Therefore it was reasonable to take profit after 30-plus-percent return while the corporate earnings didn't support a further rally,"" Louis Lu, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at CSOP Asset Management.
Chinese markets had rallied earlier in the year on expectations of more stimulus for the cooling economy, and on signs that Beijing and Washington were making progress in talks to end their trade war.
But investors began to temper their policy easing views after surprisingly upbeat March data, though weak April readings suggest the economy is still trying to find its footing. 
Graphic: Shanghai stocks fall amid policy support, trade worries - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Lvcocx
China's stocks fell the most in more than 3 years on the first trading session of May, as investors scrambled to dump stocks amid a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade relations. 
U.S. President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on China on Sunday to reach a trade deal, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. 
""We don't see it an opportunity to buy on the dip because the risk of trade dispute escalation significantly increased after the Trump’s threat"", Lu added. 
Zhang Gang, an analyst with China Central Securities, said it was natural for foreign investors to reduce holdings after the robust rally early in the year, given uncertainties including the Sino-U.S trade talks, U.S.-EU trade tensions and Brexit.
""Foreigners chose to lock in gains, partly as they worried China's monetary policy could turn marginally conservative after upbeat data pointing to signs of economic recovery,"" said Yan Kaiwen, analyst with China Fortune Securities. 
Foreign capital inflows could return as China further opens up its capital markets, Yan said. 
Global index provider MSCI is quadrupling the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks later this year, a move it said might draw more than $80 billion of fresh foreign inflows to the world's second-biggest economy. 
The index provider will increase the inclusion factor of Chinese large-cap stocks to 20 percent from the current 5 percent in three steps, with increments of 5 percent in May, August and November.

Among sectors most sold by foreign investors were liquor makers and home appliance makers that had drawn most of the inflows earlier in the year. 
In particular, foreigners dumped China's leading liquor maker Wuliangye Yibin Co Ltd, even as the stock marched to a fresh high. 
According to HKEX, investors via the Stock Connect linking Shenzhen and Hong Kong held a total of 291.7 million shares at end-April, down dramatically from 431.9 million shares at end-February.

Investing.com --  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), Germany’s biggest - and staidest – conglomerate is enjoying a rare day in the sun on Wednesday, rising 4.3% after announcing an improvement in profit at its core industrial businesses in the three months to March.
But it’s not really the profit numbers that are catching the eye as much as the company’s announcement on Tuesday that it will spin off and sell down its stake in its gas and power operations, a division that has had a bad decade due to a collapse in emerging market demand since the 2008 crisis, and to the shift away from fossil fuel power to renewables in developed markets.
The move is the latest example of how Europe’s conglomerate is unlocking shareholder value by giving its various units more autonomy. It's a strategy that has seen it escape the fate of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) over recent years, even if the stock has hardly set the DAX alight with a rise of only 17%, compared to the index's 21%.
The spin-off of Gas and Power follows a path already trodden by Siemens’ lighting division Osram (DE:OSRn), its renewable energy division Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN), and most recently its healthcare division Healthineers AG (DE:SHLG), whose clunky name hasn’t stopped it rising 12% in the last year, while the DAX has fallen 6.1%.
Under plans announced on Tuesday, Siemens plans to sell its majority stake in the Gas and Power unit by September 2020.
“The new company won’t have to compete for resources with higher margin business like smart infrastructure and digital industries,” Reuters quoted Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser as telling reporters.
Kaeser was less forthcoming on Wednesday about the fate of Mobility, Siemens other strategically-challenged unit. Having failed to persuade the European Commission that it should be allowed to merge with France’s biggest rail group  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), it now faces an uncertain future. The company’s direction under Kaeser suggests it too will ultimately be spun off and listed to fend for itself.
Siemens' (DE:SIEGn) performance helped lift the DAX on Wednesday to be the top of the European leaderboard, with a 0.7% rise. It was also helped by a better-than-expected German industrial production number for March.
Elsewhere, the benchmark STOXX 600 index was up 0.2% at 382.46, rebounding after two days of losses caused by fresh concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was lagging the field, effectively unchanged, while the Italian FTSE MIB was up 0.1%."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.1 percent by 0730 GMT, reaching its lowest in more than four weeks and on course for its fifth decline in this month's six trading days. The blue-chip STOXX 50 rose 0.1 percent.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington on Thursday for two days of trade talks, in a bid to avoid increases in tariffs on Chinese goods that U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to impose. 
European stocks were also roiled by a European Commission decision on Tuesday to lower its forecasts for euro zone economic growth.
Germany's DAX outperformed after upbeat earnings reports and data that showed the country's industrial output rose unexpectedly in March.
Siemens climbed 3.6 percent on better-than-expected profit from its industrial business in the second quarter, as the German industrial group began separating and spinning off its struggling power and gas business.
Payments company Wirecard advanced after raising its profit outlook for 2019 as it tried to shake off allegations of fraud and false accounting.
Wirecard shares and Spain-based IT company Amadeus rose 4 percent after upbeat first-quarter results helped technology stocks gain the most among European sectors.
Britain's largest distributor of building materials,  Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK), was the top percentage gainer after reporting strong first-quarter results.
But German reinsurer Munich Re slid after reporting a 23 percent decline in net profit in the first quarter as a result of higher claims. 
Poste Italiane's slipped 3 percent on falling first-quarter profit as capital gains from government bond sales declined and costs rose.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>","Defying Brexit, Volvo car brand Polestar picks UK for new development hub","By Esha Vaish
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish luxury electric carmaker Polestar, which is jointly owned by Volvo Cars and its Chinese parent Geely, is setting up an R&D center in Britain to develop future passenger cars, it said on Wednesday.
The move comes as Britain's impending exit from the European Union has dented UK car manufacturing, prompting several carmakers to cut local production and warn that Brexit was deterring suppliers and EU workers.
Polestar, whose cars are known for their signature Polestar gold seat belts, said there were no special considerations about Brexit in making its decision as the move was more about tapping existing engineering expertise in the UK.
Polestar intends to initially employ 60 engineers in Britain and expand its team over the rest of the year.
""Polestar's role as a technology spearhead requires new and developing skills in low-volume, light-weight, multi-material performance car engineering. The UK operation will allow us to take the next steps towards our future cars,"" R&D head Hans Pehrson said in a statement.
A spokesman for the company, which hopes to offer its cars largely via a monthly subscription model that covers insurance and maintenance cost, declined to say what segments or models they were exploring.
The company is currently manufacturing its only hybrid, Polestar 1, in China, and unveiled its mass market sedan, Polestar 2, a competitor to Tesla's Model 3, earlier this year.
It has also promised the market an electric coupe-style SUV, Polestar 3, in 2021, just after the expected launch of Tesla's Model Y SUV, with both carmakers betting that mass market customers are on the verge of adopting battery technology.
The UK site, whose cost will be borne by Polestar, will be the marquee's first independent facility, with the company having so far relied on Volvo for its R&D capacity. 

The move comes as Volvo courts Chinese and U.S. tech investors to buy a stake in Polestar. Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson hopes it will valued at a tech multiple like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio rather than auto incumbents.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:01AM ET</span>","KPMG fined over defective audit of Co-op Bank, faces extra checks on audits","LONDON (Reuters) - Accounting giant KPMG has been fined and reprimanded by regulators over a defective audit of Britain's Co-op Bank and its audits of lenders will face additional checks for three years.
Britain's Financial Reporting Council said KPMG had been fined 5 million pounds ($6.5 million), reduced for a settlement to 4 million pounds.
KPMG audit partner Andrew Walker was also fined 125,000 pounds, discounted for settlement to 100,000 pounds, and reprimanded.
The penalties relate to a 2009 audit of the Co-op Bank shortly after its ill-fated merger with the Britannia Building Society, which pushed it to the brink of collapse.
The penalties come at a difficult time for Britain's big four accountancy firms - which also include PwC, Deloitte and EY - with regulators calling on their audit functions to be ringfenced from consultancy after a string of auditing failures on major firms including BHS and Carillion.
All KPMG's audit engagements with credit institutions for audits ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021 will be subject to an additional review by a separate KPMG audit quality team who will provide reports to the FRC, the regulator said.
KPMG will also pay 500,000 pounds towards the FRC's costs.
The FRC said KPMG and Walker both admitted their conduct fell significantly short of standards expected in assessing the fair value of Britannia's loan book.
The accountancy firm failed to obtain sufficient evidence and to exercise sufficient professional scepticism and failed to inform Co-op Bank the financial statements were not adequate. 
A spokesperson for KPMG said: ""We regret that some of our audit work around specific elements of the Bank's Fair Value Adjustments did not meet the appropriate standards
""The work in question was conducted almost a decade ago and we have significantly enhanced our procedures and training around the areas in question since then.""
After further years of tough trading Co-op Bank was rescued by a consortium of US hedge funds in 2017.

The lender separately reported first quarter results this morning, with a pre-tax loss of 28.6 million pounds for the first three months of 2019.

1023,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",Each Word of Trump's Tariff Tweets Wiped $13 Billion Off Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- It was a total of 102 words that erased about $1.36 trillion from global stocks this week.
Equity markets across the world were roiled by President Donald Trump’s tweets Sunday that he would boost tariffs on Chinese goods. Not only did they spark losses, but volatility came roaring back with a vengeance, with the Cboe Volatility Index rising 50 percent in two days to breach 20 for the first time since January.
Risks surrounding U.S.-China trade relations -- which were not on investors’ radar as late as last week -- came flooding back. Markets had been lulled into a state of complacency in recent weeks as confidence grew the trade discussions were going well, major central banks were dovish and U.S. corporate earnings were coming in better-than-expected.
“The latest shift adds a new dimension of uncertainty to what most market participants were assuming was a done deal,” said Eleanor Creagh, Sydney-based Australia market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “Something shifted over the weekend, and it could be wishful thinking to keep drinking from the glass half full.”
All 102 words that shook global markets:
Depending on who you talk to, the events of the last two days are only a speed bump that gave back a fraction of this year’s market rally or have raised a valid question of whether the bull market can continue.
Kerry Craig, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, still believes a trade deal can be reached, but it could take longer than expected. “The pull back in markets was due given how hard global equities had rallied and investors may have been looking for an excuse to take some profits,” he said.
Given the slump in shares, it’s clear some investors are repositioning.
“My feeling is that investors are lightening their portfolios as a precaution,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific.
Halley sees a “middle path” for markets with an underlying sentiment that a deal will get done. And, sparks of activity could lift growth and earnings expectations -- “I wouldn’t abandon the equity markets,” said JPMorgan’s Craig.
Furthermore, the dovish central bank pivot means its a different market now than last year when both the U.S. and China were tightening policy, according to Alex Wong, Hong Kong-based director of asset management at Ample Capital Ltd.
“Even if no deal could be reached, the impact won’t be that severe,” Wong said in a telephone interview. “I’m not that worried.”
Everything now depends on what happens this Thursday and Friday when negotiations between two of the world’s largest economies meet in Washington.
“This sets us up for a potentially very emotional week,” Oanda’s Halley said.

South Korean firms led the earnings downgrades this week, followed by China and the Philippines.

On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week and would ""soon"" target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs, prompting investors to dump risky assets on Monday.
The MSCI Asia-Pacific index has fallen 2.3 percent this week. Chinese equities were the biggest losers in the region with a decline of 5.6 percent, followed by Hong Kong and Singapore with each declining over 3 percent this week.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google business on Tuesday announced new privacy controls for its services, including “Incognito mode” for Google Maps, and published new privacy commitments for its hardware, showing how increased public scrutiny is forcing greater transparency in Silicon Valley.
The announcements were dotted throughout nearly two hours of product updates from the search giant at its annual Google I/O developers' conference. Google also launched its lowest priced smartphone yet, the Pixel 3a, and demonstrated upcoming capabilities for its virtual assistant, such as car rental and movie ticket bookings by voice commands.
Google has been fending off some of the growing legislative and regulatory pushes in the United States and elsewhere to regulate data privacy and other issues core to its business model. Proposals being weighed by lawmakers would limit how Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and other internet companies track consumers and distribute information.
With revenue growth slowing and costs largely growing, Alphabet has faced questions from investors about the threat of new rules and its ability to commercialize newer services such as the Google Assistant. 
Alphabet shares closed Tuesday down 1.2 percent to $1,178.86. They have fallen from an all-time high of $1,296.98 since the company reported quarterly sales last month that were $1 billion below expectations.
Incognito mode, which is launching on Google Maps ""soon"" and Google search later this year, would block the company from storing user activity in those services, the company said.
For home-based devices including smart speakers, thermostats and security alarms, Google on Tuesday published a new website with disclosures on how sensors such as microphones and cameras on those devices work. In addition, it committed to giving users the ability to review any sensor recordings and delete them.
Further, the company said it would not use ""video footage, audio recordings, and home environment sensor readings"" to personalize ads.
Other privacy announcements included more granular control starting later this year over how mobile apps for Google's Android operating system access location data.
""The central focus of the release is security and privacy,"" Stephanie Cuthbertson, director of product management for Android, said on stage.
NEW ASSISTANT OPTIONS
The car booking capability, which Google demonstrated on National Car Rental's website, builds on the company's push over the last two years to integrate more artificial intelligence-fueled features into its virtual helper, Google Assistant. 
It aims to free users from manually filling out forms on websites, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told the several thousand conference attendees. It will be available later this year on Android phones in the United States and United Kingdom, Google said. 
In an update to search, Google introduced augmented reality technology that enables users to view three-dimensional renderings of some visual results through their smartphone cameras. Google said it was working with companies such as New Balance,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Samsung (KS:005930) and Volvo to make 3D models of their products available in mobile search.
Google also brought Google Assistant to new products. Starting at $399, the Pixel 3a could help the company reverse flagging sales of more premium phones. 
It will be available in the U.S. in T-Mobile and Sprint stores for the first time in addition to Verizon (NYSE:VZ) outlets. AT&T (NYSE:T), the fourth major wireless carrier, has declined to stock it, people familiar with the matter said.
Google said it would re-brand all of its ""Home"" hardware as ""Nest,"" reflecting the thermostat maker it purchased in 2014. 
The Google Nest Hub Max, a larger version of Google's smart speaker with a display, will arrive later this year, the company announced. Priced at $229, the Max will include a camera with facial recognition technology to activate the device without a voice command. 

That camera sensing feature will not send imagery to Google's servers once it is set up, Google said on its new privacy website.

But as Uber slashed incentives, Raut's earnings dwindled swiftly. His income dropped to about $540 a month this year and he defaulted on his taxi loan payments. Deciding after an accident that he couldn't afford to fix the vehicle, he quit Uber and now his monthly income, from a new job driving a truck, has crashed to $200.
""There is no benefit in driving for Uber ... my life was much better just as a cook,"" said 26-year-old Raut.
Former Uber India executives say incentives were sharply cut in early 2017 because of growing pressure from the U.S. head office to improve financial performance ahead of an initial public offering (IPO), which values it at as much as $90 billion. Uber is set to debut on Friday on Wall Street.
In interviews in the metropolises of Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru, more than 35 drivers said discontent against Uber was growing.
Mounting debt from taxi loans was a key concern. Many drivers took loans to buy cabs, while some leased cars from the companies themselves. 
To be sure, many drivers from Uber are still earning more than they could get in other blue-collar jobs in India. The national minimum wage in India is only about $2.50 a day.
""It's not that we are making a fortune, but it does give us a livelihood,"" said Prakash K.C., who earns around 38,000 rupees ($548) a month driving an Uber in Bengaluru city.
Uber has acknowledged the risk of unhappiness among its drivers. ""As we aim to reduce driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect driver dissatisfaction will generally increase,"" it said in its IPO filing.
DOUBLING DOWN ON INDIA
Uber currently operates in 40 Indian cities and the country accounts for an estimated 11 percent of its global rides.
Uber said last year it would double down on India investments after it sold its Southeast Asia business to Singapore's Grab Holdings. Grab does not operate taxis in India.
Uber started its India operations in 2013, three years after local rival Ola launched a ride-hailing service. Both are backed by Japan's Softbank Group Corp. Ola, which operates in 125 cities in India, last year said it plans to go public in four years.
Both gave attractive cash incentives to drivers and offered very low fares to riders when they started operations.
It wasn't uncommon for Uber drivers to boast of monthly earnings of 100,000 rupees, which is the typical salary of a junior multinational executive in the country. 
There were perks too. In a January 2017 company video, Uber drivers are seen entering a luxury hotel in northern Chandigarh city, where guards open their taxi doors and welcome them. Sitting and smiling with their families in a large hall with chandeliers, some of the drivers receive prizes such as an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, holiday package and a car.
In early 2017, the company slashed incentives by around 30 percent overnight, said three former Uber India executives, who declined to be named.
The total incentive cut in recent years may well be far higher: research firm RedSeer Consulting estimates online taxi operators driver incentives, as a percentage of gross booking totals, fell from 60 percent in 2015 to 18 percent last year.
That came at a time when prices of diesel, used in many taxis in India, surged by about 30 percent.
One of the former Uber executives told Reuters the company should have taken more care as drivers were its most important stakeholder. The decision to cut incentives sharply had disappointed several members of Uber's India team back then, the executive added.
LOWER INCENTIVES
Last October, hundreds of drivers went on strike in Mumbai and New Delhi, demanding higher fares to meet rising fuel costs. Drivers say they ended the strike as taxi firms assured some fare concessions, but more needs to be done.
Some Uber drivers in the United States and Britain have called for a strike on Wednesday in protest against what they call low pay.
An Uber spokesman told Reuters drivers were at the heart of its service and the company was committed to ensuring drivers get sustainable earnings, even though some were making less than they did three years ago.
""Uber continues to invest heavily in the well being of drivers and their families,"" the spokesman said, adding it was helping them access life and health insurance, as well as loans.
Ola did not respond to a request for comment.
To mark its IPO, Uber says it plans to pay $300 million to more than 1.1 million drivers, a so-called ""appreciation reward"". Qualified drivers in the United States, Uber said in its filing, will get $100 to $10,000 based on trips taken.
The Uber spokesman said thousands of drivers in India earned the reward, but did not provide an exact number. A driver in New Delhi showed his Uber app that said he had received an $84 reward, while another in the city, Arvind Kumar, received $165.

""There are a lot of troubles, this amount is nothing ... all my dreams are broken,"" said Kumar, who earns half the $1,432 per month he made five years ago. He said the drop in earnings had scuttled plans to provide his children with private-school education.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 03:16AM ET</span>","In Canada, a little-known drug regulator shows its teeth","By Allison Martell and Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - A tiny, little-known government agency is ramping up regulation of Canada's pharmaceutical industry, seeking to rein in prices for patented drugs that are among the highest in the world, according to industry sources and a Reuters analysis of government data.
The federal Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) is targeting an increasing number of expensive drugs, including a rare-disease medication made by Horizon Pharma that can cost C$325,000 ($253,409) a year, documents reviewed by Reuters shows. 
The agency can challenge the list price of any patented drug in Canada and order companies to repay some revenue. Data show the number of open PMPRB investigations into potentially overpriced drugs has more than doubled since 2013, reaching 122 as of March 2018. 
(See graphic on escalating enforcement actions here https://tmsnrt.rs/2LuY5og) 
New proposed regulations could enhance the PMPRB's powers and help set a broader agenda for taming prices in Canada. 
This shift toward greater regulation - years in the making but not always so visible - could hurt pharmaceutical revenues in Canada and has alarmed drugmakers. But it could benefit private drug plans and provincial governments and help patients with out-of-pocket costs.
In addition, although Canada is a relatively small market for major drugmakers, lower prices in Canada could spread into the U.S. market, experts say. Washington is considering a proposal to base some drug prices on the cost of medicines in other developed nations. 
Cross-border sales could also put pressure on U.S. prices for patented drugs, which lead the world and well exceed even Canada's. Some American patients already buy prescription drugs illicitly from Canada, and last year the U.S. Food and Drug Administration created a working group to study legalizing some wholesale imports. 
The pharmaceutical industry's main lobby group in Canada, Innovative Medicines Canada, has argued that the changes, if approved by the cabinet of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, could delay or limit Canadians' access to new patented medicines. Reuters reported in February that drug companies offered to give up C$8.6 billion($6.4 billion) in revenue over 10 years to head off the PMPRB reforms.
Last month, the U.S. Trade Representative said in a report that it was closely monitoring the reform effort, noting it ""would significantly undermine the marketplace for innovative pharmaceutical products.""
Drugmakers around the world are under pressure as governments and insurers grapple with skyrocketing drug prices, especially the United States.
Stephen Frank, president of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, said changes at the PMPRB reflect a broader willingness to tackle drug prices.
""There's a momentum and an energy around becoming more engaged on pricing issues,"" he said. ""There's many layers to this, that have sort of aligned to give them the space they need to try and be more active.""
UNUSUAL AGENCY
From its founding in 1987, the PMPRB was an unusual agency. With a budget of C$15.4 million and approved staff of 83, it is one of the smallest federal departments in Canada. By comparison, the National Film Board employs about 400.
Healthcare is generally a provincial responsibility in Canada, but the PMPRB draws its power from federal patent law. Instead of bargaining drug prices down, it can declare some to be an illegal abuse of patent rights. It caps prices paid by private as well as public plans. The agency's cases are most often settled out of court. 
Its size belies its importance. Canada's universal healthcare system does not cover most patented - or generic - prescription drugs, which are paid for by more than 1,000 public and 100,000 private, employer-sponsored drug plans as well as patients themselves.
Executive Director Douglas Clark, who took over in 2013, said he believes the rise in investigations has been driven more by the escalating prices set by pharmaceutical companies than by his agency's toughened stance.
But the agency could soon gain more muscle. The reform proposal, shepherded by federal regulator Health Canada, would allow PMPRB to figure in the effectiveness of drugs and what Canadian governments can afford when determining whether costs are excessive.
Announced in 2017, the rules were scheduled to take effect in January but have been delayed as the government reviews feedback. 
There is no guarantee the reforms will proceed, especially given the uncertainty of federal election results in the fall. But even if they are shelved, Clark said, his agency has some ability to change pricing guidelines on its own. 
""We don't have the same maneuverability if we don't have regulatory change, but we'll make the best of what scope we have,"" he said. 
PUNCHING ABOVE ITS WEIGHT?
The PMPRB is already taking on some of the drug industry's big players.
The agency recently targeted Horizon Pharma, for instance, deeming its drug Procysbi, tagged at C$325,000, excessively priced.
Health Canada approved the drug in 2017 to treat a genetic disorder known as cystinosis, which afflicts about 100 Canadians. Without treatment, the condition causes irreversible kidney damage. 
The federal approval essentially elbowed out a far cheaper alternative drug, making it difficult for patients to get. 
Horizon argued that its medication was superior, that the$180 million it spent on research and development justified the price and that patients unable to afford Procysbi were able to get it on discount or for free. 
Sales in the United States and Canada were $154.9 million in 2018. 
In January, PMPRB sought to force the company to reduce Procysbi's list price by at least 71 percent. The agency argued that the current price was so much higher than the similar alternative drug - listed at around C$25,000 - that PMPRB should set aside its usual guidelines, based largely on what is charged internationally.
Horizon is fighting back, saying in a recent statement that PMPRB wants the drug to sell at ""a small fraction of the lowest price in the world."" The matter is set for hearings and could be decided in federal court.
But in the end, said Joel Lexchin, a University of Toronto professor and pharmaceutical policy expert, the problem of escalating drug prices won't be settled by individual showdowns with drug makers over specific drugs. A broader approach - like the new proposed regulations - is needed, he said. 
""We can't really keep going with these one-offs,"" he said. ""We need a general policy.""

1032,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2019 02:50AM ET</span>","Dimon Says Yields ‘Extraordinarily Low,’ 4% Wouldn’t Be Bad","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon repeated his warning about the need to prepare for higher Treasury yields, despite their retreat since he said last August they could surpass 5 percent.
“People tend to forecast a little bit of a change, and sometimes it’s a huge inflection point which people almost never capture,” Dimon said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing. “When I talk to my board, we’ve got to be able to handle 5 percent, 7 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent because you don’t know.”
While refraining from a year-end forecast for 10-year U.S. yields, Dimon said that “4 percent when you are having fairly good growth is not a bad number.” The current level -- 2.46 percent in midday trading in Tokyo -- “is extraordinarily low.”
Central banks’ purchases of government debt “had to have an effect on the 10-year” yield, he said, though the Federal Reserve has now reversed its quantitative easing some. Even the Bank of Japan may one day need to follow suit, he said.
When Dimon cautioned last year that yields could head toward 5 percent or more, the Fed was still projecting a series of interest-rate hikes for 2019. That all changed after market turmoil in the fourth quarter of 2018 helped persuade the central bank to shift to a patient stance on rates.
Wait and See
“There’s nothing wrong with wait and see for the Fed” at this point, Dimon said. “But growth has been good and they’ve got to react.”
The banker said it may be better for Fed officials to ditch projections entirely for the policy rate, given that they must always be “data dependent,” keying decisions off of the latest indicators and outlook.
He said officials also need to think about whether the quantitative easing they deployed from 2008 to 2014 was really effective, and what its long-term impact will be. Along with considering the effect of regulatory changes, “they’ll end up in the right place,” he predicted.
Trade Tensions
Dimon played down concerns about the latest sell-off in stocks in response to U.S.-China trade tensions. “I never worry that much about it. The market’s always going to be reacting to different things.”
Read more here about Dimon’s comments on the trade tensions.
“If you just raised the odds of a real global trade war a little bit,” then the declines in equities this week were a “rational reaction,” Dimon said. If the talks were to go “really south,” it would hit world growth, said Dimon, who still estimated 80 percent odds of a bilateral deal.
“It would be a huge mistake for American policy to be set based on the stock market,” he added.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 12:48AM ET</span>",Chinese investment in U.S. startups peaks but 'tremendous uncertainty' ahead,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chinese investors maneuvered around heightened geopolitical tensions to make record-level investments into U.S. startups in 2018, but increasingly hostile conditions will likely lead to a dropoff in Chinese funding for this year, according to a new report.
Chinese entities invested $3.6 billion last year in U.S. companies, exceeding the previous record of $2.8 billion in 2015, although the number of deals dipped to about 270 from more than 300, according to the report from New York-based economic research firm Rhodium Group.
The robust investment comes despite policy headwinds from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has levied tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and penalized telecoms companies Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763), which the United States accuses of spying. The report's findings show the amplified role China has taken in the U.S. startup industry, even as it confronts a new U.S. law to limit access to bleeding edge technology. 
The law ""could yet have a chilling effect on future investment,"" the report cautioned.
The new law, known as FIRRMA, expanded the powers of an obscure government group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to probe transactions previously excluded from its purview, including attempts by foreigners to purchase minority stakes in U.S. startups.
CFIUS began applying the law in November through a pilot program, and its effect would not be fully captured by the Rhodium report, which covers all of 2018. The government set a deadline to fully implement FIRRMA and clear up a number of ambiguities early next year. 
""I think the immense uncertainty about what the rules mean, the interpretation, how they are going to enforce it, what enforcement looks like, all of that produces a situation where it wouldn't be surprising if the effect so far seems modest,"" said Stephen Heifetz, a former member of CFIUS and now a lawyer advising companies undergoing CFIUS review. 
Chinese investors, including big family offices, have walked away from transactions and stopped taking meetings with U.S. startups, Reuters has reported. The opacity of venture capital, a business with few required disclosures and layers of funds to conceal the source of money, makes it difficult to quantify the precise level of Chinese investment.
Rhodium estimates that Chinese entities have poured about $14 billion into U.S. startups since 2000, with 80 percent of the deals occurring since 2014. 
But the report cautions ""tremendous uncertainty"" for Chinese investment this year and points to ""notable shifts within investor mix and targeted industries and technologies since FIRRMA's passage.""
Investments from Chinese state-owned investors had all but disappeared by February of this year, according to Rhodium. In mid-2018, there were about five such deals each month. These investors, which are controlled by the Chinese government, would likely find it impossible to get approval for an investment in a U.S. company building sensitive technology, attorneys say.
Also, Chinese venture capitalists have tried to steer clear of the technology CFIUS is closely probing, such as artificial intelligence, data analytics and cyber security. Roughly 40 percent of the Chinese VC deals last year went to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the report says.
However, that area could soon prove challenging for Chinese financiers, as CFIUS is ramping up its scrutiny of foreign biotech investments, said James Lewis, a defense and technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
The economic slowdown in China adds further complications, causing some Chinese venture firms to fold and other investors to pull back on their overseas spending. 

""There is tremendous uncertainty for the remainder of 2019,"" the report says.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 10:41PM ET</span>","Nestle, rivals vie for big baby formula prize in China's smaller cities","By Martinne Geller and Pei Li
LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nestle plans to launch a new line of baby formula in China this year under an existing brand, targeted at smaller cities, as the world's largest packaged food company tries to lengthen its lead in the world's biggest baby milk market.
The new line, discussed exclusively with Reuters, will focus on smaller provincial cities, often in China's western provinces, where greater shipping distances and lower incomes can make some imported brand goods unaffordable, though wealth there is growing. 
Producers of many consumer staples such as soft drinks and soap had to seek growth in the less-profitable provincial cities years ago, as China's richer eastern markets matured.
But the baby milk units of Nestle, France's Danone and Reckitt Benckiser enjoyed years of prosperity mainly just targeting parents in big cities like Shanghai and Beijing, banking on their appetite for ever-pricier premium formulas and foreign brands following a domestic 2008 tainted milk scandal.
Slowing growth has now made geographic expansion crucial, and new distribution models have made it easier.
The big catch, however, is the intense competition and logistical hurdles they will encounter in China's $25 billion baby formula market as they run up against local players who dominate in the smaller cities - challenges that mirror those faced by Western brands across China's consumer goods sector.
Liu Yufeng, a 23-year-old small business owner from Baoding city, in central Hebei province, chooses a brand made by Chinese company Bright Dairy to feed her 2-year-old daughter. She told Reuters she leans toward local brands because she feels they are more affordable and suitable for her baby's make-up.
She is not alone. Some 55 percent of respondents in a survey by the User Research Institute of BabyTree, China's leading parenting website operator, said domestic brands better understood Chinese consumers.
""This reflects a broader trend that indicates local brands are gaining traction among consumers in China,"" said Wang Lei, head of the institute.
Chinese retail sales of baby formula grew 9 percent last year, according to Euromonitor International. That is down from nearly 17 percent growth in 2014, the year after China relaxed its one-child policy. Yet the scale of the country, with more than 15 million births last year, and consumers' preoccupation with quality, means it is still by far the world's most important market for baby formula. 
FOREIGN VS LOCAL
When Zhang Yanyan, a 36-year-old civil servant from Zibo city in the central province of Shandong, needs to formula feed her 8-month-old baby, she uses a version of German brand Bebivita.
""I buy foreign-made infant formula, but not ones that are original imports. Given that the make-up of Chinese children is different to foreign children, I've chosen to buy foreign-made infant formula aimed at Chinese children,"" she said. 
That balance of international brand trust and local tailoring is what Nestle is aiming for with its new line. 
It will come under the umbrella of one of its three existing Chinese brands - Illuma, S-26 and NAN - but will be marketed differently, Thierry Philardeau, head of its infant nutrition business, said in an interview.
He did not give details but noted that adaptations in distribution and marketing would make the ""sub-brand"" more appropriate for its target audience.
Marketers and other businesses unofficially classify China's cities into tiers based on differences in business opportunity, infrastructure, population size, income level and consumer behavior and sophistication. 
The major metropolises of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are traditionally seen as Tier 1 cities, with the following tiers made up of smaller, fast-growing cities that still boast of millions of inhabitants. 
Such lower-tier cities, accounted for 47 percent of the baby formula market 15 years ago, Nestle's Philardeau said, but 73 percent today.
""People have more money to spend there and are catching up with the rest of China,"" he said. But because of different consumer demographics, he said the tone of the new line's marketing would be simpler, though the product's quality and sophistication would be comparable.
""They are ready to pay a high price, but they need a more consumer-friendly communication, slightly less scientific, simpler,"" he said.
Sub-brands are a common tactic used by marketers to take advantage of the cachet of a premium brand while selling something more affordable. In China, they are often used in lower-tier cities or rural areas, along with smaller package sizes, to make products that are more affordable.
Nestle's new range, which will include products for babies of various ages, will be made at factories in China, though the company did not say where the milk would come from.
Because of consumers' unique concerns around safety and quality, baby formula is much more expensive in China than in Europe. One 800 g (28 ozs) can of baby formula in China tends to cost north of $30, while a similar can costs $13 in Britain.
Adam Xu, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants in Shanghai, said though willingness to pay high prices for baby formula was universal in China, the growth of quality national players - encouraged by the government - was making life harder for premium Western brands. 
LOCAL CHAMPIONS
Chinese formula makers, which include Feihe International, China Mengniu Dairy and Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group, have grown stronger, amid a host of marketplace shifts including government registration requirements implemented last year that dramatically reduced the number of brands on the market.
At the same time, investments by domestic players in premium brands and special formulations are helping to overcome safety concerns, said analysts at Citi Research. They predict Chinese brands could reach 53 percent market share by 2022, up from 40 percent in 2015. That is because in an overall market expected to grow about 7 percent, they see domestic brands growing 11 percent and foreign brands growing only 4 percent.
Yili Group, China's largest dairy company and maker of the fifth-largest baby formula brand, told Reuters it was working on various fronts to improve its product offering through more scientific research, as well as its route to market using big data, artificial intelligence and real-time analysis. 
LETTING OTHERS DRIVE
Multinational consumer goods companies have historically employed their own sales forces in China to service retailers, a model that is inefficient for smaller cities, said Derek Deng, a partner at management consultants Bain & Co in Shanghai.
""It works fine in Tier 1, 2 cities because the density of sales is high,"" Deng said. ""But when you go into lower-tier cities, you are facing a lot of difficulties."" 
That is why local players tend to use third-party distributors, he said, noting that foreign firms were following suit, forming partnerships with big distributors and online players such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com Inc. 
Analysts see Nestle as having the best distribution potential of its peers, since its massive scale means it has a range of goods to sell and with which to fill trucks headed for distant locales.
The Swiss firm generated 7 billion Swiss francs ($6.87 billion) of sales in greater China last year, nearly 8 percent of its total, selling everything from Nescafe coffee to Yinlu peanut milk.
Nonetheless, it needs to adapt. Philardeau said Nestle was also boosting its presence on online platforms such as Alibaba.

Partnerships with online players have allowed British rival Reckitt Benckiser to enter 250 new Chinese cities in less than a year, compared with the more than 18 months it might have taken to enter 100 with its traditional feet-on-the-ground model. A deal with JD.com sees the e-commerce giant deliver Reckitt's goods to specialist mom-and-baby stores, where parents can pick them up, within 24 hours.

1037,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2019 10:40PM ET</span>",Starbucks's Chinese Rival Markets IPO at Discount to Peers,"(Bloomberg) -- Luckin Coffee Inc. quickly grew to become China’s second-biggest coffee chain with generous promotions that made its brews much cheaper than  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). Now it’s also selling stock at a discount to rivals.
The price range for Luckin’s initial public offering values the company at 9 times to 10.2 times the company’s estimated 2021 earnings, assuming a so-called greenshoe option is exercised. That’s less than half the valuation of Starbucks, which trades at 22.5 times that year’s forecast profit.
Luckin also looks cheaper than Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., whose closing price Tuesday translates into 21.3 times on that basis. Gourmet Master Co., which owns the 85°C bakery and cafe chain, is trading at 13.7 times in Taipei, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The lower valuation could be due to Luckin’s short track record -- it only started operations in October 2017. While it had 2,370 stores at the end of March, it’s continuing to spend on growth and hasn’t yet turned profitable. Luckin made a net loss of 572.8 million yuan ($85 million) for the three months ended March, more than quadruple the same period a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing. Net revenues surged 37-fold to 478.5 million yuan.
Luckin’s IPO price range implies an enterprise value of 1.36 times to 1.56 times its estimated 2020 sales, including the greenshoe option, the deal terms show. It’s seeking to raise as much as $510 million from the base offering.
The company operates a cashier-less business, where customers place orders from a mobile app and pay with electronic wallets. Luckin calls it a “technology-driven new retail model,” as it gathers customer behavior from the app and relies more on smaller pick-up stores instead of the streetfront locations with expansive seating offered by Starbucks.

1038,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2019 10:34PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Down Amid Trade War Fears,"Investing.com - Asian markets resumed slide on Wednesday in Asia as traders become increasingly concerned there might be no trade deal between the U.S. and China by Friday as previously expected.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component slipped 0.5% and 0.1% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.8%.
Japan’s Nikkei slumped 1.5%, while South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 0.1%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 declined 0.4%.
News on the Sino-U.S. trade front continued to dominate headlines today. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is travelling to Washington to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. on Thursday and Friday, according to a statement on the Chinese Ministry of Commerce website. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will attend the talks.
Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said China is considering retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through with his threat to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Some analysts previously expected the two sides could sign a trade deal as soon as this Friday, but hopes of that happening were cast into doubt after Trump surprised Chinese officials by saying he planned to raise the tariff on Chinese goods from the current 10% to 25% because talks were “moving too slowly.”
Officials from the U.S. also blamed China for backtracking on committing to certain legal changes that are keys to selling the deal domestically, Bloomberg reported citing sources with knowledge to the matter.
In an interview with Bloomberg, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said she thought the U.S. and China were close to an agreement. “We hope that is still the case but today rumors, tweets and comments are not very favorable,” she said.
“The tariff war is not in China’s interest but it’s also not in U.S.’s interest. So the sooner the two governments put the trade war behind us, the better,” Victor Gao of the Center for China and Globalization told CNBC in an interview.
“China needs an agreement with the United States, and I think the United States also needs an agreement with China. Uncertainty, unpredictability and the prospect of greater turmoil will be a killer for both countries.”"
1039,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2019 10:10PM ET</span>",Stock-Market Slump Threatens to Spoil China Tech Board Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- A sell-off in Chinese stocks threatens to take the fizz out of one of the country’s biggest capital market reforms in years.
Sentiment has soured just as China plans to open a Nasdaq-style board, expected as soon as June. After surging at the start of the year, the Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled more than 11 percent from an April high. It suffered its biggest loss since 2016 on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports. Worst still, given the nature of the new board, the ChiNext gauge of tech stocks fell even harder.
“The slump in the stock market will definitely impact progress of the new tech board,” said Jiang Liangqing, a Beijing-based fund manager at Ruisen Capital Management. “If the Shanghai benchmark falls below the year’s low, it might be a serious problem and may even lead a postponement of the board.”
Neither China’s securities regulator nor the Shanghai stock exchange immediately responded to requests for comment.
It’s not the first time that China’s reform efforts have encountered bumps in the road. The equity market rout last year -- when $3 trillion was wiped from the market after it hit a January high -- derailed plans for China depositary receipts, while proposals for another listing venue for so-called strategic emerging industries went south in 2016.
China is introducing the Science and Technology Innovation Board to encourage its innovative firms to list at home. Its rules are more closely aligned with global bourses, and regulators have waived restrictions on how companies are priced when they list. They’ve also limited access for retail investors who dominate the country’s equity markets.
China’s Plan to Lure Big Tech Listings Back Home: QuickTake
Jiang said the restrictions on access are a concern because companies may find it difficult to attract demand from institutional investors as the market sours.
“The new board mainly focuses on technology companies, which are more vulnerable to market fluctuations compared to more established businesses,” Jiang said. “Some issuers may raise less money than planned or even fail to get deals done.”
China’s New Nasdaq Is for Traders Who Want to Experiment
Mark Huang, an analyst at Bright Smart Securities in Hong Kong, said the board’s prospects could be alright if the market stays in a “reasonable range.” Chinese stocks staged a mini recovery Tuesday, but fell again on Wednesday with both of the Shanghai Composite and the ChiNext dropping 1 percent as of 10:04 a.m. local time.
“Technology startups are driven significantly by valuations, which are mainly affected by liquidity and risk appetite,” Huang said. “Pay attention to events that may impact those, as well as economic data.”
Chinese Startup DouYu Said to Delay IPO Launch on Trade Jitters
China is scheduled to release April trade figures on Wednesday and then inflation and money supply data in the following days. Export growth is forecast to slow to 3 percent from a year earlier compared with an increase of 14.2 percent in March.
State-backed Securities Times, in a commentary Tuesday, said steady progress had been made since Shanghai stock exchange started accepting listing applications in March, though it also called for patience.
“This is a major reform, so China must try its best to ensure the launch of the new board,” said Sun Zheng, an analyst at China Development Bank Securities Co. “It is possible there will be some fine-tuning, but the pace is unlikely to be affected. This is a political task.”

1040,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 08:27PM ET</span>","Lyft sees 'peak losses' this year, says ride hailing has path to profit","By Alexandria Sage and Vibhuti Sharma
SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Ride services company  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc forecast that its losses would peak this year as it controlled expenses and got more revenue from each customer, posting a $1.1 billion quarterly loss on Tuesday, days ahead of rival Uber's IPO.
""We are encouraged by our strength of our core business and see a clear path to profitability in ride sharing,"" said Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts, sparking a short-lived bump in shares that subsequently pared gains. 
Lyft promised profit in ride-hailing services without giving any timeline, but it previously had warned regulators it may never make money overall as it invests heavily in self-driving cars, renting scooters and other ventures.
As ferocious growth slows at Lyft and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, investors are paying more attention to what the companies need to do to make a profit.
Investors appeared uncertain how to interpret the company's performance, with shares moving up and down after the bell. Since Lyft's IPO on March 29, shares had fallen 23%. 
The report, Lyft's first as a public company, showed revenue nearly doubled for the quarter ended in March but forecast that growth would slow to 52% to 53% for the full year. Lyft is watched as a bellwether for Uber, which will price its offering on Thursday. 
Lyft said it was getting more revenue per customer, reducing incentives and boosting margins, although investments in areas such as self-driving, scooters and bikes were masking improvements in its core business.
New technology to match drivers and riders, and higher-priced rides in luxury vehicles were helping boost margins, it said. Lyft said its adjusted EBITDA margin improved to negative 28% from negative 60% a year ago.
The company, which says it has nearly 40% of the U.S. ride-hailing market, said increased demand helped push revenue to $776 million in the quarter, above analysts' average estimate of $739.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
A second-quarter revenue forecast of $800 million to $810 million was ahead of analysts' expectations of $783.1 million. The low end would amount to a revenue increase of 58%, however, far short of the growth Lyft has enjoyed recently. 
Last year's second-quarter revenue got a boost from a price hike, making this year's comparison more challenging, Lyft said. 
Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell called the results ""pretty strong,"" with hints that Lyft was continuing to take market share from Uber. He cautioned, however, that Lyft's outlook did suggest ""a meaningful slowdown in revenue.""
""The question will be whether this is just conservatism, Uber starting to fight back, or the company hitting tougher comps,"" Cordwell added.
In a snub to Uber, Lyft also announced a partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo in which Lyft will deploy 10 self-driving vehicles around the Arizona city of Phoenix by the third quarter. Uber has welcomed Waymo cars on its network but has not signed any deals. 
For its second quarter, Lyft forecast an expected adjusted EBITDA loss of $270 million to $280 million.
Lyft posted revenue of $37.86 from each of its 20.5 million active riders during the first quarter, a 34% increase in revenue and a 46% increase in riders over the same period in 2018.
A net loss widened to $1.14 billion, or $48.53 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $234.3 million, or $11.69 per share, a year earlier. Stock-based compensation and payroll tax made up $894 million of that amount. 

Last year, Lyft had 30.7 million riders and 1.9 million drivers in more than 300 cities in the United States and Canada. In comparison, Uber - which could be valued at about $90 billion - had 75 million riders and 3.9 million drivers in 65 countries.

Tinder, which according to recent reports accounts for about two-thirds of Match's overall valuation, reported 4.7 million average subscribers in the quarter, 1.3 million higher than last year.
Recent new campaigns at Tinder, which has made ""swipe left"" and ""swipe right"" a point of pop culture conversations, have helped the app raise engagement, Match said.
Average subscribers for the company increased to 8.6 million in the quarter, up 16 percent.
Revenue for the three months ended March 31 rose about 14 percent to $464.6 million, slightly better than the average analyst expectation of $463.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $123 million, or 42 cents per share, from $99.7 million, or 33 cents a year ago.
Analysts on average had estimated earnings of 32 cents, according to data from Refinitiv IBES. 
Income for the quarter included an income tax benefit of $28 million, the company said.
Match's average revenue per user, excluding effects of foreign exchange, was also up 4 percent at $0.60.
For the second quarter, the company expects revenue to be between $480 million and $490 million, almost in-line with the midpoint with Wall Street's expectation of $485.5 million.
Match expects trends at Tinder to remain consistent in the second quarter. On the back of its performance in the first half, the app is expected to add over a million average subscribers in 2019.

The company also forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to be between $190 million and $195 million, above analysts' average estimate of $185.7 million.

1042,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2019 05:32PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1.  Disney  Gets Endorsements Ahead of Earnings
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports earnings after the bell tomorrow, and things are looking good for the company going into its results.
Its movie business is riding high from the unprecedented success of “Avengers: Endgame”, which has brought in more than $600 million at the domestic box office alone.
It’s also getting a vote of confidence from the sell-side community.
BMO Capital Markets boosted its price target on the stock today to $170 from $140, citing expected strength in its Star Wars theme park attractions, which open this year, and streaming service Disney+, which launches in November.
And Imperial Capital raised its target to $147 from $139.
On average, analysts expect that Disney earned $1.57 per share, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Revenue is seen coming in around $14.5 billion. Disney shares are up 21.7% on the year, sixth among the 30 Dow stocks.
Before the bell tomorrow, restaurant chain Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) and BJ's Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) will issue quarterly results.
2. Draghi to Speak as ECB Issues Minutes
Central banks look to have the most economic influence on the market tomorrow.
The European Central Bank will issue the minutes of its last rate-setting meeting at 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT).
At the same time, ECB President Mario Draghi will speak.
Draghi warned about downside risks to the euro zone economies when the ECB kept rates on hold in April.
At 8:30 AM ET, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin and Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard will be appearing at a Richmond Fed community listening session.
The session is “to review the strategy, tools and communication practices it uses to pursue its congressionally-assigned mandate of maximum employment and price stability.”
3. U.S. Crude Stockpiles to Rise for Third-Straight Week?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report due Wednesday will likely provide a timely distraction as fears that the U.S. may increase tariffs on China have dominated direction.
U.S. Crude oil futures fell 1.4% lower at $61.40 a barrel today.
U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer on Tuesday accused China of backtracking on commitments in trade talks and reaffirmed President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%.
The hike on tariffs would come into effect on Friday at 12:01 AM ET (04:01 GMT), Lighthizer suggested.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released its data. While not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report, it often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels. API numbers showed crude stockpiles rose by 2.806 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a build in crude stockpiles of 1.215 million barrels for the week ended May 3, which would mark the third-weekly build in crude stockpiles.
U.S. weekly production, which remains at a record of 12.3 million barrels a day, will likely also attract attention."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1.79%, the S&P 500 lost 1.65%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.96%. The loss was the biggest for the Dow since Jan. 3. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their worst days since March 22.
Lighthizer stoked U.S.-China trade war fears, sending the broader market into a steep decline after suggesting that President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% would come into effect on Friday at 12:01 AM ET (04:01 GMT).
Analysts, while still expecting a trade deal as the ultimate outcome, appeared to take the threat of an escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions more seriously, having shrugged it off a day earlier as a ploy for Washington to gain the upper hand in talks with Beijing, which are believed to be in the final stages.
""A trade deal with China is still the best bet, but the risk of a delay or even a disaster has risen ... if China calls Trump's bluff, markets will be in for a very rough ride,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
A slump in industrial stocks captured the jitters on trade, with  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), bellwethers of trade given their large international exposure, falling 2.2% and 3.9%, respectively.
Negative sentiment on Boeing was exacerbated after Barclays) downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight on Tuesday. Its survey of airline passengers found that many people will avoid the 737 Max for a prolonged period once the grounded aircraft is deemed flightworthy.
Boeing was responsible for 97 points of the Dow's loss, about 21% of the total.
Chipmakers, vulnerable to any slowdown in China, which accounts for about a fifth of global semiconductor revenue, were also hurt by the ongoing trade concerns, dragging the broader tech sector deep into the red.
 NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 3% on the day.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, came under pressure, falling 0.63% after U.S. oil prices settled 1.4% lower on concerns that an escalation in trade tensions could stifle China's economic rebound, limiting global oil demand.
Healthcare stocks were also a major drag on the broader the market, led by a 23.8% rout in Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) after the drugmaker missed revenue expectations and failed to deliver an update on its strategic review.
There were some positives in the market, with American International Group (NYSE:AIG) delivering a first-quarter earnings beat thanks to lower costs and higher underwriting growth. Its shares closed 6.8% higher, the best performance among the 38 S&P 500 stocks that showed gains on the day.
On the economic front, data showing better-than-expected U.S. job openings for March did little to improve sentiment on stocks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China triggered global growth fears and drove investors away from riskier assets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its second-biggest daily percentage drop of the year, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered their third-biggest percentage drops, even as the major indexes pared losses to end off their session lows.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late on Monday that China had backtracked from commitments made during trade negotiations. Those comments followed President Donald Trump's unexpected statement on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent.
Beijing said on Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Thursday and Friday for trade talks. Additional tariffs are set to take effect on Friday if a trade agreement is not reached by then.
Monday's comments from Lighthizer and Mnuchin raised concerns among some investors that trade talks between China and the United States could take much longer to resolve than previously thought.
""Week after week, we've heard there has been progress and that a deal would be reached,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""Now the goalposts have moved. There's been quite a shift in expectations.""
Investors expressed concern that additional tariffs, if imposed, could interrupt supply chains and hamper economic growth.
""The threat of tariffs has not been trotted out since the end of December,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""It could disrupt the symbiosis between (China and the United States).""
Trade-sensitive industrial and technology stocks marked the biggest percentage declines among the S&P 500's major sectors. All 11 sectors were in the red, with only utilities and energy falling less than 1%.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, the largest U.S. exporter to China, slipped 3.9%, and shares of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), another industrial stalwart sensitive to China, declined 2.3%. Among technology stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Inc shares slid 2.1%, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dropped 2.7%. Apple and Microsoft were the top two drags on the S&P 500.
The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, spiked to its highest level in more than three months. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 473.39 points, or 1.79%, to 25,965.09, the S&P 500 lost 48.42 points, or 1.65%, to 2,884.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 159.53 points, or 1.96%, to 7,963.76.
In a bright spot, American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) shares jumped 6.8% after the insurer reported a quarterly profit that blew past expectations.
With earnings season now in its homestretch, first-quarter profits are now expected to rise 1.2%, a sharp improvement from the 2.3% decline expected at the start of the earnings season.
Of the 414 S&P companies that have reported earnings so far, about 75% have surpassed analysts' estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Conversely, Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV shares tumbled 23.8%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after the drugmaker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and failed to provide greater clarity on a potential revamp of the company's strategy.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.32-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 62 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.8 billion shares, compared to the 6.71 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK/MOUNTAIN VIEW, California (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google launched more affordable versions of its Pixel smartphone on Tuesday at about half the price of its current models, and dropped an exclusive U.S. distribution deal with  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), signaling a major shift in the tech giant's hardware strategy. 
Since hitting the market three years ago, the Pixel has been a slow seller compared to phones from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. Those companies spend far more than Google on advertising, offer options at multiple prices and ensure wide distribution. 
Google is now moving to close the gap. The new Pixel 3a is priced as low $399, compared with $799 for last year's Pixel 3. The cheaper version will have one front camera instead of two and no wireless charging option, Google said. The phone will sell in the same 13 countries as the Pixel 3.
And while Pixel devices currently work on T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular networks, those U.S. wireless carriers will also begin to sell the phones starting Wednesday, along with Verizon. 
""It was the right time"" for the expansion, Mario Queiroz, the Google vice president overseeing Pixel, told Reuters last week. ""Getting into the market initially, it was better to do it in a focused way, but we've got to the point where we're ready to do it more broadly.""
Google had discussions with AT&T (NYSE:T), another major U.S. carrier, but could not overcome some differences, according to people familiar with the matter. But Google and AT&T continue to discuss the possibility of stocking smartphones in the future, one of the people said.
Google's Queiroz declined to comment on talks with partners.
He said advertising for the Pixel 3a would be a continuation of campaigns for the Pixel 3.
The Pixel 3a was unveiled Tuesday on the main stage at Google I/O, Google's annual conference for its thousands of industry partners and its showcase for new products.
Technology analysts said the mid-price range smartphone, which had been rumored for weeks, makes Google a more serious contender in the industry.
Earlier Pixel devices have drawn strong user reviews for camera features and artificial intelligence capabilities that beat those in phones from Samsung and other manufacturers using Google's Android mobile operating system.
But Android partners have seen little threat as demand slowed for phones priced above $500. Google last month reported fewer first-quarter Pixel sales than a year ago due to increased competition and decreased demand in the high-end market.
""Up until now, Pixel was more like a hobby than an actual business,"" said Ben Wood, chief of research at market research firm CCS Insight.
The Pixel 3a and its 0.4-inch larger cousin, Pixel 3a XL, which starts at $479, could upset Android partners, analysts said.
""It's like walking a tightrope,"" said Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit. ""You don't want to upset your licensees but you have to go where the money is.""
Queiroz, the Google VP, declined to comment on profit margins for the new models, which will keep features like a headphone jack that are obsolete in higher-priced smartphones.

""It’s not the absolutely bleeding edge technology,"" he said. ""Our bet is that our software capabilities are better than our competitors.""

(Reuters) - Nestle, the world's largest packaged food company, said it plans to abandon direct-store delivery of frozen pizza and ice cream in the United States, a move that will cut 4,000 jobs.
Instead of delivering frozen pizzas and ice cream directly to stores, Nestle said, it will switch to the network of warehouses it already uses for frozen meals and snacks.
Nestle said the new model would make operations more efficient and profitable, but it would have to shut eight company-owned frozen distribution centers and its frozen inventory transfer points.
Nestle said its plans would mean a one-time cost of about $500 million, and a one-time negative sales impact of about $450 million.
The move will result in the closure of eight company-owned frozen distribution centers and frozen inventory transfer points, the maker of DiGiorno pizza and Edy's ice cream said on Tuesday during an investor presentation. 
""This is massive ... in terms of the value it can translate into,"" Chief Executive Mark Schneider said. 

Investors have long pressed Nestle to improve the performance of its frozen food business. Demand for frozen food in the United States - where Nestle leads the market by share - has exploded in recent years among millennials looking for convenient, healthy ready meals.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 03:45PM ET</span>",Sleepy equity options jolted by renewed U.S.-China trade tensions,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Months of calm in U.S. stocks gave way to a surge in activity in the options market on Tuesday as investors spooked by escalating trade tensions between the United States and China boosted Wall Street's so-called fear gauge to the highest level in three months.
Wall Street's main indexes tumbled about 2% on Tuesday as investors shunned risky assets.
The Cboe Volatility Index, a widely followed options-based barometer of expected near-term volatility for stocks, known as the VIX, rose about 5.56 points to 21, its highest close since Jan. 23. The index has logged an average close of 13 over the last month.
""I think it is pretty clear that this is all driven by the trade issue,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
U.S. officials have accused China of backtracking in the past week on substantial commitments made during months of negotiations aimed at ending their bruising trade war, prompting President Donald Trump to issue a Friday deadline to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. 
The surge in trade-related uncertainty comes just after U.S. stocks reached record highs, and if the higher volatility is sustained it could indicate further trouble for Wall Street.
""The upside to be gained when we get this trade issue resolved with China is relatively small. The downside is significant,"" Frederick said.
On Tuesday, overall options volume was set to hit 25 million contracts for the day, or about 40% more than the daily average over the past month, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
A lot of the activity was concentrated in contracts that expire by the end of the week, which corresponds to Trump's Friday deadline for additional tariffs. 
For S&P 500 options, contracts expiring by the end of the week sported a volatility of about 26%. This was higher than for any other expiration, pointing to investors' focus on risk in the very near term.
""We maintain a cautious outlook for the S&P 500 as momentum, volatility and breadth indicators suggest a difficult environment for U.S. equities over the coming weeks,"" Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said in a note on Tuesday.
The VIX was on pace for its largest one-day gain since Dec. 24.
Some of the gains in the VIX may have to do with some investors having to cover short positions in VIX futures that had grown to near record proportions in recent months, Weeden & Co derivatives strategist Michael Purves said.
Speculative short positions in VIX futures were at their largest since early October and close to the largest they have been in about two years, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
""Aggressive positioning does not become a volatility catalyst, but if you get a volatility catalyst the short covering becomes a magnifier of the move,"" Purves said.
Despite the surge in defensive activity on Tuesday, investors were not hitting the panic button yet, analysts said.
""It's the kind of activity you would expect when markets fall 1 to 2 percent in a year when equities have largely only gone up,"" said Anand Omprakash, head of derivative quant strategies at BTIG in New York.

""Equities in general have had a wonderful run since January. If the market is indeed turning, I think some investors may be trying to get ahead of that,"" he said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co plans to expand its GoRide medical transportation service to 40 cities nationwide over the next four years, moving into Ohio and Florida this year and other large states by 2020, the company said on Tuesday.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has been testing various ways to grow beyond its traditional business of building and selling cars and trucks, aiming to compete with technology industry startups such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc for a share of money spent on transportation as a service. 
GoRide uses Ford Transit and Transit Connect vans to give rides to people who need medical care but do not need an ambulance. GoRide last year agreed to provide medical transport for the Beaumont Hospital system of Southeast Michigan. The service has since expanded to Toledo, Ohio.
GoRide now plans to expand to several more Ohio cities by the end of 2019, including Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. In Dayton, GoRide is expanding services in collaboration with the city's transit system.
The unit plans to launch in Miami and other Florida cities later this year. Next year, GoRide plans to move into North Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and California, GoRide chief executive Minyang Jiang said.
""By the end of the year we expect to have over 130"" vans in service, Jiang said. ""By the end of next year over 200.""
So far, GoRide is focusing on urban markets, but Jiang said the unit is looking at how to provide medical transport in rural areas that lack public transit.
GoRide competes with medical ride services offered by ride hailing industry leaders Uber and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), as well as smaller regional services.
So far, GoRide is getting capital from Ford as one of the automaker's mobility ventures. Ford said its mobility services lost $288 million in the first quarter. The medical transport service plans to generate revenue from hospital systems and insurance companies that agree to use its service to get patients to appointments.
Jiang did not give a target for when GoRide could turn a profit, but she said with scale the service should get into the black. 

""We're not going to grow at all costs,"" she said.

1061,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2019 01:50PM ET</span>",Venezuela Opposition Congress Approves PDVSA 2020 Bond Payment,"(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela’s opposition-led National Assembly voted unanimously Tuesday to make a $71 million interest payment on the state oil company’s bonds due in 2020, the crisis-torn nation’s only notes not in default.
Lawmakers said the Petroleos de Venezuela payment was necessary because the debt is backed by a majority stake in Citgo, the Venezuelan-owned U.S. refiner, which opponents of President Nicolas Maduro have controlled since seizing the company’s Houston office in January.
Still, advisers to National Assembly President Juan Guaido, who is recognized by the U.S. and more than 50 other countries as Venezuela’s head of state, said it would be a “payment under protest” as the bonds never got congressional approval and therefore aren’t legitimate obligations.
Congressmen Sergio Vergara, a Guaido confidant, said the decision to pay was was made to “protect Venezuela’s assets at all costs.”
Last month, PDVSA’s ad hoc board, controlled by the opposition, notified the bond’s trustees of its decision to “implement all necessary actions for the payment of interest.” Failure to pay would likely trigger a rush to collect on Citgo collateral. The interest payment was due April 29, yet the bond includes a 30-day grace period before it would be declared in default.
Technically, the PDVSA board controlled by Maduro has the power to pay as well. It forked over nearly $1 billion late last year to stay current on the bond, even as Venezuela missed more than $10 billion in payments on other securities. But Maduro’s team has no intention of ponying up the cash now that Guaido has control of Citgo, according to a person familiar with the matter."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cargill Inc has issued a voluntary recall of nearly 150 tons of animal feed, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday, after North Carolina regulators found aflatoxin in a testing sample.
Aflatoxin is a byproduct of a mold that typically flourishes in corn or other grains in dry conditions, and can be harmful or even fatal to livestock. The toxin became a serious problem for the grain industry eight years ago, when a historic drought in the U.S. Midwest put everyone from farmers to grain handlers and food industry officials on high alert.
Cargill said it first learned about the problem in its products after the North Carolina Department of Agriculture alerted the company that test results showed a single lot of feed product contained elevated levels of aflatoxin.
The affected products are from Cargill's Southern (NYSE:SO) States feed line, and were made at its facility in Cleveland, North Carolina. The products included feed for poultry, beef and dairy cattle, sheep, goats and equine.
Altogether, Cargill said it recalled 4,971 bags of the feed, mostly in 50 pound bags, and 25 bulk tons. Cargill gave no dollar value for the recalled product. 
""The root cause was identified as a corn supplier to our Cleveland, NC facility, with whom we have changed our internal testing protocol,"" company spokeswoman April Nelson told Reuters.
Cargill is working with the supplier to understand the source of the mold, Nelson said, and is now sourcing corn from other suppliers.
There have been no reports of adverse health effects to animals that consumed the products, Cargill said in a statement. Cargill issued a press release outlining the situation late on Monday, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Nelson said.
The products were pulled from retail outlets and distributors in the Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia markets and removed from retail shelves throughout February, March, and April.
All product has been pulled at this point, and retailers have been issued credit for their disposed inventory, Cargill said.

LONDON (Reuters) - While Britain debates the merits of a second Brexit referendum, London's financial center is steering clear of the argument, resigned to the need to shift some business elsewhere.
Burned by backing the ill-fated Remain campaign three years ago, major global and British banks told Reuters they would shy away from taking a similar position in a new vote, preferring to spend time and money on ""future-proofing"" their business, including tackling outdated technology and moving into new markets.
A Reuters survey of leadership attitudes at 17 British and global banks found just six of the 11 institutions who responded to the survey backed the idea of a People's Vote to break a parliamentary impasse on a proposed exit deal.
Four banks said they opposed another vote while one bank said it would remain agnostic on all Brexit scenarios and would let the political process - now stretching towards its third year - run its course. 
None of the 11 respondents said they would be prepared to put cash behind a campaign for either a ""Leave"" or ""Remain"" outcome at this stage.
To prepare for Brexit, Banks have transferred billions of pounds in client assets to new European Union legal entities and shifted around 2,000 roles away from London to new hubs in cities including Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid.
But now the hard graft is complete, the industry biggest players say they would not reverse those changes even if Brexit was scrapped. 
Spreading top talent across several European cities has enhanced the banks' appeal to some EU clients and reduced costs linked to doing business in London, one of the world's most expensive cities.
""The horse has bolted,"" a source at one of the banks which responded to the survey said.
Britain's opposition Labour Party has said it will support a second vote but only if Prime Minister Theresa May refuses to change her withdrawal deal or if there is no new national election.
A second senior banking source said he believed the chances of a second referendum were on the rise but he doubted it would garner anything like the same backing in finance industry circles as the first Remain campaign.
""I think we are still bruised by the experience the first time around. We don't regret it, but we would have to ask ourselves why we would put ourselves through it again?""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Citi donated between 250,000-500,000 pounds ($326,750-$653,500) each to the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign in 2016, data from the Electoral Commission showed.
Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY), Britain's leading mortgage lender, also lent 20,000 pounds to the Remain campaign at a 1 percent interest rate.
CRITICISM
Several key bankers including ex-Barclays chairman John McFarlane and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Chief Executive Bill Winters were among 1,280 business leaders who expressed support for the Remain campaign in a letter published a day before Britons went to the polls on June 23, 2016.
But the industry was accused of interfering in the political process and criticised for fuelling public fears about how Brexit might harm the economy. 
The six banks which declined to take part in the survey cited company policy on political polls or differences of opinion in their leadership teams. 
After losing the fight to secure passporting privileges, mutual recognition and enhanced equivalence regulatory regimes with the EU post Brexit, a third senior banker told Reuters it was safer to reorganize their banks without political help.
""We would not endorse a second referendum. Why would we? What would be the point?,"" he said.
""The financial sector planned for the worst possible scenario. I didn't think that politicians would deliver anything for us and I've not been disappointed.""
Others said the government needed a better grasp of EU regulation and market structures that supported the industry's status as Britain's biggest taxpayer. 
""Politicians should know their decisions have consequences and this kind of stress is the result,"" a senior executive at a fourth major bank said. ""I want to go back to not having the vote at all.""

1071,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 12:49PM ET</span>","GM's Cruise gets $1.15 billion new cash from T. Rowe Price, SoftBank","(Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's majority-owned Cruise self-driving division said on Tuesday fund manager T. Rowe Price and a group of existing investors put down $1.15 billion in new equity, valuing the unit at $19 billion.
Shares of the No.1 U.S. automaker rose as much as 2.1 percent to $38.89 in early afternoon trading following the announcement.
Funding for Cruise comes weeks after T. Rowe Price said it has sold 92 percent of its stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
The latest funding for Cruise includes existing investors General Motors, Japan's SoftBank Vision Fund and Honda Motor Co Ltd, and should give the firm much-needed cash as it aims to launch vehicles by the end of 2019.
The additional capital comes at a crucial time as a host of automakers and technology companies weigh how quickly autonomous vehicles can be marketed and sold in large volumes, and find ways to share rising costs for hardware and software development. 
Rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is in talks with German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG about joining forces to create autonomous vehicles in a deal that could involve an investment by VW in Argo AI, an autonomous vehicle technology company majority owned by Ford.
Cruise, which has secured capital commitments of $7.25 billion in the past year, was valued at $14.6 billion in the last funding round by Honda in October, which had invested $2.75 billion.
The current valuation is equivalent to about 35 percent of GM's market capitalization despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch.
GM in February outlined an incentive plan for Cruise Chief Executive Officer Dan Ammann, pointing toward a possible initial public offering for the business within ten years. 

Up to Monday's close GM's stock had risen about 14 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent increase in the S&P 500 index

1072,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>",Mortgage litigation claims could hit Spanish bank results: Bank of Spain,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish banks could see a rise in legal claims related to an historic method for pricing mortgages that could have a big impact on their profits, the Bank of Spain said on Tuesday.
Spain's mortgage rate index (IRPH) was an alternative to Euribor used for pricing floating-rate mortgages, and was based on the mean of mortgage yields sold by banks.
It was scrapped by the government in 2013, following criticism it did not allow customers to benefit sufficiently from lower interest rates.
Spain's Supreme Court ruled in 2017 the index did not constitute an abuse of the market and that its use in contracts was transparent as the IRPH was an official measure approved and published by the Bank of Spain.
However, customers and lower courts have challenged this decision at the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
On Tuesday, the Bank of Spain said a final decision by the ECJ was expected in the second half of the year, and that a ruling against banks could cost them dearly.
""Given previous litigation experience, in particular related to the sale of mortgages with floor clauses, these legal processes may have a (...) significant time extension, as well as a material impact on the profit of the lenders,"" it said as part of its twice-yearly report on domestic lenders.
Brokers such as Spanish investment firm Alantra estimate a worst-case loss for the banks of up to 10 billion euros.
A spokesman for the ECJ said the general advocate would issue a non-binding statement on June 24.
Among Spanish lenders, Caixabank has an outstanding exposure of 6.7 billion euros to IRPH mortgage contracts, BBVA (MC:BBVA) around 4 billion euros, Bankia, 1.6 billion euros, and Sabadell, less than 800 million euros.
According to analysts at Alantra, Santander (MC:SAN) has an outstanding exposure of 4 billion euros. Santander declined to give a number.
MORTGAGE PROBLEMS
After it was scrapped, the IRPH was replaced by a fixed rate of around 2 percent, which has acted as a floor for mortgage rates as Euribor rates have fallen steadily since.
Like other European banks, Spanish lenders are struggling to lift earnings as ultra-low interest rates are squeezing their financial margins.
They are also battling to overcome the legacy of Spain's real estate bubble, which burst in 2007 and saddled lenders with billions in toxic real estate assets that ultimately led to a 41.3 billion euro ($46.3 billion) public bail-out.
The number of lenders in Spain has shrank from 55 before 2008 to just 12 as they have attempted to improve profitability.
The IRPH is one of a number of mortgage-related problems Spanish banks have had to face.
Last year, the Spanish government countered a court ruling that would have forced customers to pay mortgage stamp duty by pledging a law obliging banks to pay the tax.
Two years earlier, the ECJ overturned a Spanish court ruling that had capped banks' liabilities for mortgage floor contracts.
By the start of this year, Spanish banks had paid back 2.2 billion euros to customers for what they lost on those mortgages, according to Bank of Spain figures on Tuesday, with lenders setting aside 1.9 billion euros in provisions against 2016 results.

The agreement resolves over 95 percent of the 6,000 cases in which surgeons extracted the company's Pinnacle implants because they left patients unable to walk and in pain, according to the report.
The $1 billion total includes an earlier settlement for more than $400 million and there are still about 4,500 pending suits by patients with artificial hips that were not made totally of metal or haven't been surgically removed, Bloomberg added. 
In February, Reuters reported J&J's DePuy Orthopedics unit, which made the products, was in settlement talks to resolve most individual lawsuits alleging the company's metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defective and caused severe injuries.
The implants were said to cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. 
In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations.

Borgen is the first person to be charged in a case that involves suspicious transactions of some 200 billion euros ($224 billion) that passed through Danske Bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
Denmark's biggest bank is being investigated by authorities in several other countries including the United States, where it could face major fines.
Shares in Danske Bank have more than halved since March last year, and on Tuesday fell to their lowest since August 2013 following the Borsen report, which did not specify the nature of the charges against the bank's former CEO.
Borgen, who had been in charge of Danske Bank's international operations, including Estonia, between 2009 and 2012, resigned in September after an investigation revealed the scale of the suspicious payments.
Prosecutors raided Borgen's home on March 12, the report quoted the lawyer as saying.
Borsen also cited unnamed sources as saying the Danish prosecutor had charged at least two other former managers at Danske Bank in relation to the money laundering case, but did not give any names.
Borgen and his lawyer did not respond to calls, while the prosecutor and Danske Bank both declined to comment.
Denmark's state prosecutor filed preliminary charges against Danske Bank itself in November for alleged violations of the country's anti-money laundering act in relation to its Estonian branch. The prosecutor said at the time he would clarify whether individuals could be held responsible.
The money laundering scandal has spread to Sweden where Swedbank in March dismissed its chief executive over allegations its Baltic accounts were used to launder money.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq is close to signing a $53 billion, 30-year energy agreement with  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and PetroChina, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said on Tuesday, denying any link between the mega-project and U.S. permission for Iraq to do business with Iran.
Iraq expects to make $400 billion over the 30 years the deal will be in effect, the prime minister said.
The southern mega-project involves the development of the Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi oilfields and raising production from the two fields to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from around 125,000 bpd now, Abdul Mahdi said. 
The project is crucial to supplying water to oilfields in the south in order to boost pressure and keep production steady.
Media reports had quoted Iran's ambassador in London on Monday saying the United States would grant waivers to Iraq allowing it to deal with Iran economically, in exchange for Baghdad signing an oil deal with Washington.
""Talks now between the oil ministry and Exxon Mobil and PetroChina are focused on how to split profits if oil prices rise or decline,"" Abdul Mahdi said in response to a Reuters question on the obstacles holding up a final agreement.
""The deal lasts for 30 years and such financial details are sensitive and should be given more discussions,"" he added.
Iraq is the second largest oil exporter in OPEC and has long-term aims to boost output curtailed by decades of war and sanctions. Such projects are among the most valuable prizes in the world for international oil companies. An initial agreement would be a big boost for Exxon Mobil's plans to expand in Iraq.
It is also one of the only countries in the world to have friendly relations with both the United States and Iran. Tehran and Washington, arch enemies elsewhere, are Baghdad's main allies and vye for influence there.
Exxon Mobil and PetroChina will build a water injection project to feed oil wells in the south, as well as rehabilitate and build new export pipelines, Abdul Mahdi said.
The project also aims to process 100 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Artawi and Nahr Bin Umar fields.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out last year from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, and reinstated sanctions against Tehran. Washington has told buyers of Iranian oil to stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions.
Iraq does not import oil and has a waiver from the United States allowing it to import Iranian natural gas.

""The U.S. sanctions are against countries that buy Iranian oil only, and Iraq doesn't buy any Iranian crude. For gas, as far as I know (waivers ending) won't affect (gas imports) right now. The waiver for gas still stands,"" an Iraqi oil official told Reuters on Monday.

1085,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2019 09:42AM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Falls Triple Digits Amid U.S.-China Trade Standoff,"Investing.com - Wall Street traded lower on Tuesday, with the Dow falling by over a hundred points for the second straight day, as markets worried that neither the U.S. nor China would back down in order to reach an agreement in their current trade dispute.
The Dow Jones fell 190 points, or 1.5%, at 26,248.66 points by 9:38 AM ET (13:38 GMT), the S&P 500 lost 23 points, or 0.8%, to 2,909.90 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded down 65 points, or 0.8%, at 8,057.83 points.
“The Chinese public wants an agreement, but meanwhile is well prepared for other potential outcomes, including a temporary breakdown in talks,” said an editorial in the Global Times, an English-language publication that regularly serves as a mouthpiece for official Chinese foreign policy.
The comments came after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed that the U.S. will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% as of Friday, a step that sharply escalates the trade dispute between the two countries after months of talks that appeared to be making progress in avoiding such an outcome.
Many analysts commented that both sides may only be posturing ahead of the high-level trade talks between Lighthizer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.
But the determination of both sides not to “flinch first” has markets concerned that the increased tariffs will come into force.
“It’s imperative that trade tensions are resolved in a way satisfying for everyone because clearly tensions between the United States and China are the threat to the global economy,” Reuters quoted International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde as saying in Paris on the sidelines of a meeting with the French government.
Markets want trade “results”, Investing.com analyst Pinchas Cohen said.
Cohen warned of further volatility ahead, noting that ""CBOE contracts speculating on market volatility spiked to levels not seen since late January, closing at the highest levels since late March.""
The health sector did little to reassure investor sentiment in early trading, with Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) all trading sharply lower.
Insurer AIG (NYSE:AIG) was a notable outlier with shares soaring nearly 8% after it recorded its first underwriting profit since the financial crisis, smashing expectations with its first-quarter results.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, gained 0.2% to 97.44 by 9:40 AM ET (13:40 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped 3 basis points to 2.47%.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Vaping companies facing European opposition to higher nicotine level,"By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - A push by makers of electronic cigarettes to raise nicotine levels in the European Union towards their far higher American levels is running into opposition, a senior executive at U.S. market leader Juul said on Tuesday. 
But there is little sign in Europe of the kind of regulatory backlash seen in the United States over youth vaping, said Grant Winterton, EMEA president of Juul. 
E-cigarettes, which offer a nicotine alternative to cigarettes without the same toxic and cancer-causing chemicals, have seen rapid growth in the United States, prompting Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) to buy a 35 percent stake in Juul for $12.8 billion in December.
But the roll-out across European Union countries of Juul, whose devices resemble a USB flash drive and work by vaporising a nicotine-laced liquid, has been hampered by limits of 20 milligrams of nicotine per millimetre of liquid compared to 59 in the United States. 
This, the company says, makes it less effective as an alternative to cigarettes for heavy smokers.
""We will put forward our position that we think the limit should be increased,"" Winterton said, looking ahead to a review of the EU's Tobacco Products Directive in 2021.
""At the moment I would say there is quite a lot of resistance to that,"" he added in an interview coinciding with Juul's launch in Ireland, one of a number planned in the European Union this year. 
While public health bodies in Britain have embraced vaping as a tool to wean smokers off cigarettes, governments in other EU markets, where smoking rates are higher, have been cooler. Most are ""neutral to slightly positive"" but no significant market is hostile, Winterton said. 
YOUTH VAPING
In recent months e-cigarette makers including Juul have been under fire for the popularity of their products among teens attracted to candy and dessert flavour varieties. 
In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced curbs on sales of flavoured e-cigarette products, including Juul's mango and cool cucumber, responding to concerns of underage use reaching epidemic proportion.
""We do not see at this time some of the issues that have been raised in the United States,"" Winterton said, referring to youth vaping.
European regulators have responded ""very positively"" to measures it has introduced, including voluntary nicotine warnings, marketing targeted only at over-30s and vetting to make sure retailers adhere to age limits. 
It would be ""moral and commercial suicide"" to target young non-smokers with nicotine products, he added. 
Juul is trying to match its success in the United States with a global roll-out with a target of international sales eclipsing U.S. sales within five years. 
It's U.S. market share increased from 13.6 percent in early 2017 to more than 75 percent by the end of last year, according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysis of Nielsen retail data. 
Winterton said Juul plans to launch in multiple Asian locations in 2019 and the Middle East and Africa in 2020 and 2021.

""There is no one who is not on our radar if you look forward next 4-5 years,"" he said.

1087,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",Veggie Burger Mania Hits Corporate America After Beyond IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- As hot corporate trends go, crypto and pot are so yesterday. Now, the rush is to get in on anything that smacks of vegetarian meat products.
OK, well, maybe the frenzy isn’t quite as intense as those have been, but a few days after  Beyond Meat Inc .'s (NASDAQ:BYND) stock price was frantically bid up by investors in its trading debut, food companies are rushing to get their veggie burgers to market.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN). on Monday confirmed it will introduce a meatless protein product in coming months. Tyson, to underscore the announcement, is the biggest meat processor in the U.S. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp. just began selling a veggie burger in Germany, Burger King said last week that its Impossible Whopper would go nationwide this year. In July, Whole Foods will start selling a burger made by Lightlife, a competitor to Beyond Meat. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts the Beyond Meat success will push companies like Kellogg Co., Conagra Brands Inc. and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co. to spend more on plant innovation.
The stampede could, of course, turn into a bubble and end up looking like the dot-com bust. But after years of being the province of startups and tinkering by Silicon Valley biologists, fake meat has now gone mainstream.
“All the big guys are looking, and everyone is saying, crap, we’re already three years behind,” said Chris Kerr, co-founder and chief investment officer of New Crop Capital, a venture firm with stakes in vegan companies.
It’s happening because imitation meat-makers like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods Inc. are engineering veggie burgers that are more acceptable to the masses, but it’s also about the masses changing their tastes and trying to eat less meat. Indeed, there are signs of a shortage of elite veggie burgers to satisfy consumers at the moment.
Tyson Foods’ rapid move from investor to player in the alternative meat space is “a good indication that the hot market of vegetable-based proteins will see additional players in the sector,” said Will Sawyer, lead animal protein economist at CoBank. The meat giant sold its 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat just before the initial public offering.
“That’s a very quick evolution for a company that has had a very traditional animal-protein business for decades to now expand their products in a way that we wouldn’t have expected 10 years ago,” Sawyer said. “They won’t be the last meat company in the industry that will try to participate.”
Tyson’s timing happens to be perfect for summer grilling. So it is with the new Lightlife burger, which is owned by Canadian meat giant Maple Leaf Foods Inc. According to a release Monday, Lightlife will be available in the meat aisles of thousands of U.S. grocery stores, and is coming to Whole Foods starting in July.
McDonald’s began selling a veggie burger in Germany -- the heart of meat consumption -- that’s made by Nestle SA (SIX:NESN). In its home market, the world’s biggest restaurant company’s plans for a beef alternative aren’t quite as clear. While Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook says McDonald’s teams are taking a look at plant-based proteins, they could create complications in the kitchens.
“We’ll stay close to consumer demand,” he said on April 30 in a conference call. “Our teams there are paying close attention and discussing this amongst each other.”
Kellogg’s Morningstar Farms unit, which already makes veggie burgers, will roll out more chicken imitation products, and recently hinted at other innovations, too.
“It’s a space where we feel like we have the right to win,” Chief Executive Officer Steven Cahillane said on an earnings call. “We’ll continue to innovate in that space.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Consumer trends, including health and wellness, animal protection and environmental concerns, continue to gain traction, aiding sales growth prospects for plant-based meat substitutes. Millennials are driving this trend, and growing disposable incomes allow them to spend in support of their beliefs. -- Jennifer Bartashus and Diana Rosero-Pena, analysts Click here to view the research.
In the U.S., there’s a shortage of Impossible burgers, which uses a genetically modified concoction from soy plants and yeast to imitate cattle blood -- all to more perfectly mimic the taste of flesh. They’re sold at thousands of locations including at White Castle and Burger King.
While veggie burgers have long existed, the ones that are garnering much of the investment are highly engineered alternatives that aim to taste as good as meat. But there’s also a flourishing of the lower-end stuff as retailers offer their own private label plant burgers.
Grocer Aldi is getting into plant-based proteins with vegan burgers under the Earth Grown brand that are much cheaper than Beyond’s burgers, which cost $6 to $7 for two, 4-ounce patties. The Aldi Earth Grown vegan burgers were introduced last year, and are just $2.79 for a 10-ounce package of four patties, the company says.
To be sure, alternative meat is still tiny compared with animal-protein markets -- less than one percent of animal-protein sales, according to Sawyer. But some people see the makings of a bubble.
“It’s crazy, there are companies like in a one-car garage to large companies that see the markets changing by the attitude of the millennials,” said Henk Hoogencamp, a board member and adviser for several food companies, including the alternative dairy protein startup, Perfect Day. “Some of them will succeed, and most of them will fail.”
Not every vegetable-based burger has succeeded. Wendy’s Co. a few years back tried selling a black-bean burger, but it never really took off. There was substantial customer interest in some areas, but not in others, said spokeswoman Heidi Schauer.
Big food companies are “setting up investment arms and emerging company areas, but it’s too little, too late, and they’re still trying to catch up with the curve,” said Lou Biscotti, national food and beverage practice leader for Marcum LLP, an accounting firm.

(NYSE:CVX) until May 10 to either boost its offer or walk away from the oil industry’s biggest deal in at least four years.
The announcement by Anadarko, which had rebuffed several prior bids from Occidental, comes almost a month after it agreed to be purchased by Chevron for $33 billion. Chevron has so far refused to increase its offer, saying its proposal is a better long-term option for Anadarko shareholders. If it decides not to raise the bid, Chevron can walk away with a $1 billion breakup fee.
The takeover of Anadarko has been a rare public fight for an oil industry that hasn’t seen many bidding wars. Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub’s recruitment of billionaire Warren Buffett and an $8.8 billion accord to offload African oil and gas fields to  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) appeared to have been key milestones in winning the board’s favor. Anadarko directors had previously chosen Chevron’s offer even though it was substantially cheaper than that of Occidental, which, as a smaller company, would have to take on much more leverage to do the deal.
“We think Chevron is likely to make a counter offer, but it may not be high enough to win the bid,” said Leo Mariani, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Chevron, boosted by more valuable stock, will have to offer around $70 a share to be considered by Anadarko, costing it an extra $3.2 billion, he said.
The period for Chevron’s response may be extended under the terms of the original agreement, Anadarko said in a statement after the market closed Monday. In a separate statement, Chevron acknowledged Anadarko’s response and declined to make any further comment.
Anadarko was little changed at $75.50 at 8:50 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York, less than $1 below the value of Occidental’s offer. Occidental was also little changed at $58.65. Chevron was 0.6 percent lower at $117.70.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has signaled he’s willing to end his pursuit of a deal if the price gets so high that it imperils investor returns. “We strongly believe that the combination of our two companies create superior long-term value for shareholders of the combined company,” Wirth said on an April 26 earnings conference call.
While buying Anadarko would expand the producer’s presence in the Permian Basin, which is now the world’s largest oil patch, there are other operators in the region that Chevron could acquire. Chevron also has existing ambitious growth plans for the Permian.
Houston-based Occidental over the weekend pressed to alleviate any remaining concerns from Anadarko. It said Sunday that 78 percent of the deal will be paid in cash, up from 50 percent, and it got rid of the need for a shareholder vote, which had previously been cited as a sticking point for Anadarko’s directors.
“We have long been convinced that a strategic combination with Anadarko represents a compelling opportunity for the shareholders of both Occidental and Anadarko,” Occidental said in a statement after Anadarko accepted the suitor’s offer.
At least one major Occidental investor has signaled that it’s ready to break with the company’s board of directors. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. told Reuters it intends to vote against the board after the company eliminated the need for shareholder approval in its revised bid.
“With the OXY deal looking safer for APC to accept, I’d say this may force CVX to match the OXY bid or lose out on these terrific assets,” said Bill Nygren, chief investment officer of Harris Associates LP, which manages $120 billion and owns about 3 percent of Anadarko.

MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) beat forecasts on Tuesday with a 14 percent rise in first-quarter core earnings, boosting its shares on growing expectations the Italian luxury carmaker might soon raise its full-year financial targets.
Milan-listed Ferrari shares rose as much as 5.7 percent on the results, which were driven by strong sales of the 8 cylinder Portofino model and the 812 Superfast among higher-margin 12 cylinder models. The stock was up 4.4 percent at 1215 GMT.
Ferrari stuck to its full-year targets, but analysts said an increase might be in store.
Current targets look ""extremely conservative"",  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at 311 million euros ($348 million) in January-March, above the average forecast of 284 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Net revenues rose 13 percent to 940 million euros, topping the average estimate of 864 million euros. Shipments rose in all regions, with China and America up 79 percent and 27 percent respectively. 
Jefferies analysts described the results as ""impressive"", adding the first-quarter performance more than supported current consensus expectations for the year, which were already at the top end of the company's guidance range for adjusted EBITDA. Based on the results, revenue growth might come in at around 7 percent, well above the current annual forecast, they added.
Ferrari currently expects adjusted EBITDA this year to rise around 10 percent to 1.2-1.25 billion euros. Sales are seen growing more than 3 percent to top 3.5 billion euros.
Last year's plan set a target for adjusted EBITDA in excess of 1.3 billion euros in 2020, but Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said earlier this year he was ""very bullish"" and might raise it, betting on new models and special editions at premium prices to lure customers.

Ferrari is starting to ship its first 488 Pista Spider models this quarter, while the new Ferrari Monza limited series will be shipped starting from fourth quarter.

“Many levers appear to have been pulled to get first-quarter 2019 earnings-per-share growth into positive territory for the S&P 500,” strategist Lori Calvasina wrote in a note Tuesday. We “are starting to question whether these efforts can be replicated in coming quarters.”
Robust buyback activity, a reduction in shares outstanding and pricing initiatives have been among steps taken to boost earnings-per-share, according to Calvasina. Cost-savings plans have been more in focus this reporting season than in the last few, she said.
About 76 percent of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Margin improvements via cost cuts have been a major driver of the better-than-expected results, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gina Martin Adams said.
A recent report by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. suggested companies have pivoted to using tax reform primarily to reward shareholders, rather than to pay down debt and ramp up capital spending and outlays on research and development.
“While we applaud the determination of management teams to navigate the many pressures that confronted them during the quarter,” Calvasina wrote, “one of the biggest questions that we have coming out of reporting season is whether companies will be able to pull these levers again in coming quarters -- particularly if tariff headwinds strengthen.”

Prosecutors in the southern city of Stuttgart on Tuesday said that the company's development department had neglected its legal obligations, which ultimately led to the sale of diesel cars that spewed excessive pollution levels.
The fine against Porsche follows a 1 billion euro penalty for management lapses imposed against Volkswagen by prosecutors in Braunschweig, and a fine of 800 million euros against Audi by prosecutors in Munich, Germany last year.
U.S. authorities disclosed Volkswagen's systematic emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015, sparking the biggest business scandal in the company's history which has cost Volkswagen Group 30 billion euros in penalties and fines.
VW, Porsche and Audi all sold diesel engine cars which failed to conform to clean air rules and cheated emissions tests.
German prosecutors have pursued individual engineers and took action against the companies for lack of oversight because managers failed to prevent heavily polluting cars from hitting European roads.
Prosecutors said Porsche had not appealed the findings by the prosecutor.
Porsche confirmed the fine and said that prosecutors' proceedings against the company had come to an end.
The fine does not hinder ongoing proceedings against individual people in relation to Porsche's diesel manipulations, the prosecutors added.

The claim, which will be largest group action to be heard in England, was served on the miner on Tuesday on behalf of 235,000 Brazilian individuals and organizations, including municipal governments, utility companies, indigenous tribes and the Catholic Church, according to law firm SPG Law.
BHP spokesman Neil Burrows said the miner intended to defend itself against the proceedings, brought in the north western English city of Liverpool. 
The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and spilled about 40 million cubic meters of toxic sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away.
Claimants allege BHP, the world's largest mining company by market value, was aware of rising safety concerns, failed to act on repeated warnings from independent safety experts, increased industrial output of iron ore despite safety concerns and placed the pursuit of profit over human and environmental risk.
""Driven by concern for declining revenues amidst the falling market price of iron ore, the company took risks, increased production and turned a blind eye to dangers that ultimately claimed lives and destroyed communities,"" said Tom Goodhead, a partner at SPG Law, which is representing claimants. 
""BHP was woefully negligent in its duty of care and the damages sought are entirely commensurate with the devastation the company has wrought...,"" he added.
Brazil charged 22 people in 2016 with offences, including murder, over the Fundao dam's collapse. The miners last year settled a 20 billion reais ($5 billion) civil claim with local authorities to establish a clean-up fund. Other public cases, such as a $40 billion civil reparation case, are suspended.
BHP, which has separately settled a U.S. investor class action and continues to battle Australian shareholder lawsuits, has rejected all charges against the company, as well as current and former staff. 

Although the disaster ranks as Brazil's worst environmental catastrophe, the collapse of a Vale-operated tailings dam in the town of Brumadinho in January left a higher death toll, currently estimated at 300 people.

As part of the deal, BorgWarner, which makes parts such as turbochargers and all-wheel drive systems, will fill two seats on Romeo Power's board and form a joint venture, in which the U.S. automotive supplier will have 60 percent stake.
Battery packs will add to BorgWarner's existing products for hybrid and electric vehicles including electric motors, power electronics, high-voltage battery heaters and onboard battery chargers, the company said.
BorgWarner has made a series of acquisitions to better compete in the fast-growing market for electric and hybrid vehicles, starting with $950 million purchase of electric and hybrid motors maker Remy International Inc in 2015.
The deal with Romeo Power is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019, BorgWarner said.

The company's medical aesthetics unit, which includes top-seller Botox, brought in sales of $648.2 million for the quarter, a 2 percent rise from a year ago.
Excluding items, the company earned $3.79 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $3.55, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company's net loss, however, widened to $2.41 billion in the first quarter, hit by a $2.5 billion charge related to the clinical failure of its depression treatment candidate rapastinel. The company had posted a loss of $332.5 million a year earlier.
Revenue fell 2 percent to $3.59 billion but beat the average Wall Street estimate of $3.54 billion.
The company said it now expects 2019 adjusted profit to be greater than $16.55 per share, compared with its prior expectation of profit greater than or equal to $16.36 per share.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>",French tycoon Niel to sell mobile towers to Cellnex for $3 billion,"By Mathieu Rosemain and Andrés González
PARIS/MADRID (Reuters) - French tycoon Xavier Niel has agreed a 2.7 billion euro ($3.02 billion) deal to sell mobile towers in France, Italy and Switzerland to Cellnex as he seeks to bolster the finances of his telecoms group Iliad. 
Iliad burned through 1.44 billion euros in cash in 2018, twice as much as in 2017, and has lost half its market value over the last year.
The deal by billionaire Niel, considered a maverick in France's telecoms sector, follows a similar one by French rival  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom in 2017 under which it sold about 3,000 mobile sites to Cellnex for 900 million euros. 
For Spanish towers group Cellnex, the acquisitions of thousands of new sites in the three countries allow it to extend its reach in Europe, where it has grown considerably over the past few years and is now seen as a key player in a potential consolidation of the telecoms infrastructure market. 
Iliad shares were 5.6 percent up at 0926 GMT, while Cellnex's were 6.6 percent higher. 
""This is quite a sensible move for them for two reasons: one is that it gives Iliad the financing to roll out in Italy, second ... Cellnex will end up having much better utilization of the infrastructure,"" said Karen Egan, an analyst at Enders.
Iliad, which has shaken up the French mobile market since 2012 with low-cost services, is facing aggressive fixed and mobile discounts from rivals in its home country.
Part of the proceeds from the towers sale will help to cut its debt and invest in networks in both France and Italy, it said. The deal was announced hours before Iliad's investor day in Paris on Tuesday.
TRANSFORMATIONAL
Analysts say the 2.7 billion euro investment is transformational for Cellnex, increasing by 75 percent earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA) and doubling its recurrent leveraged free cash flow. 
It would allow the Spanish group to take control of Iliad's 5,700 sites in France and the 2,200 in Italy. It would also take control of the mobile towers of Salt, the Swiss telecom operator privately-owned by Niel. 
Cellnex also intends to spend an additional 1.35 billion euros on the roll-out of 2,500 new sites in France, 1,000 sites in Italy and 500 in Switzerland between 2020 and 2027.  
""This is a big deal for Cellnex and materially increases the scale. We further believe there remains further opportunities for Cellnex to continue to do deals,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in a note to clients. 
Cellnex Chief Executive Tobias Martinez said on a conference call Britain's CTIL would be an appealing target but reiterated it could not afford to invest in France's TDF, which Spanish newspaper Expansion said it was considering.
Iliad, whose first-quarter sales grew by 7.7 percent to 1.29 billion euros, said it targeted a return to revenue growth in France in 2019 and an acceleration of its core operating profit growth in the second-half of the year.

The statement by Raimund Roeseler, an executive with Germany's financial markets watchdog, marked the regulator's first public comments on the failed merger talks, which were discontinued last month after six weeks of negotiations.
The banks attributed the failure to risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
The banks will still be under pressure to cut costs, Bafin president Felix Hufeld said. He dismissed the notion that hurdles stood in the way to cross-boarder banking mergers in Europe.
The comments, made at an annual news conference, came as Bafin disclosed that it was looking into a possible erosion of bank lending standards in Germany and has also created a new department to deal with especially troubled banks.
Bafin and the Bundesbank in April started a survey of nearly 100 financial institutions, according to Roeseler.
""A possible erosion of lending standards in conjunction with reduced risk provisioning can lead to a threat to financial stability,"" Roeseler said. ""We are therefore taking a closer look at this.""
The survey is still being conducted and Bafin said it would provide results when they were available.
Bafin founded the new department - a so-called intensive care station - at the beginning of this year.
Bafin decided to take this step while the economy was good ""in order to be prepared when there really is a need for a downturn"", he said.
Roeseler added that there were banks on the intensive care station but he would not provide further details except to say it was a single-digit figure.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Vodafone  stepped up its battle to gain regulatory approval for its Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) deal on Tuesday by offering rival  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland access to its enlarged high-speed broadband network.
The world's No.2 mobile operator agreed a year ago to pay $22 billion for Liberty's cable networks in Germany and central Europe, seeking increased fixed-line heft to better compete with German market leader Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn).
Seeking to increase competition in the German market and defuse criticism of the deal, Vodafone on Tuesday said that Telefonica Deutschland would be able to offer super-fast services over Vodafone and Liberty's Unitymedia cable networks in Germany if the deal is approved. 
The networks will cover 23.7 million households and would help Telefonica Deutschland to move up from its distant third position in fixed-line broadband, behind Deutsche and Vodafone. 
Telefonica Deutschland Chief Executive Markus Haas said the agreement would enable it to connect millions of additional households in Germany with high-speed internet. 
""By adding fast cable connections, we now have access to an extensive infrastructure portfolio and can offer to even more O2 customers attractive broadband products – including internet-based TV with O2 TV – for better value for money,"" he said. 
Telefonica Deutschland has nearly a quarter of the German mobile market, second to Deutsche and ahead of Vodafone, according to a 2018 estimate by VATM, which represents independent telecom firms. But it has long trailed rivals in the fixed-line broadband market, with just 5.9 percent.
U.S.based Liberty Global, which has extensive international operations, has already sold its Austrian business and is now seeking to exit Switzerland as well as Germany and central Europe in what would be its biggest ever divestment.
It had 13 million subscriptions and made revenue of $700 million in Germany in the first quarter of this year.
CEO Mike Fries said in a statement on Monday night he was confident the deal could be completed this summer. ""We have crossed a number of key milestones and the European Commission is currently in the final stages of its review,"" he said.
JULY DECISION
Tuesday's announcement was designed to win over regulators in Brussels who are reviewing the proposed merger with Liberty, before a decision by July 9.
Liberty Global was last year given the green light by Brussels to buy Dutch cable operator Ziggo when it agreed to several conditions over access to its network. 
Vodafone and Unitymedia, Liberty's German business, operate in different parts of the country and do not compete head to head. Nick Read, CEO of Vodafone Group (LON:VOD), said the deal would be transformational, offering high speeds for consumers and renewed competition in the four markets. 
But a merged entity would have a very strong position in cable and broadband, in particular to multi-family apartment blocks, leading competitors to urge regulators to step in and ensure that they also have 'last-mile' access to households.
Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges initially clashed with Vodafone's then-CEO Vittorio Colao over the Liberty deal last year, saying it was unacceptable because it would create a cable TV monopoly in Germany.
Hoettges later softened his criticism, instead calling for the regulatory burden to be eased on Deutsche Telekom which is required to open up its German fixed-line network to competitors at controlled prices. 
Deutsche Telekom said on Tuesday the Vodafone offer to open its network showed the British company was desperate to keep its deal alive. The proposal would not lead to a single additional broadband cable being laid in Germany, it added, and could even slow work to build out super-fast fibre-optic networks - a government priority.
Jefferies analyst Ulrich Rathe said the offer was only a proposed remedy at this stage, and would still need to be accepted. 
""This would improve the ability of mobile-centric Telefonica Deutschland to address convergence tactics by Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone,"" he said. ""For Deutsche Telekom, this spells downside to otherwise expected wholesale revenue from Telefonica.""
The European Commission opened a full-scale probe into the deal in December. Sources, however, said last month it had not raised any major concerns about the impact of the deal on Germany's cable market. 

Shares in Vodafone rose 1 percent by 1050 GMT, while Telefonica Deutschland gained 2.5 percent. Deutsche Telekom was up almost 1 percent.

1102,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2019 06:56AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Head Lower Again on China Trade Jitters,"Investing.com -- U.S. futures were set for another bumpy ride at the opening Tuesday, after China warned that it was ready to let trade talks with the U.S. collapse – at least temporarily.
“The Chinese public wants an agreement, but meanwhile is well prepared for other potential outcomes, including a temporary breakdown in talks,” said an editorial in the Global Times, an English-language publication that regularly serves as a mouthpiece for official Chinese foreign policy.
The comments came after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer confirmed that the U.S. will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% as of Friday, a step that sharply escalates the trade dispute between the two countries after months of talks that appeared to be making progress in avoiding such an outcome.
Dow futures were down 125 points or 0.5% by 6:50 AM ET (1050 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 15 points or 0.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures was down 46 points or 0.6%.
The same concerns about trade wars and global growth led U.S. crude oil futures to dip as low as $61.64 a barrel, down nearly 1% from late Monday.
“Overall, markets appear to be taking a sanguine view on the Trump China trade deal 'tweets' after the initial 'helter skelter',” said Marc Ostwald, a strategist with ADM ISI in London. He suggested markets are interpreting President Trump’s tweets as an attempt to ‘game’ China in the final stages of the negotiation, and part of a routine aimed at squeezing maximum capital out of any deal that is ultimately agreed – “even if the details of any deal that may be reached may well be very meagre fare.”
Tuesday’s earnings schedule is dominated by the health sector, with Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) all set to report before the open.
Earlier in Europe, Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) fell 2.1% after its first-quarter sales and profit both fell short of expectations, due largely to currency headwinds. The company said it’s looking at a partial sale of its Asian brewing operations through an IPO, in order to pay down a debt burden that investors still see as worryingly high.
Elsewhere in commodities, gold futures were little changed at $1,282.65 a troy ounce, while in the currency market, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was also effectively flat at 97.21."
1103,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>","Investments, legal charge put brakes on BMW","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW's first-quarter operating profit fell 78 percent to 589 million euros, despite higher deliveries of luxury vehicles, as the carmaker felt the effects of higher investment spending and a 1.4 billion euro ($1.6 bln) legal provision.
The European Commission last month told German carmakers they face hefty fines for alleged collusion in the area of emissions filtering technology. BMW denies participating in anti-trust activities and is contesting the allegations. 
Adding to the downbeat tone, the company reiterated that it expects group profit before tax to be well below the previous year's level. It also sees weaker car sales in the first half of 2019 as factories are retooled to produce a new 1-series and 3-series.
BMW's first-quarter earnings before interest and taxes were below the 666 million euros forecast in an analyst poll. A contribution of 648 million euros from financial services only partially offset a 310 million euros loss before interest and taxes at the automotive division.
BMW also booked a 328 million euro valuation gain from BMW and Daimler's mobility services business, the carmaker said. 
Analysts said BMW's results were underwhelming, adding that sales of electric and hybrid cars were not stellar. Shares fell 1.6 percent by 1045 GMT.
""As most companies have done, BMW points towards a stronger second half this year. We remain skeptical regarding this optimism as we don't see much stronger end-markets,"" analysts at Evercore ISI said, citing trade tensions and emissions rules as risks.
SAVINGS TARGET
The carmaker struck to its full year outlook of an increase in vehicle deliveries, and its goal of aiming for an EBIT margin of between 8 percent and 10 percent. 
Due to the antitrust proceedings, it expects a margin in the automotive segment of between 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent, the carmaker said. 
Investments into new technologies and the rising cost of complying with stricter carbon emissions legislation are also likely to have a dampening effect on earnings. 
BMW said spending on property plants and equipment jumped 36 percent to 999 million euros in the first quarter as BMW prepares its factories to launch new vehicles like the 3-series and to build next generation electric and hybrid cars. 
Rising trade tensions between China and the United States may dampen earnings further and could depress profits by a low triple digit million euros amount, but will not threaten the company's guidance, BMW's Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said. 
To counter rising costs, BMW said it will cut the available engine and gearbox combinations by 50 percent and seek efficiency savings of more than 12 billion euros by the end of 2022.
Excluding the impact of the legal provision, BMW's automotive division delivered an operating margin of 5.6 percent in the first quarter. It would have been around 1 percentage point higher if profits from BMW's China operations were counted.
By contrast the return on sales at Mercedes-Benz passenger cars fell to 6.1 percent, down from 9 percent a year earlier and rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said the return on sales for its passenger cars business will be at the lower end of its 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent margin target this year.
BMW said orders for its X7 sports utility vehicle had exceeded expectations as the carmaker enters the high-end sports utility vehicle segment with its core brand.
BMW said it will contest the European Commission's allegations that its participation in industry working groups amounted to anti-competitive behavior.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Petrobras plan to end refining monopoly in Brazil comes with caveats,"By Gram Slattery and Marta Nogueira
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA drew plaudits from investors last month for announcing a plan to sell off eight of its refineries in a process the company says could fetch some $15 billion.
But analysts and industry experts say that while the divestments will help Petrobras shore up its finances, it may fail to create a competitive refining market in Brazil, an oft-stated goal of regulators and Petrobras executives. 
That's because the company is hanging onto its refineries in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, home to over 60 million Brazilians. They collectively process about 1.1 million barrels of oil per day, according to Brazil's oil regulator, about half of the company's total capacity.
""I think it's a little bit for show to make it seem like the refining market is being opened up,"" said Alberto Barriga, a former refining executive at Petrobras and a partner at consultancy Bizup. ""But it won't make any difference in terms of competition as the distance between refineries is large and transport will be too expensive (to move fuel between regions).""
In response to questions from Reuters, Petrobras said its refineries in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro will be subject to competition from fuel imports and cabotage, or the transport of fuel from other refineries within Brazil.
It added that four of the five refineries it will retain are integrated by pipelines and other infrastructure, making the sale of individual assets difficult. In addition, the facilities' proximity to Brazil's prolific Campos and Santos offshore oil basins supports its view that they are strategic, Petrobras added.
Truckers protesting high diesel prices last year led Brazil's government, under former President Michel Temer, to demand that Petrobras cut fuel prices, a move that hit the company's shares and triggered the chief executive's departure. 
That intervention and a more recent one by new President Jair Bolsonaro underline how politics often impinge on the Brazilian energy sector. 
Some analysts have said breaking up Petrobras' monopoly on refining could help lower prices at the pump by boosting competition and lessen the firm's exposure to meddling from Brasilia.
But the prospect of political interference could dampen investor interest in the refineries.
Petrobras' plan to retain the refineries in the country's economic sweet spot could also run afoul of antitrust regulator Cade, which in December opened an inquiry into Brazil's refining market.
""Whatever model Petrobras ends up using is going to have to pass through Cade. Does it stimulate competition? Or does it generate regional monopolies?"" said Adriano Pires, a consultant for Brazil's Center for Infrastructure. 
""It could be that Cade makes them sell something (in Rio or Sao Paulo).""
Among the natural buyers for the refineries are national fuel distribution firms such as Raizen and Ipiranga, the fuel distribution unit of Ultrapar Participacoes SA, as well as trading firms that have established a presence in Brazil such as  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) PLC and Vitol SA, analysts say.
Petrobras distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA is also seen as a potential candidate after its planned privatization.
But for a successful sale, the government will have to prove its free-market credentials.
""The government has to decide if it believes in the market or not,"" said Edmar de Almeida, a professor and researcher and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

Demand for dairy products in Asia, led by China, has been climbing rapidly in recent years as people with higher incomes turn to protein-rich foods.
""We are trying to do an index in the dairy space, skimmed milk powder to start with,"" said Fiona Boal, head of Commodities and Real Assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""We are doing that at the request of the industry, ... reason being is that they felt they are left out of financialization of commodity markets.""
She said the planned index will take into account markets in the United States, Europe and New Zealand.
""(We plan to launch it) maybe by end of this year. There are some challenges around creating a global index, for how we weigh the index,"" she told Reuters, adding that the index would likely be trade-weighted rather than production weighted.
""You want the index to be useful to farmers and investors.""
Last week, New Zealand dairy group Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd said that local milk production in March dropped 8 percent year-on-year, but exports rose as Asian demand remained robust.
Exports from New Zealand surged 27 percent in February, the world's largest dairy company said in a statement, with shipments to China increasing 11 percent over the month.
Boal said the dairy industry was keen on adding liquidity.
""It is an interesting example where the industry thinks that by adding additional liquidity... is highly valuable.""

Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr added it was unlikely a single buyer could acquire all Thomas Cook airlines due to antitrust regulations and declined to comment on the offer price.
""We decided yesterday in the meeting of the management board to bid for all of Condor with the option to be able to extend this (bid) to all Thomas Cook airlines,"" Spohr said on the sidelines of Lufthansa's annual general meeting in Bonn.
Thomas Cook shares were up more than 10 percent while Lufthansa shares declined 1.4 percent.
Thomas Cook put its profitable airlines business up for sale in February after profit warnings in 2018 left it needing to raise cash.
The indebted travel group's airlines business consists of Germany's Condor, as well as British, Scandinavian and Spanish operations.
Sources said earlier this month that Indigo Partners and Lufthansa were most interested in the business, with a deadline of May 7 set for expressions of interest.
Lufthansa's Spohr earlier this year said his company will be an active player in consolidation among European airlines.
Lufthansa, which owns airlines like Swiss and Austrian Airlines, has also expressed its interest in Italian flagship carrier Alitalia.

Spohr on Tuesday reiterated that Lufthansa would only be interested in the loss-making company if it were restructured and the Italian government left out.

Germany continues to be a hit by an economic slowdown and lower car sales due to the introduction of new emissions standards, Adecco said on Tuesday, as it reported a 2 percent fall in first-quarter revenue.
""The new law on emissions... has created a bottleneck and is slowing down seriously the sales of new cars in Germany,"" Dehaze said. ""Around 30 percent of our revenues come from the automotive industry; this had an impact in the previous quarter and continued to have an impact in this quarter.""
Adecco said it had problems finding enough qualified professional staff -- particularly IT workers -- in the United States, where unemployment has hit its lowest level in nearly 50 years.
Some companies had started offshoring workers, while there was also a lack of workers with required skills.

1113,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2019 04:34AM ET</span>",StockBeat: U.K. Utilities Hit By Labour's Nationalization Plans,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The specter of socialism is starting to haunt U.K. stocks again.
Water providers  Severn Trent  (LON:SVT) and  United Utilities  (LON:UU) are two of the worst-performers on the FTSE 100 as the London market reopened after a public holiday on Monday, thanks to a report on Sunday detailing Labour Party plans to bring them back under public ownership if it wins the next general election.
The Sunday Times cited a briefing paper drafted by senior party officials saying that the entire U.K. water industry should be nationalized. While that’s been official Labour policy since Jeremy Corbyn took over as leader in 2015, the report indicates a willingness to be aggressive in expropriating current owners: the paper suggests compensation for them should be capped at 20 billion pounds. The U.K.’s water regulator Ofwat valued the industry’s assets at 73 billion pounds in its last review.
The water companies, like the U.K.’s energy utilities, were mostly privatized in the 1990s by a Conservative government that promised they would be run more efficiently. According to a study by Friederike Lauruschkus of consulting firm Civity, Britons do indeed pay 30% less than French and German consumers for their water, although she said the U.K. figures are flattered by hidden subsidies.
Moreover, the U.K. still loses almost a fifth of overall supply to leaks, something that sits uncomfortably with the water companies’ record as generous dividend payers.
But nervous shareholders can take comfort from the fact that a future Labour government would face serious financial and reputational costs from the approach outlined in the paper. Aside from the costs, it would likely face lawsuits from owners such as Cheung Kong, the owner of Northumbrian Water, whose ownership rights are protected by an investment treaty with Hong Kong.
Severn Trent and  Pennon  Group (LON:PNN) both fell 2% in early trading while United Utilities fell 1.7%. All later trimmed losses, pulled up by the broader market. At 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.3%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.1% at 387.14. Germany’s Dax was 0.1% lower, weighed down by disappointing results from BMW (DE:BMWG) and consumer products group Henkel (DE:HNKG_p).

G4S acknowledged Garda's decision and said it had not received any proposals or requests for extension of the May 8 deadline from the Canadian firm during the offer period.
Garda said on Sunday it did not intend to make an offer for G4S, having previously said it was considering a cash offer for some or all of the company.
Shares of G4S, the world's largest listed security company, recouped some initial losses to trade down 5.6 percent as of 0711 GMT, after it also said it would focus on its previously announced review to separate its cash solutions unit.
""The Group is making good progress in its plans to enable it to commence separation of the cash business in the second half of 2019,"" G4S said in a statement.
The change in Garda's plan, however, comes as a blow to G4S which has been working to rebuild its reputation after a series of scandals, most notably a failure in 2012 to provide enough guards for the Olympic Games in London.
G4S stock had hit a six-month high in April when news of a potential offer from Garda first surfaced.

SocGen, as the bank is known, told investors it expected that revenue in its domestic retail network will first remain unchanged or fall by 1 percent in 2019 because of persistently low interest rates, while costs will rise between 1 percent and 2 percent as the bank implements automation processes.
As a result of this year's transformation, SocGen now expects costs to start falling in 2020, while it sees revenues rising, boosting return on net equity to between 11.5 percent and 12.5 percent, the bank said in a presentation to investors.
Major European banks have found it tough to keep up their levels of profits, as years of record low interest rates in the region have hit returns on retail banking. Most banks such as SocGen have grown more dependent on the volatile investment and corporate banking business. 

A general market downturn in 2018 has badly hit SocGen, so the bank's chief executive Frederic Oudea has launched a broad transformation plan to make its investment and corporate banking arm safer and its retail bank more profitable.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares staggered up from five-week lows on Tuesday but remained fragile after U.S. President Donald Trump's latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods shocked financial markets and fueled worries that trade talks may be derailed. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1 percent, erasing earlier losses. It tumbled 2 percent on Monday after Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on Beijing in the midst of trade negotiations.
Chinese shares staged a mild technical rebound but stayed choppy after their worst drop in more than three years on Monday. The benchmark Shanghai Composite was 0.5 percent higher, while the blue-chip CSI 300 rose 0.7 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.3 percent.
Japan's Nikkei shed 1.5 percent, taking a delayed hit as the country's financial markets opened on Tuesday after a 10-day break to mark the ascension of a new emperor.
Financial spread-betters expect London's FTSE, Frankfurt's DAX and Paris's CAC to fall between 0.1 and 0.3 percent when they open.
U.S. stock futures for the S&P 500 declined as much as 0.8 percent in Asian trading hours on Tuesday as top U.S. officials said China had backtracked on commitments in trade talks.
Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week and would ""soon"" target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs, prompting investors to dump risky assets on Monday.
Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo, believed stocks have entered a new downtrend as investors had growing doubts over whether the United States and China would cut a deal on trade any time soon.
""Investors had been too complacent since the beginning of this year. Now it's time for 'sell in May and go away,'"" he said.
Still, some investors are holding out hope that the tariff threats are a negotiating tactic.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he expected top Chinese negotiator Vice Premier Liu He would lead a delegation coming from Beijing for talks in Washington on Thursday and Friday.
""Markets are still not sure (whether Trump will go ahead with the tariff hikes,) and far from a panicky situation. We have to see how the U.S.-China talks will unfold this week,"" said Naoki Iwami, fixed income chief investment officer at Whiz Partners.

Australia's dollar became the biggest mover among the major currencies, strengthening as much as 0.9 percent to a one-week top of $0.7048, after the country central bank's decision to hold rates wrongfooted some who had expected a cut.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>",Trump's tariff push squeezes businesses and consumers,"By Lisa Baertlein and Jason Lange
LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The first time President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on the luggage that Tiffany Williams (NYSE:WMB) imports for her Texas store, she stockpiled high-end suitcases and other products ahead of the deadline to protect profits.
This time, she may not have that option.
Trump on Sunday vowed to lift tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of this week if no trade pact is sealed between the world's two largest economies.
Williams sources about 85 percent of the products for her business, Luggage Shop of Lubbock, from China, and she bought heavily before Trump's first round of 10 percent hit last fall.
""This time we will not have that opportunity. We won't be able to load up,"" said Williams, who voted for Trump.
Her sales are down since November, under pressure from tariff-related sticker-shock on her mainstay high-end products and competition from online rivals like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
In an email on Monday she shared with Reuters, Samsonite told her it would again raise prices to match the tariffs- if Trump makes good on his threat.
""We are optimistic this saber rattling ahead of the planned China/USA trade meeting this week will be reversed,"" the email said. Samsonite did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
Trump has insisted that China has picked up the tab for his tariff campaign, not American consumers.
But prices are up on a host of products as diverse as bicycles, sewing machines and pet supplies, and government data shows U.S. consumers have already had to pay more since the first round of tariffs kicked in last fall.
The price of sewing machines, which were hit in September by the original 10 percent tariff rate, have risen 10.3 percent in the 12 months through March. That is the biggest annual gain since the Labor Department started tracking prices for the appliance in 1997.
Trump also ordered 10 percent tariffs on pet supplies and bicycles. The inflation rate for pet supplies rose to 4 percent as of March, while the rate for bicycles and related sporting equipment went from about zero in October to 3 percent in March.
Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton and Columbia universities, published in March, estimated the tariffs cost U.S. consumers at least $6.9 billion last year.
Graphic: Tariff pressures - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wvh0jU
FRONT LOADING
In a comment letter last year objecting to the tariffs, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc warned that retailers would be pressured to raise prices on car seats, cribs and backpacks.
""For lower-income families, a 25 percent tax on these items would be a serious burden on household finances,"" Walmart wrote.
Walmart and rival  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) were among a swarm of retailers that pulled forward shipments of apparel, microwaves and furniture before the original Jan. 1 deadline for tariffs to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent. Walmart and Target declined comment on the newest developments.
To be sure, most U.S. consumer prices have risen only modestly since September when Trump imposed the first 10 percent levies. The tariffs largely hit components of consumer goods rather than final products, diffusing the impact across America's $20-trillion economy.
Some companies also accepted lower profit margins in order to keep from passing higher costs onto consumers. Overall prices, as measured by the Labor Department's consumer price index, rose just 1.9 percent in the 12 months through March.
Tom Derry, chief executive at the Institute for Supply Management, which surveys purchasing managers at major business each month, said many companies appeared to be treating tariffs as a temporary nuisance. That has made it easier for suppliers and purchasers to split costs between them in the interest of future business relations.
But a jump in tariffs to 25 percent would signal a more enduring rise in costs and hit bottom lines harder for companies that buy and sell those goods. ""No company's profit margin can stand that intense of a hit,"" Derry said.
Steven Smith, owner of Luggage & Leather Depot in Bethesda, Maryland, said a jump in tariffs to 25 percent ""would absolutely kill our business."" He said his sales are off as much as 20 percent after he raised prices to reflect the higher costs.

""If it goes to 25 percent, forget it. People reach a limit,"" Smith said.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 01:05AM ET</span>","As IPO looms, Uber clings to hard-knuckled tactics in pursuit of growth","By Heather Somerville and Joe Bavier
SAN FRANCISCO/ CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick used to tell investors he liked to keep his company teetering between order and chaos.
By the time he left, it was chaos. The company was battered by a slew of scandals, including revelations it had used illicit tactics to handicap competitors and dodge regulators. 
Almost two years later, under new leadership and set to debut Friday on Wall Street in the largest U.S. public stock offering since 2014, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is still testing the rule of law. 
With growth slowing, the company continues to spar with local officials around the world looking to limit Uber cars on their streets.
In Cape Town, South Africa, for example, Uber dominates the market with an estimated 7,000 drivers, most of whom are operating illegally, according to city officials. Uber blames Cape Town's ""broken"" system for approving ride-hailing licenses.
In the United States, Uber has used the courts to try to block what it see as unreasonable restrictions on its business. And it has successfully lobbied state legislatures to pass laws preempting local ride-hailing regulations, much to the frustration of officials in some cities where it operates.
Uber insiders say CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has made strides in cleaning up a frat-house culture that spawned allegations of sexual harassment and embarrassing leaks of executives behaving badly. 
But Uber's sharp-elbowed business tactics, detailed by lawmakers, city staff and regulators across the globe, as well as drivers and former employees, continue to drive the company.
""It's in the DNA,"" a former Uber manager said. ""Old habits die hard.""
Whether its playbook delivers the growth and profitability public market investors will be seeking remains to be seen. Revenue growth slowed to 2.3% in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter, a worrisome sign for a business that lost more than $3 billion last year. 
Uber's economics ""are not immediately or obviously attractive for sustainable, long-term investment,"" Mark Hargraves, Head of Framlington Global Equities at AXA Investment Managers, said in a recent note to clients.
An Uber spokesman declined to comment. In its IPO filing, the company said it is ""using a proactive and collaborative approach with regulators"" and ""rebuilding and strengthening"" its relationships with cities. Where ride-hailing is banned, Uber is instead offering e-bike services or partnering with traditional taxi companies.
Still the company acknowledged ""legal and regulatory obstacles"" around the world that could impede its revenue and growth. 
CAT AND MOUSE IN CAPE TOWN 
Thousands of miles from Wall Street, Uber is pushing the bounds of regulation.
In Chile, which has yet to work out a regulatory framework for ridesharing, Uber drivers have been known to enlist passengers to help them evade transit cops. In Mexico City, Uber has protested new safety rules it says would limit the number of riders who could use the app. In London, Uber is on probation after it was temporarily banned for flouting safety rules.
And in Cape Town, Uber has entered its fifth year of a stalemate with local officials. 
Every ride-hailing service in Cape Town is allotted a certain number of operating licenses for its drivers. As of mid-April, Western Cape Province, where the city is located, had approved 760 such licenses for Uber. But the city estimates there are roughly 10 times that many Uber drivers plying its streets, many of them immigrants or refugees.
Foreign-born drivers must also have work permits, paperwork many of them lack, according to city aldermen and drivers. 
Uber said it allows drivers to start work while their ride-hailing licenses are still pending approval but that the company thoroughly vets the drivers.
A game of cat and mouse has ensued: drivers alert each other to the whereabouts of traffic cops through the WhatsApp mobile messaging service. If their cars are impounded, they pay the fines, start driving anew and wait for Uber to reimburse them. 
Those impound fines start at almost $500 and go up with each subsequent offense, topping out at more than $1,000. Drivers are fined an additional $173 each time.
""It's just like gangsterism fighting for turf,"" said Ivan, a South African driver who gave only his first name.
Uber has spent at least $2.3 million since 2016 to reimburse drivers for the impound fines, according to Reuters' estimate based on data from the city. Uber declined to say how much it had spent, but said it would continue paying the fines to support its drivers and get them back on the road.
South Africa is crucial to Uber's Africa strategy, boasting the continent's most-developed economy. 
A spokesperson for Uber South Africa said Cape Town's licensing system ""is effectively broken"" and blamed the city for what it says is a backlog that can stretch for more than two years in some cases. 
The city estimates there is a market for about 2,100 Uber drivers. Alderman JP Smith said part of Cape Town's calculus is to head off violence that could result if too many taxi drivers are put out of business by new ride-hailing rivals. In the larger cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg, some Uber drivers and cabbies have been killed and their cars torched as part of an ongoing turf war.
""In other parts of the world, if there are too many taxis some just stop being taxis,"" Smith said. ""Here, disputes between taxis are settled via assassination and murder.""
The face-off may not find a resolution any time soon. Cape Town is expanding its impound facilities so it can take in nearly twice the number of cars.
BAD BLOOD
Big cities concerned about gridlock, air quality and the safety of passengers and drivers are crafting new policies and demanding more data from ride-hailing companies to find solutions.
Uber is pushing back. The company sued New York City in February over a law imposing a cap on the number of ride-hailing drivers, a move taken to address worsening traffic. In its hometown of San Francisco, Uber is fighting a court order to turn over data the city says would help improve traffic management and the safety of Uber drivers. 
As city officials in the United States have gotten scrappier, Uber has sought out friendlier state legislators to work around them.
Over just four years, Uber and rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) helped pass laws in 41 states that put ride-hailing under the state's jurisdiction, preempting some or all local regulations, according to a 2018 study by the National Employment Law Project. 
Uber is now pushing legislation in Oregon that would preempt local mandates on driver caps, permits, data collection and access for passengers in wheelchairs, among others.
Uber's general manager for Oregon said the bill would create ""increased mobility for rural and urban communities,"" by bringing Uber to towns that currently do not allow it.
Officials in Portland say their city is in the crosshairs. After Uber launched there in late 2014, Portland sued to stop its operation, declaring it illegal. That suit was later dropped, but Portland regulates Uber closely. 
Noah Siegel, interim assistant director at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, said the proposed legislation would hurt the city's ability to manage growth and ensure everyone can get around safely. 

""We were not really holding a lot of bad blood about what had happened"" with Uber in the past, Siegel said. ""But this bill serves as a reference point that it's only been four years and they still haven't turned a profit and they will do anything to make money.""

1123,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 12:22AM ET</span>","Japan's SoftBank set for small profit rise, Vision Fund IPO plans eyed","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp is expected to report a small rise in its fourth-quarter profit, while investors look for details on whether the conglomerate plans to monetize its almost $100 billion Vision Fund through an IPO. 
SoftBank is considering taking the Saudi-backed investment fund public, a source said on Friday, adding that no formal process has been started. 
Shares of the group rose as much as 4 percent on Monday as trading resumed after Japan's extended ""Golden Week"" holidays.
Following the listing of the group's domestic telco SoftBank Corp in December, the Vision Fund is the largest segment in SoftBank's earnings without a market valuation. 
It is, however, unclear how the world's largest technology investment fund could be listed in its current form.
SoftBank is expected to post on Thursday a 1 percent rise in operating profit to 156 billion yen ($1.41 billion) for the three months ended March, an average estimate of three analysts polled by Refinitiv shows. SoftBank has not provided a forecast and moved to new accounting standards this financial year. 
The results come at a potential inflection point for the group and the Vision Fund as portfolio companies like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and the owner of WeWork, The We Company, prepare to list, putting a price tag on some of the conglomerate's largest bets on unlisted startups.
With investors struggling to quantify Vision Fund's growing investments amid a lack of clarity over its valuation methods, analysts think the listings could help underscore its strategy.
Given the group's focus on technology companies, ""if something happens to that sector it could be very negative"", said Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar.
Uber is set to price its $10 billion IPO on May 9, seeking a valuation of up to $90 billion. That is lower than what Uber insiders had hoped for, but investors have reported strong demand for the shares.
The lower valuation comes after rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) Inc's poor stock performance after its market debut. That reflects investor scepticism over Lyft's path to profitability, with peers likes Uber and WeWork also heavily losing money.
In China, Sequoia Capital China, viewed as a bellwether for tech investment, is set to lay off as much as 20 percent of investment staff as a slowdown in the tech sector saps appetite for risk, two people have said.
While the Vision Fund has previously profitably exited its stakes in Indian online retailer FlipKart, which it sold to Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and in already-public chipmaker Nvidia Corp, Uber will be its first portfolio company to go public.
SoftBank's rapidly growing investments continue to cause investor headaches in valuing the business, while also raising concerns about returns and SoftBank's indebtedness. 
Last week, a newly created Latin America-focused fund under SoftBank Group COO Marcelo Claure made its first move after SoftBank announced a $1 billion investment in Colombian delivery app Rappi.
WEAK TELCO RESULTS
SoftBank Group's domestic telco reports its financial results a day ahead of its parent. Three analysts on average see a weak end to SoftBank Corp's year, with operating profit set to fall 11 percent to 94 billion yen. 
While the telco hopes a series of joint ventures with SoftBank portfolio companies will help drive growth, pressure on carrier fees have left many investors in wait-and-see mode. 
Sprint Corp, a SoftBank unit, and T-Mobile US Inc last month extended the deadline for completing their $26 billion merger, as regulators have yet to decide whether to approve the transaction announced a year ago.
SoftBank Group's shares have risen 60 percent this year, but the telco's shares are down 5 percent and languish 14 percent below their December 1,500 yen IPO price.
SoftBank Group's shares were up 0.9 percent at 1300 local time (0400 GMT), while SoftBank Corp's shares down 1.3 percent in line with the broader market.

1124,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks See Muted Gains After Monday's $487 Billion Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- There was no rush to buy the dip in Chinese stocks after their biggest rout in more than three years.
The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent at the mid-day break after losing 5.6 percent Monday. The declines, which wiped out $487 billion from the value of Chinese shares, followed two tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week over the pace of trade talks. His top trade negotiator late Monday confirmed the plans. The offshore yuan slightly extended losses after China’s state-run Global Times newspaper said the country is ready for temporary breakdown in trade talks.
Volume on the Shanghai measure was 32 percent lower than the 30-day average at this time of the day, suggesting there was little conviction in Tuesday’s rebound. Defensive stocks led gains, with consumer discretionary and health-care stocks among sectors rising most on the CSI 300 Index.
“Markets are shaky right now,” said Yu Yingbo, investment director at Shenzhen Qianhai United Fortune Fund Management Co. “The uncertainties are still too many. Trump has taken advantage of the one factor that the Chinese government has little control over.”
Technology shares, which had become a trade-war proxy, particularly suffered in China on Monday. Optimism that China and the U.S. would reach a deal on trade helped make Shanghai equities the hottest in the world this year until last week. The benchmark has failed to hold above a number of key support levels as popular trades unraveled amid lackluster corporate earnings and concern Beijing is easing back on stimulus.
State-backed media has sought to downplay the rout: there was barely any mention of the stock tumble on Tuesday. An article published by the China Securities Journal, one of the country’s most widely circulated financial dailies, argued that the bull market will resume. Only one Chinese-language newspaper featured escalating trade tensions on its front page.
The Shanghai Composite traded at 2,916, below the key 3,000 level that acted as a support last month. PetroChina Co. and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. -- which saw sharp moves in late trading Monday amid speculation Chinese state funds were stepping in to support the market -- were among the biggest drags in Shanghai. Shenzhen stocks fared better, with the benchmark gaining 1.5 percent.
When Stocks Crash, China Turns to Its ‘National Team’: QuickTake
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index was little changed in Hong Kong, while the city’s equity benchmark gained 0.3 percent. The offshore yuan slipped as much as 0.38 percent to 6.7989 per dollar.
There is at least 30 percent chance that the U.S. and China will fail to reach a deal to end the trade war, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note dated Monday. The danger is that both sides may believe their negotiating position has strengthened and may be less willing to compromise, they wrote.
“The market won’t be trading with a clear direction in the near term,"" said Zhang Gang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co. “There will definitely be more twists and turns along the way before both parties reach a trade deal that everyone wants to see. The market could still be impacted in the short term.""

1125,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 11:30PM ET</span>",Trump's Tariffs on Chinese Electric Cars Seen Likely to Last,"(Bloomberg) -- With China bent on dominating the future of electric vehicles, President Donald Trump is likely to erect trade barriers targeting that technology in the form of stiff new tariffs that will have staying power, according to a consultant on the country’s auto market.
“I expect that President Trump will keep tariffs on electric cars as high as he possibly can,” Michael Dunne, chief executive officer of consultancy ZoZo Go, said Monday in a speech to the Automotive Press Association in Detroit. “He can see all this capacity gathering in China, and they’re bound to want to export to the U.S., so ‘let’s not make that easy.’”
China’s government is pouring $100 billion into becoming the global leader in electric vehicles, Dunne said. Last year, Chinese consumers purchased 1.2 million battery-powered autos, compared with about 350,000 in the U.S. Trump’s tough tariff talk, which has unsettled the Chinese government as much as it has rattled markets, is aimed at protecting technological innovation in the U.S., Dunne said.
Trump “believes that by threatening tariffs, this really puts a scare into the Chinese, and it seems to have gotten their attention,” Dunne said. “The tariffs are almost a psychological tactic to undercut the confidence of the average Chinese businessman and consumer. But the real story remains technology. Tariffs are almost a decoy -- technology is what the trade negotiators are working on.”
On the back of China’s booming electric-vehicle industry, global automakers have drawn up plans to step up EV production in the country, with a view of exporting those to other markets. BMW AG said last year it plans to sell its first all-electric sport utility vehicle, dubbed the iX3, around the world including in North America after production starts next year.
Local Chinese brands also have U.S. ambitions. Electric-car startup Byton plans to begin selling its $45,000 M-Byte sport utility vehicle in the U.S. in 2020, while the maker of the petite Pickman electric pickup truck is targeting to sell as many as 10,000 units in the country this year.
For now, China’s car exports have been modest. While more than 28 million autos are sold in China each year, the country only exported 1.2 million vehicles in 2018, including 147,000 new-energy vehicles, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Exports of new-energy vehicles to the U.S. were less than 10,000 units last year, according to an estimate by Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the car-industry body.
Trade tensions between the U.S. and China flared after Trump’s surprise announcement over Twitter on May 5 that he planned to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent because talks were moving too slowly. The president said he may also impose duties “shortly” on $325 billion of Chinese goods that aren’t currently covered, a move that would hit virtually all imports from the Asian nation.
Trump’s top trade negotiator said the U.S. plans to raise tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday, accusing Beijing of backpedaling on commitments it made during negotiations.

1126,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",Asian Markets Mixed as Investors Digest Latest Sino-U.S. Trade Headlines,"Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed on Tuesday as investors digested the latest news on the Sino-U.S. trade front.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.3% and 1.6% respectively by 10:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.4%.
Chinese stocks recovered from Monday’s losses after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is still set to lead a Chinese delegation in trade talks in Washington on Thursday and Friday even as U.S. President Donald Trump warned that tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods could more than double to 25% from 10% on Friday.
Comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said the U.S. would reconsider the duties if talks get back on track, raised hopes that the two sides might still be able to reach a trade deal.
Japan’s Nikkei 225, which returned for the first day of trading following an extended holiday period, was down 1.0%.
Data showed this morning that the country’s manufacturing activity expanded in April for the first time in three months.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.2 in April from 49.2 in March.
The pick-up ""will be a welcome sign that the recent drop in momentum has potentially subsided for now,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Given the difficulties faced by firms in semi-conductor and automobile-related industries in recent months, it bodes well that anecdotal evidence indicated that stronger optimism was in part driven by more upbeat forecasts for these two key Asian industries.""
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 1.0%, while Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.7%.
Stocks across the globe plunged on Monday after Trump unexpectedly said he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods because negotiations are moving “too slowly”.
“The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” he tweeted.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said about 90% of the pact had been finalized last week, but progress in trade talks deteriorated after China sent through a new draft of a potential agreement over the weekend that saw them pulling back on language in the text on some key issues.
The changes had the “potential to change the deal very dramatically,” Mnuchin said.
“We are not willing to go back on documents that have been negotiated in the past,” he said.
“We felt we were on track to get somewhere. Over the course of last week we have seen an erosion of commitments by China. That in our view is unacceptable,” Lighthizer added."

Li, head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX), has long wished for a China foothold to expand its London Metal Exchange (LME) franchise, but has faced reluctance from Chinese regulators concerned with protecting emerging local exchanges in the world's biggest consumer of metals.
""We have been talking about LME warehousing in China, it's not going to be an easy subject,"" said Li, speaking at an event in Hong Kong. ""We are working with the Guangdong government (to see) if we can experiment a pilot scheme for warehousing.""
Warehouses are a critical part of the LME's price-setting function because they act as a market of last resort; a buyer for sellers in need; and a store of metal for those who need to purchase, a mechanism that roots exchange prices in the physical market.
The bourse still requires consent from regulators to go ahead with the pilot plan, Li added.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 10:23PM ET</span>",Kinder Morgan's $1.75 billion gas pipeline hit with steel tariff: filing,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI) will pay a tariff on imported steel used in a $1.75 billion natural gas pipeline project, the U.S. Department of Commerce ruled on Monday, dealing a setback to energy industry efforts to avoid the penalties.
The Trump administration last year slapped a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in a bid to safeguard U.S. jobs against overseas rivals. Energy companies have opposed the tariffs, saying they add cost to businesses contributing to the nation's energy security.
The tariff could add up to $80 million to the construction cost of Kinder Morgan's Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, analysts estimated, because about half the project employs some Turkish pipe subject to a 50 percent tariff. It filed for an exemption nearly a year ago, citing the lack of domestic steel and the economic benefits of natural gas exports.
The 514-mile (827-km) pipeline will carry nearly 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas from Texas fields bottlenecked with rising shale gas production to Gulf Coast export hubs. A portion of the line went into operation in August and full service is expected by October.
Steel required by Kinder Morgan's project is available in sufficient quantities and quality from U.S. manufacturers, a Commerce Department review found.
Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Katherine Hill declined to comment on the decision.
In its request for an exemption, Kinder Morgan said the pipeline ""not only will enable producers to transport and sell natural gas to consuming markets, it also will unlock additional upstream oil production,"" of more than 1 million barrels of oil.
After it sought the exemption last May, President Donald Trump authorized the Commerce Department to double tariffs on Turkish steel to 50 percent as a dispute deepened with Turkey over an American pastor detained in the country. The pastor was released in October but the higher tariff remained.
Several U.S. steel makers, including Berg Steel Pipe and Stupp Corp, as well as the American Line Pipe Producers Association (ALPPA), an industry group, had filed objections to Kinder's request, stating they could supply domestic materials for the project.
""ALPPA commends the Commerce Department for denying this exclusion request given the ability of several domestic manufacturers to supply this product,"" said Tim Brightbill, a partner with Wiley Rein LLP, who represents ALPPA.
Objections from steel makers weigh heavily on decisions made by Commerce, the department has said.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 09:03PM ET</span>","Anadarko backs Occidental's revised bid, pressuring Chevron to respond","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) Corp's board on Monday backed a $38 billion bid from Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), adding pressure on rival  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) to raise its offer or walk away from the takeover contest. 
The decision capped a series of moves by Occidental to finance and reduce hurdles before its $38 billion deal after Anadarko balked at several earlier offers. Occidental received the board's endorsement after raising $18.8 billion in cash pledges that allowed it to avoid a vote by its shareholders on the deal.
Chevron has four days to decide whether it wants to alter an existing merger agreement that Anadarko already accepted or make a new bid. A spokesman confirmed it had receive the notice of termination from Anadarko and declined comment on its next steps.
Anadarko said its board had unanimously determined that the revised Occidental proposal constituted a ""superior proposal"" and that it intended to terminate the Chevron merger agreement, a decision that would see it pay Chevron a $1 billion termination fee.
The decision was a victory for Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, who pressed Anadarko's board to reject the Chevron agreement and pulled in support from billionaire Warren Buffett for the deal. She convinced Buffett to invest $10 billion in the deal after flying to Omaha, Nebraska, to make the case.
Days later, Hollub won a deal with French oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) to take most of Anadarko's international assets, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique estimated to cost up to $25 billion to complete. Total agreed to pay $8.8 billion for the assets once the merger goes ahead. 
Hollub wants her target's prime position in the top U.S. shale field. Anadarko holds nearly a quarter million acres (102,000 hectares) of land in the Permian Basin, the biggest prize for Chevron and Occidental. The Permian has become the epicenter of the shale oil-and-gas boom, helping drive U.S. oil output to a record 12 million barrels a day (bpd), more than Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
Anadarko first disclosed a merger deal with Chevron on April 12 after snubbing a higher bid from Occidental. That prompted Occidental's Hollub to go public with her offer, to pressure Anadarko to reconsider its stance. 
The change of heart came after Occidental increased the proportion of cash in its $76 per share offer to 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, removing a stock exchange requirement for the approval of Occidental's shareholders.
Some investors in Occidental oppose the decision to bypass a shareholder vote of approval. T. Rowe Price Group Inc, said on Monday it intended to vote against the Occidental board of directors at the annual meeting on Friday in protest.

Occidental said in a statement that it looked forward to completing the discussions and ""executing our merger agreement with Anadarko to complete this exciting transaction.""

1131,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 07:30PM ET</span>",Ex-Goldman Banker in Plea Talks Ahead of 1MDB Trial in New York,"(Bloomberg) -- Former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). banker Roger Ng is in plea talks to avoid a U.S. trial on charges that he broke American anti-bribery laws and conspired to launder money embezzled from Malaysia’s state investment fund 1MDB.
Ng arrived in New York from Malaysia early Monday and appeared in federal court in Brooklyn, where he entered a not guilty plea. But Magistrate Peggy Kuo said at his arraignment that a constitutional guarantee to a speedy trial was being set aside because the two sides are “engaged in plea negotiations.”
Asked about the talks after court, Ng’s lawyer Marc Agnifilo walked back the suggestion of talks with prosecutors, saying: “We are not in active plea negotiations.” He said Ng “will consider all options available to every defendant.”
""It’s really too early to tell,” Agnifilo said. “It’s hard to manage a case with a client in jail on the other side of the Earth.”
Prosecutors alleged bribes and kickbacks were paid in connection with Goldman’s bond offerings on 1MDB’s behalf, which helped the fund raise more than $6 billion and which generated some $600 million in fees for the bank. Former senior Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by paying bribes to Malaysia and Abu Dhabi officials and circumventing Goldman’s internal accounting controls.
Ng is also charged with conspiracy to violate the FCPA and a money-laundering conspiracy, crimes which carry a maximum sentence of decades in prison.
Jho Low
Also charged is Jho Low, the alleged mastermind behind the multibillion-dollar theft from 1MDB. He remains at large. U.S. prosecutors are looking to sell Low’s $39 million mansion in Los Angeles that he allegedly bought in 2012 with money stolen from the investment fund.
In a statement distributed by public relations firm Reevemark LLC, Low criticized the Malaysian government, accusing it of being politically motivated and persecuting its predecessors with “show trials and abusive use of arrest warrants.”
“It is good that Mr. Ng has been rescued from Malaysia’s inhumane prison conditions and a process controlled by a leader with a history of abusing the judicial system to destroy political opponents,” Low said.
Ng was Leissner’s deputy and left Goldman in 2014. He was detained in Kuala Lumpur in November after the U.S. charges were made public.
Secured Bond
Wearing a blue cotton shirt, dark blue slacks and black sneakers, Ng appeared somewhat disoriented.
Agnifilo said Ng was infected with Dengue fever while in a Malaysian jail and lost a significant amount of weight.
""I thought it made sense to get him here,"" Agnifilo said. ""The U.S. case wasn’t going away and I thought it was better for him to get here and get on with it.""
Ng was granted bail after agreeing to put up $1 million in cash to secure a $20 million bond. He also surrendered his passport and must remain in the New York City area. He’ll be placed under house arrest at a location that hasn’t been publicly disclosed and will be monitored electronically. The next hearing is scheduled for May 23.
Agnifilo said he was in Malaysia in February and told authorities there that his client wanted to come to New York to face the U.S. charges. Ng will stay in the U.S. as long as necessary to fight them, Agnifilo said.
""There’s a tremendous amount to learn,” Agnifilo said on Monday. “Since he’s been in jail in Malaysia I’ve only been able to speak to him for about only four hours.”
Thomas Statement
Malaysia’s Attorney General Tommy Thomas said Ng was extradited on a warrant that allows him to remain in U.S. custody for up to 10 months. The term can be extended if both Malaysia and the U.S. agree, Thomas said in a statement.
After the U.S. prosecution is finished, Ng will return to Malaysia to face separate 1MDB-related charges brought by the Southeast Asian nation, Thomas said.
“This arrangement is further evidence of the strong collaboration between the relevant government agencies of our two countries in all matters pertaining to the massive 1MDB scandal,” Thomas said in the statement.
The agreement to send Ng to the U.S. marks an about-face from Minister of Home Affairs Muhyiddin Yassin’s earlier insistence on delaying his extradition to prioritize the Malaysian case against the former banker. That had risked raising questions over Malaysia’s willingness to cooperate with other jurisdictions in getting to the bottom of the global scandal.
However, Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last week lauded the return of millions of dollars of 1MDB funds from the U.S. and Singapore.
Malaysia has also charged Goldman with misleading investors when it helped 1MDB raise money through bond deals in 2012 and 2013, while knowing that the funds would be misappropriated. Goldman has denied the allegations and said it will defend against the charges.

(Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, said on Monday at the Sohn Investment Conference that his best idea for investors is to buy interest rate volatility on long maturity U.S. Treasuries. 
Gundlach, known as Wall Street's Bond King, said U.S. interest rates ""cannot maintain the low volatility"" they have experienced in the past eight years and it is ""not inconceivable"" that interest-rate volatility could double.
Investors can express the bet through both put and call options at the same strike, or sale, price, he said. Puts give investors the ability to buy, while calls provide the chance to sell. Landing a number where the rate rises or falls more than the total premium on the option could allow investors to book big profits. 

Gundlach recommended using the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF as a way to execute the trade. “I think this is an extremely compelling time to do this trade and an extremely important environment where outcomes are so binary,” he said.

1135,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2019 06:27PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Tariffs, Tariffs, Tariffs
As trading ended Monday, all seemed well on the U.S.-China trade talks. A Chinese delegation was heading to Washington with a 100-or-so team members and the Chinese planned to continue the talks with their counterparts from the Trump administration.
Stocks ended well off their lows.
The reason was that investors and traders believed that President Donald Trump’s threat to bump up tariffs from 10% to 25% on some $200 billion in Chinese-made goods was simply a negotiating tactic.
Maybe it is, but late Monday afternoon in a session with reporters, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the tariffs will be imposed on Friday because China is reneging on earlier commitments.
Futures markets immediately tanked, with Dow futures off 297 points, S&P 500 futures down 38 points and Nasdaq 100 futures down 126 points.
Prices for corn, soybeans and wheat, vulnerable to the vagaries of the trade dispute, also moved lower.
What exactly the issue might be isn’t clear. Lighthizer wasn’t saying, and, in the meantime, the Chinese delegation was still on its way to Washington for talks now set for Thursday and Friday. A mystery is if Liu He, the Chinese vice premier overseeing economic policy, will attend the talks.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said while some concerns arose last week when he and Lighthizer were in Beijing for talks, they received some reassurances. Then, over the weekend, the talks went “substantially backward.”
2. Beaten-Down Lytf Hopes for an Earnings Boost
On the earnings calendar tomorrow, everyone will be looking for the newbie after the bell.
Ride-sharing company  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) reports postmarket. On average, analysts are looking for a loss of $3.33 per share, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Revenue is expected to come in at about $740 million.
This is Lyft’s first earnings report since it’s debut at the end of March. Since then, it’s been hammered by the market. Shares are down more than 22% since the first day of trading.
Also reporting results after the bell is video game company Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA).
EA is expected to report a profit of 99 cents per share on revenue of about $1.2 billion. Both would be down from the year-ago period.But investors will be most interested in any updates on its game pipeline and guidance for the next quarter.
3. Will API Storm up Like EIA?
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data, which showed a second-straight build last week, will be in spotlight on Tuesday, as U.S. output remains at record highs.
Higher U.S. crude output and supplies has been outlined as one of the factors that could keep a lid on oil prices ahead of the upcoming summer driving season, which tends to boost demand for crude.
Crude oil inventories for the week ended 26 April, showed total production reached a record of 12.3 million barrels a day, the Energy Information Administration said last week.
As well as China trade trouble, higher U.S. inventories, rig counts and production adds to some recent bearishness from crude fundamentals heading into the summer demand season, said Robbie Fraser at Schnider Electric.
WTI crude settled 31 cents higher at $62.25 a barrel after the United States deployed bombers and a carrier strike group to the Middle East in response to Iranian threats, stoking tensions in the region."

The bank also said that Philip Berlinski and Jeff Nedelman were being named co-chief operating officers of global equities with Michael Daffey. The three will jointly lead global equities.
Berlinski had been Levine's co-head overseeing global equities trades and execution services, and Nedelman had been the global head of prime services. 
Goldman routinely names multiple co-heads of its business units, and the memos announcing Monday's leadership changes were signed by all three co-heads of the securities business, Ashok Varadhan, R. Martin Chavez and Jim Esposito.
""Brian has played a critical role in developing the firm's leadership position in equities trading,"" they wrote of the outgoing Levine. ""He has helped build systematic trading platforms that will benefit our clients for years to come.""
Levine joined the bank's shares trading desk 25 years ago. He went on to play key roles helping the bank become a market leader in program trading and handled risk management of some of the bank's most important ""capital markets blocks over the past decade,"" according to the note.

Rowe Price Group Inc said on Monday it intends to vote against the Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) board of directors because the oil company will not allow shareholders to vote on its hostile bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), which T. Rowe Price and other shareholders oppose.
Several other investors also said they might vote against approving Occidental's board of directors at the annual meeting on Friday. Occidental on Sunday increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko, removing a requirement for Occidental shareholders to approve the deal.
""We don’t feel we have any choice,"" said fund manager John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. ""We really struggle to understand the logic of not putting a transformational deal to your shareholder base.""
T. Rowe Price, Occidental’s sixth largest shareholder, held 21.1 million shares of the oil company as of Dec. 31, along with 865,000 shares of Anadarko and 8 million in  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), which has a competing bid to pay $33 billion for Anadarko.
Occidental risks the ire of billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who has been amassing a stake in Houston-based oil producer intending to challenge its Anadarko offer, according to sources.
Icahn's involvement throws a wild card into the merger battle, said David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, which held 241,700 shares of Occidental and 61,300 shares of Chevron at the end of April. 
Matrix opposes the merger and may vote against the Occidental board ""to send a message,"" Katz said. ""We don’t think they’re correctly handling their fiduciary decisions.""
Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub on Monday said the decision to increase the cash portion of the offer was designed to address Anadarko's need for greater certainty the deal would go ahead.
""Our objective in doing this was not at all to avoid a shareholder vote. It was to ensure we had a reasonable chance to make this happen,"" she said on a conference call on Monday. ""We weren’t at all on a level playing field,"" she said, noting that the Anadarko board had not yet decided on the offer after lengthy negotiations. 
It has ""been a 12-day process"" and ""our proposal still wasn't deemed superior, which is why we've yesterday submitted the increased cash offer,"" Hollub said.
Occidental's bid includes a pricey financing deal with billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) would receive preferred shares paying an 8 percent dividend. 
""Occidental putting in more cash is really a ploy to not have a shareholder vote,"" said Christian Ledoux, investment chief at South Texas Money Management, which holds shares of Chevron and Occidental. ""That’s upsetting from an investor point of view.""
Ledoux opposes the merger, fearing that Occidental would go into the next oil price downturn with a debt-laden balance sheet. He has not decided how his company will vote on the Occidental proxy. It will wait to see what else develops and whether Icahn takes a stand, Ledoux said. 

""I would imagine there’s going to be a lot of votes against (the board) as a protest,"" Ledoux said.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 05:33PM ET</span>","Tyson Foods expects to profit from hog fever in China, warns it may hit U.S","By Tom Polansek
(Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) said on Monday that the U.S. meat processing industry could reap significant financial gains from a global shortfall in pork as an incurable hog disease spreads rapidly across Asia.
Tyson projected its U.S. pork, chicken and beef units could all benefit from increased demand linked to outbreaks of African swine fever, after the Arkansas company reported quarterly profits above analysts' estimates.
The disease, which is fatal to pigs but harmless to humans, has been detected in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Africa and parts of Europe. 
With African swine fever in China, the world's top hog producer, about 5 percent of the global protein supply has disappeared as demand is rising, Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said. 
China is expected to import more protein to make up for its hog deaths, which White estimated at 150 million to 200 million pigs. The losses could help Tyson by pushing up pork prices and prompting consumers to buy more chicken and beef as alternatives, he said. 
""African swine fever has the potential to impact the global protein industry on a level that we have never experienced,"" White said.
Tyson shares rose 2.6 percent at $77.05 in afternoon trading and reached their highest price since early 2018.
The company could start benefiting from African swine fever outbreaks late in fiscal year 2019, White said.
The disease is already boosting U.S. pork and beef exports and tightening domestic supplies, chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp said last week.
So far, though, U.S. hog prices have climbed faster than those for pork on expectations for increased Chinese demand, crimping processors' margins.
The potential for African swine fever to enter the United States represents a risk to Tyson and its rivals, such as WH Group Ltd's Smithfield Foods. U.S. cases would kill hogs and reduce exports.
""The rate in which it has spread over the course of the last 12 months makes it very plausible that it could come to the United States,"" White said. 
African swine fever also could hurt Tyson by raising input costs for pork used in prepared food products. 
Tyson tempered an annual outlook for its prepared foods unit to a range of 10 percent to 12 percent return on sales, from closer to 12 percent previously.
The company plans to raise prices for prepared foods over the next six months to compensate for more expensive raw materials, White said. He said higher meat costs will reduce demand among some consumers.
Last year, sales in Tyson's prepared foods segment reached about $8.7 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in pork, $12 billion in chicken and $15.5 billion in beef.
""We do not yet understand how pork and prepared food margins will be anything but impaired under the weight of higher hog costs,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.
Profits in the quarter ended March 30 benefited from higher sales in beef and prepared foods.

Excluding certain items, Tyson earned $1.20 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.14. Quarterly sales were $10.44 billion, above expectations for $10.29 billion.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 04:53PM ET</span>","AIG profit beats on strong underwriting, lower costs; shares up 6 percent","(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Wall Street estimates on Monday, as its general insurance business posted its first underwriting profit since the financial crisis.
Shares of the company rose more than 6 percent after Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault said he expects the company to record an underwriting profit for the full year.
The general insurance unit's underwriting income, which is the difference between premiums an insurer collects on policies and claims it pays out, was $179 million in the latest quarter, compared with an underwriting loss of $251 million a year earlier.
Adjusted income from the business rose more than two-fold to $1.27 billion.
Duperreault, who took the helm at AIG in May 2017, has been overhauling AIG's underwriting culture, which has for years focused on chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks.
The CEO and his deputies have been telling staff to be more selective about clients and wind down or revise unprofitable policies. AIG is also buying reinsurance to mitigate losses on old business.
The general insurance unit's accident year combined ratio - which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years - was 96.1 for the quarter, compared with 99.7 a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
The accident year ratio is a measurement that Duperreault has cited as the best gauge of the unit's long-term profitability. The number excludes catastrophe claims and reserve charges.
A tight leash on costs also helped the insurer, with its expense ratio falling 230 basis points to 34.3 from the prior-year quarter.
Gross premiums written rose 11 percent to $10.2 billion in the general insurance business, helped mostly by the performance of its commercial lines insurance in North America.
AIG's adjusted net income rose to $1.39 billion, or $1.58 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $963 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.06 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Big-name hedge fund managers, including David Einhorn and Larry Robbins, pitched stock ideas ranging from airplane lessors to biotech companies that are working to extend the human lifespan at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York on Monday.
Greenlight Capital’s Einhorn, who made his name pitching a timely short of Lehman Brothers before the 2008 global financial crisis, announced a long position in airplane leasing company AerCap Holdings and a short position in rail car leasing company GATX Corp, which he said has higher maintenance costs and less visibility into future revenues but trades at higher multiples than AerCap. 
“We think the market has this wrong,” he said. 
Einhorn, who has been a prominent critic of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, started his 15-minute presentation by silently showing several slides of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and his bullish pronouncements for the company before calling it “a lot of horseshit.” 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital LLC, meanwhile, reiterated his long positions in HMOs such as  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), whose shares have fallen on concerns about progressive Democratic candidates endorsing so-called “Medicare for all” plans ahead of the 2020 elections. He also remained bullish on hospitals overall. 
“Hospitals are not under attack, hospitals are a wonderful place to invest,” he said. 
The wide range of investment ideas reflected the challenge for portfolio managers to find undervalued assets at a time when global stock markets are near record highs. 
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 hit two record highs last week and is up 17 percent year-to-date, thanks in large part to an expanding economy and the Federal Reserve’s surprising decision in January to pause its interest rate hikes.
The average hedge fund was up 5.7 percent in the first quarter, the best start to a year since 2006, according to industry publication Hedge Fund Research. 
Not all the investment ideas were bullish. Ryan Heslop, portfolio manager of Firefly Value Partners LP, announced a short position in rural hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc, which he said will likely go bankrupt over the next few years as its revenue per hospital bed shrinks and its debt costs increase. 
The company’s “pile of debt and the declining profitability of hospitals make it almost certain that this patient will die,” he said. 
Community Health did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Spencer Glendon, founder of Probable Futures, said increasing global temperatures and more severe storms due to the effects of climate change will undercut the economy of Florida and its housing market.

""When the Florida housing market falters, everything will go with it ... they are utterly dependent on real estate,"" he said.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Hedge funds target Centene, may oppose WellCare deal - sources","By Carl O'Donnell and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Hedge funds Corvex Management LP and Sachem Head Capital Management LP have built stakes in U.S. health insurer  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp and are exploring challenging its planned $17.3 billion acquisition of WellCare Health Plans Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The hedge funds believe that Centene may be able to do more to find out if another company such as  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM) would be interested in acquiring it, the sources said. 
The hedge funds are seeking to take advantage of the fact that Centene needs to secure approval from its shareholders for the WellCare deal, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is no certainty that the funds will agitate against the deal, the sources added.
""We remain as committed to our combination with WellCare today as we did when we announced it on March 27,"" said Marcela Hawn, Centene's chief communications officer. 
Corvex and Sachem Head declined to comment. WellCare and Humana did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
It was unclear whether Humana would take an interest in an acquisition of Centene.
When asked during a May 1 earnings conference call with analysts about his view on Medicaid growth in light of Centene's acquisition of WellCare, Humana's chief executive, Bruce Broussard, said the company was ""confident in our organic direction,"" but that its strategy involved always looking at the market for M&A possibilities. 
Centene shares rose 5 percent to $55.23 on the news. WellCare shares dropped 1.4 percent to $256.07.
Centene's acquisition of WellCare would create a major new player in government-sponsored healthcare, serving 22 million members across 50 states. It would allow it to bulk up its government-backed Medicare and Medicaid businesses, while reducing exposure to Obamacare healthcare exchanges.
Centene's chief executive officer, Michael Neidorff, 76, recently extended his contract to run Centene for another five years, and in a conference call with analysts said he is in good health and looking forward to continuing to run the business. 
An acquisition of Centene would give Humana control over the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country and its extensive portfolio of Medicare Advantage customers. 
Centene has nearly 400,000 customers in Medicare-related plans, 8.6 million customers in Medicaid-related plans and 2.5 million commercial customers including those enrolled in Obamacare health insurance plans.
Humana is the second largest Medicare Advantage provider, with 3.7 million Medicare Advantage members and another 4.5 million in Medicare drug plans. It has about 460,000 members in state-based contracts that include programs for people eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, temporary assistance and long term support services. It has about 1.5 million commercial customers and nearly 6 million in U.S. military plans, including in dental, vision and other supplementary insurance.

A Humana tie-up with Centene would face limited antitrust hurdles because there is relatively little overlap in the markets that the two companies operate in.

(Reuters) - David Einhorn, president of Greenlight Capital, at the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday said his firm is positive on airplane leasing company AerCap Holdings and negative on railcar leasing company GATX Corp.
Einhorn said GATX has ""trouble returning to pre-crisis usage levels,"" while AerCorp shares are trading at half the book value and less than half the price-to-earnings of GATX's shares. 
Speaking favorably of both industries, he said the airline sector has some advantages over rail that make AerCap the better choice over GATX, whose shares he believes are overvalued. “Neither has consumer-facing businesses, and both have terrible news. AerCap operates in a growing industry with a favorable outlook,” Einhorn said. “We think the market has it wrong.""
AerCap shares are up 31% in 2019, while GATX has gained 11% year-to-date.
AerCap is the industry leader with 11% marketshare, he noted. As aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have backlogs of multiple years, aircraft leasing companies step in to fill the gap as air travel continues to increase around the globe.
Einhorn, who told the Sohn Investment Conference that the theme of his pitch involved Trains, Planes and Automobiles, referencing a 1987 movie, reassured the audience that he still did not like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Einhorn started out with a slide show of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statements about his electric car company and concluded by saying that's ""a lot of horseshit.""
Einhorn has been short Tesla. In a letter to clients last month, Einhorn's Greenlight renewed criticism of Musk and Tesla, saying the electric car company appeared to be “on the brink” of failure again. 
The letter cited a lack of demand, “desperate” price cuts, layoffs, “closing-and-then-not-closing” stores, closing service centers, slashing capital expenditures, rushed product announcements and “a new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA’s autonomous driving capabilities.”

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Einhorn's remark.

1150,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Trump's Tariff Threat Sends China Stocks Spiraling,"Investing.com -- China stocks were on the backfoot Monday, even as U.S. markets paired the bulk of their losses after analysts suggested that President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs on imported goods from Beijing is more a negotiating ploy than a signal that progress in trade talks had stalled.
Trump's warning that tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods could more than double to 25% from 10% on Friday sent Chinese stocks tumbling as reports followed that China was considering canceling this week’s trade talks with the U.S. in light of the threat. Chinese officials downplayed the idea.
Smart-phone maker Xioami, networking company ZTE (OTC:ZTCOY), Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:SMI) and JD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) were among the more notable names that fell sharply during the session. ZTE was off more than 9% in U.S. trading, with others falling at least 4%. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 5.6% in Monday trading while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 2.9%.
The Dow  fell 471 points at the open but pared its loss to 215 points, or 0.8%, by 2 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 was off 0.9%.
A slew of Wall Street banks including Citigroup said there's little sign that China is willing to step away from talks after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that ""China’s team is preparing to go to the United States for the discussions.""
""Unless China walks away from the talks (which is not necessarily the same as Vice Premier Liu canceling his trip but rather having no talks at all), we do not expect an escalation of trade tensions into a trade war,"" Citi said.""
The sharp declines come even as UBS analysts and others suggested that the timing of the threat appears to be a negotiation tactic to get the upper hand on China heading into the final round of talks this week.
The abrupt threat arrived after Trump’s top trade negotiator told him that Beijing was backpedalling on a trade deal following a round of talks last week, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter."

1152,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sequoia China to cut up to 20 percent of investment staff as tech growth slows - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sequoia Capital China, widely viewed as a bellwether for Chinese tech investment, is set to lay off as much as 20 percent of its investment staff as a slowdown in the country's tech sector saps appetite for risk, said two people with knowledge of the matter.
The Chinese arm of Silicon Valley venture capitalist Sequoia Capital is looking to cut the number of venture investment professionals from about 70, the people said. Two other people said the cut would be at least 10 percent.
Sequoia China told Reuters in a statement sent ahead of story publication that it regularly reviews its workforce which may result in personnel adjustments.
""Within the last 12 months, we had 13 new investment professionals join Sequoia China, which slightly increased our total number of employees,"" it said in the statement. 
In a later statement to Reuters after the story was published, a spokeswoman said the story was untrue. 
The layoffs would come after a government campaign against debt financing left start-ups vying for shrinking pools of fresh capital. Meanwhile disappointing returns from firms going public amid market volatility has made investors bearish, resulting in down rounds - where a firm's valuation in a round of fundraising falls below that of a previous round.
Chinese venture capital and private equity managers raised a combined $1.5 billion for investment across all sectors in the first three months of 2019, a far cry from the $9.4 billion of the same period last year, according to data provider Preqin.
Reflecting broader industry malaise, major tech firms have cut headcount and salaries to maintain performance as economic slowdown and Sino-U.S. trade war weigh on customer sentiment, while at the same time seeking opportunities as growth plateaus.
Sequoia China's job cuts began in late March and have mainly affected the venture capital arm's technology & media, healthcare, consumer and industrial technology teams, two of the people told Reuters, declining to be identified as the information was not yet public.
Investment professionals including one partner, one managing director, and several vice presidents and associates have agreed to leave the firm during these cuts, said one of the people.
The cuts mirror similar moves across the much-hyped tech industry in the world's second-biggest economy. 
In February, ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing said it would axe 15 percent of staff, mostly in non-core business units.
The same month, online media outlet Sina Tech said e-commerce firm JD.com Inc planned to lay off 10 percent of senior executives this year. In March, Bloomberg said gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings Ltd planned to demote or axe about 10 percent of managers.
Neither JD.com nor Tencent responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
BROADER FOCUS
Sequoia China was founded in 2005 by entrepreneur-turned-investor Neil Shen. The firm employs about 150 people at offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere in China.
It has invested in over 500 firms in China, including JD.com and bigger rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, as well as some of China's fastest-growing firms such as Didi Chuxing, Meituan Dianping and Beijing Bytedance Technology.
It is widely known for expertise in venture capital-type deals, but has been broadening its focus to even earlier-stage seed investment as well as far later-stage funding ahead of initial public offerings.
Last year it raised its first seed fund of $150 million and its fifth growth fund of $1.8 billion, the largest of its kind, showed Preqin data.

Its relatively young seed- and late-stage investment teams have been less affected by the layoffs so far, said two of the people. One of the people said there would be job cuts in the one-year-old seed team in the coming months.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted broad-based declines on Monday after President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week, triggering worries about a global economic slowdown.
Trump on Sunday said tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% from 10%, reversing a decision he made in February to retain them at 10% as the two sides made progress on trade talks. 
China said on Monday a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States, but did not mention if Vice Premier Liu He, its lead official in the negotiations, will be part of the team as originally planned.
The threat sent the S&P 500 down as much as 1.6% during the session and led to a drop in U.S. Treasury yields as investors turned to low-risk government bonds. However, the major indexes pared some losses in afternoon trading. [US/]
""Obviously it was a negative start, but the market still appears confident that we will get a China trade deal and this was Trump's art of the deal strategy,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager with Hodges Funds in Dallas. 
""There is a great chance for a trade deal to be reached, it's a win-win for both sides, and I don't think that China would walk away from it.""

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) said on Monday its latest bid to take over Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) was designed to make sure Anadarko's board considers its offer superior to one from  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), even though it could spark tensions with its own shareholders.
Occidental is prodding Anadarko's board to abandon its $33 billion merger agreement with Chevron. Occidental on Sunday increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a requirement to win the approval of Occidental shareholders.
""We weren't playing on a level playing field,"" Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said on a call with analysts on Monday morning. By raising the cash component, Occidental will not need approval from its shareholders.
The company did not want to bypass a shareholder vote, but felt its only options were to ""increase the share price or provide clarity at closing,"" Hollub said. Chevron's offer did not require shareholder approval, which is why Anadarko has so far preferred that bid, Hollub said.
Anadarko shares jumped 3.1 percent to $74.95 while Occidental dipped 0.4 percent to $57.74 and Chevron rose nearly 1 percent to $118.43.
Several Occidental shareholders oppose the merger, though, including T. Rowe Price Group Inc. The deal also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer, according to sources.
The bid ""smells like desperation,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland. ""They clearly aren't willing to take no for an answer, and are willing to leverage what had historically been a pristine balance sheet to get the deal done,"" Rowland said.
Occidental said it has suspended its share repurchase program due to the Anadarko bid, and will instead focus on paying down debt. 
Anadarko said on Sunday its board will review the proposal.
Earlier Sunday, France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) said it had agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for $8.8 billion if the two U.S. oil and gas companies merge.
Last week Occidental secured a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa) Analysts and investors see the terms of that deal as particularly favorable to Buffett. 
Occidental's new offer to Anadarko is 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, compared with an even cash/stock split previously.

The bidding war between Occidental and Chevron underscores the value of Anadarko's assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades.

1160,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Assumptions Shattered as Emerging Markets Get Trade Wake-Up Call,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market assets have risen this year based largely on two assumptions: the U.S. Federal Reserve would stay dovish and trade talks between Washington and Beijing would gradually progress toward a deal.
Two tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday shattered the latter, sending emerging markets into a tailspin, even as the former still holds true. China’s yuan plummeted on Monday and its main stock index sank the most in more than three years, dragging assets including South Africa’s rand and Turkish stocks down with them.
The retreat suggests that weeks of positive comments from U.S. and Chinese negotiators had led investors to get complacent over the outlook for an agreement. The MSCI Emerging Markets stock index has climbed more than 10 percent this year, while a Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index of developing-nation dollar debt has advanced 6 percent.
“This is reality checking in,” said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging-market strategist at SEB AB in Stockholm. “Even if they do reach an agreement -- and I think they will -- the risk of a delay is quite significant. It’s a risk that will linger for the better part of the year and probably into next year as well. The market had pretty much ignored this.”
The rand and Turkish lira -- the two biggest losers globally on Monday -- will be among the hardest-hit currencies, according to Hammarlund, while the Russian ruble may be relatively unscathed.
Still, some investors saw a buying opportunity in today’s rout. Kathryn Rooney Vera, head of research at Bulltick LLC in Miami, recommended the MSCI EM Index, telling Bloomberg TV that an eventual trade accord would spur inflows into the asset class. She saw potential value in Brazil, Mexico and China.
Following Monday’s slump, the gap between valuations based on future earnings for the S&P 500 Index and the emerging-market measure widened to the most since November.
How markets move in the coming weeks may now depend on whether there’s much bite behind Trump’s bark, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
“The news in the past 12 hours has thrown a monkey wrench” into the theme that a stable yuan would anchor developing-nation assets as a whole, said Jason Daw, a SocGen analyst in Singapore. “The market was basically fully priced for a positive outcome on the U.S.-China trade talks given the prior positive comments from both sides.”

(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co will restate financial reports for a near three-year period to fix errors that resulted from lapses in procurement practices by some of its employees, the packaged food company said in a filing on Monday.
The company also said it received an additional subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March, related to the assessment of goodwill and asset impairments and a request for documents associated with the procurement operations.
Kraft had disclosed a SEC subpoena in February related to an investigation into its accounting practices and, procurement procedures. Following the subpoena, the company initiated an investigation into the procurement practices.
Kraft Heinz said the misstatement was not ""quantitatively material"" to its financial reports, adding that its investigation was substantially complete and that it would continue to cooperate with the SEC.
Along with the subpoena, the company had also announced a $15.4 billion write-down of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands in February and Monday's filing revealed that the misstatements would increase the amount by about $13 million.
Due to these findings, the company said it would not be able to timely file its quarterly report for the period ended March 30.
""While we expect there will be more change, the worst of the uncertainty surrounding financial statements appears to be over,"" Consumer Edge Research's Jonathan Feeney said. 
Shares of the company were marginally up at $32.70 in noon trading.
Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder with a 26.7 percent stake, told CNBC after Kraft Heinz disclosed the restatements that the company had his confidence.
The misstatements in Kraft's reports for the years 2016, 2017 and the first nine months of 2018 mainly relates to the timing and recognition of supplier contracts in the procurement area.
The investigation and review required adjustments of about $208 million related to the costs of products sold and the findings from the investigation also revealed that there was no misconduct from any member of Kraft Heinz's senior management.
Kraft also said it reviewed supplier contracts and found additional misstatements may or may not have resulted from the misconduct tied to its procurement practices.

""The company is taking action to improve our policies and procedures and will continue to strengthen our internal financial controls,"" Kraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Banco Bradesco SA has embarked on its first-ever international acquisition by paying approximately $500 million to buy BAC Florida Bank, which focuses on high-net-worth individuals in a move intended to close the gap with Brazilian rivals.
Based in Coral Gables, BAC Florida is controlled by Grupo Pellas, which was founded in 1877 in Nicaragua.
After the deal closes, Bradesco said its main goal is to provide a wide range of financial services in the United States to Bradesco clients and lure new customers to BAC Florida.
Bradesco Chief Executive Officer Octavio de Lazari said on a call with journalists that the Brazilian bank's private banking clients have increasingly demanded diversification and greater access to global products.
""This move underscores our expansion not only in the U.S., but also in Latin America as a whole, as BAC has clients all over the region,"" he said. Around 20 percent of BAC Florida's clients are Brazilian and 9 percent are American.
Still, Lazari said Bradesco is not seeking to build a retail base outside Brazil, but wants to boost its private banking business, which manages nearly $50 billion in assets.
BAC Florida will add 10,000 customers to Bradesco's 13,000 private banking clients in Brazil. 
""This acquisition is small for Bradesco (less than 1 percent of the bank's market cap) and tends to help the bank to reduce the gap of its private banking business,"" Itaú BBA said in a note to clients, estimating a 30 basis point impact on capital.
Bradesco's footprint in private banking is smaller than rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, which has $120 billion in assets under management. Itaú acquired the Latin America private banking business of ABN Amro and now-defunct BankBoston nearly 12 years ago. 

BAC Florida ended 2018 with total assets of $2.2 billion and net income of $29 million. One of its main business segments is real estate financing.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 11:33AM ET</span>",Sinclair CEO sees possible deals with Amazon and others seeking live sports,"By Kenneth Li and Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc would consider teaming up with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other tech giants to offer live sports, its chief told Reuters, fresh from announcing a $9.6 billion deal to buy Disney's regional sports networks.
On Friday, Sinclair announced a deal to buy Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's collection of 21 regional sports networks (RSNs), turning the largest U.S. broadcast station owner into one of the biggest live news and sports companies this side of Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp.
With Walt Disney Co, Amazon, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) just some of the combatants now in the video streaming wars, ""There is only going to be more competition and more interest for key assets like this in the future,"" President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley said, in response to a question about licensing sports to big tech companies. ""We have an interest in as broad a distribution as possible.""
The deal is a capstone to Sinclair's expansion from a stodgy TV station owner to a conservative-leaning media company stitching together 190 local TV stations across the country. 
In January, it launched an advertising-supported streaming TV service called STIRR. It is also modernizing its broadcast technology to the new ATSC 3.0 standard, which will let it act more like an online TV company by offering interactivity and ads targeted to viewers.
In an interview on Sunday, Ripley said the deal was a bargain because Disney needed to sell the assets to gain approval for its $71.3 billion deal to buy the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox from Murdoch. 
The sports networks are valued at five and a half times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, after tax benefits, compared to MSG Networks which trades at around eight times.
Disney is selling the YES Network separately for $3.5 billion to the New York Yankees and Amazon, according to a person familiar with the deal. Sinclair also reportedly has a stake in that deal. Amazon and the Yankees did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
But Sinclair's doubling down on traditional TV appears to run counter to the shift in consumers away from traditional television, broadcast and pay TV to digital services owned by Netflix and Google.
Ripley said battling the tech giants head-on, as Disney and AT&T are preparing to do with upcoming digital video services, made no sense for the much smaller Sinclair. 
""We're a local media company with a strong focus in local news and we continue to see that as an area that will have strong relevancy if we took it multiplatform and not be an area flooded by cheap cash by big tech,"" he said.
The company views live sports as a long term profitable business because of its scarcity. 
""There are only 160 or so baseball games a year,"" Ripley said. ""No matter how much money that Amazon or Google or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) throws at the MLB (Major League Baseball), they can’t really change that dynamic very easily.""
Profits could be hurt as the sports network's contracts with pay television providers are up for renewal in the next two year, according to BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.
Ripley said those contracts expire over as long as a few years to 15 years.
Sinclair already distributes content to multiple cable, satellite and streaming companies, including YouTube, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. Adding more digital clients like Amazon would be just another distributor relationship, he said.
BETTING THE FUTURE
The acquisition will see Sinclair capitalizing on the new U.S. sports betting market.
In addition to increased fan engagement and viewership, he expects $1.5 billion to $2 billion of new ad revenue industry-wide ""in short order,"" from sportsbook operators and other companies marketing in the space.
Ripley also plans to eventually allow viewers to place bets right from their screens during live games, similar to how fans can wager in Europe now.
""If you're interested in gaming, we're going to add on extra stats, the ability to do prop bets in the game, pitch by pitch, play by play,"" he said. ""You can play along and wager while you watch.""
The in-game, on-screen wagers, which it is currently exploring with its Tennis Channel, would be done in partnership with sportsbook operators, but Sinclair would not want to become a bookie itself.

1168,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",Stocks Pare Losses After Shock From Trump's Tweets: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities climbed from the lows of the day posted after President Donald Trump’s threat to increase tariffs on Chinese imports called into question the chances of a resolution to the trade war.
The S&P 500 index tumbled by the most since March before cutting the loss in half, signaling a potentially volatile week on Wall Street after Trump tweeted a plan to hike tariffs this coming Friday. From JD.com and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), tech companies with China exposure and machinery companies -- which are seen as proxies for the trade war -- were among the biggest decliners in early trading. The VIX gauge of stock volatility headed for its biggest increase this year.
“All the indications we had were that things were going well, and we had this news that took people by, ‘Woah, hold on, last we saw things were going okay,”’ said Joe “JJ” Kinahan, the chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “We get this news, overnight the markets get a little scared. With the markets opening today, I wouldn’t say cooler heads prevail, but you have more places to trade so that’s why you saw the market come back a little bit. We’ll see if this can last.”
Commodities were roiled. Cotton and corn futures slumped, while soybean contracts headed toward their largest drop in about nine months. West Texas Intermediate oil futures declined as much as 3.1 percent before erasing most of the drop as Saudi Arabia cut June pricing for all crude grades to the U.S., a move that appeared to be aimed at easing concern over supplies.
As some investors sought safer assets the yield on benchmark Treasuries fell the most in almost two weeks. European government bonds and the euro held steady as economic activity in the euro area showed signs of stabilization. Equities in the region slid, tracking a sell-off across much of Asia. Shanghai’s benchmark index tumbled 5.6 percent, even after Chinese state-backed funds were said to have been active in an effort to limit the damage.
Seeking to ramp up pressure on China for more concessions, Trump threatened in two tweets to more than double tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and impose a fresh round of duties on top of that. Talks to resolve the year-long trade standoff appeared to be on life-support Monday, with Beijing struggling to fully respond. China’s foreign ministry said that officials were still planning to travel to the U.S. for the next round of negotiations, but it was unable to confirm when amid signs that a delay is now being considered.
“Escalation like this means we are certainly further away from the end of this negotiation process than we thought,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. “The three things that have been driving this market higher this year have been the pivot by the Fed, better than feared earnings, and the belief that we would get a trade deal done sooner rather than later.”
Adding to a complex global picture, North Korea carried out a weapons test that potentially included its first ballistic missile launch since 2017, challenging Trump’s bottom line in nuclear talks.
Elsewhere, Turkey’s lira weakened past six per U.S. dollar, touching its lowest level in almost seven months as a possible repeat of the March Istanbul mayor’s election hung over the market and added more pressure to emerging-market currencies.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 10:59AM ET</span>",U.S.-based investment-grade corporate bond funds see 14th week of inflows,"By Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - Investors gravitated toward the higher-quality spectrum of the credit markets this week, as U.S.-based investment-grade corporate bond funds attracted about $374.5 million in net cash, their 14th consecutive week of inflows.
According to Refinitiv's Lipper research data on Thursday, investors sent roughly $16 billion in net cash to U.S. money-market funds for the week ended Wednesday, following their previous week's inflows of $4.26 billion.
U.S.-based equity mutual funds, however, had another rough week.
Investors pulled $5.5 billion from U.S.-based equity mutual funds in the week ended Wednesday, Lipper data show, while equity exchange-traded funds garnered $3.7 billion.
""Despite the S&P 500 setting three record closes during the fund-flows week, investors remained on the equity sidelines after learning about disappointing Q1 revenue growth from stalwart Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL),"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper.
""There was a split once again between mom-and-pop investors and authorized participants. Equity mutual funds witnessed outflows of $5.5 billion, while equity ETFs took in $3.7 billion during the fund flows week.""
U.S.-based taxable exchange-traded funds posted cash withdrawals for the week, with investors withdrawing $700 million in net cash.
""While investors were keeping a keen eye on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, which concluded on Wednesday on a more hawkish note than some anticipated, taxable-fixed income mutual funds took in small amounts of net new money - $348 million-plus, with ETF investors ... withdrawing $700 million,"" Roseen said.
""Interestingly, though, both investors types were net purchasers of municipal bond funds, injecting $877 million into conventional open-end funds and $314 million for ETFs, respectively,"" Roseen said. ""For the week, the average municipal bond fund returned 0.51 percent.""

1172,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Volkswagen sounds out buyers for MAN Energy Solutions -sources,"By Arno Schuetze and Harry Brumpton
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has approached several companies to gauge their appetite for buying MAN Energy Solutions, which makes large diesel engines for ships and power generators, people close to the matter said.
The informal sales pitch is part of Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess's efforts to slim down and simplify the group which has 12 brands, trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars and electric bicycles as part of its business. 
Volkswagen has not yet started a formal sales process or appointed an adviser for the sale of the company but has contacted rivals in the engine manufacturing business such as Cummins (NYSE:CMI), Wartsila and private-equity owned Jenbacher, these sources said. 
Volkswagen declined to comment.
""Volkswagen wants to see what would be possible,"" one of the people said, adding that depending on the feedback it gets the carmaker could launch a formal sales process later this year.
People familiar with the matter said that they expected MAN Energy Solutions to achieve a valuation of about 3 billion euros ($3.36 billion) in a potential sale.
The business, formerly known as MAN Diesel & Turbo, also makes turbochargers used in the oil & gas industry and in 2018 reported operating earnings of 133 million euros on sales of 3.1 billion euros. 
The sources said it could also attract interest from Mitsubishi Heavy, Alfa Laval as well as from private equity groups such EQT, Bain and Cinven if it is formerly put up for sale, the sources said.
The potential sales process follows Volkswagen's decision earlier this year to scrap plans for an initial public offering of its Traton trucks unit, which features the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Caminhoes e Onibus brands.
Volkswagen has struggled to slim down in the past after the company's works council, which has veto power over major restructuring moves, blocked efforts to sell motorbike brand Ducati and transmissions maker Renk.

MAN Energy Solutions was originally a part of VW's trucks brand MAN, but some of MAN's assets were transferred to Volkswagen last year as part of efforts to streamline Traton ahead of the planned listing.

The Dow Jones sank 383 points, or 1.5%, at 26,121.48 points by 9:35 AM ET (13:35 GMT), the S&P 500 fell 40 points, or 1.4%, to 2,905.38 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded down 135 points, or 1.7%, at 8,028.77 points.
Trump threatened to raise the 10% tariff on $200 billion in Chinese goods imported to the U.S. to 25% by this Friday, complaining that trade talks were moving too slowly due to Beijing’s attempts to renegotiate.
Early reports suggested that China was considering cancelling the trade talks due to take place in Washington starting on Wednesday in response to Trump’s weekend tweets, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry later confirmed that the delegation was preparing for the trip.
Chinese officials did not confirm however that China’s top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, would still attend.
Trump’s tweets surprised markets as reports of last week’s trade talks in Beijing suggested that progress was being made, with talk of a deal being reached by the end of May with a possible summit to sign off on the agreement considered a possibility as soon as June. Some analysts speculated that the threats were a tactic to increase pressure on China ahead of this round of negotiations.
Concerns over the impact of a full-blown trade war sent global equities lower, with Chinese stocks posting their biggest one-day loss in three years and European bourses all losing between 1% and 2%.
Particularly sensitive were stocks of companies with high revenue exposure to China such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slid 2.6%
In other company news, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) was under pressure after the company announced it would restate financial statements for 2016 and 2017 to fix accounting errors due to the misconduct of several employees.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 2.7% after the company admitted that it knew about a missing safety feature on its 737 MAX planes, which it inadvertently made optional, 13 months ahead of informing U.S. regulators.
Elsewhere, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) sweetened the terms of its $38 billion bid for Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), offering a higher percentage of cash in the offer. Anadarko said it is studying the proposal although its agreement to be bought by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) for $33 billion remains in effect.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 09:18AM ET</span>",BP to boost Gulf of Mexico spending as shale-focused rivals pull back,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) Plc on Monday announced new production units in the Gulf of Mexico, enhancing its standing as the largest producer there at a time when rival global oil majors are scrambling to expand vast U.S. onshore shale drilling. 
Britain-based BP will add two new subsea production units about two miles (3.2 km) south of its existing giant Thunder Horse platform, with two wells added in the near term and eight total wells planned, the company said on Monday. BP did not disclose the cost of the investment.
The investment runs against current industry trends that emphasize spending on shale, which has propelled U.S. production to more than 12 million barrels a day (bpd), making it the largest producer in the world. U.S. offshore production accounts for 1.8 million bpd, but has grown more slowly.
Like its rivals, BP has completed a massive onshore acquisition, buying BHP Billiton's onshore assets for $10.5 billion to improve its shale position. That new investment has not detracted from the company's plans for the Gulf. 
People familiar with BP’s investment decisions told Reuters that the Gulf’s vast oil reservoirs and increasingly affordable platforms make the formation a good hedge against the risks of shale, where industry's per-well productivity has dropped by 14 percent from its 2016 high. Among deepwater basins, the Gulf of Mexico's reliable regulatory climate makes the region particularly attractive, analysts say.
BP said it plans to increase its Gulf production to about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by the mid 2020s. That’s about a fifth of the region’s total production. The company’s Gulf production has already increased more than 60 percent from 2013 to more than 300,000 boed. 
""Those big fields keep on giving,” Starlee Sykes, the company’s president for operations in the region, told Reuters.
NEW SEISMIC IMAGING CAPABILITY 
The new development at Thunder Horse will add 50,000 gross boed of production, with first oil expected in 2021. That’s more crude from a single project than the total Permian production BP acquired as part of the deal with BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB). 
BP used new seismic imaging capabilities to identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil in place at the Thunder Horse field. 
“One of the significant advantages of deepwater or offshore wells relative to onshore U.S. wells is their high productivity,” said Emeka Emembolu, BP’s Gulf of Mexico vice president for reservoir development. “On average, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells produce around 5,000 barrels of oil per day.” 
Some offshore wells have production rates starting at 30,000 barrels per day, he said. That’s compared with an average of just 650 barrels a day for Permian wells, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics. 
Offshore developments traditionally require hefty upfront investment, but improved recovery technologies have reduced project costs. BP has reduced its per-barrel costs to $40 a barrel or less – on par with wells in the best shale formations.
""Growth in onshore oil can only provide 15-20% of what the market needs year-on-year in terms of volume growth, so that's why you see continued activity in the Gulf of Mexico, in offshore Brazil, and new basins popping up,"" said Andrew Slaughter, executive director, Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions. 
Still, in the United States shale has overshadowed the Gulf.  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) are locked in a battle for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), with both touting onshore and liquefied natural gas assets as key attractions of the deal, rather than Anadarko’s Gulf platforms. Anadarko produces roughly 140,000 bpd from the Gulf.
Separately,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) has started a sale process to identify a buyer for 45,000 bpd of Gulf production interests and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) agreed to sell a production platform last month. 
BP has maintained a position in each of the five largest Gulf fields, and it also is one of the few of late bidding on areas not adjacent to existing properties in the Gulf. 

The rest - mostly the majors and a few niche regionally-focused independent companies - have centered their exploration around acreage next to existing platforms.

PARIS (Reuters) - IKEA opened its first store in the heart of Paris on Monday, its latest step in developing a new range of shops designed to meet changing customer habits.
IKEA, the world's biggest furniture retailer, is known for its vast self-service out-of-town stores, but it is adapting its business model in the face of mounting competition and customers who prefer the ease of buying items of furniture online.
To a soundtrack of Abba songs and with staff waving blue and yellow Swedish flags, IKEA opened the doors on Monday at its first store in central Paris, in the Madeleine district, which will be its 34th outlet overall in France.
""La Madeleine is an innovation test laboratory for us. We want to serve the people who know and love IKEA but think IKEA is too far away,"" Jesper Brodin, chief executive of Ingka Group which owns most IKEA stores, told Reuters.
""If La Madeleine is successful, we will open more (such)stores in France, but also in the U.S., Japan,"" he added.
Its other city center formats include a dedicated kitchen showroom in Stockholm, a London store offering personalized planning for home renovations, and one for living room furniture in Madrid.
IKEA, which had global sales of around 39 billion euros ($44 billion) last year, plans to invest 400 million euros in France over the next three years.
The Madeleine store should also boost Paris' retail sector, which has been hit by France's ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests since late last year.
IKEA's new French investments will entail upgrades to its existing store network, building up new city center stores, offering new services and improving its online capabilities.
RENTALS AND SERVICES
France is IKEA's third largest market, after Germany and the United States.
Since taking over as group CEO in 2017, Brodin has led efforts to overhaul the IKEA business model to respond to the rise in ecommerce.
The group is planning to roll out furniture rentals to its main markets to appeal to increasingly environmentally conscious and transient customers.
""Yes, we will test furniture rentals in this (La Madeleine) store, probably within a year,"" said Brodin.
To help accelerate its services drive, IKEA bought U.S. odd-jobs site TaskRabbit in September 2017, expanding it in the United States. It has since launched it in Britain and Canada.
""France is next, with Paris this summer,"" Brodin said.
The new 5,400 square meter Madeleine store spreads over two levels, and will employ 140 people.
The store will include a salad bar and restaurant, and offer Feng Shui, cooking classes and workshops on repairing furniture or on home renovation. It will also host art exhibits.
Items that cannot be taken from the store can be ordered online and delivered at home or to 350 pickup points for parcels up to 20 kilograms.
IKEA employs around 10,000 people in France, where its sales rose 3 percent in the 2017/18 fiscal year to 2.83 billion euros.

Speaking to reporters on Monday after a meeting of the voluntary-contribution arm of Italy's FITD depositor protection fund, FITD Chairman Salvatore Maccarone said the plan was expected to receive a final approval at a May 14 general meeting. The plan would then be presented to the European Central Bank on May 17.
Maccarone said the rescue plan would see Italian banks convert into equity 313 million euros in hybrid debt they bought from Carige to prop up the lender in November 2018.

BlackRock would cover the rest of the cash call with a part of it reserved for Carige's current shareholders. State-owned soured loan vehicle SGA would take on the bank's bad loans under the plan.

1181,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Wall Street Wonders Whether Trump's Tariff Is a Tactic. Or Not.,"(Bloomberg) -- Policy analysts are offering a variety of interpretations of President Trump’s latest tariff threat. Some, like Goldman and Citi, are optimistic a U.S.-China deal can still be reached. Others, including Raymond James and Cowen, are more cautious, warning the process may have been derailed, and point to rising global risks.
Investors weren’t happy about the news, with S&P 500 futures lower by about 50 points. Tech and machinery companies were particularly hard hit, with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). all sliding. Bellwether banks such as Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). were all lower pre-market.
Here’s a sample of what analysts are saying:
Goldman, Alec Phillips
Goldman believes a tariff increase may be “narrowly avoided,” putting odds that tariffs rise on Friday at 40 percent, Phillips wrote in a note.
Will be watching whether a large delegation of Chinese officials comes to Washington on May 8, as scheduled; canceling would mean an agreement in the coming week would “seem very unlikely,” and would make an increase in the tariff rate to 25 percent “the base case.”
China trade issues have “negative implications for the outlook for auto tariffs and passage of the USMCA [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement].” Trump’s “willingness to risk a market disruption by threatening an unexpected tariff hike suggests that he might also be willing to risk the disruption that formally proposing auto tariffs or announcing the intent to withdraw from NAFTA might cause.” Phillips raised the probability that auto tariffs will be implemented later this year to 20 percent from 10 percent, and lowered the probability that USMCA will pass to 60 percent from 70 percent.
Citi, Cesar Rojas
“Cautiously optimistic” on a U.S.-China trade deal in the second quarter, though tariff threats will likely “remain as a way to get concessions from China and to enforce the agreement,” Rojas wrote in a note.
Rojas had expected that as the Chinese economy stabilized, “China would be less willing to provide additional concessions to the U.S.” The new threat is “consistent with the U.S. adding more pressure on China to get these concessions.” The Trump administration “pays attention to equity markets,” which means stocks diving could lead to a retreat from implementing the tariffs threat.
Even so, he continues to believe “uncertainty is likely to remain high as the tariffs threat remains in place and second round effects from a reallocation of global trade remain underestimated.”
RBC, Lori Calvasina
A trade deal with China has been widely anticipated by investors, and was a ""key contributor to the early 2019 rally in US equities,"" Calvasina wrote in a note.
That means the weekend’s developments were a negative catalyst for the market not only because of investor sentiment, but also ""because of the downward earnings revisions that are likely to occur if the tariffs are expanded.""
Sees ""these steps backwards on the trade deal with China as particularly negative"" for industrial and semiconductor companies.
Raymond James, Ed Mills
“The progress towards a U.S.-China deal has been up-ended with renewed tariff threats by President Trump ... apparent balks by the Chinese (especially on tech transfers), and the threat of the Chinese delegation canceling this week’s round of negotiations,” Mills wrote in a note.
Conversations with Raymond James’s trade contacts point to “a universal belief that this is not negotiating leverage, but what was almost a done deal last week, has derailed in recent days. There is some hope that negotiations could be salvaged, but this situation highlights how tenuous any U.S.-China deal remains.”
Contacts have revealed questions about “what led to the latest breakdown, and whether developments related to Venezuela, the Iran oil sanctions decision, North Korea’s weekend missile test, or lessening worry about the economic conditions in both the U.S. and China influenced the direction.” Geopolitical volatility spiking in recent weeks may signal “ a more difficult path ahead for negotiations.”
MUFG, Chris Rupkey
“For weeks now markets have been lulled to sleep on the U.S. trade war with China thinking an agreement was imminent. No more,” Rupkey wrote in a note.
“This has all the makings of a complete disaster that could lead the stock market to crater this week,” he said. It may also jack up “external risks to the U.S. economic outlook,” just a few days after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said global risks had moderated somewhat.
Compass Point, Isaac Boltansky
Trump’s threat to hike tariffs is “a standard part of his negotiating style and we remain bullish on the prospects for a deal in the coming weeks,” Boltansky wrote in a note. Though there “will be puts and takes in this story,” believes “pressure on both sides of the Pacific will ultimately catalyze a deal.”
“Beijing is sending roughly 100 representatives to Washington this week, which we view as indicative of their belief that a deal is within striking distance.” At the same time, he warned that “once attention turns from China to other trade matters – including the USMCA – market sentiment regarding trade policy could turn more cautious.”
Cowen, Chris Krueger
The “return of Tariff Man” is “pretty shocking and surprising - even grading off the Trump Curve,” Krueger wrote in a note.
Krueger offered several interpretations. The “cautious” one suggests “this is simply an intemperate tweet (s) by a president that can’t help himself during a rainy Sunday afternoon...Trump really, really wants to see this deal finished by Friday and (perhaps mistakenly) believes this gives the U.S. leverage.”
The ""not-so-cautious"" interpretation is that “this is not an outer-borough real estate transaction. Trump issued a Presidential Statement last week highlighting his gift as the world’s premier hostage negotiator; tariffs are a very dangerous hostage and we believe will be seen as both provocative and insulting by Beijing. ”"
1182,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Occidental Seeks Edge Over Chevron Bid by Adding More Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). moved a step closer to sealing its proposed $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). after it sweetened its offer and agreed to sell assets owned by the target company.
Occidental increased the cash portion of its bid to 78 percent from 50 percent on Sunday. It also pledged to cover the $1 billion breakup fee Anadarko would have to pay for abandoning an already-agreed to deal with  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), and said Occidental shareholders won’t be required to vote on the takeover.
The heftier buyout proposal came just hours after French energy giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) agreed to buy operations in four African nations for $8.8 billion, contingent upon Occidental completing a takeover of Texas-based Anadarko.
The Total agreement augments billionaire Warren Buffett’s $10 billion commitment to Occidental, which has faced investor criticism for its unsolicited April 24 offer to best Chevron’s takeover of Anadarko. While Occidental is a storied name in American oil and operates across three continents, it’s just one-fifth Chevron’s market value and its pursuit of Anadarko was seen by some as quixotic.
Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub, who has been pursuing Anadarko for almost two years, has grown frustrated at the company’s unwillingness to acquiesce to her advances.
“We remain perplexed at your apparent resistance to obtaining far more value for Anadarko shareholders which has been expressed clearly through our interactions over the last week,” Hollub said in a letter to Anadarko’s board dated Sunday.
Stunning Rebuff
Anadarko said in a statement that it will review the revised offer and reaffirmed its existing recommendation to shareholders to accept the Chevron deal.
The Total agreement may ameliorate concerns that Occidental would take on too much debt and shorten the amount of time the company would be out of the market for share buybacks, said Bill Nygren, chief investment officer of Harris Associates LP, which manages $120 billion and owns about 3 percent of Anadarko.
An Occidental-Anadarko accord would be a stunning rebuff for Chevron CEO Mike Wirth just 15 months into his tenure at the head of the world’s third-largest oil explorer by market value. Sunday’s emergence of Total as an Occidental ally pits two of the world’s supermajor oil drillers on opposite sides of the industry’s biggest takeover battle in years.
Gulfstream V
Hollub has pursued Anadarko amid on-and-off talks since late 2017, to no avail.
In an apparent acknowledgment that more was needed to get the deal across the line, Hollub flew to Omaha, Nebraska, on April 28 to visit Buffett. The legendary investor announced two days later he had agreed to pay $10 billion in exchange for a slug of Occidental preferred stock and warrants, contingent on a successful takeover of Anadarko.
“With the OXY deal looking safer for APC to accept, I’d say this may force CVX to match the OXY bid or lose out on these terrific assets,” Nygren said in an email, referring to the stock tickers of the suitors and target.
Icahn Arrives
At the heart of the tug-of-war over Anadarko is a fight for supremacy in the Permian Basin, the world’s largest oil patch. Chevron announced an ambitious, multibillion-dollar plan earlier this year to boost its fracking activities in the region, and buying Anadarko would turbo-boost its Permian growth. For Occidental, the deal is about securing its position as the dominant producer in the basin.
Buying Anadarko would be the biggest oil industry deal in four years and mark an end to an era of austerity among explorers chastened by a decline in crude prices and chastized by investors for poor returns. The pressure on Occidental and Chevron shares in the past two weeks showed investors were worried the industry was returning to the old ways, when profligate spending and bold deals were de rigueur.
Indeed, the controversy stirred up by Occidental’s bid appears to have attracted another interloper. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has built a small stake in the company, people familiar with the matter said on May 3.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
""Carl Icahn’s minor Occidental Petroleum stake may not be enough to reframe the debate over Anadarko, even as some shareholders remain skeptical of both the deal’s impact and the costs Berkshire extracted to help finance it. We believe Icahn is making a push to sway the outcome, as he has a stake in the Permian, Occidental’s prime motivator in pursuing Anadarko. Icahn inherited a position in Diamondback Energy, a midsized Permian E&P firm, through its purchase of Energen, a holding he initially pushed to seek alternatives. If Icahn can derail Occidental’s bid for Anadarko, the former would pursue a better-fitting, more digestible E&P target with a stronger concentration in the basin.""--Vincent G. Piazza, senior industry analyst, and Evan Lee, associate analystClick here to view the research
Occidental shares rose in after-market trading on Friday after the news of Icahn’s involvement, signaling that fresh doubt about the deal’s prospects was a positive catalyst for investors. On Monday, following the Total accord and the revised takeover offer, they had erased those gains and were down 1.6 percent. Anadarko rose as much as 2.4 percent to $74.50. Chevron was unchanged.
Four Days
Anadarko doesn’t just operate in the Permian, and both bidders face being saddled with unwanted assets -- Chevron has also said it will sell off billions of dollars of operations post merger.
The Total deal means the French company will take on oil operations in Ghana, Algeria and South Africa, as well as a massive liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. Total is already a major player in LNG while Occidental has no current involvement in that market and had already indicated that it was looking to sell the facility.
Investors now await a decision from the Anadarko board. Having previously rebuffed proposals from Occidental for more than a year, Anadarko agreed to start negotiations with the company even before the cash portion was lifted late Sunday. If Anadarko recommends a merger with Occidental, Chevron will have four days to make a counter offer or walk away.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 07:36AM ET</span>",Former Orange bosses stand trial over workers' suicides,"By Emmanuel Jarry and Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - Former bosses at leading French telecoms group Orange were due to go on trial on Monday over a series of suicides at the company in the late 2000s - a traumatic episode that shocked the nation and raised questions over corporate culture.
Ex-CEO Didier Lombard, along with six other former executives and the company itself, are accused of moral harassment in the first case of its kind on this scale in France, setting a potential precedent for large businesses.
The trial, in Paris' criminal court, is expected to run for the next two months. 
Central to the case is a plan under which the telecoms operator, a former state monopoly, aimed to cut its workforce by 22,000 and redeploy 10,000 workers between 2006 and 2010. Prosecutors believe this plan triggered the wave of suicides.
Between April 2008 and June 2010, prosecutors listed 18 suicides and 13 suicide attempts by employees of Orange, still called France Telecom at the time, when the company was engaged in deep restructuring after its privatization. 
Lombard, who denied any wrongdoing, stepped down as CEO of Orange in early 2010 amid criticism of his handling of the crisis.
The former CEO and the other former executives risk two years in prison and a 30,000 euro ($34,000) fine if found guilty.
An Orange spokesman declined to comment on the opening of the trial and the accusations but added that a lot of work had been done under current CEO Stephane Richard to improve the corporate culture.
METHODS QUESTIONED
The approach taken by former Orange bosses to accelerate cost-cutting plans had caused uproar in France. 
""I'll get them (the employees) out one way or another, through the window or the door,"" Lombard told a gathering of France Telecom's senior executives on Oct. 20, 2006, according to notes from the meeting that later came to light.
According to union records, the suicide wave claimed the lives of over 30 workers in two years, including a man who stabbed himself in the stomach during a staff meeting and a woman who threw herself out of a window. 
A 2010 report by labor inspectors said management used ""pathogenic"" restructuring methods such as forcing people into new jobs and giving them unattainable performance objectives.
These conclusions were followed up by public prosecutors in their own investigation. 
They stressed that Orange executives wanted to unsettle employees by deliberately making their work disorganized and forcing them to move from one place to the other. They also denounced the use of excessive and intrusive control methods including threats. 

The reorganization took place against the backdrop of the deregulation of the telecommunications sector and the gradual privatization of France's incumbent operator.

Bigbasket, which sells everything from groceries and fresh produce to pet food, competes with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's e-commerce unit Flipkart in many categories.
Supermarket Grocery Supplies Private Ltd, which owns Bigbasket, will use the proceeds for expansion and to scale up the online grocer's supply chain, the company said. Launched in 2011, Bigbasket operates across 25 Indian cities.
The Bengaluru-headquartered firm has been investing in warehousing and logistics as well as in expanding its delivery network to smaller towns and cities as it fights to keep its lead in a complex but fast-growing grocery business.
Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund and Alibaba were joined by the UK government's development finance institution, CDC Group, in the funding round, Bigbasket said.
Alibaba became the biggest shareholder in Bigbasket last year, after it led a $300 million funding round in the company, stepping up its competition with Amazon.
Bigbasket Chief Executive Hari Menon had then said it expected to break even between 2020 and 2022.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday he planned to discuss India's new e-commerce rules that could have an impact on operations of firms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) with his Indian counterpart on Monday.
Ross is visiting New Delhi at a time when India and the United States are locked in disputes over tariffs, price caps India has imposed on imported U.S. medical devices and over rules banning companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest. 
India also prohibits companies from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms, rules which could affect investment plans of foreign firms in India's fast-growing market set to touch $200 billion by 2027.
Ross told reporters he would discuss e-commerce with India's commerce minister, Suresh Prabhu.
Two trade ministry sources said India was hoping for a breakthrough in the talks.
""We are negotiating and we want there to be some breakthrough because India has stakes and they are one of the biggest partners and this is an opportunity to de-escalate tensions,"" one of the sources said.
In March, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to end preferential trade treatment for India that allows duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its exports to the United States.
India is the world's biggest beneficiary of that trade concession, called the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), and its withdrawal would be the strongest punitive action against the country since Trump took office in 2017.
India wants the United States to review its decision on GSP and also hopes the it will defer its decision to withdraw trade privileges until India's general elections are over on May 19, one of the sources said. 
Political and security ties between India and the United States have developed but trade has become a problem. Indian officials said both sides are likely to emphasize strategic ties and try to manage trade differences. 
""The messaging is a re-assurance that the U.S. thinks of India as a strategic partner and the relationship cannot be colored by differences on trade,"" one of the sources said.
Total U.S. trade with India stood at $87.5 billion in 2018, with the deficit at $21.3 billion. 

India has held off implementation of new tariffs on U.S. goods after Washington refused to give it an exemption on higher steel duties.

1186,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Tumble as Trump Breaks Trade Truce,"
Investing.com -- U.S. futures were taking a pummelling early Monday after President Donald Trump revived concerns about a full-blown trade war with threats of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports.
Dow futures were down 488 points or 1.8% by 6:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), while S&P 500 futures lost 49 points or 1.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 167 points or 2.1%.
Trump’s threats reportedly prompted China to scrap this week’s scheduled round of trade talks, consistent with its policy of refusing to negotiate “with a gun to its head”. The Wall Street Journal reported that a trade delegation would fly to Washington as planned.
It wasn’t clear, however, whether vice premier Liu He would head the delegation, as scheduled. Liu’s absence would make it harder for the delegation to make any top-level decisions and thus possibly push back further the timeline for a possible resolution to the dispute between the two countries.
The tweets came as a surprise after officials close to the talks had briefed about gradual progress and dangled the possibility of a summit at the end of May to sign off on a deal.
The list of most active losers in premarket trade is predictably headed by the ADRs of Chinese companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Jd.com (NASDAQ:JD) and electric vehicle maker NIO (NYSE:NIO). However, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – which has a high exposure to China both through its supply chain and its sales of iPhones – were also marked down.
Trump’s intervention came only 48 hours after another solid employment report damped hopes of any near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Three senior Fed officials may offer their interpretation of that report when they speak later Monday.
Crude oil futures also suffered from the U.S. President’s Twitter barrage, as a trade war is seen by the International Monetary Fund and many others as one of the biggest risks to the world economy, and consequently to oil demand.
U.S. crude oil futures tumbled overnight and were down 0.9% at $61.38 a barrel at 6:45 ET, while Brent futures were down 0.6% at $70.42 a barrel.
Elsewhere in commodities, gold futures rose in line with other haven assets to stand at $1,283.05 a troy ounce, up from $1,271.95 before the tweets.
In the currency market, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 97.317, rising against the euro, sterling and Australian dollar, but falling against the yen and the Swiss franc."

Malaysian Roger Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against him for allegedly laundering funds diverted from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund.
He left Goldman Sachs in 2014.
Ng had agreed to be sent to the United States, but the proceedings were delayed after Malaysia's home minister said he should first face criminal charges in the Southeast Asian nation.
Following negotiations, the two countries have now agreed for Ng to be temporarily surrendered to the United States for ten months and for the U.S. case against him to proceed first,
Malaysia's attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement. 
Ng was sent to the United States on May 3 and will be returned to Malaysia to face charges as soon as the U.S. proceedings are concluded. 
""The period of temporary surrender may be extended upon mutual agreement by Malaysia and the U.S.,"" Thomas added.
Goldman Sachs is under scrutiny for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB.
The DoJ has estimated that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise.
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used.
Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales. 
He was also charged in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law targeting official bribery abroad. 
Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB funds. Leissner has pleaded guilty.
Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-prime minister Najib Razak. 

Najib, who lost a general election last year, is facing 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 06:11AM ET</span>","Foxconn's Gou wants to be peacemaker between U.S., China and Taiwan","By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - The chairman of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn said on Monday he wanted Beijing to recognize the existence of Taiwan, as he outlined his plans to be the peacemaker between China, the United States and the self-ruled island Beijing sees as its own.
Billionaire Terry Gou, who said last month he would run for president of Taiwan in 2020, met U.S. President Donald Trump last week to discuss the status of the Taiwan company's planned investment in Wisconsin.
""I told Trump specifically that I’m here to be a peacemaker,"" Gou told a news conference in the capital, Taipei, adding that he had met Trump in an effort to improve his private relationship and not as a campaigner.
But he told Trump of his desire to forge a mutually-beneficial peace and improved commercial links, he added.
""This ‘peace’ involves the United States, China and Taiwan, not just Taiwan and China,"" he added. ""The U.S is involved.""
The United States and China are in the middle of a bruising trade dispute, with Trump threatening on Sunday to raise U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and soon target hundreds of billions more.
Using Taiwan's official name, Gou said, ""We’d like to ask Beijing to recognize and acknowledge the existence of the Republic of China.""
Gou said he would like to have talks with Beijing on a ""mutually equal basis"" to boost economic development for both China and Taiwan.
Beijing regards the island as a breakaway province, part of ""one China"", and has not renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.
The United States acknowledges that China takes the position that there is one China and that Taiwan is part of it. But it is also Taiwan's biggest ally and arms supplier and is duty-bound by law to help the island defend itself.
Gou also hit back at critics whom he described as ""trying to make me (out as) 'red' by saying that I will be held hostage,"" over Foxconn's investments in China.
The trade spat between China and the United States might end soon, Gou said, but the broader tensions between them could drag on longer.
The United States has also been pressing allies to limit the role of Chinese telecom equipment makers, such as Huawei Technologies, over concerns their gear could be used by Beijing for spying. Huawei says such concerns are baseless.
Foxconn has pledged to create 13,000 jobs and build a $10-billion campus in Wisconsin, but has not met early hiring targets and has said it has been reconsidering its plans.
Gou said the investment is intended to help the United States reshape its technology supply chain.
Last month, he told Reuters he planned to step down from the world's largest contract manufacturer to make way for younger talent to move up its ranks.
A board meeting is to be held on Friday, Gou added, but declined to comment on questions over his succession plan.

1191,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",China State Funds Sought to Cushion Blow as Stocks Tumble,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese state-backed funds were active in selected stocks on Monday, people familiar with the matter said, seeking to cushion the blow from a sudden escalation in trade tensions with the U.S.
Among the funds’ targets were two large oil companies, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private information. PetroChina Co., which fell as much as 3.5 percent in Shanghai, pared losses in afternoon trading to close with a 0.9 percent decline. China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. also spiked briefly, though it ended the day down 4.2 percent. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the country’s largest lender, displayed a similar pattern.
State funds stepped in after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened China with steeper tariffs, ramping up tensions in a trade conflict that many investors had hoped was nearing an end. While the large-cap stock moves helped major equity gauges close off their lows, the Shanghai Composite Index still finished down 5.6 percent, its steepest drop in three years.
Chinese authorities have a long history of intervening to smooth swings in the country’s $7 trillion stock market, though their efforts have had mixed success in recent years. Maintaining market calm may help President Xi Jinping’s negotiators project strength as they try to strike a trade deal without giving away too much to Washington. Past instances of Chinese market intervention have tended to become most visible during the afternoon, with sudden swings in stocks that have large weightings in benchmark indexes.

Not all investors have welcomed such moves. “The government needs to come up with a basket of solutions to alleviate the market’s key concerns, rather than resorting to a short-term boost to stock prices, which would only prove to be futile and nothing more than a window-dressing act,” said Raymond Chen, a portfolio manager at Keywise Capital Management Beijing Ltd.
Signs of government support also emerged outside the stock market on Monday. At least one big Chinese bank offered to sell the U.S. currency as the onshore yuan fell toward 6.80 per dollar, according to traders, limiting depreciation in the Chinese currency after it dropped the most in nearly three months. Separately, China’s central bank said it will set a lower reserve requirement ratio for mid- and small-sized banks focusing on local economies.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission didn’t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
While state funds helped ensure a steady bull market in Chinese stocks for much of 2016 and 2017, the government was widely criticized for its botched attempts to end a $5 trillion selloff in mid-2015.
This year, the Shanghai Composite is one of the world’s best-performing benchmark stock indexes. It’s up 17 percent even after Monday’s slide, buoyed by looser credit conditions in China and signs that Asia’s largest economy is stabilizing after a tough 2018.

(Reuters) - European shares were deep in the red on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly ratcheted up trade tensions between the world's largest economies by vowing to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by this week, prompting investors to flee riskier bets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index had shed 1.4 percent by 0845 GMT, its steepest fall in six weeks. 
Sharper selling was seen in regional bourses with Germany, France, Italy and Spain down between 1.6 percent and 2.2 percent. Markets in Britain remained shut for a bank holiday.
The narrower Euro Stoxx index slipped 2.2 percent, on pace for its worst day since early December. 
Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal have partly been the reason for the strong rally in equities this year, with most country indices recovering from a major rout last year and hitting multi-month highs.
Oil prices slumped and Asian shares took a beating after Trump, in an unexpected move to mount pressure on China, said on Sunday that trade talks were proceeding ""too slowly"", and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and target hundreds of billions more soon.
China's foreign ministry still said a Chinese delegation is preparing to go to United States for trade talks.
""Optimism had only just been picking up on hopes that China's economy was finding stability and this threat from Trump risks derailing that train in a hurry,"" said Han Tan, Market Analyst at FXTM.
""Ailing demand would prove another thorn in the side for Germany's manufacturing sector."" 
Latest survey showed the euro zone economy limped into the second quarter with lackluster growth as weakness in the manufacturing sector is increasingly affecting the bloc's dominant services industry.
Auto stocks' - sensitive to trade news - tumbled 3.5 percent, leading broad-based declines among European sectors. 
Luxembourg-based Stabilus slipped after the auto supplier cut its full-year guidance on account of the ongoing weakness in the global auto industry.
Chipmaker stocks AMS, STMicro and Siltronic, which are highly sensitive to trade war news, lost between 2.7 to 5 percent. 
In a relatively light day for earnings, dealmaking was in focus.
French energy major Total said it had reached a binding agreement with Occidental (NYSE:OXY) to acquire Anadarko assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa for a consideration of $8.8 billion.
Telecoms, a defensive sector, outperformed. Shares in Norway's Telenor rose 3.5 percent after the company and Malaysia's Axiata Group said they are in talks to form a jointly-owned Asian telecoms company.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks tumbled to a one-month low and German bond yields slipped back into negative territory on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, triggering a global rout in risky assets.
In a surprise twist on Sunday, Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, signaling a major shift. Trump had earlier cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Global investors were caught off guard as they had been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade agreement soon.
""The market was caught on the wrong foot as everyone expected talks were heading in the right direction and almost close to finishing,” said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). “This was totally out of the blue and the reaction is that we have more risk aversion today.""
The latest episode in the trade war comes on the back of weeks of low market volatility across asset classes and a growing swathe of tepid but steady economic data with little negative surprises lulling investors into a sense of calm.
Chinese shares plunged more than 6 percent, while U.S. stock market futures fell 1.6 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan fell to a 10-month low. 
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell half a percent.
Trump sharply escalated tensions between the world's two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding ""too slowly"", and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent.
The tweets stirred up the hitherto calm market mood arising from signs of improving economic growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well.
China's foreign ministry said on Monday a delegation was preparing to go to United States for trade talks.
While many market watchers including ING regard the latest episode as a negotiating tactic by Trump, investors pared their positions in risky assets after recent gains.
SEA OF RED
European stock markets were a sea of red while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent, signaling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday.
Germany's main stock index was down 1.8 percent while a broader index of European shares declined 2 percent to its lowest level since early April.
Moves were slightly exaggerated, with Japanese markets still on holidays while London markets were shut for a local holiday.
Losses in equities translated into gains for bonds with benchmark government bond yields in Germany retreating to a shade below zero and not far from a 2-1/2-year low of minus 0.09 percent hit in late March.
Emerging market currencies and commodity-linked currencies were the hardest hit with the Australian dollar falling half a percent against the greenback while the offshore yuan swooned nearly a percent
In commodity markets, Trump's tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices. 
U.S. crude at one point dropped as much as 3.1 percent to a more-than-five-week low, before bouncing to $60.69 per barrel - still off 1.3 percent on the day. Brent crude LCOc1 was 1.8 percent lower at $69.59 per barrel.
The selloff in risky assets burnished the lure of gold with spot gold up 0.25 percent to trade at $1,282.20 per ounce.

1194,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",The Market Gave Trump Space for Tariff Tweet. But for How Long?,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump had the comfort of an 18 percent rally in U.S. stocks for the year so far when he tweeted the threat of more China tariffs. But what the market giveth, the market has demonstrated it can taketh away.
The circumstances were quite different at the start of 2019, when the S&P 500 Index’s biggest quarterly sell-off in more than seven years had fueled fears of recession. Key economic advisers were campaigning in the White House for a quick resolution to the trade war with China to help markets recover. Even with a solid recovery in shares by March, Trump himself was pushing his negotiators to close a trade deal soon, concerned that failure could drag down stocks, people familiar with the matter said.
“There’s an element of saying ‘the market has rallied this year’ and the U.S. administration saying ‘that’s a sign of strength in the U.S. economy, so we can be a bit more forceful right now’” with China, said Kerry Craig, a global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Melbourne.
Yet with the rally itself driven in part by expectations of a trade deal, the risk is that the tariff threat “unwinds anything the U.S. might have been playing on,” Craig said.
No modern president has been as direct as Trump in the importance he places on American equities. Go back no further than last month, when he renewed his campaign for Federal Reserve monetary easing with a tweet claiming the stock market would have been much higher. In early March, he said that “you’re going to see a very big spike” in stocks once trade deals get done.
True, Trump effectively kicked off the trade war back when U.S. stocks had just gone through the “volmageddon” unwind last year. But the American economy was just starting to get a kick from tax cuts at the time, so there was support from other areas. And that economic good cheer helped U.S. equities outperform the rest of the world during the summer of 2018 as the trade war raged on. Chinese shares in particular did poorly, by contrast.
Trump even crowed in an August tweet that “our market is stronger than ever,” while China’s had tumbled, weakening its bargaining power. That confidence evaporated during the rout in U.S. benchmarks seen in October and, with even greater vehemence, December, when the president blamed the Fed for having hurt both the economy and markets with its tightening campaign. The S&P 500 slid 14 percent that quarter.
Supporting Pillars
The Fed’s pivot to a patient stance on interest rates, and a pledge to halt the contraction in its balance sheet in coming months, has provided part of the lift for stocks, which saw Wall Street notch fresh records last week. Also helping: strong earnings, with about three-quarters of S&P 500 members reporting for the January-to-March period beating consensus expectations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Those two pillars could still help limit declines in American equities. The 1.8 percent slide in futures on the S&P 500 Index as of 3:18 p.m. Hong Kong time was a fraction of the 5.6 percent plunge in the Shanghai Composite. But all bets could be off if the trade deal investors had anticipated as soon as this week proves beyond reach.
“Now that Wall Street is at record highs, he has some leeway to threaten again,” Stephen Innes, the head of trading at SPI Asset Management, said of Trump. “He’s willing to shave off some equity market gains to make that happen.”
Innes added that “ultimately, after this clear-out, some attractive levels will be there for the taking.”
That may be all the more true if the slide serves as a way station to a trade deal.
“The most likely outcome is that a deal will still be done,” said Arthur Kroeber, the head of research at Gavekal Research. “The main reason is that global markets have priced in a deal, so a failure of the talks will trigger a massive sell-off,” he wrote in a note to clients. “The odds still favor an agreement in time for Trump and Xi Jinping to sign it ahead of the G-20 summit in Osaka on June 28.”

Investing.com -- Stocks are in retreat all across Europe on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump reignited fears of an all-out trade war between the U.S. and China.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 5.34 points, or 1.4% at 385.02
The French CAC 40 was the worst affected, losing 2.0%, while the German DAX was down 1.7%. The U.K. FTSE was closed due a public holiday.
They’re all following the Chinese market, which had its worst one-day loss in three years after Trump revived threats of raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%, as well as threatening to levy 25% tariffs on $325 billion more in Chinese goods previously unaffected by the dispute.
Trump’s threats represent a serious and surprising blow to market morale, after weeks of guidance from both U.S. and Chinese officials that an agreement on trade between the two countries was likely. They came only 48 hours after the monthly U.S. employment report showed the U.S. economy still performing well, adding more jobs than expected without any noticeable pick-up in inflation.
The U.S.-China angle is overshadowing domestic news. There was little reaction to the release of IHS Markit's Eurozone composite purchasing managers index, which showed that activity picked up marginally in April.
Stocks sensitive to global trade are among the worst losers, with German chemicals company BASF (DE:BASFN) down over 7% (that's also due in part to its going ex-dividend) and French auto supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) down 4%. The big French and German automakers are all down, as is steelmaker ArcelorMittal, which announced sharp but notionally temporary cutbacks in European steel production earlier, citing the weak economic outlook, along with high electricity and carbon costs.
And the resilient ones? Utilities are performing well, with Spain’s  Endesa  (MC:ELE) and  Red Electrica  (MC:REE), France’s Engie (PA:ENGIE) and Germany’s  E.On  (DE:EONGn) all outperforming local indices."
1196,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 04:05AM ET</span>","China stocks fall most in over three years on tariff threats, yuan tumbles","By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets.
The country's major stock indexes fell the most in more than three years. The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Around 1,000 mainland firms plummet the maximum allowed 10 percent daily limit. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent.
Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly.
Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China's economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying.
Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China's central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks.
The yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent.
Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. 
Trump's move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy.
""The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,"" said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong.
""If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,"" he said. 
But China's bond market would benefit from ""diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,"" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore.
PESSIMISM 
China's Vice Premier Liu He is ""very unlikely"" to go to the United States this week following Trump's ""threat"" to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China's influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government.
Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as ""productive.""
""Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,"" said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. 
""The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilize the market,"" he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates.
Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. 
The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. 
'RIGHTFULLY WORRIED'
Chinese shares have surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. 
""In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,"" Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. 
But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike in 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing's clampdown on debt, ""liquidity conditions are much better this year."" 
In a move to bolster domestic growth, China's central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies.
Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China's stock market opened, and just hours after Trump's tweets. 
While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown.
""It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,"" said Westpac's Cheung.

China is Australia's largest wine export market, and although shipment growth has stalled in recent months, a reputation for quality has supported years of soaring sales.
Penfolds wines and, especially, the ultra-high-end Grange vintages, are popular and profitable, and are sold under the brand name ""Ben Fu"" in China. Treasury sued in February to restrain Australian company Rush Rich from using those names.
It said on Friday that Australia's Federal Court ordered Rush Rich to cease and pay just over A$375,000 ($262,000) in compensation.
""This positive outcome affirms TWE's leadership in protecting it's IP rights against copycat and counterfeit operators,"" Treasury said, referring to itself by its stockmarket code, in an emailed statement.
""The company continues to invest strongly in this area through a dedicated brand protection team ... and works closely with local authorities in Australia and China and partners to enforce against bad faith operators,"" the company said.
Court filings show Rush Rich was also ordered to pay Treasury's legal costs. 
Reuters was unable to immediately find a publicly-available telephone number for a representative of Rush Rich, which does not have an Australian website.
Corporate filings show Rush Rich is based in Adelaide. The Adelaide Advertiser newspaper has previously quoted Rush Rich operator Vincent Zhao denying the firm copied Treasury.
""We reject, in the strongest terms, Treasury Wine Estate's assertion that we have infringed any trademark held by Treasury Wine Estates and will contest this vigorously,"" the paper quoted Zhao as saying a year ago.
""Our product range does not in any way resemble the Penfolds' range,"" he said. 
Images of Rush Rich bottles on wine-selling websites show label designs and product names similar to Penfolds'.
Australian and New Zealand suppliers of goods from wine and lamb to honey have lately been stepping up efforts to combat fakes, particularly in the lucrative Chinese market.
Treasury won a similar legal challenge in China over the right to use the ""Ben Fu"" trademark there in 2017.

Chiyoda, one of the world's leading builders of liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, has struggled with losses after a hurricane hit its Cameron LNG project in Louisiana. 
However, a global shift from coal is seen boosting the demand for natural gas, and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) has forecast the global LNG trade to rise 11 percent to 354 million tonnes this year. Mitsubishi has said it expects such growth to also fuel a rise in LNG projects.
Mitsubishi, which has bailed out Chiyoda twice already and has a 33.4 percent stake in the engineering company, will provide the bulk of the 150 billion yen ($1.36 billion) lifeline through a private placement of new preferred shares and loans, the report said, without citing sources. 
MUFG Bank, a part of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, will provide additional financing, it said.
Chiyoda said it was in talks, but no decision had yet been made. It also said its full-year loss would likely be bigger than it previously forecast.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",Rice Energy founder to drop lawsuit against energy producer EQT,"By David French
(Reuters) - Toby Rice, the co-founder of Rice Energy which was acquired by EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) in 2017, will drop his lawsuit against EQT after the U.S. oil and gas producer said it was not seeking to manipulate the outcome of his board challenge, a Rice spokesman said on Sunday.
Rice and his brother Derek have put forward a slate of nominees to challenge EQT's board in a shareholder vote in July, arguing EQT has mismanaged the $6.7 billion acquisition of their company to the detriment of EQT investors.
In a lawsuit last month, Rice also accused EQT of seeking to mislead its shareholders by portraying his board nominees as endorsing EQT's existing board, and presenting their election as triggering covenants that would require EQT to repay early or refinance its debt.
In a letter on Sunday to its management, EQT said the lawsuit was a distraction without merit. It said the Rice team had misinterpreted a ""standard form director and officer questionnaire"" and that it would not seek to conflate its board directors with the Rice nominees. It added it had no intention of triggering change of control provisions that would have required a debt refinancing or early repayment.
In response, the Rice team told Reuters in its statement it was pleased ""EQT has conceded that it must withdraw its unreasonable requirements"" and that it was ""deeply disappointed"" that a lawsuit was needed to address the issue. The Rice team is continuing with its effort to overthrow EQT's board.
Pittsburgh-based EQT became one of the largest gas-focused U.S. producers when it completed its tie-up with Rice Energy. Despite its new scale, EQT’s share price has lagged since the merger, spurring the Rice brothers to call for changes.
How the company develops its assets is at the heart of the dispute. The Rice brothers insist the current management has not fulfilled EQT's potential, while the company insists the siblings’ projections are inflated and based on outdated market conditions.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2019 05:28PM ET</span>",Boeing did not disclose 737 MAX alert issue to FAA for 13 months,"By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) did not tell U.S. regulators for more than a year that it inadvertently made an alarm alerting pilots to a mismatch of flight data optional on the 737 MAX, instead of standard as on earlier 737s, but insisted on Sunday the missing display represented no safety risk 
The U.S. planemaker has been trying for weeks to dispel suggestions that it made airlines pay for safety features after it emerged that an alert designed to show discrepancies in Angle of Attack readings from two sensors was optional on the 737 MAX.
Erroneous data from a sensor responsible for measuring the angle at which the wing slices through the air - known as the Angle of Attack - is suspected of triggering a flawed piece of software that pushed the plane downward in two recent crashes.
In a statement, Boeing said it only discovered once deliveries of the 737 MAX had begun in 2017 that the so-called AOA Disagree alert was optional instead of standard as it had intended, but added that was not critical safety data.
A Federal Aviation Administration official told Reuters on Sunday that Boeing waited 13 months before informing the agency in November 2018.
By becoming optional, the alert had been treated in the same way as a separate indicator showing raw AOA data, which is seldom used by commercial pilots and had been an add-on for years.
""Neither the angle of attack indicator nor the AOA Disagree alert are necessary for the safe operation of the airplane,"" Boeing said.
""They provide supplemental information only, and have never been considered safety features on commercial jet transport airplanes.""
Boeing said a Safety Review Board convened after a fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October corroborated its prior conclusion that the alert was not necessary for the safe operation of commercial aircraft and could safely be tackled in a future system update.
The FAA backed that assessment but criticized Boeing for being slow to disclose the problem.
Boeing briefed the FAA on the display issue in November, after the Lion Air accident, and a special panel deemed it to be ""low risk,"" an FAA spokesman said.
""However, Boeing’s timely or earlier communication with the operators would have helped to reduce or eliminate possible confusion,"" he added.
Boeing attributed the error to software delivered to the company from an outside source, but did not give details.
INDUSTRY DEBATE
Sunday's statement marked the first time since the two fatal accidents that Boeing explicitly acknowledged doing something inadvertently in the development of the 737 MAX, albeit on an issue that it contends has no impact on safety.
Boeing has said the feeding of erroneous Angle of Attack data to a system called MCAS that pushed the planes lower was a common link in two wider chains of events leading to both crashes, but has stopped short of admitting error on that front.
The angle of attack measures the angle between the air flow and the wing and helps determine whether the plane is able to fly correctly. If the angle becomes too steep, the flow of air over the wing is disturbed, throwing the plane into an aerodynamic stall. That means it starts to fall instead of fly.
    Although the angle itself is key for onboard systems, the industry has debated for years whether such data should be included in already crowded cockpit displays because it is directly related to airspeed, which pilots already scrutinize.
Some analysts and academics say having the AOA Disagree alert installed would have helped Lion Air maintenance crew diagnose a problem on the penultimate flight of the 737 MAX jet that crashed in October, killing all 189 on board.
The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide over safety concerns following the Ethiopian crash in March, killing 157 people.
When the jet returns to service, all new aircraft will have a working AOA Disagree alert as a standard feature and a no-charge optional indicator showing the underlying data, Boeing said. That restores the situation found on the displays of previous 737NG models since around the middle of last decade.
Airlines with grounded 737 MAX jets will be able to activate the AOA Disagree function directly.
Boeing is also developing a software upgrade and training changes to the MCAS system that must be approved by global regulators before the jets can fly again.
Boeing has yet to formally submit the upgrades to the FAA for approval but could do as early as this week once it completes a special test flight.

Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department inspector general's office and a blue-ribbon panel are also looking into the 737 MAX's certification. A U.S. House of Representatives panel will hold a hearing on the plane's status with the FAA's acting chief, Dan Elwell, and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt on May 15.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>",Airbus considers legal action against Germany over Saudi ban: sources,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus is considering suing the German government as its freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia means the company is unable to complete a border security system for the Gulf state, two people familiar with the matter said.
In October, Germany decided to reject future arms exports licenses to Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and to freeze deliveries of already approved equipment - a move that infuriated allies and defense companies.
Airbus is looking at taking legal action against Berlin over the security system for the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen - a contract worth some 3 billion euros ($3.36 billion), of which around 1 billion euros remains open, the sources said.
""We are looking at an action for failure to act,"" said one source familiar with the matter, speaking on Sunday on condition of anonymity. ""We want to force the federal government to decide now.""
Airbus declined to comment.
The German government has said it could not comment on any potential corporate compensation claims as a result of the Saudi arms export ban until any materialize.
It was not immediately clear where in Germany or when any lawsuit would be filed.
In late March, Germany extended the ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia until the end of September, with a few exceptions.
The border system for Saudi Arabia consists of radars, drones and command posts for guards.
""We are not talking about an offensive weapon here, but about a border security system,"" the source said.
Airbus, which had to make risk provisions of 300 million euros due to non-completion of the contract, feels an obligation to take legal action to show its customers, shareholders and suppliers that it is doing everything it can to complete the contract, the source said.

In February, company sources told Reuters that Airbus had decided to redesign the C295 military transport aircraft it builds in Spain to remove German components following Germany's freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia.

1206,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",One Word Grips the Bond Market Before Crucial Inflation Update,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond traders will have one word on their minds as they gear up for the latest readings on inflation: “transitory.”
That’s how Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell characterized the factors behind muted price pressures after last week’s policy meeting, where officials kept interest rates unchanged. Markets whipsawed on his comments, with benchmark 10-year Treasury yields bouncing off their lowest levels in a month.
This week, traders get to see if Powell’s right, with updates on producer and consumer price indexes. Friday’s CPI report is expected to show that inflation picked up last month. Still, the bar will be high when it comes to altering market expectations for the Fed’s path, according to TD Securities. Powell said officials don’t “see a strong case” for moving rates in either direction, and futures traders seem to agree: They still expect a quarter-point cut as the next move, but it’s not fully priced in until mid-2020.
“CPI will be quite crucial, as Chair Powell hinted at some of the transitory factors weighing down inflation,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior U.S. rates strategist. “A stronger inflation report could help push back on some of the pricing for rate cuts this year, though I think some doubts will remain since this will be viewed as only one reading.”
That skepticism was evident Friday. Despite a robust U.S. labor report, traders barely changed expectations for when a cut would be fully priced in, as they zeroed in on tame earnings growth. Yields on 10-year Treasuries ended the week at 2.53 percent, after swinging in a 12-basis-point weekly range -- the largest span in over a month.
Entrenched View
Schroder Investment Management’s Lisa Hornby is of a similar mind when it comes to the resilience of rate-cut wagers. Though inflation is “the most important data we have to look at,” the portfolio manager says it will take more than one report to sway the market.
“It will take a lot to move the Fed and therefore, market pricing,” Hornby said. “The Fed is firmly on hold until a direction comes clear” as far as the trajectory of inflation.
She anticipates range-bound trading, but sees scope for higher yields. She says she’d buy should 10-year yields exceed 2.7 percent in the next few weeks -- a level last seen in March.
Consumer prices, excluding food and energy, probably rose 0.2 percent in April from the prior month, and 2.1 percent on a yearly basis, a slightly quicker pace than seen in March, according to the median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Any surprise to the upside could douse yield-curve steepening bets, according to Goldberg.
“A firmer inflation print will help yields rebound somewhat, but that rebound may be concentrated in the front-end of the curve, which could lead the curve to flatten further,” he said.
Goldberg said he’ll also monitor this week’s barrage of Fed speakers for any push-back on the view Powell laid out last week. More than a half-dozen policy makers are scheduled to appear this week, including the chairman.

(Reuters) - Federal investigators on Saturday began searching for what caused a Boeing (NYSE:BA) jetliner with 143 people on board to slide off a runway into a shallow river while landing at a Jacksonville, Florida, military base during a thunderstorm, injuring 22 people.
The Boeing 737-800 chartered by the U.S. military was arriving from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba with 136 passengers and seven crew members when it slid into the St. Johns River at the end of the 9,000-foot runway at Naval Air Station Jacksonville on Friday night, authorities said.
Officials raised the count of people injured to 22, from 21, after a three-month-old child was admitted to a local hospital for observation, Capt. Michael Connor, commanding officer at the Jacksonville station, told a news conference. 
National Transportation Safety Board investigators have recovered an undamaged flight data recorder and it has been sent to Washington for analysis, NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said at the news conference. 
""We expect to get a very full report on that shortly,"" he said.
Investigators said they are hoping to interview the crew on Sunday. 
The cockpit voice recorder is in the tail of the plane and submerged underwater. Investigators will not be able to recover it until the aircraft is lifted out of the water, Landsberg said. 
""We are going to be very careful in preserving the perishable evidence,"" he said. 
Officials were determining the best way to remove the plane from the water, NTSB investigator in charge John Lovell said. 
""There are some ideas being floated in terms of putting some sort of cushioning below it ... and moving it on those cushions,"" he said.
The U.S. Coast Guard placed floating booms around the jetliner to contain leaking jet fuel in the water, Landsberg said. 
The plane, chartered from Miami Air International, was attempting to land at about 9:40 p.m. local time amid thunder and lightning when it slid off the runway and came to rest in the shallow water of the river, authorities and passengers said.
Landsberg said investigators will look closely at whether the weather played a role in the incident. 
""It is a miracle. We could be talking about a different story,"" Connor said early on Saturday. 
Active duty military members, civilian government employees and their dependents were on the jetliner, Connor told CNN. 
The military base is on the western bank of the St. Johns River about 8 miles (12.87 km) south of central Jacksonville, about 350 miles (563.27 km) north of Miami.
Miami Air International is a charter airline operating a fleet of the Boeing 737-800, different from the 737 MAX 8 aircraft that has been grounded following two fatal crashes involving that plane.
Representatives of the airline did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 
A spokesman for  Boeing Co  said that the company was aware of the incident and gathering information.

The charter company is contracted by the military for its twice-weekly ""rotator"" round-trip service between the U.S. mainland and Guantanamo Bay, said Bill Dougherty, a spokesman for the Jacksonville base.

The president announced the budget cuts in an executive memo released late on Friday, but did not give an estimate for how much the new austerity measures would save.
Finance Minister Carlos Uruzua said in a statement that the savings would be used to ""strengthen"" Pemex, but did not elaborate.
The measures announced by the president include leaving vacant positions unfilled, less spending on printing and travel for government workers, and stricter limits on which officials can use government-paid chauffeurs.
Lopez Obrador has repeatedly pledged to revive Pemex, which has seen its oil output decline for 14 consecutive years. On Friday he said that ""very soon"" he would be unveiling a reduced tax structure for the company.
Petroleos Mexicanos, as Pemex is formally known, is the world's most indebted oil company. The federal government depends on the taxes it pays to fund around 15 percent of its budget.
In recent years, the government has taxed more than 80 percent of the company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
Due in large part to its financial debt of some $106 billion, Pemex faces the possibility that its credit rating could be downgraded to so-called junk status, which could trigger a range of adverse consequences including much higher financing costs.

Two of the three major ratings agencies rate Pemex just barely within their investment grade categories, and all three have said a major factor that weighs on the firm's finances is the high level of taxation levied on it by the government.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc is  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's largest shareholder, on Saturday signaled no shift in his support for the bank despite several scandals it has faced.
""Wells made some big mistakes,"" Buffett said. ""When you find a problem, you have to do something about it. I think that's probably where they made a mistake.""
Buffett made his comments as he and his long-time business partner, Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, fielded several hours of shareholder and analyst questions before tens of thousands of people attending Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.
Wells Fargo has spent more than 2-1/2 years addressing fallout for mistreating its customers, including by creating fake accounts, losing two chief executives in the process, including Tim Sloan in March.
Munger said, ""I don't think people ought to go to jail for honest errors of judgment,"" and that he wished former Wells Fargo chief executive Tim Sloan was still at the bank and that the banker was an ""accidental casualty.""
A Wells Fargo spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours.
BIG PROFITS, BIG BUYBACKS
Berkshire also reported on Saturday that gains in its stock investments fueled a $21.66 billion profit in the first quarter, when it also repurchased $1.7 billion of stock.
Operating income rose 5 percent, helped by the Geico and BNSF railroad, though it fell just shy of analyst forecasts.
Berkshire's buybacks reflected Buffett's troubles to find better uses for Berkshire's cash hoard, which now totals $114.2 billion.
The 88-year-old investor is struggling with the question, ""how do I buy a business with the uncertainty that the multiples I'm paying today are sustainable five to seven years from now,"" said Mario Gabelli, chief executive of GAMCO Investors Inc, whose funds own Berkshire shares.
Berkshire owns companies across industries and countries, and it employs more than 389,000 people, making the results a barometer for the U.S. economy as well as a report card for one of the world's most revered investors.
The shareholder meeting is a rare chance for shareholders to ask Buffett questions directly.
Results excluded operating earnings tied to Berkshire's 26.7 percent stake in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co because the food company has not released its own audited quarterly results, Buffett told reporters before the annual meeting.
""It's pretty unusual,"" Buffett said of Kraft's reporting issues as he inched through a crowd of reporters and picture-taking fans in a scene that resembled a slow-motion stampede.
NOT JUST BUSINESS
The annual meeting is not all about business. Buffett's career of investing success and down-to-earth public persona are both part of the draw.
""We love you Warren,"" people shouted as he walked through the arena and nibbled on a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. Parents lifted their kids in the air so they could get a glimpse of the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha.
People lined up before midnight to get early access to the best seats at the downtown Omaha arena, which opened at 7 a.m.
Daphne Kalir-Starr, 9, a fourth-grader from New York City, lined up with her father at 11 p.m. the night before, along with her sleeping bag. It's her third time to see Buffett.
""I really like hearing from great investors,"" she said. ""Even though he wasn't really recognized at the beginning, he kept working at it.""
Events are being held around Omaha, and people can buy mementos such as postage stamps featuring Buffett and Munger or, for $8,950, a pair of 2 carat-weight diamond stud earrings from Berkshire's Borsheims jewelry unit.
Bela Chowdhury, 49, came to see Buffett from Kolkata, India, with more than a dozen other students of a nonprofit group that promotes financial literacy for women.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Saturday said gains in its stock investments fueled a big first-quarter profit, while improved results from its Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad units boosted operating results.
Berkshire also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its stock in the quarter, reflecting Buffett's troubles to find better uses for the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's cash hoard, which now totals $114.2 billion.
Results were released as Buffett, 88, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, prepared to answer more than five hours of questions from shareholders and analysts at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which draws tens of thousands of people.
The $21.66-billion overall profit, or $13,209 per Class A share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $1.14 billion, or $692 per share, and a fourth-quarter net loss of $25.39 billion.
These results illustrate what Buffett has called the ""wild and capricious"" and, in his view, meaningless swings caused by an accounting rule requiring the reporting of unrealized stock gains with earnings, regardless of Berkshire's plans to sell. Berkshire had $15.1 billion of these gains in the first quarter.
Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 5 percent to $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per Class A share, from $5.29 billion, or $3,215 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $3,399 per Class A share, according to Refinitiv data.
Results excluded operating earnings tied to Berkshire's 26.7 percent stake in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co because the food company has not released its own audited quarterly results, Buffett told reporters before the annual meeting.
Buffett also maintained that ""we paid too much"" for Kraft Heinz, which was created in a 2015 merger between Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, which Berkshire and Brazil's 3G Capital controlled.
In last year's fourth quarter, Berkshire took a $3-billion writedown on Kraft.
GEICO, BNSF
Geico saw pre-tax underwriting profit rise 14 percent as rising rates and premiums offset higher accident claims.
BNSF's profit rose 9 percent to $1.25 billion as higher demand from the energy and industrial sectors offset lower volumes attributed to severe winter weather and flooding.
Among other businesses, the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit posted a 3-percent profit increase, while earnings from retailing and services units increased 16 percent, despite a 19 percent revenue drop at See's Candies because Easter fell late.
Berkshire owns more than 90 companies. 
Last month, Berkshire committed $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's cash-and-stock bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), which  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) also wants to buy.
The Berkshire investment is contingent on Occidental completing its proposed purchase of Anadarko.

The Franco-Dutch company, which blamed higher fuel costs and price competition for its operating loss of 303 million euros ($339 million), will present the redundancy plan to a union and management meeting on May 13, La Tribune said on its website.
Another 200 departing staff would not be replaced, it added.
An Air France spokesman confirmed that a voluntary plan to cut short-haul ground staff would be presented on May 13 but declined to give details on the proposals ahead of the meeting.
He also said that a company review had pointed to a need to hire more than 1,000 people across the company's business this year.
Air France-KLM has trailed rivals Lufthansa and British Airways (part of Intercontinental Airlines) on profitability, held back by restrictive French union deals and strikes that last year wiped 335 million euros off earnings and forced out its previous chief executive.

Under CEO Ben Smith, who joined last September from Air Canada, the airline is seeking to boost efficiency in part via better coordination of the Air France and KLM networks, but his task is complicated by the arrival of the Dutch government as a major shareholder keen to preserve KLM's autonomy.

1213,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2019 03:19AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Chips May Dip
Semiconductor stocks continue to flirt with record highs, boasting gains of more than 40% since their December slump as investors bet on a turnaround in the second half of the year. But new findings showing a sharp decline in chip sales suggest the near-term optimism may be misplaced.
Worldwide sales of semiconductors totaled $96.8 billion during the first quarter of 2019, a 15.5% plunge over the fourth quarter and a 13% drop year on year, according to a report published by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) on Monday.
IC Insights, a market research firm, offered up a more dour assessment, estimating that the real first-quarter revenue decline was 17.1%, calling it the largest year-on-year drop since 2001 and the fourth largest since 1984. While the first quarter for chip sales is usually the weakest, with an average decline sequentially of 2.1% over the past 36 years, according to IC, the drop this year was much larger than the average.
The outlook is hardly encouraging, with the research firm estimating the sector will suffer a double-digit sales decline for the year.
But in the face of dwindling sales, proponents of semis point to industry bellwether Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) outlook on a recovery and the rebound in China's economy as a source of hope.
""China was a big cloud, and Qualcomm’s kissing and making up with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) actually turned out to be Intel’s loss, so some of this is very idiosyncratic,” Chantico Global CEO Gina Sanchez said on CNBC. ""It’s a really mixed bag, but there’s an expectation that these semis will recover in the second half or, if you listen to Texas Instruments, the first half of next year.""
Others are less constructive on the sector, arguing that consensus expectations for sales improvement in the second half of 2019 are overly bullish.
The firm's internal checks ""provided a more cautious view into any recovery given uncertainty in bookings in China and Europe, greater excess inventory than previously realized, and a return of semi pricing pressure,"" Longbow Research said.
The fundamentals tend to support the more somber view as several factors, including falling memory pricing, slowing purchases by cloud infrastructure customers and headwinds in China, have conspired to knock the earnings outlook for major chipmakers.
In April, chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) delivered a cautious outlook, warning that near-term sales would slide the most in 10 years as global smartphone markets continue to slow. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), in late April, slashed its revenue guidance, predicting its data-center segment, which provides the chips that power almost all computer servers, will post a revenue decline in 2019, its first drop in a decade.
With semi stocks seemingly punching above their weight, the quarters to come will determine whether cracks appearing in semis are merely dents, or the start of a structural decline that may see the rally go up in smoke.
2. Is the Fed Trimming Down on Inflation?
Investors will be very familiar with what financial journalists invariably describe as the Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation: core personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy.
But all things fall out of fashion. Is the Fed now ready for a new favorite way to gauge price pressures?
At his post-rate-decision press conference, Fed Chief Jerome Powell mentioned the trimmed mean PCE inflation rate a couple of times (hat tip MarketWatch’s Steve Goldstein).
The trimmed mean PCE was devised by the Dallas Fed as an alternative measure of core inflation.
To calculate, the Dallas Fed looks at the price changes for each component that makes up personal consumption expenditures, looks at what fell and rose the most, and trims out a fraction of the extremes at both ends.
“The trimmed mean inflation rate is a proxy for the true core PCE inflation rate,” according to the Fed. “The resulting inflation measure has been shown to outperform the more conventional ‘excluding food and energy’ measure as a gauge of core inflation.”
It’s yet to be called the TMPCE, but that’s only a matter of time.
A look at the latest report on trimmed mean PCE from the Dallas Fed for March will dismay those hoping that inflation is sluggish enough for a rate cut, at least compared to other measures.
Looking at one-month inflation, the trimmed mean came in at 1.9%, with the PCE at 2.4% and the core PCE at 0.6%.
Further out, for six-month inflation the trimmed mean is at 2%, right at the Fed’s target, ahead of the PCE at 1.1% and the core PCE at 1.4%. And for 12 months, the trimmed mean is at 2% again, ahead of the PCE at 1.5% and the core PCE at 1.6%.
3. The Fed and the Plight of Prime-Age Men
As strong as Friday's jobs report was with its 3.6% unemployment rate, there is an area of concern, according to Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton, the big accounting firm.
That's the problem of men in prime working age -- 25 to 54 -- either forced to work part-time or getting laid off and dropping out of the work force altogether.
The number of men in that age range participating directly in the labor force range has fallen by about 500,000 since the turn of the century, she wrote on Friday.
""The reasons span a loss of male-dominated jobs, skills erosion, lack of training and investment, mass incarceration and, sadly, a sharp increase in opioid addiction,"" Swonk wrote.
You can see an example of the loss of male-dominated jobs in Lordstown, Ohio, where General Motors (NYSE:GM) shut down a plant that makes Chevrolet Cruze cars. The plant employed 4,500 just two years ago.
And, in fact, while the reported jobless rate is the lowest since 1969, a separate measure that takes into account all workers unemployed and people working part time for economic reasons stood at 7.3% in April for a third-straight month, according to the Labor Department. And that's still higher than the all-time low of 6.8% reached in November 2000.
Absent Congress and the White House actually agreeing on a plan, it falls to the Federal Reserve, Swonk says.
But the Fed has only an indirect tool, she conceded. That is to keep interest rates as low and steady as possible for as long as possible to pull these workers into the full-time work force."

The Church Commissioners for England (CCE), the endowment fund of the Church of England, as well as New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who manages the state's pension fund, also urged other shareholders to vote in favor of an independent chairman.
ExxonMobil's inadequate responses to climate change indicated its board was not functioning effectively due to the absence of an independent chairman, the two shareholders said in a filing.
Exxon Mobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for DiNapoli declined immediate comment on Friday.
The filing comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission said earlier in April that Exxon Mobil was not required to let investors vote on a shareholder submission calling on the company to set emissions targets beginning next year.
Exxon had called the resolution misleading, substantially implemented and an attempt to interfere with its management responsibilities.

The proposal, which would have asked the oil company to set emissions targets ""aligned with the greenhouse gas reduction goals established by the Paris climate agreement,"" was rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 10:46PM ET</span>",U.S. rejects Tesla bid for tariff exemption for Autopilot 'brain',"By David Shepardson and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials rejected Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's bid for relief from President Donald Trump's 25-percent tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot ""brain"" of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles, one of more than 1,000 product denials linked to China's industrial development plans.
According to documents filed by the U.S. Trade Representative's office (USTR) and reviewed by Reuters, exclusion requests from Tesla and others for Chinese-made products from aircraft parts to biotechnology instruments were denied because they were deemed ""strategically important"" to the ""Made in China 2025"" program. 
Tesla declined to comment.
The company has separate pending tariff exclusion requests for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen and for the Model 3 Car Computer before USTR.
Tesla said in a securities filing on Monday: ""Our costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from China.""
The denials illustrate a systematic approach by the Trump administration to thwart China's efforts to develop high-technology industries that Washington alleges benefited from theft and forced transfer of U.S. intellectual property.
Made in China 2025, a program aimed at growing China's prowess in 10 strategic industries dominated by the United States, is at the heart of trade negotiations and U.S. demands for sweeping changes to China's policies.
Those industries include new energy and autonomous vehicles, aerospace, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals, robotics and artificial intelligence. 
ECONOMIC HARM
Tesla first made its request to exclude its 3.0 Autopilot electronic control unit in July 2018, which it called the ""brain of the vehicle"" when the Palo Alto, California-based automaker warned that ""increased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.""
In a March 15 letter, USTR general counsel Stephen Vaughn said the agency was denying Tesla's request because it ""concerns a product strategically important or related to 'Made in China 2025 or other Chinese industrial programs."" USTR issued a separate letter also denying a request for the earlier 2.5 version of the Autopilot ECU.
It was not clear when the letter was posted on a U.S. government website. Other exclusion denials were posted at the same time, including for industrial robots imported by Kawasaki Robotics USA and composite panels made by Hexcel Corp in China for use in various Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co aircraft.
Some less high-tech products cited in the 2025 denials included a wiring harness for a rear door imported by Lear Corp's Chinese joint venture, Kyungshin-Lear Sales and Engineering LLC. 
""The material composition of the product consists of insulated wire, connectors, terminals, tape, and conduit,"" Kyungshin-Lear said in its request.
USTR has received China tariff exclusion requests for nearly 13,000 products and denied 5,311. Of the denials, 1,166, or more than a fifth, contained the same language as the Tesla request, citing links to Made in China 2025. 
NO U.S. SOURCES
Tesla told USTR it was unable to find a manufacturer in the United States, adding that ""choosing any other supplier would have delayed the (Model 3) program by 18 months with clean room setup, line validation, and staff training.""
Tesla says it reflashes the Autopilot ECU with the latest Firmware created in California when it is shipped from China by supplier Quanta Shanghai.
""For a product as safety critical to consumers, and critical to the essence of Tesla, we turned to industry experts who could achieve this quality and complexity in addition to the deadlines, which was not possible outside of China,"" Tesla wrote. ""When it comes to identifying a supplier, we cannot risk our customers' lives due to a defect from a supplier.""
The Autopilot ECU, also used in the Model S and X, includes two printed circuit board assemblies, which Tesla calls ""the brain responsible for Tesla's Autopilot functionality"" and the main safety system for the vehicle.
Tesla has a separate pending tariff exclusion request filed in December for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen.
Other exclusion requests also cited the lack of U.S. sources. Kawasaki said there are no industrial robots manufactured in the United States, and it only produces robots in China and Japan. 
In a previously unreported request, Tesla also asked USTR to waive tariffs on the 17-inch (43-cm) cockpit touchscreen control panel that displays navigation, media, audio, climate control, energy display, and all in-cabin controls.
Other automakers have sought similar exemptions but have not yet received answers.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in late July sought an exemption to a 25-percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility vehicle. The Envision accounted for nearly 15 percent of U.S. Buick sales last year.
GM has also sought exclusions for dozen of parts, including push button ignition switches and transmission bearings. 
Nissan Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have also filed exclusion requests for parts, while Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc asked for an exclusion for electric bikes rented through the Uber app.
Even if the United States and China reach a trade deal in the coming weeks to resolve their disputes, companies may not see tariff relief for months or possibly years. People familiar with the talks say that some tariffs, especially those aimed at the Made in China 2025 industries, could remain in place as part of an enforcement mechanism.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the manner in which tariffs were removed would be part of that mechanism, aimed at ensuring China lives up to its obligations in any agreement.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 10:04PM ET</span>",Disney to sell Fox regional sports networks to Sinclair for $9.6 billion,"(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co said on Friday it would sell its interests in 21 regional sports networks and Fox College Sports to Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc for $9.6 billion, a deal that clears the way for its purchase of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets.
The deal will help Sinclair, the largest U.S. broadcast station owner, add channels such as Fox Sports Detroit and Fox Sports Florida to its existing sports business that includes Marquee Sports Network and Ring of Honor Wrestling.
Shares of Sinclair, whose bid for Tribune Media Co collapsed last year following opposition from the Federal Communications Commission, were trading up 14.6 percent at $51.50 in after-hours trading.
Friday's deal excludes the New York Yankees team's regional sports network, Yes. 
Sinclair plans to make the acquisition through a newly formed indirect subsidiary called Diamond Sports Group LLC.
The company said Byron Allen, CEO of Entertainment Studios, will serve as an equity and content partner in a newly formed indirect wholly-owned unit of Sinclair and an indirect parent of Diamond.
Disney, which closed the acquisition of Fox's film and television assets in March, had agreed to sell the networks as part of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.
""The news could bring some closure to Disney's pending obligations regarding the consent decree, while the company continues to take steps to fortify ESPN amid a paradigm shift to direct-to-consumer offerings,"" CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi wrote after the Wall Street Journal first reported about the impending deal.
The assets are valued at $10.6 billion, including minority equity interests.
The regional sports networks portfolio delivered a combined $3.8 billion in revenue across 74 million subscribers in 2018, the companies said.
""The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to free cash flow and brings consolidated net leverage to 4.7x and 5.1x through the preferred financing,"" said Sinclair Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley. 
Diamond or Disney may end the deal if not completed by February 2020, according to a filing. 
Completion of the deal is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the U.S. DoJ. 
Guggenheim Securities LLC,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities Inc, RBC Capital Markets, Pursuit Advisors and Moelis & Co are Sinclair's financial advisers.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>",U.S. judge approves Fiat Chrysler diesel emissions settlement,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco on Friday approved a $307.5 million civil settlement for about 100,000 U.S. owners of Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles that the government said had illegal software that allowed them to emit excess emissions.
Under the settlement approved by Judge Edward Chen, about 100,000 owners and lessees of Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee 3.0-liter diesel vehicles from model years 2014 to 2016 will receive payments for having a software reflash completed. Most owners will receive $3,075 payments.
Current owners and lease-holders have until February 2021 to submit a claim, and until May 2021 to complete the repair and receive compensation, while former owners have until August to submit a claim.
The Italian-American automaker on Jan. 10 announced it had
settled with the U.S. Justice Department, the state of California and diesel owners over civil claims that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests. A criminal investigation is ongoing.
Chen also approved the consent decrees announced in January between Fiat Chrysler and California, Environmental Protection Agency and agreements with all 50 states.
Under the agreement, Fiat Chrysler agreed to apprise an independent auditor of the status of various initiatives. Fiat Chrysler said on Friday it has launched three-quarters of the initiatives and one-third are already complete.
Fiat Chrysler estimated the total value of the various settlements at about $800 million.
Robert Bosch GmbH, which provided emissions control software for the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, agreed to pay $27.5 million to resolve claims from diesel owners, while Fiat Chrysler is paying $280 million of the $307.5 million.
Fiat Chrysler is also paying $311 million in total civil penalties to U.S. and California regulators, granting extended warranties worth $105 million. Fiat Chrysler is also paying $72.5 million for state civil penalties and $33.5 million to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims.
Fiat Chrysler and Bosch also agreed to pay $66 million to the lawyers representing the vehicle owners.
The hefty penalty was the latest fallout from the U.S. government's stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules.
Regulators said Fiat Chrysler used ""defeat devices"" to cheat emissions tests in real-world driving. Fiat Chrysler did not admit liability.

U.S. regulators are also reviewing Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's emissions certification process and emissions questions about some  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) vehicles.

The matter will now be decided by the judge overseeing PG&E's bankruptcy ""in the coming weeks,"" according to the documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday. 
At issue is whether the bankruptcy court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over the power purchase contracts, which are worth up to $42 billion. 
San Francisco-based PG&E wants the matter resolved in bankruptcy court, while NextEra and others want FERC involved. FERC has said it has ""concurrent jurisdiction"" with the bankruptcy court in such matters. 
The contracts have emerged as one of the most contentious issues in PG&E's bankruptcy, which the company launched in January in the face of tens of billions of dollars in potential liability stemming from wildfires in California in recent years that may be traced to its equipment. 
The question of what will happen to the power contracts is critical for California’s goal to source 60% of its power from sources of renewable energy by 2030. Most of the power contracts in question are for solar or wind resources to fulfill the state mandate.
""PG&E recognizes its important role in supporting the state's commitment to clean energy initiatives and remains committed to continuing to help California achieve its bold clean energy goals,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
""We appreciate the concerns from stakeholders across the state concerning the impact that Chapter 11 filing could have on the state's clean energy progress. PG&E has made no decisions as to whether to assume or reject contracts as part of filing for Chapter 11.""

Officials from NextEra were not immediately available for comment.Last month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali urged the companies and PG&E to try to reach an agreement by a May 3 deadline. In the court papers made public on Friday, they said they were unable to reach an agreement.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 09:45PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico announces deal to restructure power authority debt,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power utility struck a deal with a group of creditors that seeks to allow the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth to restructure more than $8 billion of bonds, according to an announcement by government authorities on Friday.
A group of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bondholders, bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, along with the island's government and federally created financial oversight board, reached a restructuring support agreement that would reduce the utility’s debt by up to 32.5 percent.
The move paves the way for a plan of adjustment for PREPA, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in July 2017 after a previous restructuring deal fell apart. The latest agreement, which requires support from at least 67 percent of voting bondholders to materialize, would shed about $3 billion in debt service payments over the next decade. 
The deal also requires the approval of a U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy cases, as well as legislative action.
Under the agreement, investors will exchange their PREPA bonds at 67.5 cents on the dollar for new Tranche A bonds and 10 cents on the dollar for new Tranche B bonds. The latter would be contingent on full payment of Tranche A bonds and future electricity demand on the island.
PREPA will pay off the new bonds through a special charge levied on its customers. The new charge starts at approximately 1 cent per kilowatt hour prior to the deal's closing, increasing to some 2.768 cents per kilowatt hour upon closing and gradually increasing to approximately 4.552 cents per kilowatt hour during the expected 40-year lifespan of the bonds.
The deal still lacks the support of other PREPA creditors, most notably bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. A spokesman for National declined to comment.
National Public Finance filed an objection last month when a deal in principle was announced, saying that ""until very recently"" it was excluded from negotiations even though it is PREPA's largest creditor. National has also asked the court to appoint a receiver for PREPA, support among other creditor remains unclear following Friday's announcement.
According to government and board officials, the privatization of PREPA is under way, with transmission and distribution contracts with private companies expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2020.
""Now with this agreement we take a monumental step to provide for the restructuring of the debts and obligations of PREPA and finally conclude the bankruptcy process,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement.
If approved in federal court, PREPA's restructuring would mark the third major deal in Puerto Rico's efforts to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Deals involving the island's sales tax-backed bonds and Government Development Bank have been approved by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain.
PREPA's financial and operational problems were compounded by Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island in September 2017, decimating an electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 06:59PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers urge Trump administration to not end India's trade privileges,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty-four U.S. members of Congress sent a letter on Friday to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, urging him not to end a vital trade concession for India, a day before the Trump administration is likely to announce a decision on it.
Ending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which allows preferential duty-free imports of up to $5.6 billion from the South Asian nation, would impose ""hundreds of millions of dollars annually in new taxes"" on American companies, the lawmakers said in a bipartisan letter led by Democratic Representative Jim Himes from Connecticut.
""In the past, even temporary lapses in such benefits have caused companies to lay off workers, cut salaries and benefits, and delay or cancel job-creating investments in the United States,"" the letter says. They urged the administration to continue negotiating a deal with India that would protect American jobs. 
A decision to scrap the trade privilege comes as President Donald Trump has vowed to cut the U.S. trade deficit and repeatedly called out India for high tariffs. 
India is the world's largest beneficiary of GSP, which dates from the 1970s, and ending its participation would not only be the strongest punitive action against the country since Trump took office, but would also open a new front in the global trade war. 
The elimination of GSP is likely to bring retaliatory tariffs from New Delhi, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Last June, India said it would step up import duties varying from 20 percent to 120 percent on a slew of U.S. farm, steel and iron products, angered by Washington's refusal to exempt it from new steel and aluminum tariffs. But it has since repeatedly delayed adopting the higher duties - a move that could be implemented if GSP is withdrawn, the source added. 
India is hoping the decision to end the trade privilege is delayed and the Trump administration is open to further negotiations, the source said. 
In April, Republican Senator John Cornyn and Democratic Senator Mark Warner, co-chairs of the Senate India caucus, urged Lighthizer to delay adopting the plan. 
India sent a trade package listing the concessions it was willing to make to the USTR in late February but hasn't heard from them, the source said. 
""They are usually very responsive so it is highly unusual for them to not respond to the trade package that was sent,"" the source said. 
The decision to drop GSP is also ill-timed as it comes in the middle of elections in India, hampering the country's ability to negotiate further, the source added. 
Despite close political ties between the two countries, trade between India and the United States, which stood at $126 billion in 2017, is widely seen to be performing at nearly a quarter of its potential. 

Trade relations suffered in the past few months after India adopted new rules on e-commerce, reining in how U.S. companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc can do business in the country.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 06:55PM ET</span>",Exxon Mobil sues Cuba for $280 million over expropriated property,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Friday sued Cuba's state-owned Cuba-Petroleo and CIMEX Corp in U.S. federal court seeking $280 million over a refinery, gasoline stations and other assets seized after Fidel Castro’s revolution.
Exxon, the largest U.S. oil producer, is the first corporation to sue Cuba since the Trump administration allowed a long dormant section of the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, known as the Helms-Burton Act after its sponsors, to take effect on May 2.
The Trump administration has been ratcheting up pressure on Venezuela and Cuba. Previous presidents had waived the provision of the act that allows anyone whose property was nationalized after the 1959 Cuban Revolution to sue any individual or company profiting from their former holdings.
On Thursday two Cuban-Americans sued cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp for using Cuban ports nationalized from the family members who owned them.
Exxon Mobil accuses the Cuban defendants of ""unlawful trafficking in Plaintiff’s confiscated property in violation of Title III of the ... Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996,"" according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The Standard Oil refinery at Havana Bay, now operated by CUPET, was the first U.S. property taken over by Castro and his bearded revolutionaries after the company refused to process oil from the Soviet Union as tensions mounted with the United States.
CIMEX operates gasoline stations in Cuba with CUPET.
Standard Oil was broken up into several companies, one of which was Exxon, which merged with Mobil in a 1998 deal.
In the 1960s the United States certified 5,913 claims against Cuba valued at $1.9 billion of which Standard Oil and Mobil each have a claim valued at a combined $245 million, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a New York-based organization whose expertise includes U.S. claims.
""This filing is significant. This is the fifth-largest company in the world using Title III of the Libertad Act to sue a company owned by the government of Cuba,"" said John Kavulich, president of the council.
""This provides comfort for other large claimants to sue, will increase fear by companies in other countries from engagement with Cuba due to the reach of Exxon Mobil and is consistent with Exxon Mobil efforts to recover assets in Venezuela and defend themselves in other countries,"" he said.
Under a Cuban law passed in 1996 in response to the Helms-Burton Act, certified claimants who take advantage of the act will be disqualified from future settlements.
CUPET and CIMEX were not immediately available for comment.
An Exxon Mobil spokesman confirmed the suit is seeking to recover $280 million from expropriated assets.
Cuba charges Title III violates international law because its nationalization of property was legal and also because Cuban-Americans were not U.S. citizens when their properties were taken.
All other nations settled their citizens' property claims decades ago. Certified U.S. claims by American citizens at the time of expropriation were never settled.
Canada, the European Union and other countries charge the United States has no jurisdiction over their citizens' activity in Cuba and they will take the issue to the World Trade Organization, among other actions.
International opposition, and the fear that thousands of suits brought by Cuban-Americans would clog U.S. courts, led previous U.S. presidents to waive implementation of Title III.

Title I and II of the Helms-Burton Act codify all previous sanctions into law and set conditions for the U.S. Congress to lift them. Title IV bans executives and their families from the United States if they profit from expropriated properties.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.75%, the S&P 500 added 0.96%, coming within two tenths of a point of breaking its closing high, set on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq Composite, however, jumped 1.58% to a fresh all-time closing high, The Nasdaq 100 Index also ended with a new closing high.
The U.S. economy created 263,000 jobs in April, beating expectations for a 181,000 gain, according to estimates from Investing.com, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%. The unemployment was the lowest since December 1969, the Labor Department said.
But wage gains missed economist expectations and will likely keep a lid on the pace of inflation. In the wake of the weaker wage growth, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told CNBC on Friday said that she sees no need to adjust the central bank’s monetary policy.
Consumer discretionary stocks, led the rally in the broader market, thanks to 3% rise in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as investors seemingly took their cue from Warren Buffet, who reportedly said that one his managers at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) had been buying the stock. Amazon finished the week with a 0.61% gain.
Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) also fired up consumer discretionaries, surging more than 13% after delivering first-quarter results that beat estimates from Investing.com.
But  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) took some of gloss of the rally in consumers discretionary, falling 0.9%, after its mixed first-quarter results and lower-than-expected occupancy rate in its affiliated hotels prompted traders to dump the stock.
In industrials, U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) jumped more than 17% thanks to quarterly results that topped expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
In the wake of mixed quarterly results, some of the more bullish analysts on Wall Street have not shied away from raising their outlook on the broader market.
Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, raised his S&P 500 year-end target to 3,125 from 2,925. The upgrade reflects the first-quarter earnings “recession,” which has not been as bad as feared, Lee added. Lee's target is 6.1% above Friday's close and would mean a yearly gain of nearly 25%. The S&P 500 is up 17.5% so far this year.
Earnings aside, rising energy stocks also propped up the broader market, as U,S, oil prices rose sharply to end a torrid week, in which they fell 2.15.%.
In other company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock accelerated about 4.5% as the electric automaker ramped up the size of its latest sale of stock to 3.1 million shares from the 2.7 million shares previously expected to be sold in the offering, with CEO Elon Musk committing to buy an additional $15 million in shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Friday it expects to refund some servicing fees to customers who may have been confused about how to avoid monthly charges. 
The San Francisco-based bank said in a securities filing it was reviewing past disclosures to consumers about mininum debit card activity requirements to waive certain monthly fees. 
Roughly 90 percent of customers successfully avoid paying servicing fees on checking accounts by meeting certain requirements, said Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz.
Consumers can get waivers for the monthly fee by connecting a qualifying direct deposit or keeping the a minimum daily balance among other things. 
The bank has made changes to address guidelines for how to get a waiver through debit card use that had the potential to be confusing.
""We have made improvements in how we communicate all of the ways customers qualify for a monthly service fee waiver, and how they can track their progress,"" Seitz said. ""It’s the right thing to do for our customers.""
The disclosure adds to the long list of remediation efforts going on at the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets after a string of admissions that it may have improperly charged customers for various financial products. 
The bank became mired in scandal in 2016 when it revealed it had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Since then, issues have cropped up in each of Wells Fargo's primary business segments.
Wells Fargo has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has already paid out tens of millions of dollars to make consumers whole. 

In the same filing the company also raised the high end of potential losses in excess of the company's accrual to $3.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion at the end of last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad-based rally on Friday as stronger-than-expected job growth in April coupled with muted wage gains left investors upbeat about the outlook for the economy and interest rates.
The Nasdaq registered a record high close, while the S&P 500 ended just shy of a record high finish. 
The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.6 percent, the lowest level since December 1969. Average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure.
The data supports the Federal Reserve's patient stance toward raising interest rates, which is a positive for stocks.
""We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there's less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don't see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""That could portend for better earnings in the future for companies.""
Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has bought shares of the internet retailing giant for the first time.
The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 197.16 points, or 0.75%, to 26,504.95, the S&P 500 gained 28.12 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.64, and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.22 points, or 1.58%, to 8,164.00.
For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% while the Dow slipped 0.2%.
With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
The upbeat reports have turned around the S&P 500 earnings estimate for the first quarter to a rise of almost 1% compared with the 2% decline projected at the start of April. 
Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 13.5% after the maker of Rubbermaid and other consumer goods exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing.
Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled 10.4% after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue, while Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) fell 4.8% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.85-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 30 new lows.

Odds that Latin America’s largest economy contracted in the first quarter increased after March industrial production fell by more than double analysts’ expectations.
Brazil’s output tumbled 1.3 percent in March, its worst reading in six months, the national statistics bureau reported Friday. In the 12 months through March, industrial production contracted for the first time since 2017.
The Brazilian economy has suffered with a disappointing recovery since emerging from a deep recession two years ago. Record-low interest rates haven’t provided the hoped-for boost to the industrial sector, which since 2017 hasn’t once posted back-to-back months of growth. With the government fiscally strapped, a wave of private-sector investment is needed to accelerate growth, but confidence has wavered since President Jair Bolsonaro assumed power. Exports to Argentina are also down as the neighboring country sinks into recession.

Brazil’s largest private-sector banks cut their estimates for the economy in the aftermath of the data. Itau now expects gross domestic product to contract 0.2 percent in the first quarter from the previous period, while Bradesco sees it shrinking 0.1 percent.
The March industry data “definitely increases the risk” GDP contracted in the first three months of the year, said Alberto Ramos, Goldman Sachs’ chief Latin America economist. Edward Glossop, Latin America economist at Capital Economics, added that the first-quarter data is “likely to be ugly” and it appears the economy may have posted a small contraction.
Swap rates fell across the board. Interest paid on the contract maturing in January 2020 dropped 4 basis points in afternoon trade, as the weak economy suggests no scope for inflationary pressures.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“The late Carnival (NYSE:CCL) was expected to drive some decline in industrial production versus year-ago levels -- but the plunge seen in the March reading goes beyond that. Prolonged industrial weakness despite the relatively weaker currency, record-low interest rates and subdued wage pressure is illustrative that the usual suspects are not sufficient to explain the low dynamism of the industrial sector.”--Adriana Dupita, Latin America economistClick here to read the research
The March plunge in industrial production was led by a 2 percent decline in output of consumer goods, particularly due to a drop in vehicles as Argentina imports fewer cars.
Stubborn, double-digit unemployment has also kept domestic demand low, hindering production, according to Flavio Serrano, chief economist at Haitong in Sao Paulo.
From the same month a year earlier, overall output fell 6.1 percent, the most since last May’s trucker strike ground the economy to a halt. The effect of the Brumadinho dam disaster in January continues to weigh on the mining sector, with output from extractive industries down 14 percent year-on-year, according to Andre Macedo, who coordinates the survey.

1233,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",BlackRock Is Winning at Making Less Money From Junk ETFs,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., the world’s largest issuer of exchange-traded funds, is winning a battle to attract investors with lower fees, even as success takes its toll.
The iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, ticker USHY, added a record $368 million Thursday, after discreetly slashing its fee in March. BlackRock’s move came after  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). lowered the price of one of its junk funds, and was followed by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s DWS Group two weeks later.
USHY is the only one of the three funds -- which now all charge $1.50 for every $1,000 invested -- to add more than $50 million since the fee cuts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Asset managers are reluctantly accepting lower revenue in exchange for market share as investors seek out the cheapest products. More expensive junk funds run by BlackRock and State Street lost money to withdrawals this week.
“This is being driven by the fee compression,” said Todd Rosenbluth, the director of ETF research at CFRA. “You get a snowball effect when there’s money moving into the newer high-yield bond ETFs. It can generate greater interest from other investors because they see the trades were executed in a favorable manner and ask ‘why can’t I do that too and pay less money?’”
State Street’s larger, pricier fund -- the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF, known as JNK -- saw almost 10 million shares worth about $356 million trade at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday; less than one minute later, USHY printed a large buy order.
Trading Down
Defections and cannibalization are growing risks for fund issuers. BlackRock steered into that trend in 2012 when it started a range of cheap “core” funds for buy-and-hold investors, while encouraging active traders to use more established (and liquid) funds that cost more. Some of those low-fee products are now surpassing their pricier siblings.
USHY still has a long way to go in that respect. The fund manages $1.2 billion, about 8 percent of the assets overseen by the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF. That fund, which is known as HYG and costs over three times more, saw $354 million pulled on Thursday.
“While we expect HYG will remain the vehicle of choice for professional traders and other investors, USHY is ushering in a new generation of bond ETFs that investors can also use in a variety of ways,” said Melissa Garville, a spokeswoman for BlackRock."

1235,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Don’t Cheer for the Health-Care Hiring Boom,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Of the 263,000 nonfarm payroll jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates were created in April, 27,000 were in health care.
This is not really news: Since the beginning of 2015, the average monthly gain in health-care jobs has been 28,959. Since 2010, it’s been 23,893; since 2000, it’s been 24,041; since 1990, it’s been 23,709. Only four of the 351 months since January 1990 have seen declines in health-care employment.
That kind of consistency is in itself somewhat newsworthy, though. Most industries don’t behave like that! Here’s the growth in health-care employment since 1990 compared with job growth in the rest of the economy:
During recessions, employment declines. But over the past three recessions, employment in the health-care sector kept on rising. One result is that, while health care’s share of nonfarm payroll employment has risen from 7.3 percent in January 1990 to 10.8 percent today, those gains have almost all come during and immediately after economic downturns.
The slight uptick over the past eight months in health care’s share — if you stretch things out to two decimal points, it has gone from 10.73 percent in August to 10.81 percent in April — is interesting. I certainly wouldn’t call it a recession signal, but it’s worth keeping an eye on.
The BLS health-care-sector numbers don’t include health insurers or government hospitals. Add them in (which I didn’t do in the above charts in part because there are no April data available for them yet), and health care accounts for 12.1 percent of payroll employment. But government hospital employment has grown only modestly since 1990, and while employment at health insurers has grown a spectacular 174 percent, it’s still a pretty small part of overall health-care employment.
The gains in health-care employment are great news if you want a job in health care. So is the fact that weekly earnings in the sector, which were lower than those for private employers overall in 1990, are now about 13 percent higher for non-supervisory workers, a premium that arose in the 2000s and has stayed about the same since 2009.
All this good news for health-care workers is not necessarily good news for the U.S. economy, though. Health care is a low-productivity-growth sector that, over time, has arguably been a drag on other U.S. industries. Plus, its share of employment can’t keep growing forever, right? A 27,000-job gain doesn’t mean as much when employment is at 16 million as when it’s at 8 million, so the percentage increases in health-care employment are smaller now than in the 1990s and 2000s. But they’ve still been higher in most recent months (not April, when the two were pretty much even) than the gains for total nonfarm payroll employment. The end of the health-care boom is not yet in sight.

1241,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",The Hidden Cost of Homework,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The latest academic kerfuffle involves a former economics professor at Arizona State University who claims he was fired for being a whistle-blower. One of his charges is that the school is profiting from the use of software that requires students to pay to gain access to course materials or turn in homework.
Although the school has appointed a retired judge to investigate the situation in response to student demands, Arizona State has denied the whole thing — and there does seem to be a good deal less to this story than meets the outrage. Still, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the ethics of the enterprise as the former professor, Brian Goegan, describes it.
Last month, Goegan sent his students an email “saying that the university required students to use MindTap, a program by Cengage that charges students money to turn in homework and gain access to course materials,” according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. The reason, he wrote, was to get Cengage to give the school “a large monetary grant.”(1)
There is no evidence of a grant, reports the Arizona Republic, which has been all over this story. And the school says it has not profited from its arrangement with Cengage, an educational software company. Nevertheless, the newspaper reports, the university and the company have “shared money from fees for some economics courses.”
This is a good place to make what may be an obvious point: Although we’re rarely forced to face the question so starkly, the business model on which higher education rests is that colleges make money off their students. Faculty members make significant human capital investments to become experts in their fields, and students pay to learn what the faculty knows. This is true whether the students pay their own way or borrow money.(2)
Similarly, students always pay a charge to “turn in homework and gain access to course materials.” Suppose a college provides to students an educational software product, such as Blackboard or Canvas, at no additional fee. This does not mean that the software is free, or that students are not “paying” to gain access to course materials online or turn in homework. It means simply that the cost of acquiring and maintaining the system is bundled into the tuition.
Thus, one way of looking at this story (assuming Goegan’s allegations to be true) is that Arizona State has simply unbundled a part of the cost of serving its students. In general, unbundling is good when the seller is providing multiple services, because it enables buyers to understand how much of their dollar goes to pay for each. For example, although travelers often get angry when an airline charges for a checked bag, the system has the advantage of allowing those who have only carry-ons to avoid subsidizing those traveling with more.
But this approach only makes sense if the buyer has a choice as to whether to purchase the unbundled service. Part of the concern is that students have no choice. The MindTap software is used in two courses required of economics majors.
Nevertheless, it’s hard to find the ethical problem. The software comes bundled with the online version of Gregory Mankiw’s introductory economics textbook, which the courses require. There’s nothing wrong with the school’s decision to assign this excellent and widely used volume. The controversy seems to have arisen from the decision by the economics department to test in these two courses the adaptive version of the software — the version that, for instance, is able to tell students what they are doing wrong in their problem sets. This version available only at an extra cost.
OK, that sounds bad in a headline. But I’m not sure how it differs from the common practice in which the required text is authored by the professor teaching the course. Over the years, any number of critics have argued that professors who assign their own texts have a conflict of interest and perhaps are behaving unethically.
To the best of my recollection, I’ve never required students to buy one of my books for a course.(3) In any event I agree with the American Association of University Professors, which in 2004 reminded faculty that their only interest when making assignments should be the education of the students, but added that “more often than not, the profits are trivial or nonexistent.”
More to the point, except in the case of required courses taught in an assigned section, there is generally complete transparency. Students know which books are being assigned, and if they believe the professor has a conflict, they are free to choose a different class or a different instructor.
This point matters because, when faced with an ethical question, disclosure is generally a wiser course than regulation. If news reports are right, disclosure is where Arizona State erred. The whole contretemps might have been avoided had the university simply informed students that a portion of the fee they were paying for the software package supported its implementation at the school. Such an approach might even have muted some of the usual student grumbling about the costs of course materials.
In short, if the school bumbled, it was not in its decision to require the software, but in its failure to make details of its contractual arrangement public. It’s always unfortunate when so small an error serves as potential springboard for a scandal-seeking investigation.(4) The cautionary tale, not only for colleges and universities but for other institutions too, is obvious.
(1) For an easily readable text of the email, as well as other relevant links, see thisblog post from Paul Caron, dean of the Pepperdine University Law School.
(2) Yes, institutions of higher learning raise a part of their operating budgets from endowment income, but outside the fifty or so wealthiest schools, this income is not very large. Even including those schools, 2018 endowment income constituted less than 10 percent of the budget of the average university. State colleges and universities receive a direct subsidies from public funds, but the basic model remains the same.
(3) I have occasionally assigned chapters of my books, but as far as I recall, students have always received these as part of sets of duplicated materials for which they might pay a fee but from which I receive nothing.
(4) Goegan makes another allegation that, if true, is outrageous: that the school, as part of a larger test of the project, required him to flunk 30 percent of the students in his courses. There’s nothing wrong with a grading curve, even a steep one, but if such a policy was implemented for any reason other than pursuit of the educational mission, it would be just as wrong as it could be. (There would be notice problems too.)

1242,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Icahn discloses U.S. probe into sale of Manitowoc shares: filing,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked billionaire investor Carl Icahn's company for information about trades in crane maker Manitowoc, Icahn Enterprises disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday, in its first acknowledgement of such a probe.
Icahn Enterprises said it received a subpoena after critics questioned the timing of Manitowoc stock sales Icahn, who briefly served as an unpaid adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, made before his administration announced steep steel tariffs in March 2018. Questions had swirled about whether the sales were prompted by inside information about Trump's plans.
The stocks of many U.S. industrial companies, major consumers of steel, fell that day after the announcement, with Manitowoc losing more than 6%.
Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York contacted Icahn Enterprises in June 2018, the company said in the filing. ""We cooperated with the request and provided documents in response to the subpoena.""
The U.S. Attorney's office and Icahn's office had no immediate comment. Manitowoc did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors in Manhattan have a history of pursuing major cases over insider trading on Wall Street, famously securing the trial conviction of hedge manager Raj Rajaratnam and a guilty plea from the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors.
Icahn sold roughly one-third of his stake in Manitowoc, which uses steel to make its equipment, between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, 2018. Trump said on March 1 that he would impose 15% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminum to make domestic production more attractive.
In response to news reports about his stock sales, Icahn said he cut his position in Manitowoc for ""legitimate investment reasons"" and dismissed any speculation that his sale of shares was prompted by knowledge about Trump's plans.
Icahn, who has been friendly with Trump for decades, has been a sounding board for Trump and was instrumental in vetting people for key positions before Trump was inaugurated in 2017.

He stepped down as an unpaid special adviser to Trump in August 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Heavily indebted British travel company Thomas Cook said on Friday it was in talks with its lenders about bolstering its finances, following recent media speculation about the firm's ability to pay its debts.
The firm, which put its profitable airline business up for sale in February, has endured a tumultuous few days on markets, with its shares closing down 15 percent on Thursday.
""We have (...) taken the proactive step to approach our financing partners and are engaged in constructive discussions to ensure we have the flexibility and resources to continue investing behind our plans over the long-term,"" chief executive Peter Fankhauser said.
Thomas Cook declined to comment on a Bloomberg report on Thursday that three of its lenders accepted steep losses to exit a loan facility to the company.
Sky News reported on Friday it was in advanced talks for about 400 million pounds of new loans.
The world's oldest travel company struggled in 2018 when a heatwave in northern Europe deterred holiday makers, leading to two major profit warnings.
The company said its liquidity position was strengthening heading into this year's key summer period but it was acting proactively to ensure it had financial flexibility to maintain an ""appropriate liquidity buffer through the (2019/2020) winter"".
Thomas Cook shares were down 0.8 percent on Friday.
The yield on Thomas Cook euro-denominated bonds that mature in 2022 hit a record high of 29.896 percent earlier on Friday, while the bond's price fell to a record low of 57.701 cents. The bond's price ticked up from those lows in afternoon trade.
The cost of insuring debt issued by Thomas Cook against default also climbed on Friday. 
The company's five-year credit default swap, reflecting the cost of protecting against a default on its debt, jumped 349 basis points from Thursday's close to 2199 basis points, IHS Markit data showed. 
The CDS price implied a 78 percent probability of default, according to the data provider.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Thomas Cook has set a deadline of May 7 for expressions of interest in its airline business. Indigo Partners and Lufthansa are seen as likely bidders, sources said.

The fund was set up in 2017 and has become the world's largest technology investment fund. Its investments include ride-hailing pioneer Uber (NYSE:UBER), chip designer ARM and shared workspace firm WeWork.
The company has publicly stated it plans to set up a second investment fund. The senior banking source said Softbank was now talking to banks about helping it raise money, confirming an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.
Softbank has spoken to half a dozen banks over the last month about a potential listing of the Vision Fund but has yet to start a formal process, the source said, adding he was not expecting such a process in the near term.
""They asked banks questions on how they could possibly do it. It is still very much in exploration mode,"" the source said, adding that Softbank had been possibly given the idea by fellow tech investor Naspers, which plans to list some of its assets.
""The big difference is that the biggest asset in the Naspers portfolio is Tencent, which is listed, whereas the portfolio of the Vision Fund is all private,"" the source said.
China's Tencent Holdings Ltd is a social media and gaming company listed in Hong Kong.
A spokesman for Softbank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
SoftBank is also in talks with Oman for an investment in the fund, which has raised nearly all of its funding so far from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, according to the WSJ report.
Oman was not immediately available for a comment when contacted by Reuters, nor was there an immediate response from the Japanese conglomerate. 
SoftBank is seeking to raise new funds for ""informal deals"" chief executive officer Masayoshi Son negotiated in China for Vision Fund, one of the people told WSJ.

The fund is also planning to double its staff over the next 18 months to keep up with the pace of deal making by SoftBank, the company's top deputies reportedly said at a conference in Los Angeles this week.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 10:51AM ET</span>","Tesla boosts capital raise to $2.7 billion, Musk buys more stock","By Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Friday was set to raise up to $2.7 billion in a record-setting capital raising for the electric carmaker, as investors scooped up a mix of new stock and convertible notes that will recharge the company's cash-depleted balance sheet.
The company said in a filing that it had increased its offer to 3.1 million shares, rising to 3.5 million including a tranche for underwriting banks, from an initially planned 2.7 million, priced at $243 per share.
The filing also showed it would place convertible debt worth $1.6 billion, up from an initial planned $1.35 billion. That all pointed to buoyant interest in the offering and shares in the company rose 2.5 percent in morning trading. 
The coupon for the debt offering, however, was set at 2.0 percent - the top of the indicated range - suggesting the company had ceded ground to investors to borrow so much. 
The conversion premium at which the bonds can be exchanged for stock in the future, was also at the bottom of the initial range given by the company - another concession. 
""Seeing the offering amount raised does not surprise me at all,"" Clement Thibault, senior analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com. 
""As far as Tesla is concerned, the more money in the bank, the better.""
Tesla's launch of a capital raise was greeted with relief by Wall Street on Thursday after a tumultuous year which has seen analysts and investors cast doubt on its ability to produce, sell and deliver enough cars to make a sustainable profit.
The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.
Many analysts had calculated that without new cash Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter and has seen demand for its cars soften - would not be able to carry out its plans.
The company said that after all costs had been deducted it could now get up to $2.7 billion in new capital from the offer. That compared to the $2.2 billion in cash reserves the company held at the end of March. 
BUY IN
Billionaire Musk, whose fortune centers around a 20 percent stake in the $42-billion company, also doubled his initial commitment for buying shares and will now buy stock worth up to $25 million, the company said.
""The fact that Musk could increase its share from $10 million to $25 million is in line with the usual marketing scheme,"" said Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope. ""Musk always tries to surprise with promises that are often not kept."" 
Including the option for underwriters to buy 15 percent in each offering, Tesla will sell about $860 million in new shares and $1.84 billion in debt.
Tesla had said on Thursday it would raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital through shares and debt. That included an offering of 2.7 billion shares worth around $650 million and $1.35 billion in debt, before issues to underwriters.

Tesla’s junk and convertible bonds opened roughly unchanged from Thursday’s close, with the bonds of its SolarCity unit higher, according to Refinitiv data. The $1.8 billion junk bond maturing in 2025 < 88160RAE1=>, which rose 1.8% Thursday to a high of 87 cents on the dollar, was last at 86.5 cents.

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - The chief executive of Brooks Running, part of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, said his company will shed much of its presence in China by moving running shoe production to Vietnam, a result of the trade dispute between China and the United States.
Jim Weber, who has run Brooks since 2001, said in an interview that Brooks made the decision in January, when U.S. President Donald Trump was threatening to boost tariffs on the shoes to 45 percent from 20 percent.
Weber said the tariff threat weighed ""massively"" because Brooks cannot simply raise prices on its shoes, which typically retail for $100 to $160 a pair, and though trade tensions have cooled, the company could not wait for a resolution.
""We're going to pull most of our production out of China,"" he said. ""We've had to make a long-term decision on this picture. It's disruptive, but the reality. So we'll be predominantly in Vietnam by the end of the year.""
About 8,000 jobs will also move to Vietnam from China, Weber added.
Vietnam is emerging as a preferred destination for companies looking to move production because of tariff concerns.
The country generates about 55 percent of Brooks' running shoe production, with China accounting for the remainder.
Brooks shoes are sold in 56 countries, and account for the bulk of the Seattle-based company's annual revenue, which grew 26 percent last year to $644 million.
Revenue from January to April is up 22 percent in 2019, and Weber is targeting full-year revenue of just under $750 million. He hopes revenue will reach $1 billion by 2021. Brooks also sells apparel.
Weber said Brooks may start shoe production in a third, yet-to-be-determined country next year. The eventual breakdown could be 65 percent from Vietnam, 10 percent from China and 25 percent from the third country, he said.
Brooks plans to continue research and development, as well as small production runs of shoes, in China.
Weber also said Brooks hoped to ""prototype small, custom personalized shoe runs"" in the United States within the next several years, but much of the company's technical know-how and automation is in Asia. ""Volume is a long ways away,"" he said.
Brooks became part of Berkshire in 2006 when Berkshire's Fruit of the Loom unit bought its parent at the time, Russell Corp. Berkshire spun out Brooks as a standalone unit in 2012.
Weber began reporting last year to Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, after previously reporting to Buffett.

The professional services company blamed the shortfall on continued softness in business from “a few of our largest banking clients” and a slowdown in its health-care segment. Cognizant now sees full-year revenue up 3.6 percent to 5.1 percent, down from a prior view of 7 percent to 9 percent. Its adjusted earnings per share view was lowered to a range of $3.87 to $3.95, down from a February projection of “at least $4.40.”
Wall Street bulls were quick to throw in the towel as eight buy-rated analysts trimmed their ratings to neutral, including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which wrote that it was “still confused on what happened during the qtr so suddenly.” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cut its rating to underweight from neutral, saying “execution likely played a role” in the company’s first-quarter revenue miss as new Chief Executive Brian Humphries took the reins after the period ended.
With at least 33 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street, there could be more downgrades still to come for Cognizant. Ten would match the number of cuts Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB). received in March after a failed Alzheimer’s drug study cost the shares almost a third of their value. That was the biggest one-day reduction in sell-side projections for any S&P 500 company since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Cognizant sank 10 percent at 9:47 a.m. in New York, adding to a 7.7 percent decline late in Thursday’s session after the earnings report was released on the company’s website. The stock is trading at its lowest levels since late December.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",EU should take over supervision of bank money-laundering risks: ECB's Enria,"By Crispian Balmer
FLORENCE (Reuters) - The euro zone should favor mergers of banking groups in the bloc and take over the supervision of money-laundering risks from national authorities, the European Central Bank's top watchdog said on Friday.
Andrea Enria's remarks followed a series of money-laundering scandals at European banks which have exposed vulnerabilities in the bloc's ability to counter financial crime.
""If you want to be serious about this issue you need to have the courage to move these responsibilities to the European level and to strengthen these much more,"" Enria told a conference in Florence, Italy.
Under EU rules, money-laundering risks are mostly monitored by national authorities. The ECB is the euro zone's top supervisor of bank financial stability, which can be put at risk by exposure to financial crime.
""We have a single market, which means whenever criminal money enters the system, it is in the system, so you need to have a common protection of this system,"" Enria said.
Recent money-laundering cases at euro zone banks show that allegedly illegal transactions went through different countries of the bloc, making national checks less effective.
Faulty anti-money laundering procedures are also increasingly causing financial problems to banks, with investors fleeing lenders perceived as being at risk of exposure to financial crime.
Danske Bank, Denmark's largest lender, and Sweden's Swedbank have seen their shares drop after allegations of their involvement in a money-laundering scandal in the Baltic region. 
Danske Bank has admitted that 200 billion euros of suspicious transactions flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The EU banking watchdog, the European Banking Authority (EBA), found that Danish and Estonian supervisors had breached EU rules with lenient oversight of Danske Bank, a draft report shows.
""If you have a weak authority in the system ... then the whole single market is dented,"" said Enria, who chaired the EBA before starting his ECB job in November.
The limits of a mostly national supervision of financial crimes that are largely cross-border have long been criticized by the ECB and the EU parliament, but EU states keep defending their national competences.
In April, national supervisors rejected EBA's draft report over the breach of EU law in the Danske case.
Enria also insisted that the bloc should do more to favor banking mergers, especially between groups from different countries.
""We need to deploy policies to restore and improve the integration of our banking markets to favor consolidation and also, possibly, cross-border consolidation of banks,"" he said.

""You need to have European controls, European banks and European safety nets,"" he concluded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said Friday it is recalling 368,000 medium- and heavy-duty diesel trucks equipped with engine-block heaters for fire risks after 19 reports of fires.
The recall covers some 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 4500, 5500 and 6500 trucks, 2017-2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500 and 3500 trucks equipped with Duramax 6.6-liter diesel engines and an optional engine-block heater, including 324,000 U.S vehicles. The engine block heater cord or the terminals may short circuit and fail, GM said.
There are no reports of injuries, accidents or fatalities tied to the recall, GM spokesman Dan Flores said.
GM said the remedy for the issue was still under development, and told dealers on April 25 the company was working with the supplier ""to obtain the required parts as quickly as possible.""
GM's internal investigation began after a company engineer submitted a report in December to the company's ""Speak up for Safety"" program after inspecting an engine-block heater recovered from a warranty return.

GM stopped building trucks with the optional combination late last month.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 09:52AM ET</span>",FCA sees U.S. pickup trucks hauling profits in rest of 2019,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Nick Carey
MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) said on Friday that new U.S. pickup truck models would help the automaker achieve its 2019 profit targets and offset a weak performance in the first quarter.
That renewed forecast sent FCA's shares up 4 percent.
Nearly all - 98 percent - of the Italo-American automaker's first-quarter profit was powered by its Ram pickup truck. FCA's U.S. sales were down 3.1 percent in the quarter, but Ram sales were up more than 20 percent and outsold rival General Motor Co's Chevrolet Silverado.
""The whole quarter was powered by Ram (pickup trucks) while the rest of the company was lagging,"" said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Cox Automotive, adding that FCA spent heavily on consumer discounts to outsell the Silverado. 
""The question is whether the strong performance by Ram is going to be enough to give FCA a push moving forward,"" Krebs said.
Analysts and investors have worried about FCA's over-reliance on the U.S. market, given its loss-making operations in both Asia and Europe.
FCA expects new models such as the Jeep Gladiator pickup truck and all-new Ram heavy-duty trucks to help it meet full-year targets. 
Chief Executive Mike Manley told analysts on a conference call most of the profit improvement would come in the second half of 2019.
The automaker posted a higher profit for the quarter in Latin America and Manley said the region's strong performance should continue. He said FCA's European region, which lost money in the quarter, would return to a profit with margins of around 3 percent by the end of 2019.
The carmaker has pledged to spend 5 billion euros ($5.58 billion) on new models and engines in Italy over the next three years to better use factories, plus boost jobs and margins in Europe. 
Asked about potential partnerships, Manley said he expected the next two to three years to yield ""significant opportunities"" and FCA to play an ""active role"" in that environment. 
FCA has been at the center of renewed merger speculation in recent months. 
Chairman John Elkann - a scion of Italy's Agnelli family that is FCA's biggest shareholder - reiterated last month the family was prepared to take ""bold and creative decisions"" to help build a solid and attractive future for the carmaker.
FCA's North American margin fell to 6.5 percent from 7.4 percent a year earlier, below the first-quarter margins posted by Detroit rivals GM and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
The company's first-quarter operating profit fell 29 percent to 1.07 billion euros, below analyst expectations of 1.31 billion euros.
The operating profit at Maserati fell 87 percent, hurt by weakness in the Chinese market. CEO Manley said the performance of the luxury brand should improve in the second half of 2019.
FCA stuck to its full-year 2019 adjusted operating profit forecast of more than 6.7 billion euros. 
""The numbers are pretty weak, but what's good is that they confirmed their guidance, and this is giving support to FCA shares,"" a Milan based analyst told Reuters.
In late trade in Milan, FCA shares were 4.2 percent at 14.11 euros.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, made record returns on investment in the first quarter amid a surge in tech stocks. 
Separately, the fund is assessing whether to make an investment in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, which is planning an initial public offering, its chief executive told Reuters.
The fund earned 738 billion Norwegian crowns ($84.15 billion) for the January-March period, the highest amount it has ever recorded.
When measured in terms of the fund's international currency basket, the return for the quarter stood at 9.1 percent, beating its benchmark, it added. 
""The first quarter was an exceptionally good quarter,"" fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told reporters. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) made the most positive contribution to the return in the first quarter, the fund said in its quarterly report, followed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The investments that made the most negative contributions were pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), bank Swedbank and U.S. consumer services firm CVS Health (NYSE:CVS).
TECH UNICORNS
Overall, out of the 10 largest equity holdings in the fund, five of them are U.S. tech companies. The top three equity holdings are Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
The fund participated in the initial public offerings of tech firms  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Weimob in the first quarter, and in the present quarter it is examining the listings of two large companies, including that of Uber, Slyngstad said.
The fund has previously said it wished more companies, and particularly tech companies, had sought public listings, enabling the fund to invest in these fast-growing companies.
Slyngstad welcomed the recent wave of public listings by tech firms, but reiterated that they could be seeking listings at an earlier stage so the fund can capture the fruits of their growth.
""This development of these large unicorns coming to the exchanges is something we view positively,"" Slyngstad said in an interview on the sidelines of a news conference. 
""We are of course pleased that more companies have decided to go to the stock exchanges. We appreciate the transparency and the liquidity of the public markets.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were battling to avoid their first weekly fall in six weeks on Friday, as investors waited to see whether key U.S. jobs data would give the Federal Reserve another reason to dismiss rate cut calls.
Traders were pinning hopes on Wall Street regaining its record highs later in the session if MSCI's 47-country world index is to avoid ending its weekly winning streak. 
Europe was doing its bit too, with earnings from HSBC and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and a 7 percent leap to a record high for German sportswear maker Adidas' shares helping the region's main bourses move 0.2-0.8 percent higher. 
The dollar was also trying to end the week on a firmer note having seen markets scale back bets on a U.S. rate cut. As well as the jobs figures, there are no less than eight Federal Reserve policymakers due to speak on Friday. 
Bond and commodity markets remained largely on the backfoot, with most benchmark government debt yields up on the day and Brent oil slipping back towards $70 a barrel and its worst week in over two months. 
Fund manager UBP strategist Koon Chow said it all pointed to a little bit of the steam coming out of the markets after a flying start to the year.

The Aussie slipped below psychological support of $0.7000 overnight to its lowest since early January while the kiwi drifted closer to a recent five-month trough of $0.6581.
The weakness in the antipodean currencies also came as the U.S. dollar gained on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week that a recent weakness in inflation owed to ""transitory"" factors.
That led traders to start paring expectations for a Fed rate cut. Futures now imply about a 49 percent probability of an easing at year-end, down from 61 percent late on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Record-breaking rally leaving energy stocks behind,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market surge since the start of the year that has sent the benchmark S&P 500 index up to new record highs is leaving behind one sector that typically outperforms in an expanding economy: energy. 
A sharp rebound in the price of oil has not been enough to offset a long-standing reluctance on the part of investors to hold energy companies after prices collapsed in 2014. Energy companies in the S&P 500 are down 13% over the last year, while the broad index is up 10%. Over the last 5 years, energy companies have sunk 31%, while the S&P 500 as a whole is up nearly 60%.
Weak gasoline and petrochemical margins along with record U.S. crude production have weighed on refiners and integrated oil companies this year, yet fund managers and analysts say that energy stocks must also jump the high hurdle of negative investor sentiment before they can catch up to or even lead the broad market higher. 
""There's still an overhang from investors feeling like they have been burned in this cycle before,"" said Trip Rodgers, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy  BP  (LON:BP) Energy fund. ""There's only so many times you can get caught off-guard before you start to feel skeptical that higher prices are here to stay."" 
That sense of trepidation on the part of investors has helped extend the disconnect between the price of oil and the performance of energy stocks, he said. 
Oil prices are up by more than 35% since the start of the year, due in part to higher-than-expected global demand, production cuts from OPEC and the effect of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. Economists expect the price of both Brent crude and U.S. light crude to stay above $60 for the rest of this year, according to the latest Reuters poll. 
Yet energy companies continue to lag the broader market, with the S&P 500 energy sector down 3.6% since the start of the quarter. The S&P 500 is up nearly 3% over the same time, and notched a new record high on Wednesday. 
Investors will need to see consistent oil prices above $60 a barrel and more ""capital discipline"" on the part of energy companies before they start to move back into the sector, Rogers said. As a result, he has been focusing on companies that are improving their balance sheets and keeping their costs low despite the gain in the commodity price, he said. Energy Transfer LP, Diamondback Energy Inc, and Parsley Energy Inc are among his largest positions. 
Noah Barrett, an analyst who works on several funds at Janus Henderson Investors, said the outsized gap between the gain in oil prices and the muted performance of energy stocks may help fuel a ""catch-up trade"" later this year. Yet for that to happen, companies must prove to investors that they can keep a lid on spending, he said. 
""Particularly among the larger-cap companies, you're hearing this message of 'Trust us, we're focused on generating free cash flow and giving a portion of that back to shareholders instead of plowing it back into the field,'"" Barrett said. ""That's a good message but it's something they can only say for a quarter or two. Because of the history of this industry, this is something that will take multiple quarters, if not years, for investors to believe.""
Overall, institutional investors appear to be taking a slightly more bullish stance on energy stocks than retail investors. Global fund managers have a 3% overweight to the sector, well below the overweights of 10% or more that fund managers held through much of 2017 and 2018, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). 
The growth of alternative energy and the popularity of electronic vehicle makers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc are contributing some to the subdued performances of energy companies, said Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group. Yet those concerns will likely fade if oil prices can sustain these relatively high prices, proving to investors that they will not be once again fall victim to a false rally, he said. 

""Energy stocks are still pricing in a risk premium, even though energy prices are ramping up,"" he said.

After years of work and millions of pounds spent in preparation for the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, the delay to October and seemingly endless questions about the outcome are casting a cloud over bankers’ outlooks and taking the shine off the rise in shares this year. The sentiment was underlined on Friday when  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson warned that the uncertainty is plaguing consumer and business confidence.
“We continue to be cautious on the U.K., probably more than anywhere else given the array of Brexit outcomes that could drive some pretty different economic outcomes,” Stevenson said in a phone interview.
HSBC’s views were shared in recent days by the country’s most senior bankers.
Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc
The U.K. government-backed lender issued its strongest warning yet on the impact of Brexit, when it said April 26 that Britain’s slowing economy is likely to eat into income over the coming months. Shares in RBS, which is historically the country’s largest lender to small- and medium-sized businesses, tumbled on the news and analysts cautioned that the bank might miss its profit targets.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc
Jes Staley, the bank’s chief executive, emphasized that Brexit is a big drag on Barclays’s stock price and told analysts last month that the lender is positioning itself conservatively to withstand the uncertain U.K. outlook. The bank reduced its loan-to-deposit ratio and has increased its stock of high-quality liquid assets to prepare for any volatility in markets. The bank’s retail division missed analyst estimates in the first quarter.
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY)
Lloyds, the largest U.K. mortgage lender, is striking a more upbeat tone and is one of the few banks to not make a provision for a Brexit-related downturn in its business. Still, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio said that continued uncertainty over the U.K.’s withdrawal could further affect the economy.
 Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA
Banco Santander SA’s U.K. subsidiary, one of the largest personal finance lenders in the country, said Brexit is dragging down profits. Santander UK Plc’s profits before tax were down 35 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier and the bank warned of a slight deterioration in U.K. economic growth this year.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Barclays and RBS sounded notes of Brexit caution at 1Q earnings, ahead of the next U.K. rate decision and confirming some recent, bleak loan data.

Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann broke his silence on Mario Draghi’s initiative to rethink the institution’s negative interest-rate policy, joining colleagues in speaking out against the move.
The German, commenting on the European Central Bank president’s push to consider softening the effects of sub-zero borrowing costs, said so-called tiering to partially relieve banks from the impact may offer some advantages. That’s outweighed by the risk of sending the wrong message on when interest rates will rise, just as the outlook for growth and inflation shows improvement.
“The potential relief through interest-rate tiering, as it’s currently being discussed, would certainly be felt, but ultimately be negligible,” he said in Frankfurt on Friday. “It would probably be less significant than the additional burden from the shift in normalization expectations to which this debate has led.”

The remarks by Weidmann, the central bank chief of Europe’s biggest economy, are his first with an outright opinion on recent discussions to mitigate the effect of negative interest rates. He previously only stated that he “wouldn’t necessarily overestimate” the effect of a potential tiering measure.
Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau pushed for a rethink at the ECB’s March meeting. The discussion gained importance since the last Governing Council gathering in April, when Draghi said policy makers would assess the impact of negative rates.
Many analysts took the discussion to mean the ECB was preparing to keep borrowing costs lower for longer, or even implement further cuts, as the economic outlook has shown few signs of improvement since a slowdown began in the second half of last year. But policy makers have lacked enthusiasm on the matter and some doubted it will actually happen, people with knowledge of the discussions told Bloomberg last month.
On Friday, Weidmann also argued that although he doesn’t see overall signs of improvement in the German economy yet, strong consumption and labor-market trends bode well for an eventual pick-up. He warned against economic pessimism, arguing “important growth drivers are still intact.”"

Investing.com -- For a company supposedly exposed to global trends of slowing growth and squeezed incomes, Adidas (DE:ADSGN) is doing remarkably well.
The German sportswear company’s shares hit a new all-time high on Friday, rising over 7% after it reported a 17% rise in net profit in the three months to March, despite a drop in sales in its home market in Europe and a slowdown in North America due to supply chain bottlenecks.
Adidas’ net income came in 11% above forecasts at 632 million euros ($708 million), a rise of 4% from a year earlier when adjusted for currency swings.
And there’s better to come, according to CEO Kasper Rorsted.
Rorsted told CNBC that the company will aim to deliver sales growth of just under 10% in future, when it has overcome what he hopes will be ‘temporary’ supply chain issues.
“We’re in a situation where the demand is higher than the supply,” Rorsted said. ""We should have managed that better but still, a better situation to be in than the reverse where the supply is bigger than the demand.”

The lawsuit, filed on Friday at the Victoria Supreme Court by law firm Maurice Blackburn, was brought on behalf of about 6,000 drivers and taxi license owners from across four Australian states, the lawyers said in a statement.
""This will be a landmark case regarding the alleged illegal operations of Uber in Australia and the devastating impact that has had on the lives of hard-working and law-abiding citizens here,"" Andrew Watson, Maurice Blackburn national head of Class Actions, said in a statement.
An Uber spokeswoman said the company had not been served with a class action claim and denied it operated illegally.
""Uber denies this allegation and, if a claim is served making it, the claim will be vigorously defended,"" she said in an emailed statement.
""We will continue our commitment to delivering a great experience to Australians in all the cities where we operate.""
The damages being sought could be ""in the hundreds of millions of dollars"", but would be determined as part of the case or settlement negotiations, a Maurice Blackburn spokesman said.
Uber has proved popular with the Australian public, even in the face of resistance from the taxi industry and local authorities. 
The lawyers allege Uber knew its operations in Australia were illegal for a number of reasons, including that it ""adopted a policy to operate in any market where the regulator had tacitly approved doing so by failing to take direct enforcement action.""

1274,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",Investors Won’t Like a More Exciting Macquarie,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Whisper it, but Australia’s millionaires factory had until recently risked looking a bit boring.
Macquarie Group Ltd., the country’s largest investment bank, got the nickname in the go-go years before the 2008 financial crisis when returns ran freely and bonuses were rich. To survive the crisis, it remade itself into something akin to a bond fund. 
Its core units in infrastructure, asset finance and retail banking were branded “annuity-style” businesses in recognition of their steady but (mostly) unspectacular returns. Net income from its more volatile trading desk and investment bank -- the so-called “market-facing” businesses -- dwindled to bit less than a quarter of the total in its 2016 fiscal year. 
Annual results announced Friday show those less-loved divisions are roaring back. The Commodities and Global Markets trading business saw net income climb by two-thirds, to become Macquarie’s biggest profit contributor for the first time since 2011. The Macquarie Capital investment bank did even better, with net income nearly doubling to A$1.35 billion ($944 million) from A$716 million a year earlier.
The trend is both positive and negative. One argument for Macquarie’s annuity-market split has long been that the two sides are natural hedges against each other. When economic conditions improve and reduce returns from the interest rate-dependent annuity businesses, the transactional activity supporting the market businesses ought to heat up and balance out any weakness.
The evidence to date suggests this strategy is working: The A$1.25 billion improvement in net income from trading and investment banking was more than enough to offset the A$164 million drop from the annuity side.
At the same time, it’s early days yet. Earnings next year will be “slightly down,” Macquarie said, in contrast to analysts’ expectations of another year of growth; the shares fell 7 by percent, their worst performance in nearly three years, as a result. A big factor in the downbeat forecast was simply that the past year was an unusually good one for commodities, management said. A return to more normal conditions for such a major division will inevitably weigh upon future income.
In addition, there’s the question of what’s still hidden in the black box of the annuity businesses. As we’ve argued in the past, the potential risks to infrastructure from higher interest rates are profound: Funding costs risk rising faster than revenues and, if those conditions are seen as becoming the status quo, accountants may have to write down the value of long-term investments, stripping more money from the income statement.
There are already some glimpses of this from the core Macquarie Asset Management infrastructure business. Expenses last year rose by a third to A$1.33 billion, even as operating income crept up just 11 percent.
Ultimately the problem is that infrastructure -- the engine of Macquarie’s growth over the past decade, with returns on assets of 19 percent or so -- may not prove to be quite the annuity that it’s promised to be. A more volatile and robust global economy risks opening up cracks in a business model that’s been rock-solid over the past decade. There’s no guarantee that trading and investment banking will be sufficient to plaster over that weakness. 
Investors have liked the new look of Macquarie in recent years as its market-facing businesses have pumped out more profits and taken up a larger share of net income. In contrast to its retail-focused Big Four rivals in Australia, the bank’s price-book valuation has soared to its highest levels in a decade. But the flip side of rising profitability has been rising volatility, something investors are only just starting to appreciate.
If Macquarie wants to win back their affection, it should heed the lesson of its own restructuring. Investors like returns, but they like annuity-style stability even more. In finance, boring is beautiful.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 11:16PM ET</span>",Tesla ends 'Spartan diet' and seeks $2.3 billion to fund expansion,"By Akanksha Rana and Alexandria Sage
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital, renouncing what Elon Musk called a ""Spartan diet"" and easing Wall Street concerns about the money-losing company's ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines.
Tesla's plan to issue shares and convertible debt comes after the company repeatedly pushed back forecasts for turning a profit. The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.
Many analysts had calculated that Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter - would not be able to carry out its growth plans without new cash.
""The market seems to be breathing a sigh of relief. Now they need to get back to work, and start selling more cars,"" said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin.
Shares of Tesla rose 4.3 percent to close at $244.10, while the yield on Tesla's existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month.
""This is how they pay for the factory in China, the Model Y, their 2020 goals, said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. 
Raising $650 million in new shares and $1.35 billion in debt, while giving underwriters the option to buy an additional 15 percent of each offering, could potentially raise the proceeds to $2.3 billion. 
Tesla later priced its stock offering at $243 per share and also increased its size to 3.1 million shares from 2.7 million shares, Bloomberg reported after market hours on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
This stock offering price would be at a discount of 0.5 percent to the close on Thursday.
Tesla was not immediately available to comment on the report.
Chief Executive Officer Musk would also pitch in $10 million of his own money, Tesla said in a filing.
For over a year, Musk had insisted that the money-losing Silicon Valley automaker had no need for a capital raise, saying that high Model 3 volume and efficiency would push the company to profit in all quarters of 2019. That changed with a $702 million loss in the first quarter, and warnings that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.
Raising capital should not be a substitute for operating effectively, Musk said last month, suggesting that a capital raise could be near. ""It's healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while,"" he said.
Before Tesla's announcement on Thursday, however, analysts speculating about a capital raise had cautioned that the company had missed optimal timing - last year's third quarter, when the company posted a profit. 
Tesla has reported four profitable quarters since it went public in June 2010.
The company has made a series of moves to rework pricing strategies for its cars following the reduction of a $7,500 federal tax credit for Tesla buyers by half, a decline that hurt first-quarter deliveries. 
Musk also has been distracted by a public feud with U.S. regulators. Shares in the company have dropped 28% since the beginning of the year. 
LOWER COUPON 
Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash. In 2019, it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for 2020 and 2021.
Throughout its history, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, equity sales, convertible notes, a junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes.
Convertible bonds, which permit an issuer to repay creditors in new stock rather than cash if certain conditions are met, have been among Tesla's most preferred vehicles for raising capital. They typically allow a borrower to raise capital at a lower interest rate than an ordinary bond because the investor has the potential for a greater return should the conversion terms be met.
The convertible notes announced on Thursday are seen carrying a coupon rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal.
The convert is being marketed with a higher conversion premium than its last convertible bond, issued in March 2017, meaning Tesla shares will have to rise by an even larger magnitude to trigger a conversion to equity. 
Tesla's last convert was a $977.5-million security maturing in March 2022 that featured a 2.375% coupon with a 25% conversion premium to the stock's reference price of $262 per share at the time of the sale. That bond can be converted to equity at a price of $327.50 per share, which is currently around 36% above Tesla's current share price of around $240.
In March, Tesla had to repay a $920 million convertible in cash because the stock failed to reach the conversion price of around $360 per share. Only one of the convertibles it or its Solar City unit have issued has met the terms for conversion.
The yield on Tesla's existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month at just over 8 percent on Thursday after the news, roughly 2.7 percentage points above its 5.3% coupon.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) will manage the offering. BofA Merrill Lynch,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are the additional book-running managers.
Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) have $507 million in outstanding personal loans to Musk, with his Tesla shares put up as collateral, according to Thursday's prospectus. If Tesla's stock falls, the banks could force him to sell some of those shares. Tesla's previous prospectus in 2017 showed Musk had $624 million in personal loans from banks, backed by his shares. 

In a sign of Wall Street's concern about Tesla, Goldman Sachs recommended selling Tesla shares in an April 25 report, putting a 12-month price target of $200.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3% by 10:40 PM ET (02:40 GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 0.6%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was largely unchanged at 6,350. Macquarie Group slumped almost 6% after the company said profits would drop in 2019.
Trade volume remained thin in Asia as markets in Japan and China are closed for holidays.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee left its overnight funds rate in a range of 2.25% to 2.5% as expected.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell played down recent weakness in U.S. inflation, which retreated further from the Fed’s 2% target, as possibly “transitory.” Powell told reporters that the policy stance is “appropriate right now” and “we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.”
Powell’s comments sparked a sudden sell-off in the U.S., with the Dow closing more than 150 points lower on Thursday.
Market sentiment also took a hit this week after weak manufacturing data coming out from China and the U.S. signalled global growth remains fragile.
Looking ahead, investors’ focus will be on the U.S. non-farm payrolls and job data due later in the day.
“Payrolls tonight are expected (to) reveal still robust levels of payrolls growth (190K) but there’ll be more than one eye on what the report says about average earnings growth that’s expected to grow a meagre 0.1%,” David de Garis, a director and senior economist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note that was cited by CNBC.
Traders are also closely monitoring developments on the Sino-U.S. front. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will lead a 100-member delegation to Washington next week.
Citing people familiar with the discussion, Bloomberg said “difficult issues remain unresolved,” just one day after CNBC said a trade deal might be announced by next Friday."

Politico reported on Wednesday that Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) were negotiating a possible settlement that would require the company to create an independent privacy oversight committee and take other steps to safeguard users.
The FTC has been investigating revelations that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The probe has focused on whether the sharing of data and other disputes violated a 2011 agreement with the FTC to safeguard user privacy.
Facebook announced last week that it had set aside $3 billion to cover the settlement.
It was not immediately clear whether Instagram, another Facebook-owned service, would also be covered under the settlement, the Wall Street Journal report said.
Facebook and the FTC declined to comment.

1278,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 10:40PM ET</span>",Japan's Liquidity Woes Risk Limiting BOJ to Tinker on Sidelines,"(Bloomberg) -- Haruhiko Kuroda took charge at the Bank of Japan declaring an “incremental” approach to stoking inflation should be abandoned. Six years on and still a long way from his price goal, the governor has been forced to tinker with little-noticed funding programs in a bid to sustain his stimulus program.
The key challenge: negative side effects of Kuroda’s original initiative -- massive asset purchases -- are piling up. Traders continue to warn about depressed liquidity in Japanese government bonds (JGBs), while major institutional investors are pushed into riskier assets to an extent that’s stoked regulatory concerns.
While the focus of last week’s policy meeting was fresh wording on the time frame for maintaining ultra-low rates, the other tweaks showcase the BOJ’s dilemma: how to convince observers that it’s still pursuing its inflation target while limiting the damage.
“The fact that the BOJ had to rely on complicated measures like these indirectly show that it has limited tools left for easing,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). rates strategists Takafumi Yamawaki and Shumpei Kobayashi wrote in a note on the meeting.
The tweaks included:
Diminishing liquidity in the JGB market has been an increasing concern of the BOJ, thanks to the central bank having amassed more than 40 percent of the total outstanding. Officials began regular surveys of liquidity in 2015 -- which have been steadily enhanced -- and met with market participants to hear their complaints and suggestions.
The latest moves follow a trimming back in BOJ bond purchases and widening in the tolerance band around the 10-year yield target of around zero adopted in 2016. Yet without a rise in yields, the changes may not be sufficient to encourage domestic funds to return. Institutional investors such as insurers have instead gone abroad.
Another challenge is that the BOJ has committed to keep expanding Japan’s monetary base until inflation exceeds its 2 percent target (The most recent reading was 0.8 percent). And that growth rate has been coming down thanks to the reduced bond purchases.
That may help explain why policy makers extended until at least June 2021 two loan-support programs rolled out by Kuroda’s predecessor, Masaaki Shirakawa.
The adjustments mark a contrast from Kuroda’s QE, which was complemented by a negative short-term policy rate in 2016 and yield-curve control that same year. The governor in April 2013 said “it’s true that the price target won’t be easy, but we can’t meet it by incremental easing,” and reiterated his opposition to incremental moves in 2014 and 2016.
In its April 25 statement, the BOJ described the adjustments to its legacy programs as “contributing to the continuation of powerful monetary easing.”
Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). in Tokyo, had a rather more prosaic description: “a combination of new technical measures.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is considering a $1 billion investment at its Missouri assembly plant where it builds vans and trucks, state officials said on Thursday.
Missouri Governor Mike Parson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that GM, in a closed-door meeting, had outlined a plan to invest in the plant and add jobs. 
Parson told the newspaper that GM is seeking a package of state incentives that would need approval from the legislature before committing to the project to expand its Wentzville plant, which builds the midsize Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickup trucks, Chevrolet Express Cargo van and GMC Savana full-size van.
State Senator Bob Onder in a Twitter post praised the plan. ""I am excited that @GM is considering investing $1 billion dollars in our Wentzville Community! This would extend a decades long relationship between this great company and the great people of St. Charles County,"" he wrote
GM declined to confirm the investment, but said in a statement it appreciated ""the willingness of state officials in Missouri to work with us on potential opportunities within the state.""
There has been speculation GM may build a new mid-size body-on-frame SUV based off the Canyon and Colorado chassis. Automotive News reported in 2016 that industry officials believed GM was considering the plan to complete with Fiat Chrysler's Jeep brand.
GM has come under criticism in Washington after it announced in November plans to idle five North American plants and cut up to 15,000 jobs. Since then, GM has announced some new U.S. investments.
GM said in March it planned to invest $1.7 billion in its U.S. plants, adding 700 new jobs, including $300 million at its Orion assembly plant in suburban Detroit. It announced last week that it will add a second shift at its Bowling Green, Kentucky, assembly plant and add 400 jobs where it builds the Chevrolet Corvette.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 10:04PM ET</span>",Elon Musk owes $507 million to banks helping Tesla raise capital,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk personally owes $507 million to Wall Street banks involved in Tesla's stock and debt sale, backed by his stake in the electric car maker, a company filing showed on Thursday.
The lending was disclosed in Tesla's prospectus on Thursday to raise up to $2.3 billion with new shares and convertible debt, and it was $117 million less than the personal loans to Musk disclosed in Tesla's previous prospectus in 2017. 
Still, Tesla said that if the price of its stock falls and the banks force Musk to sell some of his shares, that could create additional pressure on the stock.
Tesla jumped over 4% after Tesla disclosed capital raising plans, which soothed investors' recent concerns about the Palo Alto, California company and pulled its stock up from two-year lows. 
Musk, who owns 20% of Tesla, has taken personal loans from Wall Street banks for years. A Tesla 2017 prospectus showed $624 million in loans to Musk.
The filing on Thursday showed Musk owed money to three banks working on the capital increase. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has $213 million in loans outstanding to Musk, while he owes Morgan Stanley $209 million, and another $85 million to Bank of America Corp . Goldman was not mentioned as a personal lender to Musk in the 2017 filing. 
Those loans are backed by Musk's shares in Tesla, currently worth a total of around $8 billion. If Tesla's stock declines, then Musk could be forced to sell some of those shares under terms of the loan, according to the Tesla filing.
Mark Williams (NYSE:WMB), a professor of finance at Boston University, said that investment banks can run into conflicts of interest with their deals with companies, their founders and CEOs, testing their rules to keep different businesses separate.
""This is particularly true in the case of Tesla where you have an aggressive and vocal CEO who is prone to pushing the legal limits and gain terms that might run counter to Goldman’s conflict of interest policies,"" Williams said.
Goldman and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), the top-line book runners in Thursday's capital raise, both have ""sell"" ratings on Tesla's stock, which is unusual but not exceptional on Wall Street.
At the end of 2018, Musk and his trust had 13.4 million Tesla shares pledged as collateral for personal debts, according to another filing. That is down from 13.8 million shares at the end of 2017.
Tesla,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs declined to talk about the loans. Tesla has a policy that caps executives' borrowings at a quarter of the value of the shares pledged as collateral.
With Tesla repeatedly pushing back forecasts for turning a profit, its stock has dropped 27% year to date.

Musk plans to buy another $10 million worth of shares as part of the sale announced on Thursday.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division asked a federal judge on Thursday to hold a hearing on any possible remedies to be imposed if mobile chip supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc is found liable in an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
The FTC took Qualcomm to trial in January and is awaiting a decision in federal court in California.
The Justice Department's filing asked Judge Lucy Koh of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California to hold a hearing on any possible remedies if she finds Qualcomm liable for antitrust violations and argued that ""a remedy should work as little injury as possible to other public policies,"" according to the filing.
The Justice Department said that any penalties Judge Koh might impose should not hamper the market for 5G, the next generation of mobile networks that are expected to be up to 100 times faster than current networks. The United States, China and Korea will roll out those networks this year and next, and Qualcomm makes so-called modem chips that allow smart phones and other devices to connect to those networks.
""(T)here is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,"" the Justice Department wrote. ""Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.""
Qualcomm and the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.
The FTC sued Qualcomm more than two years ago over allegations the company used anticompetitive patent licensing practices to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips.
The claims in the case mirrored similar antitrust claims made by iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The two sides settled during opening arguments at the trial between Apple and Qualcomm.
The FTC's case was filed in the final days of President Barack Obama's administration, with the lone Republican-appointed commissioner at the time formally dissenting against the action. Antitrust experts widely expected the case to be dismissed when President Donald Trump's appointees constituted a majority of the five-member commission.

But FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons recused himself from voting on the Qualcomm case because of prior work he had done for the chip supplier while in private practice. Antitrust experts believe that left the commission's Democratic and Republican appointees deadlocked at 2-2 on the matter, which prevented the Republican-appointed commissioners from voting to dismiss the case and allowed it to proceed to trial.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 09:58PM ET</span>","Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway, finally, has invested in Amazon.com: CNBC","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying, CNBC reported on Thursday.
Buffett said the purchase was made by one of his investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, and details would be disclosed later this month in Berkshire's quarterly report of its U.S. stock holdings.
The purchase marks a U-turn for Berkshire, where Buffett has long praised the leadership of Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.
""Yeah, I've been a fan, and I've been an idiot for not buying,"" Buffett told CNBC.
Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a similar request.
Shares of companies often rise when Berkshire reveals its support through new stakes, even when the purchases are believed or known to have been made by Combs or Weschler, who together invest about $26 billion.
The initial impetus of the portfolio managers has in the past heralded Buffett's eventual forays into some of their investments, often in big ways.
It was Combs who in 2012 began investing in industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Four years later, Berkshire completed its purchase of that company for $32 billion, in what remains Buffett's largest acquisition.
More recently, it was either Combs or Weschler who in 2016 began investing in iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
But it was Buffett who ramped up that stake into Berkshire's largest common stock investment, more than 255 million shares, now worth roughly $53 billion.
The Amazon purchase adds an additional bond between Buffett and Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to form a new venture, Haven, to reduce employee healthcare costs.
Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive.
In February, Buffett called acquisition prices ""sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects.""

Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will on Saturday answer shareholder questions at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which normally draws more than 40,000 people.

1284,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 09:40PM ET</span>",Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk described autonomous-driving technology as “transformative” to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. in a call aimed at ginning up interest in the electric-car maker’s debt and stock offering of about $2 billion, according to two people who dialed in.
The chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.
Ahead of the call, Tesla filed to raise at least $2 billion through debt and stock offerings, after a dismal first quarter depleted its cash balance to the lowest level in three years. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) hosted the call for investors at 11 a.m. New York time with Musk and Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s chief financial officer, the people said.
Tesla later increased the size of the stock offering, pricing 3.1 million shares at $243 each, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak about it. That’s a 0.5 percent discount to the latest close. The offering was increased from 2.7 million shares.
Tesla delivered just 63,000 cars in the first quarter but said in a letter to shareholders last week that it expects to deliver between 90,000 and 100,000 vehicles in the second quarter. Kirkhorn re-affirmed that forecast during the Thursday call, the people said.
Tesla shares climbed 4.3 percent, their biggest jump since Feb. 27, to close at $244.10. The stock has dropped 27 percent this year.

The networking giant, shrugging off a barrage of accusations that it aids Chinese espionage (which it’s repeatedly denied), grew shipments 50 percent from a year earlier, research firm IDC estimates. It was the only name in the top 4 that managed to expand volumes as the overall market slid for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Huawei’s been steadily gaining on Apple and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. with an increasingly high-end line-up of devices, particularly in its home market of China. The iPhone maker this week projected quarterly sales that topped analysts’ estimates, suggesting demand for iPhones has stabilized after a disappointing holiday period. Samsung also enjoyed a spike compared with the fourth quarter thanks to the launch of the marquee S10 range in February. IDC reckons Huawei should cling to the No. 2 spot over the rest of 2019.
“The overall smartphone market continues to be challenged in almost all areas, yet Huawei was able to grow shipments by 50 percent,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “This new ranking of Samsung, Huawei, and Apple is very likely what we’ll see when 2019 is all said and done.”

The deal, which would include sports channels in Los Angeles and Detroit, is expected to be announced as early as Friday, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Disney and Sinclair were not immediately available for comment.
Disney acquired the sports networks as part of its $71 billion acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets. 
The company agreed to sell the networks after the U.S. Justice Department said Disney, which owns cable sports network ESPN, must divest the Fox networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets.
Disney closed the acquisition of Fox's film and television assets in March, nearly a year after it won a bidding war against cable company Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) . 
The potential deal for Disney's sports networks would come after Tribune Media Co terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair last year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The founder of Insys Therapeutics Inc on Thursday became the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be convicted in a case tied to the U.S. opioid crisis, when he and four colleagues were found guilty of participating in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe an addictive painkiller.
A federal jury in Boston found John Kapoor, the drugmaker's former chairman, and his co-defendants guilty of racketeering conspiracy for engaging in a scheme that also misled insurers into paying for the drug.
Kapoor's 2017 arrest came on the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared the epidemic that has caused tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually a public health emergency.
Kapoor, 76, was found guilty of running a wide-ranging scheme to bribe doctors nationwide by retaining them to act as speakers at sham events at restaurants ostensibly meant to educate clinicians about its fentanyl spray, Subsys.
Prosecutors said Kapoor also directed efforts to defraud insurers who were reluctant to pay for Subsys. His co-defendants were former Insys executives and managers Michael Gurry, Richard Simon, Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan.
They face up to 20 years in prison. They denied wrongdoing, and defense lawyers signaled plans to appeal.
""Dr. Kapoor is disappointed in the verdict, as are we,"" Beth Wilkinson, Kapoor's lead attorney, said in a statement. ""Four weeks of jury deliberations confirm that this was far from an open-and-shut case."" 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Subsys in 2012 only for use in treating severe cancer pain. Yet prosecutors claimed doctors who took bribes often prescribed Subsys to patients without cancer, helping boost sales for Chandler, Arizona-based Insys.
Fentanyl is an especially potent opioid, 100 times stronger than morphine.
Kapoor's lawyers acknowledged Insys paid doctors but contended he believed they were being legally paid to discuss Subsys' benefits.
Wilkinson in her opening statement in January told jurors Kapoor had no knowledge of ""side deals"" being cut with doctors. She said a former executive turned government witness, Alec Burlakoff, kept Kapoor in the dark about them.
Burlakoff, Insys' ex-vice president of sales, and Michael Babich, its former chief executive, testified against Kapoor after pleading guilty to participating in the scheme.
Jurors during the trial watched a rap video Insys produced for its sales staff describing its strategies to boost sales that starred Burlakoff dressed as a dancing bottle of Subsys.
Witnesses also testified that Lee, an ex-stripper turned Insys regional sales director, gave a lap dance to a doctor at a Chicago club while pushing him to prescribe Subsys.

Insys in August said it had agreed to pay at least $150 million in a related settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. In a statement on Thursday, it said the case involved ""the actions of a select few former employees.""

1289,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>",Tesla seen finding ample appetite for its newest convertible bond,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc should find no shortage of demand for the $1.35 billion convertible bond the electric carmaker is selling even though the terms it is offering look inferior on paper to a similar deal two years ago, bond investors said Thursday.
And Tesla's volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why, they said.
Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low-yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash. 
In the new deal, being sold alongside $650 million in new shares, Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago, even though interest rates today are broadly higher. There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price. 
Investors, however, said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla's existing convertibles, which now feature even leaner yields and, because the stock has been so wobbly, an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years.
""With this new bond, you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off. They don't have to be successful, they don't have to hit a home run. They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years,"" said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management. 
The fundraising - which could top $2 billion in total - is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker, which has struggled to maintain profitability, and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla shares, which had fallen by nearly 10% in the two years since its last convertible was sold, ended more than 4% higher on Thursday.
The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday. 
While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2.375% coupon on the $977.5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022, it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1%, Dancey said. 
On its face, the conversion premium being touted, with a midpoint at 30%, also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond's lower conversion premium of 25%. But the underperformance of the stock, which closed at $244.10 on Thursday, means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34% rise in the stock to a price of$327.50 in order to trigger a conversion.
""The terms of the convertible look reasonable, and I don't think they'll have any issue selling,"" said Dancey, who may buy some of the new bonds. He does not have an existing position.
Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge, a common arbitrage used by hedge funds, said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. More than 25% of Tesla's public float of stock is sold short. 
""I haven't heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done,"" Pars said. Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel-making unit, Solar City, according to its most recent SEC filing. 
""With convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK,"" he said. 
Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki, known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the ""noise"" surrounding Tesla - including Chief Executive Elon Musk's recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets - had rattled some of his clients. 

""When we build a portfolio, Tesla will be a part of it. But what we'll probably be doing is adding more on the convertible side not on the equity side,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will keep one penny and two pence coins in circulation, finance minister Philip Hammond announced on Friday, a year after saying they were obsolete and usually hoarded in jam jars or even binned.
""Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services,"" Hammond said in a statement.
""But it's also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.""
The 50-pound note ($65), which a finance ministry consultation last year said is perceived as a tool for money laundering, will also stay in circulation.
The ministry faced a backlash after signaling that Britain's remaining copper cash would go the same way as the halfpenny coin that was scrapped in 1984, even though the ministry warned at the time this could stoke inflation.
""A firm wanting to charge 99p should still have the freedom to hand a penny change to a customer paying with a 1 pound coin,"" Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said earlier this week.
In its consultation last year, the finance ministry said six in ten 1p and 2p coins are only used in a transaction once before they are saved in a jar or thrown away, forcing Britain to mint 500 million replacements annually.
Cash has become a political issue after banks closed thousands of branches, hitting rural communities. The ministry estimates that 2.2 million people in Britain rely on cash because they don't have a bank account or for other reasons.
Debit cards overtook cash for the first time in 2017 as the most frequently used payment method in Britain.
Lawmakers have described the cash system as ""broken"" and consumer watchdog 'Which?' wants a new regulator to ensure that everyone has convenient access to cash.

Hammond said on Friday a new Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group was being created to provide ""comprehensive oversight"" of cash and ensure its availability ""for years to come"".

1291,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 06:55PM ET</span>","Curacao refinery, operated by PDVSA, receives exemption from Venezuela sanctions","(Reuters) - Curacao's state-owned Isla oil refinery, which is operated by Venezuelan state-run company PDVSA, has received an exemption from U.S. sanctions on PDVSA, the Caribbean island's government said in a statement on Thursday. 
The U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions on PDVSA in late January in a bid to force out socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a collapse in the OPEC member nation's economy. 
The license for the refinery, along with two other related companies, will allow the facility to continue to do business with U.S. companies through Jan. 15, 2020. 
The exemption comes as Curacao's government seeks a new partner to replace PDVSA as the operator of the 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery, possibly before PDVSA's contract to run the facility expires at the end of 2019. 
Isla has been mostly idled due to a lack of crude supplied by PDVSA, but some of its units restarted last month in an attempt to resume a portion of its crude processing capacity and produce finished fuel for the island.
""This exoneration is an important step toward keeping the refinery operative, and also to attract new partners for the refinery's future,"" the government's statement said. 

A neighboring Caribbean refinery operated by PDVSA's U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum in Aruba has also remained idled since a project to refurbish it has not been able to move forward amid sanctions blocking funds for the revamp.

OSLO/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Scandinavian airline SAS said late on Thursday it reached a deal with unions to end a week-long strike by pilots that has grounded 380,000 passengers.
SAS Chief Executive Rickard Gustafson said the airline and the unions agreed on a 3.5 percent salary increase in 2019 as part of the new three-year collective agreement.
He said flights would be resumed as soon as possible, but it would likely take up to 24 hours before operations were entirely up and running again. 
SAS had canceled more than 4,000 flights through Thursday since pilots went on strike on April 26 over wages and working conditions.
""I can with relief inform our customers and our staff that we now can put this conflict behind us. We have tonight signed a new collective agreement with our four pilot unions,"" Gustafson told a news conference. 
Close to bankruptcy in 2012, SAS sold assets and cut wages and thousands of jobs in return for a life-saving credit facility. It has been profitable in the last four years, but fuel costs are rising and overcapacity is still squeezing the sector.
Pilots had been seeking around a 13 percent pay hike, to make up for the 2012 wage cuts. SAS, which is part-owned by the Swedish and Danish governments, said that would entail significant cost increases that would seriously damage competitiveness.
""The agreements between SAS and the pilots’ unions concern predictability of scheduling, job security and salaries. In addition, the previously canceled agreements concerning collaboration and career paths have been reintroduced,"" SAS said in a statement. 
SAS shares earlier on Thursday closed up 9 percent, reaching levels seen just before the strike began on Friday, supported by news that talks had resumed, and later in the day, by Norwegian media reports that the parties were nearing a deal. 
Analysts have estimated the stand-off could cost SAS as much as $10.5 million a day, threatening to wipe out the airline's annual profit in short order.
Gustafson said SAS would elaborate on costs for the dispute in connection with its next earnings report. 
""I am very satisfied that SAS and the pilots have reached an agreement so the passengers can fly again. I hope that there will now be peace and stability around SAS,” Denmark’s finance minister, Kristian Jensen, said on Twitter.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 06:22PM ET</span>",Apollo-backed Starboard in exclusive talks with Petrobras for 9 oilfields -sources,"By Gram Slattery and Carolina Mandl
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management-backed investment firm Starboard Restructuring Partners is in exclusive talks with Petrobras to buy nine onshore oilfields for roughly 1 billion reais ($252 million), two sources familiar with the matter said this week.
The Brazilian investment firm, in which Apollo has a 20% stake, has partnered with oil startup 3R Petroleum, aiming to bring Starboard, for which this would be its entry into oil production, more knowledge about the sector. 3R was founded in part by former Petrobras managers and has been active in the industry only recently.
The move comes as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Brazil's state-run oil firm is formally known, seeks to unload stakes in mature oilfields in a bid to reduce debt and focus on the nation's offshore, 'pre-salt' play.
Last week, the company announced the $384 million sale of a complex of 34 relatively small oilfields known collectively as Riacho da Forquilha to PetroReconcavo, a Salvador, Brazil-based firm. Current Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has made a priority of exiting the onshore segment, where production has fallen dramatically in recent years, amid flagging investments by the firm.
Petrobras and Starboard declined to comment. Ricardo Savini, a partner at 3R, did not respond to a request for comment. 
One of the sources said Starboard is in talks with Petrobras to acquire the Macau and Fazenda Belem clusters, which are composed of seven and two oilfields, respectively.
Combined, those assets produce about 5,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, according to the document seen by Reuters.
A deal would represent a second chance of sorts for 3R. Petrobras announced in November that it had reached a deal with the startup to sell Riacho da Forquilha, which aroused suspicions from unions and trade groups concerned about the deal's lack of a clear financing structure.
Eventually, the deal was rescinded after 3R failed to acquire financing, and PetroReconcavo agreed to purchase the fields.
Starboard manages 2.5 billion reais, while its partner Apollo has more than $300 billion under management.

(This story Starboard corrects Apollo stake to 20 percent, not 30 percent, in paragraph 2).

1294,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 06:13PM ET</span>",Beyond Meat's share price more than doubles in vegan burger maker's IPO,"By Tina Bellon and Bharath ManjeshR
(Reuters) - Shares of vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc rose more than 160 percent in their market debut on Thursday, as investors look to cash in on the first publicly listed veggie meat company and the growing popularity of plant-based meat alternatives.
The stock opened at $46, well above its IPO price of $25. Shares surged minutes after starting to trade and were halted due to volatility. They traded up to $72 during the day, before closing at $65.75.
Beyond Meat, which has warned it may never turn a profit, closed with a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion, based on shares outstanding including underwriters' option. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the company raised the size and price of its offering after increased demand from investors. The IPO raised $240 million. 
The money raised from the IPO gives Beyond Meat firepower to compete with other rivals in the increasingly crowded imitation meat market, such as Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods Inc. 
Beyond Meat founder and Chief Executive Ethan Brown told Reuters on Thursday the proceeds would be used to expand marketing efforts, develop new products, establish production centers in Europe and Asia and open additional manufacturing facilities in the United States.
The Los Angeles-based company, which counts actor Leonardo DiCaprio and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates among its investors, aims to market its meatless burger patties and other products to meat-loving consumers. It avoids terms such as vegan or vegetarian and instead displays its products in the meat case of supermarkets.
Plant-based substitutes for meat have been gaining popularity as more people shift towards vegan or vegetarian diets, amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat, animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming. 
Beyond Meat creates substitutes for meat by using ingredients that mimic the composition of animal-based meat, mainly employing pea protein that looks and cooks like beef or chicken.
Currently, some 70 percent of the company's revenues are generated by its flagship Beyond Burger patties. The company also sells imitation sausages and vegan ground beef. 
But Beyond Meat said it has struggled with production capacity issues in the face of growing demand, and interruptions in the supply of pea protein, which it currently sources from two producers in Canada and France.
""We're looking very much at not only expanding the number of pea protein providers but also getting into new types of protein,"" Brown said.
Brown said protein blends, including from mung beans, brown rice and sunflower seeds, would not only offer pricing protection and supply chain diversity, but also provide consumers with a variety of plant-based protein options.
But Beyond Meat is not the only company vying for health-conscious consumers.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), the No.1 U.S. meat processor, owned a 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat, but last week said it sold its holding, as it looks to develop its own line of alternative protein products.
Burger King and Impossible Foods last month started selling their vegan burger Impossible Whopper in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri, with nationwide sales expected by the end of the year.
Beyond Meat began selling its plant-based burger at more than 1,100 U.S. locations of fast-food chain Carl's Jr in January.
In 2018, some $50 million of Beyond Meat's revenues came from retail sales, including at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Whole Foods Market and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co supermarkets, while some $37 million was generated at restaurants.
Brown said the company planned to expand its network of restaurant and retail partners outside the United States, which currently account for 7 percent of revenues, but declined to provide further details.

In 2018, Beyond Meat's net loss narrowed marginally to $29.89 million, from $30.38 million a year earlier. Net revenue more than doubled to $87.93 million in the same period.

The IT services and outsourcing company's shares fell as much as 6 percent in after-hours trading.
The company said it expected its financial services unit to be hit by lower demand from banks, insurers and North American regional lenders, with the healthcare business facing the brunt of the recent spate of consolidation.
""Our revised full-year outlook reflects the first-quarter underperformance and expectations of slower growth in financial services and healthcare for the remainder of 2019,"" said Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin.
McLoughlin also signaled cost cuts in the wake of lowered revenue expectations for the year.
The company forecast 2019 revenue growth in the range of 3.6 percent and 5.1 percent in constant currency. It had earlier forecast revenue growth between 7 percent and 9 percent.
The results come against the backdrop of management changes.
Former  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) executive Brian Humphries on April 1 assumed charge from long-time Chief Executive Officer Francisco D'Souza.
Revenue in its financial services unit fell 1.7 percent to $1.44 billion in the quarter. Growth in the business, Cognizant's biggest, has been sluggish and that has weighed on overall revenue growth.
Healthcare services revenue increased nearly 4 percent to $1.17 billion, but missed the $1.20 billion forecast by three analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Total revenue rose to $4.11 billion from $3.91 billion, but fell short of the average analysts' estimate of $4.16 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, the company earned 91 cents per share, missing estimate of $1.04.
The results were unveiled just ahead of the scheduled press release time, sending shares sharply lower. They finally closed down 7.7 percent.

1306,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Nonfarm Payrolls Dominates the Day
The April employment report will take most of the market’s attention before the bell tomorrow.
The Labor Department will release its latest jobs figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls rose by 181,000 last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The unemployment rate is forecast to stay at 3.8%.
Wages, a key component of inflation, are predicted to rise, with average hourly earnings climbing 0.3% for the month, pushing its year-over-year gain to 3.3%.
Data earlier this week has been generally encouraging for the jobs number, with the ADP private sector payrolls posting a particularly strong gain for April.
On Wednesday the Federal Reserve pointed to the employment picture as one reason it can remain patient either way on rates, saying in its statement that ""(j)ob gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.""
2. PMIs Also on Tap, Plus Lots of Fed Chatter
Payrolls aren’t the only indicator on tomorrow’s economic calendar.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), the Institute of Supply Management will release its non-manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI).
The services PMI is expected to edge up to 57.2 for April. The ISM's manufacturing index declined slightly in April but still signaled a growing economy.
Before that, at 9:45 AM ET, Markit will release the final measure of its composite PMI for April.
The PMI is forecast to remain at 52.8, the same as the preliminary measure.
And for those not tired of the Fed this week, there are a whopping eight Fed members speaking tomorrow, most in California.
Richard Clarida, John Williams, Michelle Bowman, James Bullard, Mary Daly, Robert Kaplan and Loretta Mester will be speaking throughout the day at the Strategies for Monetary Policy conference in Stanford, Calif., starting at 11:30 AM ET.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is the odd one out. He gets a flight to Stockholm for the lengthily named NABE International Symposium: ""Global Economies at the Crossroads: Growing Together While Growing Apart?""
Evans will speak at 10:15 AM ET.
3. Fiat Chrysler to Report Results
The earnings calendar starts to lighten up tomorrow, with no reports coming after the end of trading.
Before the bell, Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) will issue results, with analysts predicting a first-quarter profit of 53 cents per share, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Revenue is seen coming in at about $29 billion.
The stock still hasn’t recovered from the sharp dive when it last reported earnings in February. Fiat Chrysler issued downside guidance for full-year earnings then and singled out challenges in China."
1307,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Stumbles on Plunge in DowDuPont, Energy Stocks","Investing.com – Stocks closed lower on Thursday, led by a slump in energy stocks as oil prices plunged to a one-month low, while a steep decline in DowDuPont also soured investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46%, the S&P 500 lost 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.16%. It was the second day in a row of declines for the indexes.
A sea of red washed over energy stocks, pressuring the broader market, as the selloff in oil prices continued in the wake of easing expectations of a supply shortage in the crude market.
In materials, chemicals company DowDuPont fell 7% as its profits tumbled 28% in the first quarter of the year on the back of dwindling chemical demand, especially in the United States. The slump also affected Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) -- a member of the Dow Jones Industrials -- the chemicals business spun off by DowDuPont on April 1. Its shares were down 6.2%.
Industrials also fell victim to weaker earnings from Fluor, while weakness in  Caterpillar  also contributed to the malaise in the sector.
Fluor (NYSE:FLR) slumped 24% after CEO David Seaton abruptly resigned on the back of disappointing earnings and a cut to full-year forecast.
""A key question is how the updated guidance will affect the earnings potential beyond 2019, and whether there are any changes to the profitability outlook for LNG Canada,"" UBS said. Last October, LNG Canada awarded Fluor and Japan's JGC Corp. a $14-billion contract to build a liquefied natural gas export facility in Kitimat, B.C., Canada.
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), meanwhile, lined up a record dividend payout, but its share price stumbled 2.2%, suggesting shareholders were hoping for a heftier windfall.
Industrials and materials, both of which are sensitive to trade news, had a muted reaction to news that a U.S-China trade deal could be announced as soon as next week.
In other company news, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 163% on its public market debut. The maker of plant-based burgers priced its IPO at $25 per share.
On the economic front, factory goods orders increased 1.9%, beating economists' expectations for a 1% rise, but that proved of little consequence as investor focus is firmly on nonfarm payrolls data due Friday.
A strong payrolls number, however, could further dent expectations for market-friendly policy measures from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Powell said on Wednesday the Fed was unlikely to cut or hike rates, arguing that the current path of policy was appropriate.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 05:04PM ET</span>","Bombardier to shed Belfast factory in revamp, shares slide on forecast fears","By Allison Lampert and Amanda Ferguson
MONTREAL/BELFAST (Reuters) - Bombardier put its Belfast wing-making factory on the block as part of a wider shake-up, while the plane and train maker's reluctance to say it would meet 2020 goals sent shares lower.
The Canadian company said on Thursday it would unite its corporate and regional jet units, while selling off two aerostructures operations, including the Belfast plant, the largest high-tech manufacturer in Northern Ireland.
Bombardier's retreat from Belfast comes at a sensitive time for the British government, which is struggling to agree a deal to leave the European Union, in large part because of disagreements over the future of the Irish border.
The plant and its 3,600 workers are an important constituency for Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which is propping up Prime Minister Theresa May's minority government. 
Stunned workers at the factory, just yards away from the shipyard that built the Titanic, urged the British government to ensure jobs were retained.
""It's a shock to the system given what we have all been through. It's taken a toll,"" said Noel Gibson, a sheetmetal worker who has worked at the plant for 29 years.
The plant escaped major job losses last year https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-itc-ruling-britain/relief-for-uk-workers-after-bombardier-trade-dispute-victory-idUKKBN1FG0DV when Bombardier won a trade victory against U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) in a dispute that had threatened to slap a 300 percent duty on sales of jets for which the plant supplies wings.
Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare called the steps, including the sale of a separate Morocco facility that builds components for the company's regional jets, ""a strategic move"".
The two facilities generate about half of the $2.25 billion to $2.5 billion in revenues expected for the aero structures division in 2019, the company said. 
Bellemare said he expects the sales to take several months.
Bombardier is shedding its commercial aviation businesses to focus on more profitable corporate jets and passenger rail cars.
But the rail division, Bombardier's largest unit, has faced recent headwinds because of delivery delays and production problems at a handful of long-term projects. 
Investors were rattled last week when Bombardier cut https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bombardier-outlook/bombardiers-surprise-forecast-cut-rattles-stock-bond-investors-idUSKCN1S1168 its first-quarter and full-year revenue targets for the transportation division.
Bombardier expects to deliver nine trains this year as part of a long-delayed order to Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), Danny Di Perna, president of the transportation division, told Reuters. 
The company is producing another 15 trains for Swiss this year which are expected to enter service in 2020. 
The rail delivery delays led Bombardier executives to shy away from reaffirming 2020 objectives, such as growing revenues to $20 billion. The company will review the targets later in the year.
The rail division, which was expected to generate $10 billion next year, is crucial to Bombardier's five-year turnaround plan, after heavy investment in aircraft production drove it to the brink of bankruptcy in 2015.
Bombardier shares dropped as much as 10 percent, then bounced a bit to close down 5.13 percent at C$2.22 in Toronto.
AIRBUS WINGS
Bellemare said the company will be working with Europe's Airbus SE to find a buyer for the wing-making facility, which produces wings for the A220 narrowbody jet.
Industry analysts said the Belfast plant pioneered a leap forward in carbon-fibre wings technology that may be attractive to Airbus for its next generation of planes.
Airbus declined to say whether it was interested in buying the plant but described it as a ""key supplier"".
A spokesman for Britain's May said that while the move was disappointing and unsettling for workers, Bombardier's Belfast business has a healthy long-term order book.
Bombardier bought the plant from Short Brothers, the world's oldest planemaker, in 1989. It has been a pillar of Belfast's economy for decades and given many locals apprenticeships. 
It is of particular significance to the mainly Protestant unionist community which long provided the majority of workers in Shorts and the nearby Harland & Wolff shipyards.
The company said it will create a single aviation division headed by business aircraft president, David Coleal, and will consolidate its five aerostructures businesses to focus on facilities in Montreal, Mexico and its newly acquired Global 7500 business jet wing operations in Texas.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 04:59PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. seeks to challenge China's electric-vehicle supply chain dominance,"By Ernest Scheyder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator plans to introduce legislation on Thursday to streamline regulation and permitting requirements for the development of mines for lithium, graphite and other electric-vehicle supply chain minerals, part of a plan to offset China's dominance in the space.
While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and other electric-focused automakers and battery manufacturers are expanding in the United States, they are reliant on mineral imports without a major push to develop more domestic mines and processing facilities.
U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chair of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, told Reuters she will introduce the Minerals Security Act alongside Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat. 
""Our challenge is still a failure to understand the vulnerability we are in as a nation when it comes to reliance on others for our minerals,"" Murkowski said.
China already dominates the electric-vehicle supply chain.
It produces nearly two-thirds of the world's lithium-ion batteries - compared with 5 percent for the United States - and controls most of the world's lithium processing facilities, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, which tracks prices for lithium and other commodities and held a Washington event on Thursday designed to bring together miners, regulators and lawmakers.
The meeting, attended by more than 100 people, featured speakers from Tesla, the U.S. Department of State and Department of Energy, as well as Standard Lithium Ltd, ioneer Ltd and other companies working to develop U.S. lithium mines.
""The country should not go from dependence on oil from the Middle East for transportation, to dependence on China for electric vehicles and batteries,"" said Robbie Diamond of Securing America's Future Energy, a nonpartisan advocacy group for renewable energies. 
The United States is not the only country playing catch-up with China. France and Germany asked the European Commission earlier this week to support a 1.7 billion-euro ($1.9 billion) battery cell consortium to thwart Asian rivals' growth in the space.
""From a national security perspective, when you are vulnerable, as the United States is and many of our friends and allies are, on a resource that you need, that is a weakness,"" Murkowski said. ""We don't want that weakness to be exposed.""
Murkowksi said China's lead in the EV supply-chain sector gives the country an edge in the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute.
""My greatest challenge right now is to educate other members of Congress as to why this needs to be a national priority,"" she said.
U.S. miners said they appreciated Murkowski's push to get the federal government focused more on EV issues, especially China's dominance.
""We need to focus the United States on the fact that China is way ahead of us in the electric vehicle race,"" said Tim McKenna of Piedmont Lithium Ltd, which is developing a lithium project in North Carolina.
Tesla, for its part, underscored its concern on access to certain raw materials at the Thursday event. One of the company officials responsible for sourcing lithium and other electric vehicle minerals said Tesla is worried about supplies of nickel, copper and other electric-vehicle battery minerals. 
The Trump administration sent a State Department official to speak at Thursday's event. 

""We think it's important for us to talk about these new technologies and how minerals play into this,"" said Kent Logsdon, principal deputy assistant secretary at State.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 04:57PM ET</span>","Caterpillar gives details on services push, hikes dividend","By Timothy Aeppel
CLAYTON, N.C. (Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) on Thursday provided investors with details on its push to grow its services business while also laying out dividend increases and more consistent share repurchases in the coming years. 
The heavy machinery maker is looking to smooth volatility in its earnings by selling more parts and services, and said it intends to grow services revenue to $28 billion by 2026, up from $18 billion in 2018 and double what it was in 2016.
Deerfield, Illinois-based Caterpillar's main customers are in businesses like mining and construction, which are prone to wide swings with the business cycle. 
""Services will help dampen the impact of cycles, but we will never be immune from the cycle,” Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said at an investor meeting at a Caterpillar equipment factory in Clayton, North Carolina.
Last week the company said about 850,000 of its machines are connected to the cloud, which it sees as a way to sell services to customers. That should grow to 1 million machines by year end, Bob De Lange, group president of services, distribution and digital, said on Thursday.
New Caterpillar machines are dotted with sensors that allow close monitoring and can warn when parts are about to fail.
Caterpillar makes most of its service income from selling spare parts, according to industry analysts. New digital offerings, such as monitoring services that help track the health of machines, are a small but growing revenue source.
Umpleby said the company's network of dealers, which it relies on to deliver and service machines, are participating in the services push and will also see added profits, though he declined to elaborate on that split. He emphasized, however, that the added revenue target for 2026 is for Caterpillar only.
The services business, spread across the company's construction, resource and energy & transportation units, contributed about 33 percent to Caterpillar's $54.7 billion revenue in 2018.
The company announced it will pay a dividend of $1.03 per share, up 20 percent from its previous payout, on Aug. 20 to shareholders at the close of business on July 22. It is targeting at least high single-digit dividend increases in each of the next four years and plans to buy back shares more consistently.
Last week, Caterpillar had spooked investors when it reported first-quarter results that showed rising costs hitting margins in its construction equipment business and weak sales in the Asia-Pacific region linked to slow growth in China.
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said on Thursday that tariffs would cost the company $250 million to $350 million in 2019 if there was no relief. 
Still, he said Caterpillar is ""cautiously optimistic"" there will be a resolution of the trade dispute with China.
Caterpillar has raised prices to offset some of the higher costs and pushed efficiency moves at its far-flung network of factories. 
The company now has a target for adjusted operating margins of 3 to 6 percentage points above historical performance from 2010 to 2016.

Caterpillar shares ended down 2.2 percent on Thursday.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Canadian dollar delinks from Wall Street as domestic risks threaten,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is losing its usual tight link to the performance of U.S. stocks as investors pay more attention to domestic economic headwinds than signs of improved prospects for the U.S. economy.
The signal that Wall Street sends about the U.S. economic outlook tends to be an important driver of the loonie because Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the United States, including many commodities such as crude oil.
But the correlation between the S&P 500 and the Canadian dollar has collapsed since March, with the loonie losing ground even as U.S. stocks notched a record high.
(GRAPHIC-Canadian dollar and U.S. stocks delink link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WmFgoi)
The market's message is ""we're confident in U.S. growth, we're confident in U.S. corporate profitability and normally that would spill over to Canada, but right now we're worried about the Canadian consumer, Canadian housing, Canadian natural resource investment,"" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive.
The Bank of Canada last week slashed its gross domestic product growth forecast for the year to 1.2 percent from 1.7 percent in January, blaming a slowdown in the country's oil sector, a weaker-than-expected housing sector and the negative impact of global trade policies.
Trade uncertainties, including negotiation of a new trade deal between Canada, the United States and Mexico, were a drag on the loonie when its correlation with U.S. stocks last broke down in July 2018.
The three countries struck the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) last September, but the chances of the countries ratifying the pact this year are receding.
Meanwhile, the rally in oil prices since December of as much as 57 percent has not led to increased investment in Canada's energy patch, while a lack of pipeline capacity has capped the amount of oil Canada can get to the global market.
""People are realizing that we're not a petrocurrency and that there is a much larger, much more important household consumption sector,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.
In the fourth quarter, household spending was about 57 percent of Canada's gross domestic product, according to data from Statistics Canada, while household debt as a share of income widened to a record 174 percent. 
Canadians have taken on record amounts of debt in recent years, fueling a rapid rise in real estate prices. But the housing market has softened since the start of 2018, weighed down by tighter mortgage rules and interest rate hikes from the Bank of Canada.
""You could see the interest burden on Canadian consumers rise to a pace that it becomes difficult to manage,"" said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners.
In a potential sign that investors have become worried about a recession in Canada, the country's yield curve inverted in March for the first time in more than a decade.
""The market is getting much more picky about some of the domestic headwinds facing individual countries and less likely to believe that rising global growth will float all boats,"" ForexLive's Button said.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 04:43PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla expects global shortage of electric vehicle battery minerals - sources,"By Ernest Scheyder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc expects global shortages of nickel, copper and other electric-vehicle battery minerals down the road due to underinvestment in the mining sector, the company's global supply manager for battery metals told an industry conference on Thursday, according to two sources.
The company, a major minerals consumer, has rarely talked publicly about its views on the metals industry. Copper, nickel, lithium and related minerals are key components used to make electric-vehicle batteries and other parts.
Sarah Maryssael, Tesla's global supply manager for battery metals, told a closed-door Washington conference of miners, regulators and lawmakers that the automaker sees a shortage of key EV minerals coming, according to the sources.
According to a Tesla spokesman, the comments were industry-specific and referring to the long-term supply challenges that may occur with regards to these metals. 
The copper industry has suffered from years of underinvestment, and it is now working feverishly to develop new mines and bring fresh supply online as the electrification trend envelops the global economy. Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, is expanding in the United States and Indonesia.
Electric cars use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. So-called smart-home systems - such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Nest thermostat and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Alexa personal assistant - will consume about 1.5 million tonnes of copper by 2030, up from 38,000 tonnes today, according to data from consultancy BSRIA.
All that will make the red metal - and other minerals - scarcer commodities, which worries Tesla. 
Maryssael added, according to the sources, that Tesla will continue to focus more on nickel, part of a plan by Chief Executive Elon Musk to use less cobalt in battery cathodes. Cobalt is primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and some extraction techniques - especially those using child labor - have made its use deeply unpopular across the battery industry, especially with Musk.
Maryssael told the conference, hosted by commodity pricing tracker Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, that there is ""huge potential"" to partner with mines in Australia or the United States, according to the sources.
Australia late last year signed a preliminary deal with the United States to support joint research and development of minerals deemed critical to the U.S. economy. 

The conference, attended by more than 100 people, featured speakers from the U.S. Department of State and Department of Energy, as well as Standard Lithium Ltd, ioneer Ltd and other companies working to develop U.S. lithium mines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased further from recent record highs on Thursday as energy shares dropped along with oil prices and investors continued to digest comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
The energy index was down the most among the major S&P sectors, falling 1.71% and extending its recent slide. U.S. oil prices slid more than 2 percent on fears of oversupply.
""For better or worse, a lot of investors have been trained to respond to the decline of oil, where it could mean demand is light and, thus, economic activity is light,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.
Powell's comments on Wednesday that a decline in inflation this year could be due to transitory factors dampened some investors' hopes that the U.S. central bank could move later this year to cut interest rates, market watchers said.
Traders lowered their bets on a rate cut this year following Powell's comments, and stocks fell, but many investors said the Fed's stance makes sense.
""I don't think reasonable investors are looking for a rate cut at this moment. And the good economic conditions don't necessarily point to a rate hike either,"" Forrest said.
The S&P 500's recent run to record highs also may be giving investors reasons to pause. 
Stocks have ""done extremely well and pockets of the market are overdone,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""Usually when the market moves that quickly, a little bit of caution comes in.""
The index has rallied more than 16 percent this year and is entering a period of the year traditionally known as being difficult for equities over the next six months.
On the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 122.35 points, or 0.46%, to 26,307.79, the S&P 500 lost 6.21 points, or 0.21%, to 2,917.52, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.87 points, or 0.16%, to 8,036.77.
With the first-quarter earnings season winding down, investors are looking for fresh catalysts such as U.S.-China trade developments and economic data.
Markets also are waiting for a reading of the Labor Department's non-farm payrolls data on Friday that is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared with March.
More than 350 of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results so far on the first quarter. Analysts now expect earnings to have risen 0.7%, compared with the 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv data.
Among gainers, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc rose 0.9% after analysts said the chipmaker was well positioned in the 5G networks space even as it forecast disappointing current-quarter sales. 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 1.1%.
Among decliners, Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, tumbled 6.1% after reporting a fall in core earnings.
Kellogg Co dropped about 3.4% after the cereal and snacks maker said it would replace its chief financial officer and reported a decline in first-quarter earnings.
But shares of vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc ended up 163% in their market debut Thursday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 62 new lows.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp on Thursday became the first company sued for profiting from expropriated Cuban property as the Trump administration piles new sanctions on the Communist-run nation for supporting Venezuela's embattled government.
The administration last month announced a long dormant section of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act would take effect on May 2 as it ratcheted up the pressure on Venezuela and Cuba.
Under Title III of the Helms Burton Act, waived by previous presidents, anyone whose property was nationalized after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, even if they were not U.S. citizens at the time, can sue any individual or company profiting from their former holdings.
The suit was brought in federal court in Miami by Javier Garcia Bengochea and Mickael Behn. The former holds title to Santiago de Cuba port and the latter to one in Havana used by numerous U.S. cruise lines. Both men are descendants of the original owners.
Lawyer Nick Gutierrez, an adviser to the claimants, said in a telephone interview that Title III recommends claimants notify defendants 30 days before filing suit.
Gutierrez said Carnival was duly notified and thus the suit was filed on Thursday, with others to follow soon.
""I know Bengochea has been in contact with Carnival and later will file suit against other companies including Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines,"" he said, adding he would also file numerous suits for clients in the coming weeks.
Carnival declined to comment on the lawsuit, except to say it was continuing its normal schedule of cruises to Cuba. It also referred to a statement from the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry lobby, saying the operations of cruise lines that do business with Cuba ""falls under the lawful travel exemption under Title 3 of the Helms Burton Act.""
Cuba charges Title III violates international law because its nationalization of property was legal and also because Cuban-Americans were not U.S. citizens when their properties were taken.
All other nations settled their citizens' property claims decades ago, while 5,913 certified U.S. claims by American citizens at the time of expropriation were never settled.
Canada, the European Union and other countries charge the United States has no jurisdiction over their citizens' activity in Cuba and they will take the issue to the World Trade Organization, among other actions.
International opposition, and the fear that thousands of suits brought by Cuban-Americans would clog U.S. courts, led previous U.S. presidents to waive implementation of Title III.
Title I and II of the Helm-Burton Act codify all previous sanctions into law and set conditions for the U.S. Congress to lift them.

Title IV bans executives and their families from the United States if they profit from expropriated properties.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA, the world's biggest iron ore producer, has taken legal action to force a German inspection firm to provide documents on its services for the Brumadinho dam that could help to establish who was responsible for the disaster.
TÜV SÜD audited the tailings dam before its collapse in January which killed nearly 300 people.
In a court filing seen by Reuters on Thursday, Vale asked a court to authorize access to all the documents related to that audit, arguing that if the German company had not fulfilled its contract it could be held responsible.
Vale cited a statement given to federal police by TÜV SÜD employee Makoto Mamba in which he alleged he had been ""pressured"" by the miner to sign a report validating the stability of the Brumadinho dam so that planned work on the dam's structure could proceed.
""The finger pointed by the TÜV SÜD technician in fact points to no one but himself,"" Vale lawyers Sergio Bermudes Advogados said in the request to a Rio de Janeiro court filed on Tuesday.
TÜV SÜD declined to comment.
The tailings dam at Vale's Corrego do Feijao iron ore mine burst on Jan. 25, releasing a torrent of mining waste that buried workers and local residents in the nearby town of Brumadinho.
An internal Vale document seen by Reuters in February showed that the company knew last year that the dam had a heightened risk of rupturing.

The report, dated Oct. 3, 2018, classified the dam in the state of Minas Gerais as being two times more likely to fail than the maximum level of risk tolerated under internal guidelines. The document showed Vale itself was concerned about the safety of the dam and raised questions as to why the independent audit guaranteed the dam's stability.

1318,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Australia's Huge Stock Rally Faces a Rude Awakening,"(Bloomberg) -- Promises of easy monetary policy have sent Australia’s stocks soaring to the highest in more than a decade. But there’s a speed bump: Soft profit growth.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index has eluded a weakening economy and a deepening housing slump to soar near levels not seen since before the global financial crisis. Speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates has helped drive the gauge up more than 12 percent this year, but results from Australia’s biggest banks and third-quarter trading updates could cause the nation’s stocks to sputter.
The market “will get excited about the outlook of easing liquidity or economic growth, and then it needs to be followed by actual earnings growth,” said Jun Bei Liu, a portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners in Sydney.
Australia’s stocks have taken part in this year’s global equities rally, even as the domestic economy showed signs of trouble. Strong commodity prices and a better-than-expected end to an inquiry into financial-industry misconduct also helped elevate the benchmark. Australian stocks jumped to its highest level in more than 11 years after the nation’s first-quarter inflation missed analyst estimates on April 24, spurring hopes the central bank will cut rates next week.
There’s a close to 50 percent chance the RBA will lower its cash rate target from a record-low 1.50 percent at its May 7 meeting, according to overnight interest-rate swaps on Wednesday.
Fading Optimism
A potential RBA rate cut and fiscal stimulus driven by Australia’s upcoming election are expected to buoy the market,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts led by Chris Nicol write in an April 28 note. While the analysts see the need for that inducement, they felt the need to “push back on the likely timing of such and look to soft earnings trends at the upcoming banks results season and broader company trading updates” in the third quarter.
Results from Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National Australia Bank Ltd. this week point to weakness over the next few quarters, given margin depression and low-volume growth, Liu at Tribeca said. Financial stocks, which make up about a third of the benchmark index, are up just under 10 percent this year, though among the benchmark’s worst performers.

“Optimism has faded somewhat into the sector,” she said.
‘Toppy’ Market
Some investors believe Australian equities have simply gone up too much. The broader market is “toppy” and overdue for a “decent” sell-off, which will likely begin in early to mid May, according to Richard Coppleson, director of institutional sales and trading at Bell Potter Securities.
Coppleson sees the S&P/ASX 200 dropping about 13 percent -- to around the 5,500 level -- by the third quarter, according to an April 18 note to clients. The benchmark closed at 6,338.40 Thursday.
Australian stocks could see a heightened level of earnings downgrades into the fiscal June year-end, Goldman Sach Group Inc.’s Matthew Ross wrote in an April 28 note. Such cuts would come after earnings in the first half of the year were the weakest since the global financial crisis and trading conditions have remained subdued, he said.
And this week may prove prescient. The nation’s key stock gauge is poised for losses this week, its first in five.
“In the next month or so, expectations will continue to come down” Tribeca’s Liu said. “It’s difficult to see the market rally during this period, barring any other external events.”

French President Emmanuel Macron has pushed for sweeping euro zone reforms but has met resistance from northern European countries loathe to bind themselves more closely to weaker economies in the euro zone's south.
""There is no progress with the deepening of the monetary union because the Netherlands, Austria and all too often Germany stand in the way when it comes to solidarity in action and joint responsibility,"" said Juncker.
""However I am still hopeful. Germany is not ready for it yet but many German politicians want to make progress in this area,"" he added in the interview to be published online on Thursday.
Asked whether so-called Eurobonds, or jointly issued debt for euro zone members, could be expected at some point, Juncker replied: ""Yes, but in another form and with another name.""
He declined to talk about failed merger talks between  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""But no one can claim that all is rosy in the German financial sector.""
Juncker, whose term as president of the EU's executive expires this year, said he was ""not advocating for or against"" Jens Weidmann, the chief of Germany's national central bank, to succeed Mario Draghi as president of the European Central Bank.
""I wouldn't mind at all if there was a German president of the ECB or of the European Commission,"" he said. ""I definitely do not share the view that is prevalent in parts of southern Europe that a German may not be president of the ECB.""
Turning to trade relations with the United States, Juncker said the EU did not want to reach a comprehensive deal along the lines of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which failed to materialize after three years of talks.
""No, there will not be a TTIP II. But we will agree on a few key points,"" Juncker said, adding that he planned to talk about trade with U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of a meeting of the G20 economic powers in Japan in late June.
He stressed that the EU did not want to include agricultural products in a deal, adding: ""The Americans keep trying but we have stood our ground. If the French government claims different then it is incorrect.""

Brexit was a ""warning shot, a continental wake-up call"" for the bloc's other members, Juncker said. ""It has become clear to EU citizens that they cannot take the EU for granted and that leaving it could have disastrous consequences.""

1320,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 03:33PM ET</span>",Wall St. watchdog proposes plan to boost oversight of firms with tainted brokers,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog on Thursday proposed a rule to boost oversight of securities brokerages with a ""significant history of misconduct"" that could require them to set aside funds that cannot be withdrawn without the regulator's consent, among other measures.
The proposal, published in a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) notice, also lays out a process for labeling a brokerage as ""restricted,"" which would trigger the new requirements. 
The proposed measures are part of an effort to rein in brokerages seen as posing a serious risk to investors because of a high percentage of securities brokers on their rosters who have a history of regulatory run-ins and other concerns.
Many brokers with a track record of regulatory violations continue to find work at smaller firms that have a high concentration of those brokers.
""Such firms generally do not carry out their supervisory obligations to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations,"" FINRA said in the notice, noting that the number of such firms is small. 
A 2017 Reuters analysis uncovered 48 firms where at least 30 percent of brokers had at least one of 12 serious FINRA red flags on their records, compared with 9 percent of brokers industrywide.
The analysis examined the 12 most serious incidents among the 23 that FINRA requires brokers to publicly disclose, such as regulatory sanctions, customer complaints that resulted in the broker having to pay the customer, and criminal cases. 
In some cases, FINRA expels brokerages from the industry because of regulatory violations, including being unable to pay aggrieved customers who won arbitration cases against them.
FINRA requires firms to have $250,000 in their company reserves. Investor advocates say that in arbitration cases where a brokerage is ordered to pay an unhappy investor an award or settlement, the most troubled firms frequently do not have enough cash on hand to do so. 
Brokers from expelled firms often find work at other brokerages.
FINRA's proposed process for identifying ""restricted firms"" includes determining a brokerage's percentage of brokers with previous violations and when they occurred, and if brokers recently worked at expelled firms.
Once identified, brokerages would have an opportunity to cut staff.
Brokerages that remain ""restricted"" would have to deposit cash or securities, on top of reserves they must already set aside, which they could not withdraw without permission, FINRA said.
The additional sum would depend on firm size, amounts of certain pending arbitration claims, and other factors, FINRA said.
Between 60 and 98 of the 3,712 brokerages that FINRA oversees would meet ""restricted firm"" preliminary criteria annually, FINRA said.

FINRA requests input from the industry and public about the proposal by July 1.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Several major Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) shareholders have voiced opposition to the oil company's $38 billion bid for rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) that now includes a pricey financing deal with billionaire Warren Buffett.
Occidental and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) are battling for Anadarko and its holdings of nearly a quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost production has helped turn the United States into the world's top oil producer at 12.3 million barrels per day.
Occidental shares were trading on Thursday at $57.48, down sharply from $66.63 a month ago, prior to rumors it might challenge Chevron. It trumped Chevron's bid last week, and its offer now includes $10 billion in financing from Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc in exchange for preferred shares that would pay an 8 percent dividend.
Major Occidental shareholders told Reuters they opposed the plan. They called the $76-per-share bid for Anadarko expensive and cited concerns about the cyclical nature of the oil business as well as the cost of getting financing from Buffett.
Several Occidental shareholders said they viewed Chevron's lower $65-per-share bid as a better fit because it could more easily swallow a company of Anadarko's size. 
T. Rowe Price Group Inc, which holds shares in all three oil companies, cited merger risks and the cost of the Berkshire infusion. John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said Buffett's deal could allow Occidental to restructure its cash-and-stock deal to avoid a shareholder vote, although its current offer includes a vote. 
T. Rowe Price, Occidental's sixth largest shareholder, had 21.1 million shares at the end of 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon figures, along with 8 million Chevron shares and 865,000 Anadarko shares.
Berkshire would receive a warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of common stock at $62.50 apiece in a private offering, in addition to the preferred stock that will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum.
""That's very expensive paper,"" Linehan said of the agreement with Berkshire. ""They could have borrowed far cheaper than that."" 
Occidental did not respond to a request for comment on shareholder objections to the current proposal. Before the Buffett financing plan, it said the deal would result in $3.5 billion in cash flow improvements and that it would sell $10 billion to $15 billion in assets to reduce debt. 
Moody's Investors Service estimated that the assumption of Anadarko's debt and additional borrowings to cover the offer would add almost $40 billion in debt to Occidental. Moody's put the company's debt rating under review for downgrade. 
South Texas Money Management, which has $2.3 billion in assets under management, including shares of Chevron and Occidental, hopes Chevron prevails. 
At the end of March they owned around 580,000 shares of Occidental and 370,000 shares of Chevron worth $38.5 million and $45.5 million, respectively. 
""Right now their bid would allow them to extract a lot of value for that deal,"" said Christian Ledoux, South Texas' chief investment officer. Chevron's offer was constructed as 25 percent in cash and 75 percent in stock, compared with the 50-50 split from Occidental.
Even if Chevron raised its bid and offered ""a little more cash,"" Ledoux would still consider the deal a good one for Chevron because the company has expertise in Anadarko's shale, liquefied natural gas and offshore assets.
Chevron has not raised its bid for Anadarko, saying its agreement would provide ""the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko's shareholders.""
Occidental and Chevron, two of the largest oil and gas producers in the Permian by production volumes, each believe they can best squeeze more oil from Anadarko's 240,000 acres (97,120 hectares) in the top shale field.
Occidental's annual meeting is May 10, ""and we will be interested to see the interaction between shareholders and the Board,"" Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday.

""On paper the (Occidental) deal looks great if oil is at $65, but we’re in a cyclical industry where commodity prices change dramatically,"" said David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, which held 241,700 shares of Occidental and 61,300 shares of Chevron at the end of April. ""They’re basically putting the company at risk.""

SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board said on Thursday it sued some owners of potentially invalid bonds of the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth, as well as Wall Street banks and firms that participated in various debt issuances in an effort to recoup more than $1 billion.
The litigation, which was in the works since last month, follows more than 230 complaints the board filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico earlier this week against private companies, individuals and service providers that received about $4.2 billion in payments from the island's government as far back as four years before its May 3, 2017, bankruptcy filing.
The board, which had only two years from that date under a statute of limitations to file certain claims, was denied an extension last week by a federal judge hearing Puerto Rico's cases aimed at restructuring about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
At issue is more than $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 that the board contends exceeded a debt limit in Puerto Rico's constitution. The validity of some bonds issued by the island's Public Buildings Authority, as well as pension bonds, is also being questioned. Judge Laura Taylor Swain has yet to rule in the matter.
The lawsuits contend that bond underwriters, attorneys and advisers ""aided and abetted"" Puerto Rico in failing to meet its fiduciary duties, as it issued debt unlawfully and while being ""clearly insolvent."" In participating in these transactions, the defendants acted ""for their own profit and unjust enrichment,"" according to the litigation.
Defendants include many of Wall Street's biggest investment banks, as well as law firm Sidley Austin. 
Linton Childs, Sidley Austin's general counsel, said, ""We believe that putative claims asserted against the firm are both untimely and entirely without merit.""
The board argued that the proceeds and profits made by the defendants ""are recoverable as fraudulent transfers"" and that the court should award damages.
In the case of $3.5 billion of junk-rated GO bonds sold in 2014, the board alleged that underwriters and advisers ""knew or should have known"" that the transaction ran afoul of the commonwealth's constitutional debt limit. It also contended underwriters bought these bonds at discount, allowing them to ""reap large profits"" from the resale of the bonds to investors. 
In addition, the board sued individual investors and banks that owned at least $2.5 million of the bonds between May 2013 and May 2017 in an effort to recoup debt service payments they received. 
“The oversight board did not take the decision to claw back payments lightly,” said David Skeel, a member of the board’s Special Claims Committee, in a statement. “However, Puerto Rico’s taxpayers should not have to shoulder payments the government made to big investors that should never have been made in the first place.” 
The board said while it is ""sympathetic"" to bondholders, Puerto Rican law limits government borrowing authority to avoid ""sacrificing services necessary to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of Puerto Rico and its people."" 
Various investment banks were also sued as parties to interest rate swap agreements with the commonwealth that earned them almost $400 million in termination fees. According to the board, these institutions ""knew that the underlying bonds tied to these swap transactions carried substantial risk,"" which would result in an unfavorable outcome to the commonwealth.
""Despite this knowledge, the swap counterparty defendants continued to recommend and cause Puerto Rico issuers to enter into additional swap transactions on bonds they themselves underwrote,"" the lawsuit stated.

BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, is partnering with Mexico as the country installs internet nationwide and develops the southern isthmus, Fink wrote in the letter to the president.
Lopez Obrador told a news conference on Thursday that BlackRock's letter, dated April 18, expressed ""confidence in the country."" 
Despite vows to boost both private and public investment, Lopez Obrador's economic decision-making has rattled investors. In particular, his cancellation of a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport in October, a few weeks before taking office, sparked billions of dollars of losses on Mexican financial markets. 
The leftist leader has called for installing a fiber-optic cable throughout areas with poor connectivity, as well as free internet in public places. He has also proposed infrastructure projects in the long-neglected southern region, including a train linking the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico across the isthmus of Tehuantepec.
Private sector analysts have been cutting their Mexican growth forecasts for 2019.

Fink said BlackRock was ""firmly committed"" to Mexico. The asset manager has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to invest Mexico, including a focus on infrastructure.

1325,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2019 02:42PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Traders Hit Play on Zynga After Earnings Beat; Activision up Next,"Investing.com - Zynga rallied nearly 6% on Thursday as its better-than-expected quarterly results and firmer guidance prompted bullish calls from analysts.
Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) raised its full-year 2019 revenue guidance to $1.2 billion, an increase of $50 million from its prior guidance.
The firmer outlook on revenue growth was underpinned by solid first-quarter growth, with the social games developer beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
The company delivered first-quarter earnings of $0.07 a share on revenue of $359.48 million, handily beating estimates from Investing.com.
Mobile revenue rose 35% to a record $246 million for the quarter, and mobile bookings rose 77% to a record $341 million.
The record quarter of growth doesn't appear to be a one-hit wonder as the company also raised its bookings guidance to $1.45 billion, an increase of $100 million from its prior forecast.
That was more than enough to trigger a wave of bullish calls from analysts.
Baird upgraded Zynga to outperform from neutral and raised its target price on the stock to $8 from $5, implying a 38% upside from its current price of $5.78.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC), citing easing concerns on outlook for growth and margins, raised its price target on the stock to $6 from $4.60.
Gaming stocks rode the Zynga wave higher, with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and  Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) higher on the day. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) was the notable exception.
Activision will provide investors with further insight into gaming stocks when it releases its results after the U.S. market closes.
The company has come under pressure as its slate of games has failed to drum up significant demand in the wake of pressure from titles like Fortnite.
Activision stock is up more than 5% this year, but that's well behind gains in the S&P 500 of about 17%.
The gaming company is expected to report earnings of 24 cents a share on revenue of $1.23 billion, according to estimates from Investing.com. The EPS estimate is 37% off from a year ago's 38 cents. Revenue would be down 10.9% from a year ago's $1.38 billion."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foxconn chairman Terry Gou met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the status of the Taiwanese company's planned investment in Wisconsin, Foxconn said on Thursday.
Foxconn pledged to create 13,000 jobs and build a $10 billion campus in Wisconsin, but it has not met early hiring targets and has said it has been reconsidering its plans.
The White House has repeatedly refused to confirm if any visit was planned and did not immediately comment on Thursday. 
The Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier said in a statement the two discussed the Wisconsin project and other issues.
Gou, a billionaire who said last month he would run for president of Taiwan in 2020, also told Trump he would seek U.S. support for his country if he wins, The South China Morning Post newspaper reported.
The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide the island with the means to defend itself. China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province, has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. 
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said at a press conference on Thursday in Milwaukee that he planned to meet with Gou later in the day.
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said last month it remained committed to its contract to build a display plant and tech research facilities in Wisconsin, days after Evers said he wanted to renegotiate the deal.
Evers, a Democrat who inherited a deal to give Foxconn $4 billion in tax breaks and other incentives when he replaced Republican Scott Walker in January, said he wanted to renegotiate the contract because the firm is not expected to reach its job creation goals for the state.
The 20-million-sq-foot Wisconsin campus, announced at a White House ceremony in 2017, marked the largest planned greenfield investment by a foreign-based company in U.S. history and was praised by Trump as proof of his ability to revive American manufacturing. Trump attended a formal groundbreaking in June 2018.
Gou told Taiwanese media he invited Trump to come to Wisconsin next May when its production line will open and said Trump agreed.
But there is growing skepticism about the fate of the project.
In January Foxconn said market changes ""necessitated the adjustment of plans for all projects, including Wisconsin."" The company told Reuters it planned a ""technology hub"" rather than a factory, and would hire mostly engineers and researchers rather than blue-collar workers.
After a conversation between Gou and Trump, the company said on Feb. 1 it would still build a factory, however.
Trump did not mention the project in a rally last week in Green Bay, Wisconsin. 
Foxconn must meet certain hiring and capital investment goals to qualify for tax credits under the current contract.

It fell short of the employment goal in 2018, hiring 178 full-time workers rather than the 260 targeted, and failed to earn a tax credit of up to $9.5 million.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 01:47PM ET</span>",Pepsi withdraws Indian potato farmer lawsuits after political pressure,"By Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc has agreed to withdraw lawsuits against Indian potato farmers it alleged infringed a patent by cultivating a variety grown exclusively for its Lay's potato chips.
The U.S. snack food and drinks maker, which in addition to filing the lawsuit against the four farmers in April had sued five other potato growers, had said it wanted to settle the issue amicably.
""After discussions with the government, the company has agreed to withdraw the cases against the farmers,"" a PepsiCo India spokesman said on Thursday, adding that this applied to all nine.
The decision comes at a particularly sensitive time in India, which is about halfway through a 39-day general election in which its rural population still has a dominant voice.
It also follows intervention by an influential Hindu nationalist group with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said PepsiCo was coercing the farmers.
Modi and the BJP are seeking a second term and most political strategists think they are likely to succeed.
PepsiCo, which did not disclose details of its consultations, had previously said the farmers must either sell their potatoes to the New York-based company or stop cultivating the FC5 variety. In return, PepsiCo would withdraw the lawsuit.
PepsiCo, which set up its first potato chips plant in India in 1989, supplies the FC5 variety to a group of farmers who in turn sell their produce to it at a fixed price.
Ashwani Mahajan, who heads the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), the economic wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which is the ideological parent of Modi's BJP, welcomed PepsiCo's move as a moral victory for Indian farmers. 
""MNCs (multi national corporations) need to understand that they must honour Indian laws,"" Mahajan said.
PepsiCo maintains that it developed the FC5 variety of potato, which has a reduced moisture content to make snacks such as potato chips, and registered the trait in 2016.
The April lawsuit was filed in Ahmedabad, the business hub of the western state of Gujarat, requesting that the court restrain the four farmers from growing the FC5 variety. 
PepsiCo had also sought more than 10 million rupees ($143,000) each from the farmers.
The state government of Gujarat, ruled by Modi's BJP, had assured the farmers that it would help them while the opposition Congress party had also criticised PepsiCo's action.
""The company remains deeply committed to the thousands of farmers we work with across the country and towards ensuring adoption of best farming practices,"" the PepsiCo spokesman said.
PepsiCo, the second large U.S. company to face such patent issues in India, is keen ""to find a long term and amicable resolution"" of the issues involving seed protection, he said.

1337,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>","Risks Are Receding in Canada’s Housing Market, Agency Says","(Bloomberg) -- Recent rule changes by the Canadian government to tighten mortgage lending appear to be having the desired effect of bringing the country’s real estate market more into balance.
The federal housing agency lowered its assessment of the overall vulnerabilities in the national market to “moderate,” from “high,” according to a report Thursday from Ottawa. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. cited evidence of easing price acceleration for the country as a whole, with prices in Toronto and Vancouver moving closer to levels supported by fundamentals.
“After being rated ‘high’ for 10 straight quarters, the overall degree of vulnerability for Canada as a whole has changed to ‘moderate,’ the agency said in the report.
Home sales and prices have slowed in Canada after regulators imposed stress tests on new mortgage lending last year to mitigate risks of a crash. Since then, banks including Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as well as realtor groups and home builders, have argued the rules should be eased, saying they are punishing first-time buyers.
The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver reported Thursday that the benchmark home price fell 8.5 percent in April from a year ago while sales were down 29 percent. Toronto reports data tomorrow.
CMHC said its assessment of overvaluation in Vancouver has changed to moderate from high , and the “conditions of overheating are easing as well.” Vancouver, Toronto, Victoria, British Columbia, and Hamilton, Ontario continue to see a “high degree of vulnerability” in the overall assessment, “but house prices are moving closer to levels supported by housing market fundamentals” in those cities.
That said, CMHC flagged “evidence of overheating” in the Montreal and Moncton, New Brunswick resale markets. Also, vulnerability remains “moderate” for the western cities of Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and Winnipeg due to “evidence of overbuilding” in these cities.
The report is based on data through the end of 2018.

The move, which may expose the Bishkek government to compensation claims from foreign investors, followed a series of public protests against plans to develop the Kyzyl Ompul project in which Azarga has a stake.
""Parliament has taken a historic decision... Uranium mining will be prohibited,"" speaker Dastan Jumabekov told the legislature after Thursday's vote by which it ordered the government to draft the necessary bills to enforce the ban.
The only exception will be made for the reprocessing of waste in Soviet-era tailings.
Kyrgyzstan produces no significant volumes of uranium, which is used to generate electricity in nuclear power stations, but has an idle uranium mill. A handful of companies from the United States, Australia, China and other countries are exploring local deposits.
UrAsia, the company developing Kyzyl Ompul and in which Azarga owns a 70 percent stake, is being taken over by the Central Asian Uranium Company for $5.85 million in cash payments and a commitment to fund $1.5 million of exploration and development expenditures.

(Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc posted a 28 percent slump in quarterly profit on Thursday, as floods in the United States delayed seed shipments and demand for its specialized chemicals used by the auto and smartphone industries declined, sending shares down about 6 percent.
The company, which sells everything from circuit packaging and display materials for smartphones to lubricants and break fluid for car makers, reaffirmed its full-year forecast for net sales to be about flat.
Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard called DowDuPont's results ""refreshingly dull"", but said the last thing the market wanted at the moment was a surprise.
Formed in 2017 by the $130 billion merger of chemical giants  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DWDP), DowDuPont is now in the process of splitting into three separate business units - Dow, DuPont and Corteva Agriscience. 
Dow Inc, the materials science business, was spun off on April 1. Corteva is set to be separated on June 1. It makes corn, soybean, cotton sunflower seeds as well as insecticides, herbicides and fungicides.
The company said in March that the U.S. Midwest floods, which idled ethanol plants, slowed agricultural shipments and swamped storage bins holding grain from previous harvests, had limited the company's ability to deliver products to customers. 
As a combined company, DowDuPont's adjusted net income fell to $1.89 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, from $2.63 billion a year earlier.
On a per share basis, it earned 84 cents, in line with analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales at DowDuPont dropped 9 percent to $19.65 billion, and at Dow, it fell 10 percent to $10.77 billion. 
The company also said it expects to benefit from a recovery in demand from the auto and smartphone makers in the second half of the year. 
DOW NUMBERS
Dow posted a 24 percent drop in core earnings from operations during the reported quarter, in line with estimate, hurt by weak prices for its chemicals. 
In the second quarter, Dow said it is expecting a $200 million hit, mainly from seasonal planned turnaround and maintenance activity. 
But pricing was beginning to rise sequentially in its key markets, with an uptick in crude prices that is expected to benefit full-year earnings, the company said. 
It forecast revenue between $11 billion and $11.5 billion for the second quarter.

Shares of Dow, which have risen about 5 percent since it spun off from DowDupont on April 1, were down 4.6 percent at $53.55.

The news comes as Connecticut-based XPO is fighting to replace significant revenue from its top customer, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which moved in-house $600 million worth of business with XPO.
Less-than-truckload, which handles relatively small freight shipments, is the biggest piece of XPO's core transportation business, which brought in $2.66 billion in the first quarter.
""Our price increases on contract renewals were 3.7 percent... down from 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter. So there is some deceleration of the contract renewals,"" Matthew Fassler, XPO's chief strategy officer, said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. 
XPO built its less-than-truckload business with the purchase of trucking company Con-way for $3 billion in 2015.
XPO in February disclosed that its largest customer canceled two-thirds of its business with the company, forcing it to cut its 2019 profit forecast for the second time in two months.
Current and former XPO employees, as well as industry insiders, have told Reuters that the customer was Amazon, which is spending billions of dollars to build its own transportation infrastructure to contain swelling shipping costs. XPO and Amazon have declined to comment.

These small businesses, from Brazil and abroad, offer products that help farmers make better use of the computerized machines they buy, as well as provide tools that better evaluate the state of crops, allowing adjustments to improve agricultural yields.
Brazilian startup Prime Field on Tuesday closed a contract to provide 80 WiFi mobile bases to Bunge Açúcar e Bionergia, the sugar and ethanol arm of commodities trader Bunge Ltd. 
""They need to connect their cane harvesters during the crop, to improve logistics, and since there is no internet coverage in most of the fields they use our remote bases for WiFi,"" said Francisco Mello, Prime Field's founder, who is seeking an investment partner to produce Bunge's order.
The company already has contracts with France's Tereos and with  BP  (LON:BP) Biocombustíveis SA, a biofuel company owned by BP Plc.
Israel's SeeTree was also at Agrishow. The company, which raised $15 million from investors, offers services for permanent crops such as orange trees. It develops a health profile of the trees, looking for problems such as the citrus greening disease.
""Once we complete the establishment of our service in the citrus sector, we will progress to additional crops, according to market needs and our capabilities. It is our goal to provide service to many permanent crops in Brazil,"" said Chief Executive Israel Talpaz. 
""Its a deluge of tech services and solutions,"" said Sérgio Rocha, CEO of AgroTools, a leading Latin American ag tech founded as a start-up 10 years ago that grew to supply services to dozens of large corporations such as JBS, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Nestle. 
AgroTools has a line of products developed from its earth observation systems. It helps companies such as McDonald's and large commodities traders, for example, to avoid sourcing raw material from areas in Brazil that suffered recent deforestation.

Rocha says the company is finishing a round to invite new investors. It plans to raise $25 million in the next 90 days.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 11:09AM ET</span>",VW shrugs off 1 billion euro legal hit with higher SUV sales,"By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Sales of higher-margin sports utility vehicles and cost cuts helped Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) shrug off a 1 billion euro legal charge to meet first-quarter operating profit forecasts on Thursday, sending its shares 4.7 percent higher.
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell to 3.9 billion euros ($4.4 billion) from 4.2 billion a year earlier but were in line with the 3.92 billion euros expected by analysts despite the extra legal charges.
Adjusted for one-off factors, EBIT rose by a forecast-beating 14 percent, or 0.6 billion euros, to 4.8 billion euros, at a time when other carmakers and suppliers were cutting their outlook.
Luxury brands Porsche and Audi remain key profit contributors, making up around 40 percent of group EBIT.
A jump in demand for higher margin sports utility vehicles at the VW brand had helped to boost profits, a trend that is expected to continue for the rest of the year, the carmaker said.
""VW is defying the odds and growing earnings while others decline,"" Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton said in a note on Thursday.
By contrast, Daimler's adjusted operating profit had fallen 30 percent in the first quarter, Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper said.
Volkswagen expects to lift sales of sports utility vehicles to around 40 percent by 2020 from 23.2 percent at the end of 2018. 
Ongoing supply bottlenecks caused by difficulties getting cars certified for stricter emissions tests, as well as economic weakness in China, South America and Russia, and legal issues pose risks to VW Group's business, the carmaker said.
As a result, the return on sales for passenger cars will likely be at the lower end of its 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent margin target for the year, the carmaker said. 
The margin will suffer as Volkswagen prepares to sell its ID electric car next year.
""Electric vehicles will put substantial pressure on the overall group margin,"" Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said, telling analysts that additional cost measures will be required to offset weaker profitability of electric cars. 
Volkswagen stuck to its forecast of higher unit sales, revenue growth of up to 5 percent this year, and for a group operating return on sales of 6.5-7.5 percent.
GOING GREEN 
VW maintained its guidance for free cashflow to reach 10 billion euros by 2020, despite an inventory build-up due to difficulties getting vehicles cleared for sale in China and the United States. 
VW said in March it planned to launch almost 70 new electric models by 2028, aiming to put itself at the forefront of the industry's shift to zero-emissions driving following the 2015 scandal over its cheating of U.S. diesel emissions tests.
The company set aside 1 billion euros for additional risks for the scandal which has cost it 30 billion euros since it was caught using illegal engine control software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015.
VW said the provisions are not related to prosecutor charges filed last month against former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn and four other VW executives who are accused of fraud for failing to report systematic emissions cheating.
VW has also set aside contingent liabilities of 5.5 billion euros for potential diesel risks, of which 3.4 billion euros have been earmarked for investor lawsuits.
Passenger car sales fell 3 percent to 2.55 million vehicles during the quarter, with sales of the VW brand down 4.5 percent, but improvements in pricing and higher sales of sports utility vehicles helped the multi-brand group post resilient earnings.
Earnings at VW brand, Skoda, Audi, and commercial vehicles came in ahead of expectations, analysts at Citi said. 

And that's despite falling demand at luxury brands Audi and Porsche which saw sales drop 3.6 percent and 12.3 percent respectively. VW's Bentley brand also managed to reverse losses, the carmaker said.

MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group has launched legal action against the chairman and controlling shareholder of Italian publisher RCS Mediagroup over a disputed property sale, a copy of the lawsuit showed.
Filed in New York on April 22 and suing RCS Chairman Urbano Cairo directly, the latest action adds to the one Blackstone filed against RCS last November. The first lawsuit was put on hold on April 24 pending the outcome of arbitration in Italy. 
Asked about the lawsuit against him on the sidelines of RCS' annual general meeting on Thursday, Cairo said he could not comment as he had no direct information on the matter.
The case centers on RCS' historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($134 million) in 2013. 
Cairo has said Blackstone bought the properties at too low a price when RCS faced financial difficulties, and the transaction should be declared void. 
The publisher, owner of influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings under Italian law in November to annul the sale.
Blackstone has in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property and said the publisher improperly blocked it from selling it to Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) last summer, according to the two U.S. filings.
""The decision to proceed with an arbitration was taken by the board,"" Cairo said. ""It was something that could not be helped after the due diligence analysis."" 
The private equity firm says in the latest complaint that it suffered damages as a result of Cairo's alleged ""intentional interference with (Blackstone's) prospective business relations in an amount to be proven at trial"". 
Cairo said that RCS had told Blackstone that the valuation of the assets was too low long before news of the sale to Allianz emerged.
""We informed Blackstone in writing in March last year,"" he said on Thursday.
RCS' board has decided against setting aside funds to cover legal risks related to the dispute, a financial document published on Thursday showed. 
Cairo, who started off by selling advertising for the media group of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and went on to build his own media empire, took control of RCS in 2016 after a hostile takeover that pitted him against Italy's business elite.

Famous for his cost-cutting abilities, Cairo has been able to turn RCS around without job losses.

1351,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",UBS Investors Revolt Over Record French Tax Evasion Penalty,"(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) shareholders refused to back management and directors in a revolt against the bank’s handling of events that led to a $5 billion penalty for helping French clients evade taxes.
A usually routine vote to release directors and executives from liability failed to get the 50 percent needed at the bank’s annual general meeting in Basel on Thursday. The decision means shareholders reserve the right to legal action against management. The last time UBS investors refused to back executives was in 2010, after the bank ran up massive losses during the financial crisis.
The decision adds to pressure on Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti, who has suffered a number of executive departures as well as criticism from some shareholders over strategy. UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, has set aside just one-tenth of the 4.5 billion-euro ($5 billion) it was ordered to pay as it appeals one of the highest penalties ever imposed on a Swiss bank.
It’s at least the third time in two weeks that shareholders at a large European company are standing up against management. On Friday, investors in  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) rebuked the drugmaker’s chief executive officer over the $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) and the handling of legal challenges linked to the deal. ING shareholders refused to back the supervisory and executive boards over their handling of money laundering issues.
‘Criminal Wrongdoing’
UBS’s investors had been advised ahead of the meeting by U.S.-based Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. to reject the annual request to release directors and executives from liability. Glass Lewis, another adviser, said shareholders should abstain when asked to vote on the directors’ liability at the May 2 annual general meeting
While the French verdict could be overturned on appeal, “it remains the case that the company has been convicted of criminal wrongdoing and has incurred a record penalty as a result; this is of serious concern to shareholders,"" ISS said at the time.
The last time UBS shareholders refused to back management was almost a decade ago. In 2010 they voted against actions for 2007, the year the Zurich-based bank amassed billions of losses related to subprime mortgages.
In 2012, early in Ermotti’s tenure, shareholders protested against management actions for the prior year after Switzerland’s biggest bank suffered a $2.3 billion loss from unauthorized trading. At that time, however, the motion was approved by a slim margin.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>","Half-time: Europe Inc scores to avert first-quarter disaster, hopes of a rebound rise","By Helen Reid and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - European investors breathed a sigh of relief as more than half the region's major companies reported first-quarter earnings above market expectations, even if the bar was set very low ahead of results season, underscoring hopes the worst is behind Europe Inc.
As the mid-way mark of the Q1 reporting season approaches, companies' stronger performance and the diminishing mentions of risks related to China and a global trade war are encouraging signs.
Make no mistake: European earnings overall are still predicted to shrink by 4.2 percent from a year ago, the worst showing since the third quarter of 2016.
But numbers for the pan-European STOXX 600 companies have been better than feared: some 58 percent of them beat expectations, compared to a long-term average of 50 percent and tracking its best quarter in two years, Refinitiv data showed.
Industrials, a sector very closely geared to European and global economic growth, have been a success with earnings delivering a 5 percent surprise.
The sector is also one of the furthest along in reporting with more than 40 percent of companies' results through.
The data also showed Swedish truck maker Volvo, engineering group Alfa Laval and Airbus topped the charts in terms of positive surprises, while Lufthansa had the biggest negative surprise.
That spells a much stronger performance than dire manufacturing data would suggest. Euro zone factory activity contracted for a third month in April.
Technology and healthcare also contributed to a higher number of beats in the March quarter, although only about a dozen companies from each of those sectors have reported so far.
SAP, Europe's biggest tech company, reported robust results and raised its outlook, helping the shares soar 12.5 percent.
A stellar sales increase at Sanofi (PA:SASY)'s rare diseases Genzyme unit boosted the French drug maker's shares.
With ""short European equities"" cited as the most crowded trade globally for two consecutive months in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's (BAML) fund manager survey, it's clear many investors think negativity on the region may be close to a peak.
""Consensus suggests the region is significantly challenged, but it has performed better than many realize,"" said Graham Secker, head of European equity strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Europe's STOXX 600 has outperformed even the main emerging markets benchmark year-to-date.

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS
But this may not be reason enough to rejoice just yet.
It is a reflection, partly, of companies in Europe becoming more savvy with their guidance and managing expectations ahead of results.
Investors have thus been cautious about extrapolating this to a stronger underlying economy. There has however been a marked shift in the pressure points for companies.
China was mentioned as a positive driver much more than a negative, according to BAML strategists, a sign massive stimulus in the world's second biggest economy may have had an impact.
Luxury group LVMH said demand had picked up in mainland China, boosting its first-quarter sales and driving its shares up nearly 5 percent to a record high.
Britain's pending exit from the European Union and the U.S.-China trade war were also blamed less often for poor performance.
Another area of improvement has been the frequency of cuts to profit forecasts: so far this quarter has seen the fewest profit warnings at the start of earnings season in a year.
""The number of profit warnings (so far) is well below that of the past earnings seasons, which should be seen as a positive development,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at Tradition.
Graphic: Europe heads for strongest quarter in 2 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WpW51H
DELAYED GRATIFICATION
Companies across sectors have guided investors to a stronger second half.
Earnings growth expectations, having already fallen significantly, should stabilize at this level, said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""The bulk of the EPS downgrades is behind us and (we) expect earnings momentum to improve as we move into H2,"" he said.
After a blistering start to the year for global stocks, investors are finding it hard to make head or tail of a rally that caught many by surprise as they recovered from a harsh sell-off late last year.
Mixed economic signals do not help paint a clearer picture.
Stronger earnings from industrial companies fly in the face of data points like euro zone industry sentiment, which fell for a fifth consecutive month in March and was well below market expectations.
But better reports from the companies most sensitive to growth could be an early sign of a pick-up in activity.
""The recession might have been priced out but the recovery has not yet been priced in,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Still, Milligan stopped short of outright positivity on Europe, saying the possibility of an escalation in a trade dispute with the United States is part of his decision to stick with a neutral position in his global portfolio.
Politics aside, the holy grail for investors in Europe remains economic improvement - and that could still be a while away.
""Is Europe going to be a top pick? Only if we start to see some very definite signs that the European economy is turning and turning up very sizeably. We're just not seeing that,"" added Milligan.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Apollo Global to switch from a partnership to a corporation,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC, a manager of alternative assets such as private equity and corporate credit, said on Thursday it would convert from a partnership to a corporation, in a bid to get more investors into its stock.
Apollo is hoping the move, which will take effect in the third quarter of the year, will boost its share price, which has traded at a discount to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) for close to a decade.
Peers KKR & Co Inc and Ares Management Corp announced last year they would also make the switch. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, said last month it would convert from a partnership to a corporation. 
Under the so-called C-Corp structure, Apollo will pay corporate taxes on all its revenue, in exchange for enabling investors such as mutual funds and index trackers to buy the stock.
The additional tax burden has become less severe after the headline U.S. corporate tax rate was lowered effective last year to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Passive investors such as mutual funds, which are becoming more important as they manage more money, are restricted by their mandates from acquiring the stock of publicly listed partnerships.
Private equity firms pay corporate taxes under the partnership structure on the management fees charged to investors, but are mostly shielded from paying these taxes on performance fees.
Apollo said the expanded investor base was worth the tax hit.
""We believe (this) will simplify our structure and enable a much broader set of shareholders to participate in the exceptional long-term growth and profitability that we have been delivering to our investors,"" Apollo CEO Leon Black said a statement.
Apollo also announced first-quarter earnings on Thursday, reporting distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - of $207.4 million in the first quarter, up from $188.6 million a year earlier.
This translated to distributable earnings per share of 50 cents, lower than the 56 cents analysts had predicted on average based on Refinitiv data.
Nevertheless, the announcement of the switch to a corporation sent Apollo shares surging about 5 percent in premarket trading to $34.42.
Fee-related earnings, the amount Apollo earns from management fees, were up 58 percent year-on-year at $209.8 million.

Chairman Jerome Powell told his regular press conference that he and his colleagues saw no immediate need to cut interest rates, despite the high-volume fretting about the weakness of some of the components in last week’s first-quarter GDP report. The Fed’s – and the market’s – concerns may have been relieved a little by ADP’s report of a 275,000 rise in private-sector payrolls last month, something that bodes well for the official labor market report on Friday.

The morning’s biggest loser may be ticketing startup Eventbrite (NYSE:EB), which slumped 30% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after reporting a wider-than-expected loss and slower sales growth, due to problems integrating the recently acquired Ticketfly.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS Group had to go to court in France to fight charges that the Swiss bank helped wealthy clients dodge taxes because it was unable to strike a reasonable settlement, Chairman Axel Weber told shareholders on Thursday.
A French court in February found UBS guilty of illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, ordering it to pay 4.5 billion euros ($5.05 billion) in penalties. UBS denies the charges and is appealing against the ruling it has called ""incomprehensible.""
The case has led to a revolt by shareholders, who could withhold formal approval of the performance of the board and senior management. This would leave the leadership more exposed to potential lawsuits from shareholders.
""In the past, we were able to resolve legal cases quickly and on acceptable terms, including by reaching settlements,"" Weber told the bank's annual shareholder meeting. ""In the case of France, unfortunately, there was no acceptable way to settle out of court. Therefore, also in the interests of our shareholders, we had no choice but to go to court.""
Shareholders usually approve managements' performance for the previous financial year but unease over the French legal strategy and high pay at Switzerland's biggest bank could pose problems at Thursday's meeting.
Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services last month said shareholders should not sign off on the bank leadership's performance.
Another shareholder advisory service, Ethos Foundation, recommended UBS shareholders reject all of the Swiss bank's executive and board pay proposals, including binding votes on bonuses and pay packages.
Adviser Glass Lewis has also expressed objections to UBS's pay proposal, citing ""pay-for-performance concern"", and recommended shareholders abstain on the discharge question. 
A significant showing of shareholder opposition to the board's and management's actions would be a blow to Weber and Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, who boosted provisions to cover the French case but still expect the verdict to be reversed.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will issue $3 billion to $5 billion in new international sukuk, or Islamic bonds, around the third quarter as part of plans to diversify financing of the national budget deficit, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters.
Riyadh began issuing debt in international markets in 2016 after its finances were snagged by lower global oil prices. It has since become one of the biggest emerging markets issuers, having sold nearly $60 billion in international bonds, including $11 billion in sukuk.
At the end of 2018, it also had more than $80 billion in outstanding domestic debt, borrowed through conventional and Islamic bonds, which bypass a religious prohibition on interest.
Fahad al-Saif, who heads the kingdom's debt management office (DMO), said in an interview that about 40 percent of the $31.5 billion in debt planned for this year had been issued in the first quarter.
""At the end of quarter one, we have reached 55 percent local, 45 percent international. We believe that the ratios will be more skewed towards the local (debt issues) by the end of this year..."" he said late on Wednesday.
International sukuk are planned for the third quarter ""subject to timing, pricing, market conditions and obviously demand and supply,"" Saif added.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and the largest Arab economy, issued its latest international bond in January, raising $7.5 billion out of over $25 billion in demand.
Many saw that deal, the kingdom's first dollar issue since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October, as a vote of market confidence after the killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul tarnished Riyadh’s reputation.
OTHER CURRENCIES
The Saudi finance minister said last week that Riyadh might issue euro-denominated bonds this year depending on market conditions, and is considering debt in other currencies such as the yuan.
Saif told Reuters that the DMO was focused mostly on Saudi riyals, dollars and possibly euros.
""Certain markets that we are paying attention to at the moment, do we have them as strict plans? Not yet. Are we discussing them as part of our medium term debt strategy? Yes.""
The DMO is also considering in the medium term raising financing backed by foreign export credit agencies, which offer loan guarantees and sometimes financing to encourage trade and lower the costs of international business.
But more than a year after requesting proposals from banks, the plans remain at an early stage.
""There is no strict timeline. We are in discussions. We are getting ourselves into the terminologies and the jargons of the ECA financing type. We are trying to match what is the right project versus the right financing to be tapped into...,"" he said.
State oil giant Saudi Aramco received more than $100 billion in orders last month for its debut bond - even after its prospectus said the kingdom would not guarantee the notes - but chose to sell only $12 billion.
Last week the Saudi energy minister said Aramco would remain active in debt markets, raising the prospect of potential impacts on Saudi Arabia's debt-to-GDP ratio and its sovereign credit rating.

Saif dismissed those concerns, saying: ""The ample demand that Aramco has received proves that there is a quite decent appetite to the kingdom in fact beyond anyone’s expectations.""

Campaigners from student activist network People & Planet waved banners reading 'Fossil Banks-No Thanks', days after environmental group Extinction Rebellion paralyzed parts of the British capital in protests against the impact of climate change.
Several protesters were dragged away from the venue at the QEII conference center in Westminster by police and security staff.
Barclays provided the most financing among European banks for fossil fuel-related projects in 2018 and the sixth highest among lenders worldwide, according to a report by campaigning organization BankTrack.
Activists' efforts in recent years to pressure banks to stop funding such projects have been bolstered by increasing support from big bank shareholders.
Investment management firms including Hermes, Edentree and Boston Common on Wednesday wrote to the bank's Chief Executive Jes Staley urging him to stop funding companies involved in coal mining or oil sands exploitation.
The protest played out just before Barclays' senior executives faced a showdown with an activist of another kind, with rebel investor Edward Bramson seeking to pass a resolution that would install him on the bank's board.
New York-based Bramson, who is expected to fail in his bid, has been sparring with Barclays for months over his plans to shrink the lender's investment bank to improve returns.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged lower by 0920 GMT with Germany's DAX outperforming as major markets returned from the May Day holiday, except for London's FTSE 100, which was trading flat. 
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed the doves after the central bank's Wednesday meeting, signaling little appetite to adjust interest rates anytime soon.
""Investors see the need to recalibrate their expectations because the chair said there was no greater bias for a cut or a raise in the near term,"" said Ken Odeluga analyst at City Index. 
""That was interpreted as somewhat more hawkish than expected given that the market has been pricing in a reduction perhaps as early as this year."" 
Later on Thursday, the Bank of England will also decide on rates. No change is likely; investors will be looking for a better picture of the UK economy and clues on Brexit preparations.
The basic resources sector dropped about 1 percent after copper prices fell to their lowest in more than two months, while the retail sector was weighed down by online-only fashion retailer, Zalando, which plans to charge delivery fees for small orders in more markets.
German fashion house Hugo Boss also slipped after reporting a fall in first-quarter earnings.
Andritz was among the biggest decliners on STOXX 600 after the company cut its full-year profit forecast, partly in response to weak car industry demand that hit its metals business.
Helping temper those losses, auto stocks jumped over 1 percent boosted by German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) which shrugged off a 1 billion euro legal charge and met first-quarter operating profit forecasts.
GROWTH PANGS
The bank sub-index reversed course to shed earlier losses and turn positive with French lender  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) providing the biggest boost after its first-quarter net profits beat expectations. 
Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) however, fell after giving up hope of a profit-boosting rise in interest rates before 2020. Dutch bank  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) also slid after reporting a 6.1 pct decline in first-quarter profits.
Shares in Swiss toilet and plumbing supplies maker Geberit vaulted to the top of STOXX after first-quarter earnings beat expectations.

A 1-0 away victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the first match of a two-game semi-final sees Ajax favored by bookmakers to reach its first UEFA Champions League final since 1996.
In Amsterdam’s first trading session since Tuesday’s game, the stock gained as much as 6.6 percent to 20.9 euros, extending its advance in the past year to 90 percent. Dutch markets were closed for a holiday on Wednesday.
Having earned 91.9 million euros ($103 million) of adjusted revenue in 2018 versus Tottenham’s 381 million pounds ($497 million), Ajax went into the tie as comparative paupers. But the club’s faith in youth paid off once again as 22-year-old academy graduate Donny van de Beek scored the only goal during a first half that Ajax dominated.
Seven of the 22 players that started the game graduated from Ajax’s youth academy, including three -- Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Christian Eriksen -- who wore Tottenham shirts. With captain Harry Kane watching from the stands due to injury, the home team didn’t have any of their own youth products on display.
By the standards of England’s Premier League, Tottenham are by no means big spenders on players, focusing instead on funding their new 1 billion-pound 62,000-seat stadium. That said, the London club’s 185 million-pound outlay on players since the 2016/2017 season, according to the transfer statistics website transfermarkt.co.uk, is about 1.8 times that paid out by Ajax during the same period.
The second leg of the tie will be played in Amsterdam on Wednesday, May 8, with the winners meeting either Barcelona or Liverpool in the final. The Catalan club has the advantage over last year’s runners-up after a 3-0 win in Barcelona on Wednesday.
This year’s finalists will each receive an extra 15 million euros in prize money, with the winner taking home an added 4 million euros.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar nursed overnight gains while Europe's share markets struggled early on, after the U.S. central bank dampened bets that it might be readying its first interest rate cut in years. 
Oil and metals markets added to the pressure on stocks on Thursday with traders sending copper to a 2-month low and using news of record U.S. oil production to cash in some of Brent crude's near 33 percent rise this year.
Europe's basic resource stocks led the downward shift in equities with a 1.4 percent drop to their lowest since late March. Continental Europe was also trying to get back up to speed having been shut for holidays on Wednesday. (EU)
There was the Fed’s signals too. For all the intense political pressure to ease policy and the mixed growth/inflation data, the U.S. central bank held the line on Wednesday and refused to signal anything other than it was still on pause.
The dollar index drifted around 97.600 against its set of major currency peers after going as high as 97.728 and hovering around $1.1211 to the euro and $1.30 to Britain's pound with the Bank of England set to keep its rates on hold later.
Although the Fed made the predicted 5 basis point cut to the interest it pays on banks’ excess reserves – a technical move to ease money market tightness as it runs down its balance sheet - chairman Jerome Powell was unwavering on the rate outlook and said the recent relapse in inflation rates was likely temporary.
""The market has gotten perhaps ahead of itself in quite confidently pricing in (U.S) interest rate cuts,"" said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets.
""Powell was quite dismissive of the latest downturn in inflation... which I think has caused the market to reassess that a little bit.""
Core European government bond yields also shuffled higher, tracking the rise in U.S. Treasuries after the Fed's message.
TRADE HOPES 
Asia trading had been thinned by holidays in Japan and China but Hong Kong and Korea's stocks gained after CNBC reported the U.S. and China could announce a long-awaited trade deal by May 10, as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He heads to Washington.
Though now expected by markets if confirmed, it would remove significant uncertainty that has weighed on markets and global data for a year now. 
""I would still expect some relief rally once the deal gets done. The question is how big that move might be,"" State Street GM's Metcalfe added.
Elsewhere Turkey's lira remained under pressure near the 6 per dollar mark after data there had showed manufacturing activity contracting for the 13th month in a row. Euro zone factory activity also contracted for a third straight month. 
""Demand shortages were again evident in the Turkish manufacturing sector in April, while currency weakness led to inflationary pressures building again,"" said Andrew Harker, associate director of IHS Markit. 
In commodities markets, the drop in oil prices came after U.S. crude production output set a new record, though the losses were capped by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. [O/R] 

U.S. crude was last off 27 cents at $63.32 a barrel while Brent slipped 33 cents to $71.86. Copper was at a two month low after a heavy tumble on Wednesday, while spot gold was marginally weaker at $1,271.55 an ounce.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are all markedly lower after early trading on Thursday, reacting negatively to the Federal Reserve’s refusal to be any more accommodative with its monetary policy despite a sustained period of relatively weak global growth.
Most of Europe’s markets are reopening after a holiday on Wednesday, against a backdrop of purchasing manager indexes still near six year lows, confirming that Eurozone manufacturing contracted again in April.
Meanwhile, the barrage of first-quarter earnings from across the continent has had as many disappointments as positive surprises.
At 04:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.4% at 389.66. It’s risen over 16% from its trough at the end of last year, with only two modest pull-backs on the way, and is now above fund managers’ average forecast for the end of 2019. That makes for a tough environment for bulls in the near term.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 0.2%, due in part to the pound finding a bid in the foreign exchange markets again. Germany’s DAX was the best-performer of the bunch, holding the line from Tuesday's close.
The morning’s stand-out winners include two big heavyweights whose quarterly reports weren’t as bad as expected. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose over 3% as a strong performance at its core VW brand took the sting out of an 8% drop in operating profit. The group also booked another 1 billion euros in reserves to cover the costs of the 2015 diesel scandal.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), meanwhile, rose 2.5% despite following  BP  (LON:BP) in reporting lower profit for the quarter, thanks to lower crude prices and tighter margins in its refining and marketing businesses. Earnings on a current cost of supply basis slipped by some 2% from last year, but were still some 15% above forecasts.
Other winners, in more than one sense, included soccer club AFC Ajax (AS:AJAX), up 4.6% after an away win at Tottenham left it with one foot in the final of the UEFA Champions League. The shares have now doubled in the past 16 months.

Shell gives a strong ending to an otherwise mixed Big Oil earnings season, which showed companies mostly recovering from a worst-in-a-generation downturn but unable to fully insulate themselves against volatile markets. While  BP  (LON:BP) Plc,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) mostly hit their earnings targets on a mixture of rising output and cost cuts,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). suffered a “shocker” due to its worst refining performance in nearly 20 years.
“Shell has made a strong start to 2019,” Chief Executive Officer Ben Van Beurden said in a statement on Thursday. “The consistent financial performance across all our businesses provides confidence in meeting our 2020 outlook.”
The Anglo-Dutch company said adjusted net income was $5.3 billion in the first quarter, well ahead of the average analyst estimate of $4.52 billion. That’s 2 percent down from a year earlier, reflecting weaker refining margins and lower crude prices.
Shell is far more focused on natural gas than its peers, accounting for about 25 percent of all the world’s traded liquefied natural gas volumes annually. The unit’s profit of $2.57 billion was 24 percent higher than analysts’ estimates, the largest outperformance of any unit.
Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital movements and the effect of accounting-rule changes, rose to $11.3 billion from $10.4 billion a year earlier. Total oil and gas output decreased 2 percent to 3.752 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
In the quarter, Shell started up the production vessel offshore Brazil called Lula North and shipped some of its first cargoes from the Prelude LNG project in Australia.
Shell replaced only half its reserves last year, prompting questions about whether the company will use acquisitions to bulk up its portfolio. In January, Van Beurden said the company’s portfolio in the prolific Permian shale basin was “a bit small,” leading to speculation about an acquisition there.
Despite talks with Endeavor Energy Resources LP earlier this year, Shell so far hasn’t jumped into the region’s growing deals frenzy that has culminated recently in the fight between Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). over Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
Investors are also keeping a close eye on details of share buybacks. Shell is now in the third tranche of its planned repurchase of $25 billion of stock before 2021. The company has bought back $6.75 billion of shares so far, and will repurchase as much as $2.75 billion in addition by July 29.

The bank posted a pretax profit of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) for the first quarter. This is lower than a consensus of 1.88 billion pounds compiled by the bank, which said it was due to one-off items including a break fee for moving some wealth funds out of  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen.
“While Brexit uncertainty persists and continued uncertainty could further impact the economy, given the current strong performance, we are reaffirming all of our financial targets,” Lloyds said in its quarterly earnings statement.
British banks are trying to stick to their growth plans as the uncertainty of Brexit looms. Unlike its peers, Lloyds has so far refrained from setting aside a specific provision to cover a deteriorating economy. Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc said last week that Britain’s patchy growth was likely to bite into income over the coming months.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc’s U.K. retail division posted weaker quarterly revenues.
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio has been cutting costs since taking the top job almost eight years ago, reducing the cost-to-income ratio to 44.7 percent in the latest quarter, improving from 49.3 percent at the end of last year. The London-based bank, which has almost all its assets in the U.K., is targeting costs of around 40 percent of its income at the end of 2020, which would make it one of the most efficient European lenders.
Lloyds is looking to diversify its revenue streams, particularly in wealth and insurance. Last year it awarded  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Plc and BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). a mandate to oversee about 109 billion pounds, aiming “to create a market-leading wealth management proposition.” However, the company on Wednesday flagged break fees to move the funds, contributing to a 339 million-pound charge.
The bank also has bills left to pay for its past misconduct. Lloyds posted a further 100 million-pound provision for customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance, as the long-running compensation program draws to a close in August. The scandal hit many U.K. banks, but Lloyds’ running total of 19.4 billion pounds by the end of 2018 makes it the biggest spender."
1371,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 01:31AM ET</span>","No, Stocks Don't Rally on Friday, in January, or at Month's End","(Bloomberg) -- Can you position yourself to snag better returns simply by owning stocks on Fridays? How about month’s end? Or around holidays, when investors might be jubilant headed into a long weekend? The answer, according to a study: maybe 60 years ago, but not anymore.
Equity returns around different days of the week or when the calendar flips are no better than any other times, according to research in the North American Journal of Economics and Finance, which analyzed calendar anomalies for the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1900 and 2018.
It used to be, some of this stuff worked. For six decades ending in the 1980s, for instance, Mondays posted reliably worse returns than other days, for example, and average returns on the day before a holiday tended to be higher for much of the century. But efficient markets prevailed and now all the fun ripples are history, according to the report.
The “‘golden age’ of calendar anomalies was in the middle of the 20th century,” wrote the group of researchers led by Alex Plastun, an economics professor at Sumy State University in Ukraine. Alas, they found, they’ve largely disappeared since the 1980s.
Though the authors ran their own analysis, they also combed through dozens of previous studies -- some conducted on a variety of indexes and through different time periods -- as reference points. For example, an examination of indexes in 19 countries from 1988 to 2000 -- which found that nearly 90 percent of monthly returns were made in the four-day turn of the month -- was compared with another stating end-of-month returns in the U.S. exceeded those of the entire month. What the researchers ultimately found is that these effects started to fade and eventually vanished in the 2000s.
Similarly, average results on the last trading day before a holiday tended to be much higher between 1900 and the end of the 1970s. But, the holiday effect has been absent from U.S. markets since then.
“The results of this study provide convincing evidence that the U.S. stock market evolved from being inefficient with a number of calendar anomalies, to being efficient such that it is impossible to find ‘holes’ in price dynamics that can generate exploitable profits,” the authors write.
But the same group subsequently explored what they called the “Halloween effect,” whereby investors adopted the sell-in-May stance and held cash until November in an attempt to avoid lower-than-average returns. The authors found that the phenomenon is real and present, with differences between November to April returns, compared with those from May to October, becoming more pronounced starting in the 1960s, though abating more recently. Even so, the effect can provide opportunities to build market-beating strategies, they said.
An analysis of S&P 500 returns over the last 90 years, broken up by those specific time periods, confirms that finding, according to the Bespoke Investment Group. While the market doesn’t typically go down during the six-month period that runs from May through October, returns are significantly worse than they are during the November through April period, Justin Walter, co-founder and managing partner at Bespoke, wrote in a recent note.
“Going all the way back to 1928, had you only owned the index from November through April each year, you’d be up 4,662%,” he wrote. “Had you only owned from May through October, you’d be up a measly 185%.”

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PG&E Corp on Wednesday sought court approval for a $105 million fund to help house victims of the wildfires blamed on the bankrupt California power provider.
PG&E in a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco said the fund would cover housing and other urgent needs for many who lost homes in the wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
The biggest of the blazes, last year's Camp Fire, killed more than 80 people and destroyed more than 14,600 housing units, with more than 11,300 lost in the town Paradise, according the California's Department of Finance.
The department said in a report on Wednesday the Camp Fire displaced 83 percent of Paradise's population, contributing to an increase of more than 19,000 people in the population of nearby Chico, which marked the largest numeric population change of any California city last year.
PG&E said its Wildfire Assistance Program was intended for wildfire victims who did not have insurance for their homes or whose insurance for alternate living expenses will be exhausted.
The investor-owned power provider filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of potentially billions of dollars in liabilities stemming from wildfires in California linked to or suspected to be linked to its equipment.
San Francisco-based PG&E in its filing said it believes it is probable that authorities will find its equipment sparked November's Camp Fire, California's most destructive and deadliest fire of modern times.
PG&E said it will enter into discussions with committees representing unsecured creditors and wildfire victims in its bankruptcy to find an administrator for its proposed fund as soon as possible.
If no agreement on an administrator is reached, PG&E said it would ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali to let it appoint one.

PG&E will ask Montali at a May 22 hearing to give it the green light to establish its proposed fund.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell played down recent weakness in U.S. inflation, which retreated further from the Fed’s 2% target, as possibly “transitory.” Powell told reporters that the policy stance is “appropriate right now” and “we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.”

1374,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 09:18PM ET</span>",Amazon dismisses idea automation will eliminate all its warehouse jobs soon,"By Nandita Bose
BALTIMORE (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dismissed the idea of running a fully automated warehouse in the near future, citing the superior cognitive ability of humans and limitations of current technology. 
Scott Anderson, director of Amazon Robotics Fulfillment, said technology is at least 10 years away from fully automating the processing of a single order picked by a worker inside a warehouse. 
There is a misperception that Amazon will run fully automated warehouses soon, Anderson said during a tour of Amazon's Baltimore warehouse for reporters on Tuesday. 
The technology for a robot to pick a single product from a bin without damaging other products or picking multiple products at the same time in a way that could benefit the e-commerce retailer is years away. 
Amazon is exploring a variety of technologies to automate the various steps needed to get a package to shoppers, Anderson said. 
""In the current form, the technology is very limited. The technology is very far from the fully automated workstation that we would need,"" Anderson said.
The tour came at a time when the company has come under fire from labor groups and other Amazon critics for allegedly poor working conditions in its warehouses and for increasingly automating jobs and reducing its dependence on human labor.
The largest online retailer is also not employing robots in its warehouses that handle fresh food, said Derek Jones, global director of environment, health and safety, who oversees Amazon's fresh food offerings like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry.
""Just imagine if you want bananas. I want my bananas to be firm, others like their bananas to be ripe. How do you get a robot to choose that?"" he said. 
Amazon runs 110 warehouses in the United States, 45 sorting centers and about 50 delivery stations. It employs 125,000 full-time warehouse workers in the country.
The warehouses that employ robots mostly handle general merchandise, which includes everything from lamps and clothing to kayaks and bikes.
The company said it is not changing the level of productivity at its warehouses to catch up with its recent one-day shipping announcement. It is instead making changes to the transportation and delivery process. 
Last month, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club, Prime, in just one day instead of two.
Anderson said Amazon's current target is four hours from the time a product is ordered to the time it leaves the warehouse, and the company is sticking with that.
The e-commerce company did not share details on how the decision to raise its minimum wage to $15 had impacted workforce turnover.
However, it said applications for seasonal jobs doubled to 850,000 at the end of October last year from the record number of applications the company received in August 2017, when it held a national job fair.
Amazon raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees in November, giving in to critics of what they said was poor pay and working conditions.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 06:50PM ET</span>","As records fall on Wall Street, investors seek bets on economic growth","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the bull market gets a new lease on life, Wall Street is growing less fretful of a U.S. growth slowdown and betting on shares of companies in sectors that will benefit from the economic up-cycle, such as industrials and financials.
After tumbling nearly 20% from its peak at the end of 2018, the S&P 500 has rebounded strongly this year as U.S. economic data remain robust and the Federal Reserve has indicated a pause in interest-rate hikes. Last week's U.S. gross domestic product reading, which put first-quarter growth at a 3.2% annualized rate, further bolstered economic sentiment.
Accordingly, fears of a stock market meltdown have given way to talk of a possible melt-up. The S&P 500 has notched record highs in the past three trading sessions.
As a result, shares of companies in cyclical sectors and industries - those whose fortunes ebb and flow in tandem with the economy - have grown more attractive. Indeed, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 this year.
Industrials are well placed to continue their ascent, especially if the United States and China reach a trade agreement as anticipated, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. Last year's trade tensions greatly contributed to the economic worries at the end of last year, he said.
""Part of the reason for the slowdown has been trade,"" he said. ""You're likely to see a rebound in demand for products from industrial companies as you see a pickup in the economy.""
Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, has grown bullish on homebuilders, which are positioned within the consumer discretionary sector. The industry is likely to benefit from low unemployment and low inflation, he said.
Indeed, as mortgage rates have eased from their levels late last year, shares of housing-related companies have risen. The PHLX Housing Index has climbed 29.3% this year, ahead of the S&P 500.
Another cyclical sector, financials, has not had the same resurgence as industrials this year, but some investors believe that economic conditions could soon boost those shares as well.
In March, a brief inversion of the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes, considered a sign of an impending recession, alarmed investors. The curve has steepened since then and yields have ticked up as U.S. economic data have remained largely upbeat.
The recent uptick in Treasury yields suggests that the global economy is still expanding, which would help shares of U.S. banks, said Helfert of Westwood Holdings Group.
""U.S. banks have corrected much faster in terms of balance sheet size than European banks, and yields will likely continue to climb on the prospect of higher growth,"" he said.
If the yield curve were to steepen further, it would particularly benefit shares of small-cap banks, given their reliance on lending as a source of revenue, said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.
""Until recently, they couldn't make money doing that,"" he said. ""Some weight has been taken off the sector with the steepening yield curve.""
MORE ROOM TO RUN
As investors bet on strong returns in cyclical sectors, they are also confident that U.S. stocks at large will continue their run.
That run could be extended, some believe, as investors who remain on the sidelines put more money into stocks. Despite this year's gains, investors have largely poured money into bond funds at the expense of equity funds.
U.S.-based equity mutual funds posted $3.64 billion of cash withdrawals in the week ended April 24, extending their weekly outflows since mid-February, according to Lipper. Conversely, bond funds, which include taxable and municipal debt funds, brought in a net $8.8 billion last week to continue a streak of positive inflows over every full week of the year to date.
That trend could soon reverse as the strengthening economy increases investors' appetite for riskier assets, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) chief executive Larry Fink told Reuters in a recent interview.

""I think we have the economic tailwinds to say we're going to probably break through,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. ""To the extent the economy does grow at a higher rate the rest of the year, that's going to broaden the rally out.""

1376,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 06:15PM ET</span>",U.S. House panel will hold May 15 hearing on grounded Boeing 737 MAX,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will hold a May 15 hearing on the grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX and the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) aircraft certification program, three people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.
The committee said the hearing to be held by its aviation subcommittee will be on the ""status of the Boeing 737 MAX."" The committee did not disclose the witnesses.
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the panel, told reporters on Tuesday he planned to hold a hearing on the Boeing 737 MAX and the certification process in the near future.
The hearing is expected to include Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell, National Transportation Safety Board chairman Robert Sumwalt and Earl Lawrence, who was named executive director of the FAA's Aircraft Certification Service in 2018, sources told Reuters.
The FAA plans a May 23 meeting with top civil aviation officials from around the world to discuss the 737 MAX. 
On Wednesday, FAA officials held a briefing with members of the committee and staff on how the certification process works. Representative Rick Larsen, a Democrat who chairs the aviation subcommittee, told Reuters he expects the FAA will not unground the planes without the backing of international regulators.
""I don't think there's a chance the FAA moves without the international community,"" Larsen said. 
Last month, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao named a panel of experts to a blue-ribbon committee to review the aircraft certification process after deadly Boeing 737 MAX crashes in October and March killed nearly 350 people. The MAX fleet was grounded March 13.
""346 people died in two separate crashes. There ought to be a lot of pressure on Boeing and the FAA to get this right,"" Larsen said.
In a March 28 memo to Elwell reviewed by Reuters, Chao said she wanted an ""action plan"" from the FAA ""to reassure congressional oversight committees that the FAA's culture of safety remains not only robust but forward-looking"" and to restore ""public trust in aviation safety.""
She also asked what ""measures are needed to reinforce the culture of safety and constantly improve the FAA's oversight functions and offices, including the certification process.""
The FAA has for decades delegated some certification duties to Boeing and other manufacturers.
Separately, Senate Commerce Committee chairman Roger Wicker told Reuters on Wednesday he still plans to call Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg to testify at a future date. ""I think he'll want to,"" Wicker said.
Boeing declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors, the Transportation Department’s inspector general and lawmakers are investigating the FAA’s certification of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft.
A joint review by 10 governmental air regulators of the MAX's certification started on Monday in Seattle. Sumwalt said in March the NTSB was also examining the certification process ""to ensure any deficiencies are captured and addressed.""
Boeing has told some 737 MAX owners it is targeting U.S. FAA approval of its software fix as early as late May and the ungrounding of the aircraft around mid-July, two sources told Reuters last month. Boeing has not yet formally submitted the software fix to the FAA for approval.

U.S. carriers have canceled flights because of the 737 MAX grounding through early August.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 06:08PM ET</span>",Apple's upbeat forecast pushes market value back toward $1 trillion,"By Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose nearly 5 percent on Wednesday, pushing the iPhone maker's market valuation back toward $1 trillion as its quarterly report and upbeat forecast soothed investors worried about falling iPhone sales.
Apple has been jockeying with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for the title of most valuable U.S. company as all three have passed the symbolic trillion mark.
The Cupertino, California, company first breached a trillion-dollar valuation in August last year. But it fell back as signs emerged of weak demand for its newest iPhones, especially in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
Apple's shares ended 4.91% higher on Wednesday, valuing it at around $969 billion, based on shares outstanding as of April 22.
That left its stock market value ahead of Amazon and just behind Microsoft, with a market capitalization of $980 billion.
Though iPhone sales dropped 17% in the fiscal second quarter, the company's services revenue beat Wall Street expectations and it forecast an upbeat third quarter.
Apple spent a record $24 billion on buybacks during the quarter. Its buybacks last year https://tmsnrt.rs/2vyr2oi topped $70 billion, or around five times its own spending on research and development. 
At least eight brokerages hiked their price targets on the stock following Apple's report, with Jefferies making the most aggressive move by raising its target by $50 to $210.
""Apple reported a clean March quarter and bullish June quarter outlook which against a backdrop of negative investor sentiment sets up for shares to move higher,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
Analysts said iPhone demand in China was getting better as Apple cut prices, upgraded its device financing program and benefited from improved trade dialogue between the United States and China.
Twenty-one analysts recommend buying Apple's stock, while 18 analysts are neutral and two recommend selling, according to Refinitiv data on Wednesday. Apple's overall favorability among analysts puts it in line with American International Group (NYSE:AIG) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa).

1378,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2019 05:50PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. More Jobs Numbers Ahead of Friday’s Payrolls
More employment numbers arrive tomorrow as the big April jobs report gets nearer.
At 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT), outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas releases its job cuts report for April.
At 8:30 AM ET, the Labor Department issues its weekly initial jobless claims figures. Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to drop to 220,000, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department will release its report on March factory orders at 10:00 AM ET. Economists, on average, are predicting that orders rebounded to rise 1% for the month.
2. Cigna, Shell to Report Results 
In sheer numbers, this is among the heaviest weeks of the earning season.
Among the most import reports due:
Cigna (NYSE:CI), one of the largest health-insurance companies, reports before the bell. Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the company to report earnings of $3.78 a share in the first quarter, down from $4.11 a year ago.
Revenue is forecast at $42.69 billion. That’s not comparable to a year ago because Cigna acquired pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) last year in a $67 billion deal. The shares are down 14.7% this year.
Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa), the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, is expected to report $1.11 per American Depositary Unit in the quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Revenue is forecast at $84.65 billion, down 5.1% from a year ago. The ADRs are up 7.6% this year, in part because of rising oil prices.
Broadcaster CBS (NYSE:CBS) is expected to report $1.39 a share postmarket, up from $1.34 a share a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Revenue is projected at $4.31 billion, up 14.6% from a year ago.
The shares are up nearly 17% this year. The company has contended with changes in broadcasting and intense management stress. In addition, the company and Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) are talking about combining again.
Also after the bell,  Tableau Software  (NYSE:DATA), which builds visualization software sold for desktops or on the cloud, is expected to report a loss of a cent a share in the first quarter on revenue of $287.25 million, according to analysts polled by Investing.com.
That would be up from a loss of 19 cents a share a year ago and up 32% from year-ago revenue of $217.85 million. The shares are off 0.6% this year but were up 73% in 2018.
3. Market Now Looking at December Rate Cut (Barely)
Investors expressed their post-Fed disappointment today, selling into the close as Fed Chief Jerome Powell poured cold water on expectations for a rate cut.
The FOMC kept rates steady in the range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
“We do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction,” Powell said during his news conference.
Now the market will be watching Treasuries and fed funds futures for hints of where longer-term monetary policy is heading. The market was pricing more than a 50% chance that a rate cut would come in September before the decision. But that has been pushed out until December, with a 54.5% chance rates are lower after that meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The 10-Year Treasury hovered around 2.5%, down slightly in late trading."
1379,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Tumbles as Powell Hurts Rate Cut Hopes,"Investing.com -- Stocks fell on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dealt a blow to hopes for a rate cut, prompting broad selling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61%, the S&P 500 lost 0.75%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.57%.
Powell said the central bank's current path of monetary policy was appropriate, cooling investor expectations that the central bank's next move on policy would be a rate cut rather than a hike.
“We do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction,” Powell said during a news conference after the central bank’s policy meeting this week.
Powell's remarks arrived after the Fed left its benchmark unchanged and signaled that its future policy decisions would continue to be led by incoming economic data, and investors hoping for an interest-rate cut reacted by selling heavily after 2:30 p.m. ET.
The sea of red across markets pushed tech stocks into negative territory despite a 4.9% rally in Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) raised guidance after Tuesday's close and delivered fiscal second-quarter results that topped estimates from Investing.com, as services growth and recovering iPhone sales underpinned performance.
Apple briefly had a market capitalization of $1.02 trillion, but the broad selling pushed the shares lower. So Apple's market cap dropped to $992.66 billion. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed on Tuesday with a market cap of $1 trillion, but the shares fell 2.1% on Wedneday, leaving the company with a market cap of $979.92 billion.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also racked up gains for the day, propping up semiconductor stocks on the back of stronger-than-expected first-quarter numbers.
In healthcare, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) raised guidance on full-year earnings to a range of $6.75 to $6.90, from its earlier forecast of $6.68 to $6.88, after first-quarter results topped estimates, sending shares more than 4% higher.
But there were some hiccups on the earnings front as Clorox (NYSE:CLX) reported lower-than-expected earnings amid rising competition, sending its share price sharply lower.
Still, the mostly upbeat earnings eased expectations of an earnings recession, with 75% of companies in the S&P 500 beating earnings estimates, according to FactSet.
On the economic front, investors digested mixed data as U.S. manufacturing activity slowed, but private sector job growth remained robust.
On the labor market front, private payrolls grew by 275,000 for last month, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and Moody's Analytics. That was the biggest monthly gain since last July and exceeded analysts' forecasts of a 180,000 increase.
The report comes days ahead of a crucial nonfarm payroll report due Friday.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 05:10PM ET</span>",Wall Street drops after Fed chair dampens rate-cut hopes,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Wednesday and the S&P 500 snapped a three-day streak of record high closes as comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appeared to dampen hopes the central bank could move later this year to cut interest rates.
In its policy announcement, the Fed held rates steady as expected and struck a cautious tone on inflation. But Powell, speaking following the Fed statement, said a decline in inflation this year could be due to transitory factors.
That seemed to throw cold water on views by some in the market that the Fed might make a preemptive bid to head off lower inflation or a recession by cutting rates.
As Powell spoke, traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures began trimming bets the Fed will cut rates before the end of the year. 
""The fact that he's basically saying 'we aren't closer to a cut then we were before' made the market sell off,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
Stocks had been higher for much of the session and the S&P 500 hit an intraday record early, driven by a jump in shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company late on Tuesday reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates despite a record drop in iPhone revenue. 
It also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and raised its cash dividend by 5%. Apple's stock ended up 4.9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 162.77 points, or 0.61%, to 26,430.14, the S&P 500 lost 22.1 points, or 0.75%, to 2,923.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 45.75 points, or 0.57%, to 8,049.64.
Selling was broad-based as nearly every S&P 500 sector ended the day lower.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 84 new highs and 52 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.44 billion shares, compared to the 6.61 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

BMW deliveries rose 1.4 percent in April, aided by the behemoth SUV’s second full month of sales. Through the first four months of the year, the brand has sold 3,584 more luxury vehicles than Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz, whose deliveries slumped 16 percent last month.
“We’re right where we want to be,” Bernhard Kuhnt, BMW of North America’s president, said in a statement. “Demand for the BMW X7 only continues to grow.”
For Mercedes, sales of C-Class and E-Class sedans slid, as did deliveries of the GLC and GLE SUVs that will be revamped later this year. Dietmar Exler, president of Mercedes’ U.S. sales unit, said in a statement that model changes and supply constraints dragged on results, and that availability should improve in the coming months.
Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus is the top gainer among the four largest luxury brands in the U.S., with sales rising 2.7 percent through April. The new UX compact crossover and ES sedan have been buffers as deliveries of almost all other models dipped.
Sales at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s Audi plunged 21 percent last month as the volume-leading Q5 SUV slumped. The brand’s deliveries have fallen three out of four months this year and were down 8.7 percent through April.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 04:24PM ET</span>",Republican senator says Trump will not waive U.S. shipping rules,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican U.S. senator on Wednesday said President Donald Trump will not waive rules requiring that only U.S.-flagged ships move natural gas from American ports to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Northeast.
The nearly 100-year-old Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport merchandise between U.S. coasts. Republican senators said the administration was seriously considering waiving the requirements for 10 years. Bloomberg News reported last week that Trump was leaning in favor of some kind of waiver.
Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters on a conference call that Trump told Republican lawmakers he would not support a waiver. The White House did not immediately comment.
Cassidy said Trump told them ""he was going to oppose any changes to the Jones Act and any waivers. That's what we went there hoping to get and that's what we did get."" He added that Trump gave his word to lawmakers, which included Republicans from Alaska and Mississippi as well.
A person briefed on the matter told Reuters Tuesday that administration officials were divided on the issue.
Senator John Kennedy, another Louisiana Republican, said in a statement the Jones Act supports 71,000 jobs in the state. ""After talking to President Trump, I am confident that he realizes how important the Jones Act is to Louisiana’s maritime industry and that no changes will be made,"" Kennedy said. ""It would be foolish to push aside those jobs in favor of foreign-made and foreign-crewed ships."" 
In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security waived the requirement for one week to allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels to ensure enough fuel reached emergency responders during Hurricane Irma and following Hurricane Harvey.

In February, leaders of the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure wrote to the DHS to oppose a request from Puerto Rico to waive the Jones Act for 10 years to allow foreign tankers to move liquid natural gas to the U.S. island territory.

The world's top oil exporter was hit hard by a slump in oil prices in 2014, leading to a budget deficit of 367 billion riyals, or about 15 percent of gross domestic product, in 2015.
Over the past few years it has embarked on a number of reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from its dependence on oil.
In the first three months of this year the kingdom's oil revenues totalled 169 billion riyals, a 48 percent increase from the same period last year, the ministry of finance said in a statement late on Wednesday.
Non-oil revenues - which give a measure of the country's economic diversification achievements - amounted to 76.3 billion riyals, a 46 percent increase year-on-year, the ministry said.
Expenditures totalled 217.6 billion riyals in the first quarter, an 8 percent year-on-year increase.
The kingdom said in December it planned to increase state spending by 7 percent this year in an effort to spur economic growth and projected spending to rise to an all-time high of 1.106 trillion riyals, from an actual 1.030 trillion riyals in 2018.
The government spent 10.3 billion riyals in subsidies in the first quarter, up from 3 billion in the same period last year, according to the statement.
""Expenditure outlays on development projects are expected to increase during the remainder of the year,"" the ministry of finance said, particularly for private sector development programmes and because of increases in expenditure on social protection.
Public debt totalled 610.6 billion riyals at the end of the first quarter.

Pritzker’s plan to stabilize the debt-ravaged finances of the worst-rated U.S. state.
The Senate voted Wednesday in favor of a constitutional amendment that would end the requirement that all taxpayers pay the same tax rate regardless of income. The bill now moves to the House of Representatives, where it needs to secure three-fifths approval before it can go before voters in the next general election in 2020. Changing the rates would provide an influx of revenue to help Illinois deal with the massive pension-fund shortfall and budget deficits that have left the state with a near junk-bond rating.
“This is the next step in a more than decades-long effort to modernize our tax code,’’ said Senator Don Harmon, a Democrat, before the vote, referring to the change as moving to a “fair tax.’’
Pritzker, a billionaire Democrat who took office in January, is pushing to usher in a progressive income tax like those already in place in a majority of states. The plan would bring in more than $3 billion of revenue annually, if the rates he’s pitched are enacted, according to administration estimates. That would help the state as it contends with chronic budget deficits, a shrinking population and escalating bills from a retirement employment system that has $134 billion less than it needs to cover all the benefits that have been promised.
Republicans, who are a minority in the legislature, opposed the measure.
“To solve our problems, we don’t need to raise tax rates,’’ Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, a Republican, said before the Senate vote. “What we need to do is create jobs.’’

1390,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 03:05PM ET</span>",Human hedge fund managers embrace robot-rival tools to amp returns,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - Traditional stock-pickers in the hedge fund world have been struggling to justify their expenses and weak returns in recent years, as low-cost algorithmic funds have done better. Now, human managers are starting to embrace the technologies employed by their robot rivals to improve results.
Prominent hedge fund managers, investors and consultants gathered at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills this week said the industry is increasingly turning to big-data analysis, machine learning and other types of artificial intelligence to research investments or build on ideas.
They insisted it is not a cost-cutting strategy to replace human managers. Rather, they are trying to improve performance with the help of technology.
""There is still a role for humans to figure out regime change and to figure out disruption, but those humans tend to do better when they are aided by quantitative tools,"" said John McCormick (NYSE:MKC), chief executive officer of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP's alternative asset management business.
Blackstone, the world's biggest investor in the $3.3 trillion hedge fund industry, has found that the most successful ones within the analog realm are those that compliment human talent with sophisticated technology, McCormick said.
That evolution was a key focus of hedge fund panels and a hot topic on the sidelines at the Milken event. Managers at firms including D.E. Shaw & Co and Citadel, plus big U.S. and global pension funds, said it is a watershed moment for the industry, driven by market trends that have put enormous pressure on active fund managers.
The number of publicly traded companies has declined to about 3,500 – roughly half the number from two decades ago – offering managers fewer options to find outsize returns.
Meanwhile, investors are balking at the high cost structures of hedge funds, which often charge a 2 percent fee plus 20 percent or more of gains, especially as low-cost, passive investments like index funds have produced better results.
The mood worsened last year, as stock-oriented hedge funds lost about 7 percent, compared with a 4 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.
""There are fewer tradable opportunities,"" said Eddie Fishman, chief operating officer at D.E. Shaw Group, a $50 billion hedge fund firm. ""People are not looking to add to long risky assets and there is such a pressure for uncorrelated returns.""
It is a much different dynamic than the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when investors were clamoring for access to exclusive funds. A host of once-prominent hedge fund firms including Eric Mindich's Eton Park and Richard Perry's Perry Capital are now calling it quits.
People are ""looking at the hedge fund industry as a giant poker table and asking themselves who is going to lose,"" said Ilana Weinstein, chief executive of the IDW Group which recruits employees for Wall Street's top hedge funds.
Other funds that focus on picking stocks, including Daniel Loeb's Third Point, are hoping that quantitative science can help improve performance.
But even as firms embrace new technologies, managers and investors said attracting and retaining top talent is still crucial. While compensation is a key motivator, is it no longer the only one. Younger recruits especially want to feel that they have a real career path with meaningful challenges, Milken attendees said.

The ""way to reduce the risk of firm failure is to attract other people,” said Blackstone's McCormick, “because no one has a monopoly on the right way to invest.""

SEATTLE/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Wednesday named a new senior adviser to Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and the board of directors as the world's largest planemaker faces its biggest crisis in years after two deadly crashes of its 737 MAX.
Crashes in Ethiopia in March and Indonesia in October have triggered the grounding of Boeing's fastest-selling plane, lawsuits, investigations and lingering concerns over the 737 MAX's safety.
The company named Michael Luttig, who has served as general counsel since joining the company in 2006, to the newly created position of counselor and senior adviser to Muilenburg and the Boeing board of directors. 
Luttig, who is often listed among the highest paid general counsels of publicly traded companies, will anchor Boeing's legal defense over the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. 
Boeing also said Brett Gerry, who has been president of Boeing Japan since 2016, is succeeding Luttig as general counsel. 
Both changes are effective immediately.
The two executives are expected to play a central role in Boeing's campaign to restore the trust of customers, passengers and regulators following the crashes.
Muilenburg survived calls to break up his three-pronged job as chairman, president and CEO at an annual shareholders' meeting on Monday.
Luttig was appointed at age 37 to the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, after working as assistant counsel to former President Ronald Reagan and as a law clerk to Antonin Scalia before he joined the U.S. Supreme Court. He also served as a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger.
Among those who served as clerk for Luttig were Ted Cruz, who is now a U.S. Senator from Texas, and Joel Kaplan, now Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's vice president of global public policy.
Gerry, who joined Boeing in 2008, formerly served as chief of staff to the attorney general and deputy assistant attorney general in the National Security Division at the U.S. Department of Justice, and in the White House as associate counsel to the president, Boeing said.
He also worked in private practice and as a law clerk at both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, the company said.

1395,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2019 01:33PM ET</span>","StockBeat - CVS Rallies on Earnings Beat, but Gloom Over Healthcare Stocks Remain","Investing.com - CVS rallied on Wednesday as its first-quarter earnings beat expectations and healthier full-year guidance suggested that the company is in better shape than expected.
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) raised guidance on full-year earnings to a range of $6.75 to $6.90, from its earlier forecast of $6.68 to $6.88. That sent its shares more than 6% higher.
Wall Street was bracing for a difficult quarter from CVS after the company warned in February that this year would be a transition amid rising costs and poor results from a nursing-home pharmacy unit.
But its recently acquired health insurance business boosted results and its pharmacies filled more expensive prescription drugs, helping the company deliver a beat on both the top and bottom lines. The company acquired Aetna (NYSE:AET) in a $68 billion deal that closed in November.
The company reported earnings of $1.62 on revenue of $61.65 billion, above estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $1.50 on revenue of $60.39 billion.
The upbeat results from CVS did little to prop up support for the broader healthcare sector, as sentiment has been soured by ongoing pressure from politicians, many of whom continued to push for measures to bring down drug costs. The Health Care Select Sector ETF (NYSE:XLV) was basically flat Wednesday and is up just 3.3% this year.
As the U.S. election campaign heats up in the months to come, analysts have warned that politicians will continue to bash health care companies, raising the prospect of further negative headline risk."
1396,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",Climate change has U.S. fund managers adjusting agriculture investments,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After historic floods devastated Midwestern agricultural states this spring, some fund managers are evaluating how climate change will affect the long-term value of companies that make or sell products ranging from tractors to fertilizer. 
The issue is not simply the unpredictability of weather. Instead, fund managers say, they are struggling to model how extreme weather events from droughts to more powerful storms will affect commodity prices and, in turn, spending by farmers on equipment or seeds. 
In November, the U.S. government published a report that found climate change will boost costs in industries including farming and energy production by increasing the frequency and severity of storms. The U.S.-China trade war has also clouded the outlook for U.S. farmers. 
Early estimates of crop and livestock losses from this year's floods are approaching $1 billion in Nebraska alone, and damages are expected to climb much higher for the region. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, has no way to compensate farmers for crops that were damaged when floods overtook their record-high stockpiles of grain.
""I just don't know how to value these companies now,"" said Christopher Terry, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital in Dallas. ""It's harder to invest around a theme when you're talking multi-decade impacts.""
More extreme weather in the Midwest, for instance, will boost the cost of grains for feed, which will cut margins of egg producers like Cal-Maine Foods Inc, he noted. Barge companies such as Kirby Corp that move commodities down the Mississippi River may have more days that operations are out of service because of flooding, he added.
Other fund managers said they were seeking agricultural companies that might actually benefit from more severe weather. 
Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, said he is focusing on midstream companies such as grains merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co and production companies like equipment maker Deere & Co that may benefit from greater volatility in commodity prices. ADM has a proven track record of hedging commodity bets, he said, while Deere may benefit if higher crop prices following extreme weather prompt farmers to invest in new machinery. 
""If you think the next 10 years will look like the last 10 years you are in a for a rude awakening,"" he said. 
LOOKING FOR WINNERS
Incorporating the impact of climate change on agricultural stock valuations is something Wall Street analysts from firms including William Blair, Wedbush and R.W. Baird have largely avoided because it is hard to predict the impact on any one quarter or season. Analysts at these firms follow companies ranging from  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) to retailer Tractor Supply Co 
""If weather conditions continue to have a more unforeseeable impact on agro business the best way to model this would be ... to increase the beta-factor within the discounted cash flow model used by me. And no, I have not yet done so,"" said Ulrich Huwald, an analyst who covers Bayer. 
Private research companies like Four Twenty Seven have stepped into that void by providing quarterly climate risk scores for specific companies that focus on the impact of climate change events ranging from wild fires to rising sea levels on supply chains, operations, and trading markets. 
Lucas White, a portfolio manager at GMO, runs one of the few actively managed mutual funds that target companies that may be significantly affected by climate change. While his fund has outsized positions in solar companies such as SolarEdge Technologies Inc and  First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR), he also focuses on potash and phosphate producers that may see increasing demand as more severe storms wash away soil nutrients. 
""Nobody knows what will happen with commodity prices and it's more or less impossible to predict,"" he said. ""But farmers spend all this time getting their soil to be very productive and all of a sudden a huge downpour comes and they have to start from scratch again. It's very difficult to produce agriculture in a world that is increasingly impacted by climate change.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Lucara Diamond Corp, which has recovered two of the largest diamonds in recent history, is turning to technology to ensure growth in an industry where new mine acquisitions remain elusive. 
For the Vancouver-based junior miner, that means using advanced technology like sorting based on atomic density to boost value from its Karowe mine in Botswana, and also diversifying away from mining into an online diamond sales platform. 
""Diamond mines are extremely rare... we haven't been able find the perfect asset, but we continue to look,"" Lucara Chief Executive Eira Thomas said in an interview. ""In the meantime, we thought it was important to establish a growth agenda."" 
While bigger companies like Anglo American's De Beers AK Alrosa PAO invest in advanced technologies, Lucara is ""by far the industry leader"" among the remaining smaller miners, said independent analyst Paul Zimnisky.
""Lucara has one depreciating and depleting asset, so they do need to look long term,"" Zimnisky said. ""They're carving out a unique niche for themselves.""
X-Ray transmission (XRT), which Lucara began using in 2015, enabled record diamond recoveries last year, including 33 stones over 100 carats. 
It measures ore's atomic density to identify diamonds early, allowing recoveries of larger stones, while traditional mining requires multiple crushing and concentration stages.
""Previously, we could see the diamonds were broken... but we had no idea what the value loss associated with that was,"" Thomas said. ""Did we break a 50-carat diamond or a bunch of 10-carat diamonds? We really couldn't tell."" 
When Lucara began production at Karowe in 2012,it estimated the diamonds would be worth $200 to $250 a carat, Thomas said. With the XRT technology, they've been worth as much as $600 per carat, she said. 
Last week, Lucara said it had recovered a 1,758-carat diamond, the biggest in recent history.
Lucara shares have gained 10 percent this year, outperforming most sector peers. 
The miner has also begun using its online sales platform Clara, doing four scheduled sales to eight manufacturers this year. 
Unlike traditional in-person tenders, where manufacturers bid on assortments of similar diamonds from producers, Clara allows manufacturers to place detailed orders. 
They are matched to stones in the system, with Lucara earning the difference between the bid and ask prices. 
Lucara's first sale in January generated revenue of $660,865, but the company didn't provide details of the other sales.
The company aims to sign up at least one producer this year, and will begin continuous sales once the system is fine-tuned, Thomas said.
Clara won't completely replace traditional tenders, which Lucara itself uses to sell diamonds under 1 carat and over 15 carats, Thomas said. The cost to scan smaller diamonds makes it uneconomical, and larger stones have too many potential outcomes, she said. 
Clara ""opens up our universe of customers, who, right now, have to fly to Botswana to buy our diamonds,"" Thomas said. ""We envisage a world where people buy diamonds from all over the world sitting at their desk.""

SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday said it was mandating new flight control software and parts to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 787 Dreamliner to address what it called an unsafe operating condition of certain products on the plane.
The FAA's new airworthiness directive was prompted by a finding that certain areas in the 787's tire and wheel ""threat zones"" could be susceptible to damage, resulting in the loss of braking and steering power on the ground at certain speeds.
The FAA said it requires installing hydraulic tubing, a pressure-operated check valve, and new flight control software.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",CVS Health raises full-year profit forecast on Aetna strength,"By Manas Mishra and Caroline Humer
(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) on Wednesday raised its full-year profit forecast and reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates due to growth in its Aetna (NYSE:AET) health insurance business, and as drug prices fell within its expectations. 
Shares rose more than 5 percent to $57.35. They had fallen 17 percent this year, hurt by a weak forecast in February and a cut to rival Walgreen Boots Alliance's full-year outlook last month due to lower generic drug prices. 
Aetna, CVS's health insurance unit, beat analysts' consensus by more than a billion dollars in the quarter, helped by its accounting for lower medical costs than anticipated during the fourth quarter. 
The company, which bought Aetna for $69 billion in November, said 2019 cost savings from the deal were tracking near the high end of its $300 million to $350 million range, and that 2020 savings would likely exceed its $750 million target. 
The company said a handful of new ""HealthHub"" pharmacies launched in Houston this year that provide healthcare services, such as chronic care management for diabetes, have drawn more customers than expected. It plans to launch more such stores in Houston and plans to provide details of a national roll-out next month.
""Consumerism in healthcare is here to stay,"" CVS Chief Executive Larry Menlo said. ""We are beginning to see this evolution through the HealthHubs. We are not just selling hundreds of products, it's a combination of products and services.""
Menlo also said the company would take part in a pilot project announced by the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand point-of-sale rebates to patients in Medicare plans. The government has also proposed a rule that would require health plans to pass on all rebates, but it is not clear if it will be finalized for 2020.
Sales in its health care benefits unit rose by $16.55 billion to $17.78 billion with the addition of Aetna to its operations. 
Sales of prescription drugs at its pharmacies were hurt as the company gets paid less for filling prescriptions. That was offset by higher volumes and higher prices of brand name drugs.
CVS in February had cautioned that rebate payments it guaranteed to customers were larger than what it has received from drugmakers due to lower-than-expected increases in drug prices.
""Considering that expectations have been low, we see this as the first positive catalyst that restores investor confidence in this management team,"" SVB Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said of the first-quarter profit and raised 2019 forecast. 
CVS said it now expects full-year adjusted profit of $6.75 to $6.90 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $6.68 to $6.88.
Overall sales at its retail unit, which also sells over-the-counter-drugs and consumer health products, rose 3.3 percent to $21.12 billion. 
The drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager said it earned $1.62 per share excluding items, beating analysts' average estimate by 12 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net income rose 42.4 percent to $1.42 billion in the first quarter. Revenue rose 34.8 percent to $61.65 billion.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 10:48AM ET</span>",GSK expects shingles drug sales to exceed $1.3 billion after 'fantastic' quarter,"By Ankur Banerjee and Pushkala Aripaka
(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline forecast 2019 sales of its fast-growing shingles vaccine Shingrix to be ""significantly"" more than 1 billion pounds ($1.31 billion) on Wednesday as a drop in the British drugmaker's free cash flow weighed on its shares.
Shingrix, launched in 2017, is an important source of growth for Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, as she strives to improve GSK's commercial performance after streamlining its operations and spinning off or selling units. 
""Shingrix has delivered another fantastic performance in the quarter,"" Walmsley said on a media call. 
The strength in its vaccines unit, whose sales rose 20 percent in the quarter to the end of March, comes at a time when some of GSK's major drugs face generic competition. 
Walmsley, who took over as CEO of GSK in 2017, has been looking to re-energize the drugmaker's pharmaceutical business, its biggest unit, buying U.S. cancer specialist Tesaro for $5.1 billion and giving it a presence in the oncology market. 
""They are really refocusing into oncology and that's going to take some time - to make that transition - so I think its going to be a difficult time for the pharma business,"" said John Rountree, a partner at Novasecta Ltd, a biopharma consulting firm, adding that the vaccine business is growing. 
Shares in GSK fell 1 percent to 1,557.8 pence at 1429 GMT, underperforming the FTSE 100, after the drugmaker revealed a 50 percent drop in free cash flow to 165 million pounds in the quarter, partly due to the impact of generic competition for its asthma treatment, Advair.
""GSK has again struggled to turn profits into cash,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
Net debt at GSK, which reiterated its 2019 forecast of a decline in adjusted earnings of 5 to 9 percent, hit 27.1 billion pounds at the end of the quarter from 21.6 billion at the end of 2018, as the drugmaker completed its purchase of Tesaro. 
""Investors should probably give GSK the benefit of the doubt, at least for now,"" Hyett said.
SHINGRIX SHOT 
Sales of Shingrix, which treats shingles, a viral infection of the skin that causes painful rashes, were 357 million pounds in the quarter, up 61.5 percent from the fourth quarter. 
Analysts had expected quarterly sales of 249 million pounds and are forecasting 2019 sales of 1.17 billion pounds.
Shingrix sales were largely driven by the United States, which benefited from market growth in new patient populations covered by immunization recommendations as well as growth in Canada and the drug's recent launch in Germany. 
(For an interactive graphic on Shingrix sales, click here https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GSK-RESULTS/0H001PBSW63Q/index.html)
Sales of Advair, however, fell 15 percent to 486 million pounds, due to competition from a generic version. 
GSK's turnover rose to 7.66 billion pounds ($10 billion) in the quarter, from 7.22 billion pounds a year earlier, and above a company-provided consensus https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/investors/analyst-consensus/analyst-consensus of analysts' forecasts of 7.56 billion pounds.
Adjusted operating profit was 30.1 pence per share in the quarter, versus expectations of 26.1 pence per share.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - E-commerce giant Amazon has reached out to Israeli retailers to enable them to sell directly to customers in Israel using its online platform.
Amazon sent a letter to a select number of Israeli retailers inviting them to join its local delivery program that allows firms to use their current Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) seller account to fulfill orders directly to customers in Israel, using local inventory.
""This new service is a positive addition to the current Amazon shopping experience for Israeli customers, providing them with quicker and cheaper delivery, while also offering a great opportunity for local, Israeli businesses to grow their businesses on Amazon,"" said a source close to Amazon on Wednesday.
News of Amazon's planned expansion into Israel jolted shares of large local retailers and shopping malls.
Azrieli Group, which owns 13 shopping malls in Israel, was down 1 percent in Tel Aviv on Wednesday after shedding 3.4 percent on Tuesday. Retailer Fox was 1.5 percent lower after a nearly 10 percent drop on Tuesday.
There has been widespread speculation in Israel's media that Amazon plans to expand further into the country by opening a local fulfillment center since many Israelis already order from Amazon's sites in the United States, Britain and Germany.
With the cost of living high, sites such as Amazon have become increasingly popular in Israel since orders below $75 are exempt from taxes, while orders up to $500 are free from customs taxes.
Newspapers have also reported that Amazon began developing a local website in Hebrew and was looking for translators and editors who specialize in Hebrew to English translation.
The company, in the letter seen by Reuters, said that customers outside of the United States will be able to purchase products from Israeli vendors when they enable local delivery. 
Ilanit Scherf, head of research at the Psagot brokerage, said small businesses should benefit since Amazon's platform puts them on the map, gives them a broader marketing base and an ability to reach customers they couldn't in the past due to high costs of mall rentals.
She estimated that Amazon ""views Israel as an important target, given local growth, the developed consumption here and the business development capability that the global company can do in this part of the world through local developments.""

1419,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Pilgrimage to see Warren Buffett out of step with populist mood,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - When Warren Buffett takes the stage at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's shareholders' meeting on Saturday, the 88-year-old billionaire will be greeted, as usual, by tens of thousands of adoring followers from around the world.
Yet the Berkshire chairman and chief executive officer's optimism about the state of capitalism, a likely theme as he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for five hours, may appear out of touch with the rise of populism in his country.
Buffett's endorsements of corporate stock buybacks, the much-criticized longtime Berkshire holding  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and employer-focused attempts to reform healthcare put the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha at odds with the drive among some Americans to tackle income inequality using root-and-branch reforms.
Many announced Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 have endorsed such measures as government-sponsored healthcare and the reining in of big banks, policies that might seem antithetical to Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.
Indeed, Berkshire's mélange of businesses, such as the utilities MidAmerican Energy and PacifiCorp, parts and equipment makers Marmon and Precision Castparts, and food distributor McLane appear more aligned with Republican President Donald Trump's industrial vision for America.
Trump in 2016 defeated Buffett-backed Democrat Hillary Clinton for the White House and championed an American manufacturing and rural economic renaissance, especially in its ""heartland"" where voters provided some of his strongest support.
Now, even some of the strong American brands Buffett bet on being immune to competition are struggling.
One such investment, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, has lost more than half its value over two years as consumers moved to foods perceived to be more healthy or natural.
""The businesses aren't necessarily bad, but the brands that were a part of the moat - the reason for the acquisition - are less prominent,"" said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""That's a concern.""
BERKSHIRE LAGS S&P 500
Investors appear to have noticed.
Berkshire's stock price, which Buffett called the best measure of how the business is doing, has through Tuesday risen 6 percent this year, compared with a 18-percent rise in the S&P 500 index, including dividends.
Buffett's assistant did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
None of this, however, will stop Buffett's fans from descending on Omaha this weekend.
Events will be held around the city, and people can buy mementos such as postage stamps featuring Buffett and Munger or, for $8,950, a pair of 2 carat-weight diamond stud earrings from Berkshire's Borsheims jewelry unit.
Buffett's career of investing success and down-to-earth public persona are part of the draw.
He has used his popularity to attract long-term shareholders and lend goodwill and credibility to his business dealings.
This included lucrative investments at the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, when he provided financing to such companies as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Harley-Davidson.
DOMINANT STAKES
Some policies endorsed from political left could weigh on Berkshire, though they could be dead-on-arrival in the face of a Trump White House and Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.
For example, some research shows that when big investors hold large stakes in multiple companies in the same industry, it might reduce the incentive for those companies to compete, boosting prices and reducing service for consumers. 
Those ""common ownership"" arguments have drawn the attention of U.S. regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission, the latter of which held hearings on the subject last year.
Berkshire owns multibillion-dollar stakes in six of the largest U.S. banks plus  American Express  (NYSE:AXP). It also owns close to 10 percent of American, Delta and Southwest airlines, and more than 8 percent of another carrier, United Continental.
""Investors like Warren Buffett - no one seems to have any data about how much does he get involved in corporate governance,"" said Martin Schmalz, associate professor of finance at Oxford University's Saïd Business School, who has done research on common ownership. ""The theory says he does not aggressively push firms to compete more aggressively.""
Meanwhile, proposals to expand Medicare come as Berkshire plows ahead on its Haven joint venture with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) to cut healthcare costs for employees at those companies.
Buffett also said in February that Berkshire was likely to become a ""significant"" buyer of its own stock, especially if it extended its three-year drought for major acquisitions.
Some lawmakers have proposed restricting buybacks unless companies commit to paying their workers more. Berkshire employs more than 389,000 people.
All of this comes as Buffett's advanced age highlights the need for investors to assess Berkshire once Buffett is gone.
Buffett has shed many of his non-Berkshire roles, including sitting on outside boards and hosting college students in Omaha.

He also ceded day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's businesses in Jan. 2018 to Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, each considered a possible successor as CEO.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Lloyd's of London plans two automated insurance exchanges,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Traditional insurance market Lloyd's of London plans to launch two automated exchanges to make doing business cheaper and quicker, it said on Wednesday.
Lloyd's, which has 99 syndicate members comprising British and international insurers with most of its business carried out face to face, is suffering from two years of steep losses and increased competition from centers such as Bermuda.
The Lloyd's Risk Exchange will automate simple insurance business and a second platform will be used for complex risks, Lloyd's said in a strategy document entitled ""The Future at Lloyd's"".
“We will succeed by harnessing the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit that is at the heart of Lloyd’s,"" said John Neal, who became chief executive in October last year.
Lloyd's, which started life in Edward Lloyd's coffee house in 1688 and is known for insuring everything from ships to paintings, has been trying to modernize.
It has moved some of its business onto an electronic platform, but progress has been slow. 
""The new Lloyd’s will be nimbler and faster,"" Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in the preface to the strategy document.
Lloyd's aims to cut the costs of insuring standard risks to 10-20 percent of premiums from 30-40 percent, it said in the document.
The market will make it easier for new syndicates to set up business and will also encourage different types of funding, such as private equity and hedge funds, it added.
The strategy is the result of meetings with 1,000 market participants. 
One market source described it as the biggest shake-up at Lloyd's since the early 1990s, when the market was almost brought to its knees by asbestos-related claims that wiped out many of its individual investors.

Further consultation on the strategy is scheduled for May and June, Lloyd's said, with the aim of implementing proposals from early 2020.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 07:12AM ET</span>",Allergan CEO Saunders wins vote to keep chairman role,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc shareholders have voted down a proposal to order the immediate split of the roles of chairman and chief executive, with 61.3 percent of shareholders backing Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders.
Billionaire investor David Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa LP made the proposal, arguing that Allergan currently has a questionable business strategy and excessive pay for executives.
Proxy advisory firms backed keeping the current structure. However, Appaloosa's success in attracting the votes of a substantial minority highlights the displeasure of many investors.
The voting results represent 85.9 percent of shares eligible to vote, Allergan said in a statement on Wednesday.
Allergan, under pressure to rescue the company's falling stock price, launched a review of its strategy last year. But that review is only likely to result in the sale of its relatively small infectious disease unit.
Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review, and has called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of its depression treatment rapastinel.
In an effort to fend off Appaloosa, Allergan agreed in March to split the chairman and CEO roles, but only at its next leadership change. Saunders, 49, has no plans to step down, a source close to the company told Reuters then.
Saunders put together the current version of Allergan through a series of deals to roll up several pharmaceutical companies in 2014, and has run the company since then.
He built his reputation as a dealmaker, but he has struggled since  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) walked away from a $160 billion deal to buy Allergan in 2016. Allergan's shares have lost nearly half their value since then.

Reuters on Tuesday had reported that enough votes had been cast for Allergan to prevail against Appaloosa.

The Cupertino-based giant’s shares were indicated 5.9% higher in premarket trade after it increased its buyback program by $75 billion, and indicated that higher revenue from accessories, iPads and services were all helping to offset the recent decline in iPhone sales.
At 6.45 AM ET (1045 GMT) The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures contract was indicated up 54 points, or 0.7%, reversing the losses posted on Tuesday after Alphabet’s disappointing update wiped a combined $100 billion off the so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)).
The Dow futures contract was indicated up 77 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 futures was up 8.8 points, also up 0.3%. It had hit a new all-time high of 2961.12 overnight.
The day’s early earnings reports have been somewhat weaker than expected, with Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) and Entergy (NYSE:ETR) both missing earnings consensus. By contrast, Humana (NYSE:HUM) beat on both top and bottom lines, as did hotel group Hotel Worldwide.
They’ll be followed by consumer giants Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), CVS (NYSE:CVS), MetLife (NYSE:MET), ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), Corning (NYSE:GLW) and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) in the course of the morning. Chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) reports after the closing bell.
Elsewhere, the dollar is weaker across the board as the market prepares for the Fed’s monetary policy statement at 2 PM ET. No change in the key Fed Funds target rate of 2.25%-2.50% is expected, although economist say the Fed may trim its rate on excess reserves fractionally to nudge the effective Fed Funds rate away from the top of that range. Yields on both two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds have hit their lowest since early April in the last 24 hours.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, was at a one-week low of 97.072.
Crude oil prices were also lower as the turmoil in Venezuela failed to have a noticeable impact on oil shipments. The U.S. benchmark WTI Futures contract was at $63.59, more than a dollar off Tuesday’s highs. Prices took a knock late on Tuesday after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise increase in U.S. crude stocks last week.

The transaction is the latest example of consolidation in the Gulf's banking sector, where profit margins are being squeezed by lower government and consumer spending because of weak oil prices. The UAE has almost 50 commercial banks in a country of about 9.5 million people.
Shares in the new combined entity, which becomes the second biggest financial institution in Abu Dhabi, began trading on Wednesday. The merger plan was announced last September.
ADCB Group incorporates UNB and Al Hilal Bank and is 60.2 percent owned by the Government of Abu Dhabi through the Abu Dhabi Investment Bank. 
UNB has been dissolved as a legal entity and its shares have been delisted, while Al Hilal Bank will operate as a separate Islamic entity within the merged bank.
First Abu Dhabi Bank was created in 2017 through a merger of Abu Dhabi's biggest lenders, National Bank of Abu Dhabi and First Gulf Bank and consolidation in the industry has since gathered pace as lenders combine to compete.
Shareholders of Sharjah's Invest Bank on Apr. 10 approved a proposal to hand the emirate's government a 50.07 percent stake in the lender and allow it to merge with one or more other banks without a vote.
Saudi Arabia, which has a population of 32 million, has 12 banks and is set to lose two of those if announced mergers are successfully concluded.
Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank (NCB), the kingdom’s biggest lender by assets, has begun preliminary discussions to merge with smaller rival Riyad Bank, the two lenders said Dec. 24.

Citing an unnamed board member, Wirtschaftswoche magazine said the meeting would take place in the next two or three weeks: ""We can't just carry on like this,"" the person said.
A Bayer spokesman declined to comment.
At Bayer's annual shareholder meeting on Friday a majority of investors cast a vote of disapproval of top management's actions.
On Saturday, the supervisory board said in a statement that it unanimously stands behind the company's management, adding that it would continue to examine the results of the AGM in the weeks ahead.
On Monday, three of Bayer's largest German investors said the drugmaker's management needed to stay at the helm to avoid further upheaval, despite their unease over a share price slump in the wake of the company's $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) have been wiped off Bayer's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. More than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages.
Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the Roundup verdicts and has pointed to global regulators' findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, is safe.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that glyphosate is not a carcinogen, contradicting decisions by U.S. juries that found it caused cancer in people.

1431,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Banks’ Bad-Debt Pile Creeps Higher With Credit-Card Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- For the biggest U.S. banks, not all consumer debt is created equal.
Credit-card losses are outpacing auto and home loans at a rate not seen in at least a decade. The question is whether banks’ plastic problem is an outlier or an omen.
For now, there’s no cause for panic. The strong U.S. economy and low unemployment means most consumers are able to stay current on debt payments -- new foreclosures and bankruptcies fell to the lowest level in at least 15 years in 2018. Yet the uptick in card losses is unmistakable. Credit-reporting company Experian Plc (LON:EXPN) said some of the blame goes to banks offering credit to riskier borrowers, and the Federal Reserve has noted a spike in late payments by the elderly.
“We do see card delinquencies a little higher and a slight uptick in the most recent couple of quarters,” Matt Komos, TransUnion’s vice president of research and consulting, said in an interview, adding that he doubts the trend is a harbinger of bad news for banks. “Delinquencies, while moving upward, are probably hitting a more normal level for the amount of credit that’s out there.”
The four largest U.S. banks had almost $4 billion in charge-offs from credit cards last quarter, and just $656 million from all other consumer lending. That’s the biggest gap since at least 2009. Card charge-offs now make up more than 80 percent of total consumer credit costs, up from 67 percent three years ago.
While the card losses are noteworthy, they’re not enough to drag down what’s been an otherwise a stellar run of profits at the top lenders. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). said last month that profit from its consumer division jumped 19 percent in the first quarter, while at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). that figure surged 25 percent.
Big banks are also stressing that loss levels aren’t outside the range they expected. Some of the deterioration in credit quality comes from growth: Lenders have piled into credit cards in recent years while pulling back on auto and student loans. Bank of America and JPMorgan, two of the largest U.S. mortgage providers, posted recoveries of delinquent debt in their residential home-loan portfolios in the first quarter.
“For us, the U.S. consumer has always been strong and confident, and even if we’re not at all-time highs in confidence, we’re still very high,” JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in April. “Generally, the data is -- even some like housing and autos that hasn’t necessarily been super strong -- is looking encouraging.”
While provisions tied to consumer loans made up the majority of major banks’ credit costs in recent years, investors have grown increasingly wary of deteriorating commercial credit. Some bank executives have warned of the growing influence of non-banks in the leveraged-lending market, for example, while others have cautioned against the risk of “fallen angels,” or bonds rated in the BBB zone that get downgraded to junk.
And as credit costs increase, many of the biggest banks in the U.S. are also experiencing a slowdown in spending on their cards, meaning they’ll reap fewer of the fees they charge merchants whenever a consumer uses their card at checkout.
“We see solid overall economic growth with some slight moderation,” Sachin Mehra, CFO for Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)., said in an interview. “We’re still monitoring a number of items as it relates to the economy, such as ongoing trade negotiations and other economic and political factors that could impact growth over the longer term.”

There was plenty to keep investors who were at their desks occupied: Beijing and Washington began their latest talks aimed at ending a bitter trade war and Fed chairman Jerome Powell was due to speak later following the central bank's two-day policy meeting.
The U.S. dollar against a basket of six major currencies was down slightly, trading in a tight range after hitting a one-week low ahead of the Fed news.
""The risk for this Fed meeting is that, unless the FOMC meets the market's dovish expectation for their stance, we would expect another leg higher in USD,"" Mizuho strategists said in a note.
The Fed is largely expected to leave U.S. borrowing costs unchanged as it seeks to balance solid economic growth against low inflation.
A call from U.S. President Donald Trump for a cut in interest rates will likely be unheeded when the results of the Fed's two-day meeting are released, but the unorthodox comments made on Twitter will increase focus on Powell at his press conference shortly after.
CAUTION FOR MAY
Sentiment has improved along with global economic data - most recently from the euro-zone where data on Tuesday showed Q1 growth topped expectations.
But there was some caution ahead of the summer lull with investors questioning how much longer the rally across global equities can last with better economic data and a stabilization in earnings priced in.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 05:02AM ET</span>",U.S. environment agency says glyphosate weed killer is not a carcinogen,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Tuesday that glyphosate, a chemical in many popular weed killers, is not a carcinogen, contradicting decisions by U.S. juries that found it caused cancer in people.
The EPA's announcement reaffirms its earlier findings about the safety of glyphosate, the key ingredient in Bayer's Roundup. The company faces thousands of lawsuits from Roundup users who allege it caused their cancer.
""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said in a statement.
Farmers spray glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture, on fields of soybeans and other crops. Roundup is also used on lawns, golf courses and elsewhere. 
The EPA did previously find ecological risks from the chemical and has proposed new measures to protect the environment from glyphosate use by farmers and to reduce the problem of weeds becoming resistant to it.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) said it was pleased the EPA and other regulators who have assessed the science on glyphosate for more than 40 years continue to conclude it is not carcinogenic. ""Bayer firmly believes that the science supports the safety of glyphosate-based herbicides,"" it said in a statement. The company has repeatedly denied allegations that glyphosate and Roundup cause cancer.
But critics of the chemical disputed the EPA's assurances.
""Unfortunately American consumers cannot trust the EPA assessment of glyphosate's safety,"" said Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity.
 Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) developed Roundup as the first glyphosate-based weed killer, but it is no longer patent-protected and many other versions are available. Bayer bought Monsanto last year for $63 billion.
The debate over glyphosate's safety has put a spotlight on regulatory agencies around the world in recent years and, more recently, on U.S. courtrooms. 
In 2015, the World Health Organization's cancer arm classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" But the EPA in 2017 said a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks found the chemical was not likely carcinogenic to humans.
In February, analysts at Brazilian health agency Anvisa also determined the weed killer does not cause cancer while recommending limits on exposure.
In the first U.S. Roundup trial, a California man was awarded $289 million in August 2018 after a state court jury found the weed killer caused his cancer. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is being appealed by Bayer. 

A U.S. jury in March awarded $80 million to another California man who claimed his use of Roundup caused his cancer.

1437,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>",WeWork Europe Expansion Faces Growing Competition Before IPO,"(Bloomberg) --  WeWork  (NYSE:WEWK) gets a lot of headlines for its breakneck expansion into new markets, and that’s only likely to increase now that it plans to go public. Yet the nine-year-old company faces stiff competition in Europe from established work-space providers like IWG Plc and local startups.
The number of serviced and co-working offices across Europe has ballooned by more than 200 percent in the last five years, according to a report by real estate broker Colliers International Group Inc. WeWork has helped to drive this growth: it has nearly 50 locations in London and has added sites from Manchester to Moscow.
“The IPO is a great milestone in the evolution of the flexible work-space scene,” said Tom Sleigh, head of consultancy on the industry at Colliers. “It’s a signal to other operators that they’re able to expand.”
While WeWork initially rose with the advent of the gig economy and an explosion of startups, big companies are increasingly seeking more flexible offices, too. Corporate clients now make up about a third of WeWork’s customers. IWG, which owns the Regus brand, has traditionally catered to corporate customers.
WeWork and IWG account for about 78 percent of the European market for flexible work-space, Colliers data show. WeWork had about 600,000 square meters (6.5 million square feet) of office space in Europe at the end of 2018. That put it ahead of IWG, whose Spaces brand is more closely comparable to WeWork venues than the traditional serviced offices operated by its Regus unit. IWG is considering selling Spaces.
A growing list of local operators are now battling WeWork and IWG for market share. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group’s The Office Group and Germany’s Design Offices are at the front of the chasing pack. Each of the firms has about 80,000 square meters of flexible office space, according to Colliers. In many major European markets, including London and Paris, smaller local players collectively account for a majority of the flexible office space market, according to the Colliers report.
WeWork’s IPO, and the financial information it discloses in the process, could prove useful to its rivals, Sleigh said. These companies will be eager to learn how much WeWork spends to open new locations as well as its long-term occupancy rates and the rate at which tenants renew their leases, he said.
The lion’s share of flexible office space in Europe is concentrated in a few cities, particularly Amsterdam and London, which is the world’s biggest city for co-working. Now other cities such as Berlin, Paris and Rome are seeing rapid expansion.
“Other cities are playing catch-up in some respects because the industry is less developed,” Sleigh said. “We expect a lot more of that as landlords become much more prepared to offer more and more services to occupiers as a response to WeWork spaces.”
Changes in the workforce underpin the spread of flexible offices. Across Europe, nearly half of workers are self-employed, on temporary contracts or part-time -- perfect conditions that have fueled the flexible work-space boom, Sleigh said.

1438,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Barclays CEO Set for Victory Over Bramson,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The fate of the U.K.’s last global investment bank is set to be decided on Thursday when shareholders of  Barclays  PLC (LON:BARC) will vote, among other things, on whether activist investor Edward Bramson should get a seat on the board.
Bramson is Barclays’ third-largest shareholder with 5.5%, much of it hedged with options. He’s been campaigning for Chief Executive Jes Staley to cut back the corporate and investment bank drastically, arguing that it’s not as profitable as the U.K.-focused lending operations.
Staley on the other hand is committed to an investment bank that has done better than its European peers in recent quarters, seeing it as a valuable, uncorrelated source of income that can smooth out returns over the long term.
The strong recent performance of Barclays’ investment bank – its fixed-income division kept revenue declines to only 3% in the first quarter, compared with double-digit drops at most rivals -- has probably vindicated Staley enough to keep Bramson off the board for now.
However, Bramson has already scored a partial success in putting a lid on pay at the investment bank: the Financial Times reported recently that accruals for bonuses in the first quarter were down by more than 10% in the first quarter, something that can be traced back to Staley taking back control of the unit from its former head Tim Throsby.
Barclays has been the worst-performing of the big U.K.-based banks over the last 12 months, falling 19% (although the U.K.-only challenger banks have fallen much more, somewhat weakening the argument that it should stick to its knitting at home). But Barclays' performance has not been noticeably worse than that of UBS (NYSE:UBS) or Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), and it has fared a lot better than  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), whose 35% stock decline has been in large measure caused by a bloated investment bank that costs more than it brings in in revenue.
With Deutsche now expected by many to cut its U.S.-heavy investment bank more dramatically as it seeks its salvation without a merger, Barclays should logically profit from the falling away of a competitor.
Unfortunately for Staley, the same logic may also apply to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which is funding Bramson’s stake with a $1.4 billion loan and which would face less competition in its home market if Barclays can be persuaded to shrink.
Barclays was up 1.1% in quiet trading on Wednesday, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2%. Most of the rest of Europe was closed due to the May Day holiday."
1439,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2019 04:20AM ET</span>",Danske Says Bank Has Excess Capital to Reward Shareholders,"(Bloomberg) --  Danske Bank  A/S has built up enough extra capital to commit to dividends and, at the end of this year, will look into the option of resuming share buybacks.
Christian Baltzer, who started as chief financial officer at Denmark’s biggest bank in October, pointed to capital buffers that exceed both regulatory requirements and the bank’s own targets as evidence it can afford to return money to shareholders.
“We right now have a strong capital position of 16.7 percent, well above our own target and well suited for whatever might come our way,” Baltzer said in a phone interview on Tuesday.
Shares in Danske (CO:DANSKE) rose to the top of Bloomberg’s index of European financial stocks on Wednesday, trading as much as 2.6 percent higher. Because of the May 1 holiday across much of Europe, many banks weren’t trading.
When it comes to dividends, Danske aims to return 40-60 percent of profits to shareholders each year, and “we can definitely maintain that,” Baltzer said. “Share buyback, it’s something that we discuss year-end with the board, so we’ll have a look at it at year-end.” He said that Danske also needs to discuss the option of share buybacks with the financial regulator.
The assurances on shareholder rewards follow a grim set of quarterly results that drove Danske’s share price down almost 10 percent on Tuesday. The bank said an Estonian money laundering scandal that erupted last year continues to weigh on its business, and pointed to higher funding and legal costs as part of the reason profits suffered.
Danske’s management was forced to cut its outlook for the full year, with net interest income set to decline in 2019 and profit at risk of stagnating. Against that backdrop, the bank’s capital position stood out as a bright spot, with its common equity Tier 1 buffer growing from a year earlier.
Danske’s laundering scandal last year prompted the Danish financial regulator to enforce an additional capital requirement of 10 billion kroner ($1.5 billion). That forced the bank to cut short its existing share buyback program and shelve plans for future repurchase plans.
Baltzer said Danske’s additional capital requirement hasn’t been earmarked for a particular purpose. It could be used to cover the cost of potential fines, but it might also go toward expanding lending or buying back shares, depending on what the regulator approves.
Danske has a common equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to 16.7 percent of its risk-weighted assets. Its regulatory requirement is 14 percent and the bank’s management has set a target of 16 percent. That leaves an excess capital layer of 0.7 percentage point, equivalent to 5.3 billion kroner, or around $800 million, according to Bloomberg calculations confirmed by Danske Bank.
It’s “a little bit of a buffer for us to work with,” Baltzer said.
Danske said in September that a large part of around $230 billion that flowed through an Estonian unit over nine years was suspicious. The bank is being investigated across Europe and in the U.S., and the roughly 50 percent it lost in market value last year reflects investor anxiety over potential laundering fines.
Danske also faces multiple shareholder lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic. Last month, 169 cases were filed in Copenhagen courts seeking claims of 3.5 billion kroner, the bank said.
The case has cost Danske roughly 500 million kroner in legal, administrative and extra funding costs so far. That figure is set to rise, though Baltzer said he couldn’t provide an estimate to show how much.
“Guessing what the end number of that will be is not something that we have come out with,” he said. “When you to have go to a lawsuit in the U.S., unfortunately it’s not for free.”
The bank has pledged not to pass on to customers the higher funding costs related to the case, he said. Danske is keen to regain the trust of customers and investors and has decided that shielding them from its laundering costs is key to that goal.
Just under 20,000 Danish retail customers have closed their accounts since October. Baltzer says there are signs that the exodus is now slowing.
“We’ve had two quarters with significant outflow of customers,” he said. “We’re seeing more of a normalization coming in. But again, you could argue that it’s too early to call. There’s the notorious seeing light at the end of the tunnel: is it a train or is it the end of the tunnel?”

1440,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",Swiss Railways plans to put more Bombardier trains into service,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and Bombardier are making progress on resolving technical problems with passenger trains the Swiss have ordered and could put more of them into service within weeks, the partners said.
SBB said in February that new Bombardier FV-Dosto trains had yet to live up to expectations and that the companies were working to correct issues, including improving software and fixing problematic doors.
""The new long-distance double-decker trains are more stable than at the end of 2018 thanks to various improvements. If developments remain positive, the SBB will add more Bombardier trains to operations over the next few weeks,"" they said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
SBB awarded Bombardier a 59-train contract in 2010, worth 1.9 billion Swiss franc ($1.86 billion), but the first deliveries were made only in 2018. Amid problems, Bombardier agreed to add three trains free of charge as compensation, boosting deliveries to 62.
The Swiss railway had said it would not take new double-decker intercity trains from Bombardier until the Canadian company fixes problems with the 12 that are already in service, raising questions over the timing of future deliveries under the contract.
Bombardier investors are closely watching the Swiss order, one of a handful of rail contracts affected by delivery delays that generated disappointing free cash flow last year and a subsequent selloff of Bombardier shares and bonds.
Bombardier Inc last week cut its full-year profit and revenue forecasts as it wrestled with production challenges in its key railcar-making unit, rattling markets ahead of the company's annual general meeting this week.
The transport division is crucial to a five-year plan to turn around Bombardier, after heavy investment in plane production drove the company to the brink of bankruptcy in 2015.
The rail unit is expected to generate $10 billion, or half of the company's revenue, in 2020.
SBB said in February it had paid about a third of the contract value to Bombardier so far.

The Swiss contract for the trains calls for undisclosed penalty payments in the event of delays, but the SBB has not given any details so far.

The change, stemming from a revision by the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority, would allow the bank to lower its targets for its CET1 ratio, a measure of capital strength, to around 12.5 percent, from 13 percent, according to a statement on Wednesday.
Britain’s largest mortgage lender signaled it’s mulling share buybacks and dividends as a result of the move. Lloyds' (LON:LLOY) shares rose 1.7 percent to 63.6 pence at 8:56 a.m. in London trading.
“The group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy and the board will continue to give consideration to the distribution of surplus capital at the end of the year,” the bank said.
Jefferies Group LLC analysts Joseph Dickerson and Aqil Taiyeb said the BOE cut its requirements more than the market expected, leaving Lloyds with about 1 billion pounds ($1.31 billion) of excess capital that could be used for a buyback this year.
“This is the first example we can think of where one of the large quoted U.K. banks has actually reduced its capital requirement, after a number of years of upward revisions,” said Shore Capital Group Limited analyst Gary Greenwood in a note.
The PRA also said Wednesday that Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's (LON:RBS) systemic risk buffer rate would be 1.5 percent, while  Barclays  Plc (LON:BARC),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Banco Santander  SA's (MC:SAN) U.K. unit would be 1 percent. The rates apply from Aug. 1.
Lloyds is due to publish its first-quarter results on Thursday.
The review comes days after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) highlighted an improving picture for its capital requirements, as a result of changes to the way the Financial Stability Board judges its importance in the global banking system.

The curbs were put in place by regulators two years ago amid concerns about abuse by companies and investors and a lack of transparency on such share sales, which were frequently below the stock's last openly traded price.
The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is working on changes to the rules such as limits on the sale of shares bought via private placements and the mechanism for pricing shares in private offerings, Caixin said, citing sources close to the regulator.
Private placements in China jumped five-fold from 2013 to $172 billion in 2016, skirting regulators’ controls on initial public offerings (IPOs) and raising concerns that companies were raising too much money for inefficient or speculative purposes.
That prompted new rules from the CSRC in early 2017 limiting the size of such fundraisings to no more than 20 percent of a company's capitalization, requiring an 18-month gap in between private offerings, and excluding some sectors altogether.
However, the crackdown on private placements meant many firms had to turn to raising debt instead, adding to the sizeable corporate debt burden in China.
A multi-year regulatory crackdown on riskier types of financing and debt limited many companies' access to funding last year, leading to the biggest-ever year for onshore defaults and a sharp tail-off in investment that weighed on the economy.

More companies than ever are missing payments this year, highlighting a continued cash crunch as Beijing backs off from broad policy easing.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 01:43AM ET</span>",Boeing says optional 737 MAX alert was 'not activated as intended',"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said an alert for angle-of-attack (AOA) sensors on its 737 MAX jets was ""not activated as intended"" for some customers, responding to reports it failed to tell Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and the U.S regulator that the optional feature was deactivated before a crash in Indonesia in October.
Erroneous AOA sensor readings that led to aggressive nose-down inputs by a computer have been linked to deadly 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, according to preliminary reports from investigators.
Boeing offered customers two optional paid features relating to AOA. The first was an AOA DISAGREE alert when the two sensors disagreed and the second was an indicator giving pilots a gauge of the actual angle.
Southwest, the largest 737 MAX customer, in November told Reuters the alert was installed and it planned to add the indicator as well following the Lion Air crash in Indonesia.
The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported that unbeknown to Southwest and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the alerts were not activated on the carrier's 737 MAX jets. 
""After the Lion Air event, Southwest was notified by Boeing that the AOA disagree lights were inoperable without the optional AOA indicators on the MAX aircraft,"" a Southwest spokesman said on Tuesday.
Boeing said on Monday that the disagree alert had been intended to be a standalone feature on the 737 MAX, but it was ""not operable on all airplanes because the feature was not activated as intended"".
""The disagree alert was tied or linked into the angle-of-attack indicator, which is an optional feature on the MAX,"" the manufacturer said in a statement. ""Unless an airline opted for the angle-of-attack indicator, the disagree alert was not operable...Boeing did not intentionally or otherwise deactivate the disagree alert on its MAX airplanes.""
When Reuters contacted several 737 MAX operators about the optional features in November, only American Airlines and Singapore Airlines Ltd offshoot SilkAir confirmed they had installed both the alert and the indicator. 
Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd and Dubai's flydubai said they had installed the alert. 
An Air Canada spokeswoman said on Tuesday that since November the alert and indicator had been installed on its fleet. Boeing said the disagree alert was not considered a safety feature and was not necessary for the safe operation of the plane. However, the company said following software modifications all new 737 MAX aircraft would have an activated and operable disagree alert and an optional angle-of-attack indicator, while current 737 MAX planes would have the ability to activate the disagree alert. 
Boeing CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg promised on Monday to win back the public's trust after facing tough questions following the two crashes.

A FAA spokeswoman declined to comment.

The head of the electric car maker reached a deal with the SEC on Friday, agreeing to submit his public statements about the company's finances and other topics to vetting by its legal counsel. 
However, SEC commissioner Robert Jackson registered his dissent after the deal was approved by a federal judge earlier on Tuesday.
""Given Mr. Musk's conduct, I cannot support a settlement in which he does not admit what is crystal clear to anyone who has followed this bizarre series of events,"" Jackson said in a statement.
""Musk breached the agreement he made last year with the Commission - and with American investors,"" he added.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan approved the deal worked out on Friday that settled the dispute in which the SEC had sought to find Musk in contempt of a securities fraud settlement last year.
Earlier this month, Nathan had ordered the parties to work out an arrangement between themselves.
The new deal lays out in more detail what types of statements by Musk must be reviewed by Tesla's legal counsel before publication, such as financial statements, previously unreported production or delivery numbers, and other topics. 
Regulators had claimed that a February tweet by Musk about Tesla's production numbers violated the earlier settlement, as it had not been vetted by the company's attorneys. Musk countered that the tweet was not material. 
The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share.

The parties eventually settled, and the deal called for Tesla's lawyers to pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.

The commission said it was ""profoundly disturbed"" by ""repeated systemic failures and pervasive culture of non-disclosure"" at the company.
The decision follows the commission's investigative report earlier in April that concluded that former executives of Wynn Resorts concealed sexual misconduct allegations against billionaire founder Wynn.
Brian Kelly, Wynn's lawyer, had said at the time that his client ""denies all allegations of non-consensual sex and nothing in this report changes that.""
The Massachusetts Gaming Commission released its decision after a year-long investigation and three-day hearing into allegations of sexual assault, misconduct and other inappropriate behavior and how Wynn Resorts handled them.
However, the commission added that there was not enough evidence to revoke Wynn Resort's gaming license.
The Las Vegas-based company received its Massachusetts license in 2013, allowing it to move forward with building the 671-room ""Encore Boston Harbor"" in Everett, Massachusetts. It is expected to open in June.
The watchdog said it would impose a $35 million fine on Wynn Resorts and a $500,000 fine on Chief Executive Officer Matthew Maddox, in addition to license conditions including an independent monitor to oversee the company's adherence to policies and organizational changes.
""We are in the process of reviewing that decision and considering the full range of our next steps,"" Wynn Resorts said in an emailed statement.
The report by the commission's investigations and enforcement bureau followed a January 2018 article by The Wall Street Journal detailing allegations that Wynn had engaged in a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct.
His subsequent exit as the company's chief executive and sale of his stake in Wynn Resorts made him one of the most prominent executives to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement, which has highlighted longstanding patterns of sexual harassment and abuse in major U.S. institutions.
The commission said in its decision that Wynn Resort's culture favored the CEO in ways that left the ""most vulnerable at great risk.""
""While the company has made great strides in altering that system, this commission remains concerned by the past failures and deficiencies,"" the 54-page decision said. 

Nevada casino regulators, following a similar investigation, in February fined the company $20 million.

(Reuters) - Far from being a Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) killer, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) envisions its forthcoming Apple TV+ streaming service as one that could sit alongside other services that viewers buy, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Tuesday.
Apple in March said it will launch a streaming service with original content from big names including Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. It plans to spend $2 billion on programming but has not said how much the service will cost.
Investors are keeping a close eye on Apple's television efforts because subscription services are an increasingly important part of its financial results as iPhone sales decline.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said sales in China were stabilizing and touted how increasing demand for services and accessories such as Apple Music and the Apple Watch helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue.
Sales of iPhones, which account for more than half of all revenue, fell 17% in the fiscal second quarter from a year earlier and slightly missed analyst expectations. 
After Apple slashed prices in China, iPhone sales picked up toward the end of the quarter and revenue rose from iPads, wearables and services. While consumers may be putting off phone purchases longer than in the past, they are deepening ties with the Cupertino, California company's brand.
Shares, which have mostly recovered from an end-of-year sell-off, are rising toward a new high. They gained more than 5% in after-hours trading after Apple announced the results and plans for a new $75 billion share buyback. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WdDgyh)
Apple said it expects revenue between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion for the current quarter ending in June, above analysts' average estimate of $51.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In an interview, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that iPhone sales started to strengthen during the last few weeks of the fiscal second quarter, including in China. ""These, along with the continued success with wearables and so forth, give us some confidence that things are getting a bit better,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview.
Apple reported net earnings per share of $2.46 for the March quarter, down about 9.9% from a year earlier, compared with Wall Street's average estimate of $2.36. Actual net income declined 16.3% to $11.56 billion. Apple spent a record $27 billion on share buybacks and dividends during the fiscal second quarter. Buybacks boost earnings per share by cutting the number of shares outstanding.
Apple said iPhone revenues were $31.05 billion, slightly below analyst estimates of $31.10 billion, according to data from FactSet.
But revenue from wearables and accessories sales of $5.13 billion beat estimates of $4.79 billion, according to FactSet data. And services revenue, which includes sales from iCloud, the App Store and other businesses, reached $11.45 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $11.32 billion, according to FactSet.
Apple has wrestled with a slowdown in iPhone sales in key markets such as China and saw its first ever year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue for the holiday shopping season.
The slowdown stemmed in part from the iPhone's high cost and competition from rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Xiaomi Corp, Oppo and Vivo - all of which sell cheaper phones with features similar to the iPhone.
But Cook said price adjustments in China, along with lower Chinese taxes on the iPhone and the trade-in and financing deals Apple offered, helped iPhone sales start to recover toward the end of the quarter. Cook also said he is ""optimistic"" that the United States and China will soon reach a trade deal.
""The trade relationship, versus the previous quarter, is better. The tone is better,"" Cook told Reuters. ""The sum of all of this together, it helped us.""
Investors are looking to Apple's services business to fuel growth as iPhone sales slow. Last month, Apple revealed a new credit card offering and subscription services for news, television and gaming, though only the news subscription is currently available to purchase. 
Apple on Tuesday said it has 390 million total subscribers to both its own and third-party services on its devices. The company has set a goal of 500 million by 2020.
Tom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management and an Apple shareholder, said the results looked good, especially the uptick toward the end of the quarter. But other shareholders such as Brian Pirri, a principal at Apple shareholder New England Investment and Retirement Group, said they took the results with a ""grain of salt"" because expectations were low heading into the report.
""I don't think the phones are the answer. (Apple) is going to need to continue to innovate, and I don't see a ton out of this report that excites me,"" Pirri said.
For its fiscal second quarter ended in March, Apple reported revenue of $58.02 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $57.37 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Apple also said its board had authorized an additional $75 billion in share repurchases and raised its dividend by 5 percent. 
""I imagine people are extrapolating the positive developments in China near quarter end and looking forward to a better environment there,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. ""For me, the driver for tonight’s (share price) move is the dividend hike ... and more importantly the $75 billion buy back. Either way, I’ll take it.""

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 08:20PM ET</span>",Allergan to prevail in vote over CEO Saunders' chairman role: sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc is on course to defeat a shareholder resolution tabled by David Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa LP that would have forced the drugmaker's CEO Brent Saunders to immediately give up his role as chairman, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
A loss would have been bruising for Saunders, a prolific dealmaker who has served as CEO of Allergan since 2014. Allergan has committed to separating the CEO and chairman roles no later than the next leadership change when Saunders, 49, steps down, rather than immediately. He has not set any public timetable for his exit.
Enough votes have been cast for Allergan to prevail against Appaloosa, the sources said. However, Appaloosa's resolution is expected to attract the votes of a substantial minority of Allergan's shareholders, the sources added, highlighting the displeasure of many investors focused on stricter corporate governance standards.
The sources asked not to be identified because the outcome of the shareholder vote is not yet public. Allergan declined to comment, and Appaloosa could not be reached for comment.
Saunders has held the roles of CEO and chairman since October 2016. Before then Saunders served as CEO of the company alongside Paul Bisaro, who was executive chairman. He left to become CEO of Impax Laboratories Inc. 
Two leading shareholder advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services LP and Glass Lewis & Co, earlier this month threw their support behind Allergan's management by recommending that investors vote against Appaloosa's proposal.
Allergan, under pressure to bolster its sagging stock price, launched a review of its strategy last year. That review is only likely to result in the sale of its relatively small infectious disease unit.
Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review and has called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of Allergan's depression treatment rapastinel.
Saunders was instrumental in putting Allergan together through a series of deals with companies including Forest Laboratories Inc and  Actavis  Plc. 

But Saunders' biggest deal, Allergan's $160 billion sale to  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) was killed in 2016 after the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration changed the rules on corporate tax inversions. Allergan's shares have lost nearly half their value since then.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>","Pushing the limits: Qantas seeks backing from pilots, regulator for record-long routes","By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd, which hopes to buy planes this year for record-breaking 21-hour flights between Sydney and London has two hurdles left to overcome: getting pilots and Australia's aviation regulator to agree to unprecedented duty times.
Airlines around the world are planning longer flights to compete with one-stop rivals and collect a fare premium of about 20 percent on non-stop routes, which are especially popular with corporate travelers.
Airbus SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co say their aircraft are ready, with only details like seat configuration left to hammer out, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said.
But there is a human cost to flying from Sydney to London or New York that must be resolved before tickets are sold, Joyce added.
    ""We don't have the ability to do that length of duty today so you do need to negotiate that and get the regulator comfortable with it,"" Joyce told Reuters in a phone interview. ""If the business case works ... (we can) put an order in by the end of this year and have aircraft arriving in 2022.""
Qantas pilots say the unprecedented length of the new flights means the airline needs do more research, consider more training, use more experienced pilots and change what they say is a flawed fatigue-reporting system.
    The maximum pilot duty time on the Sydney-London flights is expected to be around 23 hours, more than the current limit of 20 hours. ""Duty"" includes time on the ground before and after flights during which the flight crew is working.
Qantas already has 17-hour non-stop journeys between Perth and London with four pilots onboard.
Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) will evaluate the proposed longer duty time based partly on a study of pilot fatigue on the Perth-London route, agency spokesman Peter Gibson said.
It could approve longer hours, reject the proposal, approve a shorter duty time or require new measures like a more experienced crew or extended rest periods.
    ""The technological change is obviously there but the human physiological side hasn't changed since the Wright brothers flew,"" said Mark Sedgwick, the head of the Qantas pilots union, The Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA). ""We really need to understand the effects on human performance on the flight deck of these ultra-long range flights.""
REPORTING FATIGUE
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau in January released a study on pilot fatigue that found 60 percent of long-haul pilots had experienced moderate to severe fatigue on their most recent flight.
One issue: take-off times that work best for passengers on long flights are not ideal for easing pilot fatigue.
""From a passenger's point of view, a night flight at the end of the day makes it easier to adjust to the time,"" former Qantas head of safety Ron Bartsch said. ""Obviously being up the front end, (the pilots) are doing some work.""
Managing fatigue is a serious issue for airlines globally, and CASA is overseeing a new data-driven fatigue risk-management system at Qantas. The agency says the new system, which also takes into account fatigue reports from pilots, will create a flexible framework for duty times rather than prescriptive rules.
CASA and AIPA are also sponsoring a detailed fatigue study by Monash University that monitors sleep patterns of pilots on the Perth-London route. 
Measures to fight fatigue could include putting more flight crew onboard; adding crew beds; requiring more rest before and after flights; providing transport home; and reducing subsequent duty periods, Gibson said.
According to Qantas, pilots who feel too fatigued must complete a report. 
The time off is then treated as sick leave, the airline said, but Brad Hodson, a Qantas captain and union official who has flown from Perth to London, said the policy could lead to under-reporting.
""It is easier just to go sick because you don't have to fill in reports,"" he said.
How pilots are paid when they take time off because of fatigue is an ""industrial issue"" outside CASA's jurisdiction, Gibson said. 
Qantas and AIPA are negotiating a new union contract for long-haul pilots. Joyce said he hoped for an agreement this year. 
""AIPA is supportive of the commercial benefits that may flow to Qantas in being able to operate these long premium routes with minimal competition,"" Sedgwick said. ""We want to make sure the safety and fatigue management issues are adequately addressed in the process of enabling these flights.""
EXPERIENCE LEVELS
Crew experience on long-haul flights also will be part of contract negotiations, Sedgwick said.
The world's longest flight is Singapore Airlines Ltd's almost 19-hour journey from Singapore to New York.
Singapore's aviation regulator said in a statement that it requires the airline to have two captains and two first officers on shifts of more than 18 hours, including time before and after takeoff, to ""optimize their alertness throughout the flight.""
Qantas, which has a maximum duty period of around 20 hours on its Perth-London flights, also has four pilots. Crew can rest in bunks. 
But the Australian airline uses one captain, one first officer and two second officers. Second officers are paid less, can fly only at cruising altitudes and cannot take off or land.
Hodson said Qantas did not necessarily need to put two captains and two first officers on each flight. More training for second officers or adding a first officer in place of one second officer were options, he added.
""I think having another qualified pilot who could sit in the seat for take-off and landing would ameliorate a lot of the issues there,"" Hodson said. ""But Qantas won't like that because it costs money.""
Joyce said the final crew mix and training had not been decided.

""We will need to work through the safety case and our requirements and then talk to pilots and regulators,"" he said.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - An activist hedge fund on Tuesday nominated five directors and urged insurance company Argo Group International Holdings Ltd to cut $100 million in expenses, including corporate jets and housing for its chief executive.
Voce Capital Management LLC wants Argo shareholders to back its plan to double return on equity at the company's annual meeting next month, saying the current board is responsible for a ""culture of indulgence,"" according to a securities filing, seen by Reuters.
Voce, a $250 million hedge fund run by J. Daniel Plants, said Argo's return on equity could climb to over 10 percent from an average of 5.7 percent if it slashed expenses such as the jets, sponsorships and CEO pay and housing, including a waterfront villa in Bermuda and a penthouse apartment in New York City.
“The numbers Plants has put forward are fantasy,” an Argo representative said.
The hedge fund owns 5.6 percent of $2.4 billion Argo, which specializes in insurance and reinsurance products in property and casualty insurance. Voce announced plans to push for changes in February.
Voce's director candidates have global insurance and capital allocation expertise plus public company board experience. Voce proposes to replace five directors, including ones not up for re-election now, and called the current board weak.
Voce wants a combination of expense cuts, improved capital allocation and portfolio realignment, including possibly spinning off certain businesses.
Investors would reward such moves, Voce said, forecasting shares could climb as high as $126, compared with Tuesday's closing price of $78.07. If nothing is done, the hedge fund said, the stock price could also drop, erasing gains made since Voce began pressuring Argo.
Voce also said the company's Gulfstream 5 jet logged 584 flights in the last three calendar years to places where Argo CEO Mark Watson III has homes.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc committed $10 billion on Tuesday to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's $38 billion cash-and-stock bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), boosting its chances of snatching a deal from  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
Occidental and Chevron are locked in the biggest oil-industry takeover battle in years as they eye Anadarko's prized assets in West Texas' huge Permian shale oilfield.
Anadarko on Monday agreed to start negotiations with Occidental, saying its bid may potentially be superior to Chevron's existing deal to buy Anadarko for $33 billion in cash and stock.
Berkshire's cash provides Occidental with flexibility to fund and even increase its proposal. Anadarko has previously expressed reservations about the risk of Occidental having to get any deal voted through by its own shareholders. 
Occidental could now use the majority of the Berkshire investment to add cash to its bid and remove the requirement for a vote, if it so chooses.
T. Rowe Price Group, an influential Occidental shareholder, said on Tuesday it was ""very concerned"" about the deal, and that it could vote against the board at Occidental's upcoming shareholder meeting if the company tried to circumvent giving stockholders a say on the Anadarko transaction, according to a report on Barron's website.
T. Rowe Price is Occidental's sixth-largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
The Berkshire investment, contingent on Occidental completing its proposed acquisition of Anadarko, could also repay some of the debt being taken on to finance the deal's cash portion, or cover the $10 billion to $15 billion of proceeds from asset sales which Occidental plans in the two years after closing the acquisition.
Analysts said Buffett's endorsement supports Occidental's push to get the deal done but comes at a high cost.
Berkshire Hathaway will get 100,000 preferred shares and a warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental at $62.50 apiece in a private offering, a statement from Occidental said.
The preferred stock will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum, compared with about 5 percent yield on common equity and 4 percent on term debt, Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Portillo said.
""For Occidental shareholders, our view is this is a fairly expensive cost of financing for the transaction even though it carries a kind of nice headline of having Berkshire Hathaway participate in the potential financing here.""
It is rare for Buffett to participate in a bidding war for a company. The last time he did this was in 2016, supporting a consortium including Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert that tried unsuccessfully to buy Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc's internet assets.
Shares of Occidental closed 2.1% lower at $58.88, while Anadarko shares were down about 0.1% at $72.85. Chevron shares rose 2% to $120.06.
A Chevron spokesman reiterated that the San Roman, California-based company believes its ""signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko's shareholders.""
Occidental and Chevron, two of the largest oil and gas producers in the Permian by production volumes, argue they can best squeeze more oil from Anadarko's 240,000 acres (97,120 hectares)in the area.

The two companies control land adjacent to Anadarko's properties and expect a deal will add deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 eked out another record high close on Tuesday and capped its best four-month stretch in nearly nine years after a recent rally that helped to restore investors' belief in the decade-long bull run.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped about 5 percent following its quarterly results after the bell, which will help to ease worries about the earnings outlook for the S&P 500, even as Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tumbled during the session in the wake of a revenue miss. 
S&P 500 e-mini futures were last up 0.2% and jumped following the report from Apple, which forecast stronger-than-expected third-quarter revenue. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook also said iPhone sales had begun to stabilize in China.
Besides a mostly better-than-expected earnings season, analysts said market-positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks have all helped drive recent gains.
""All in all, things for the market are looking pretty decent: a friendly Fed, low rates, growing earnings. It doesn't get much better than that,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
With more than half of the S&P 500 companies reporting, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to have risen slightly from a year ago, a stark reversal from the 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data.
But not all results have been upbeat. During the regular session, Alphabet shares fell 7.5% in their worst decline since October 2012 after the company reported its slowest revenue growth in three years. 
Apple shares were down 1.9% during the day. 
The S&P communication services sector slid 2.5%, dragged down by Alphabet, and registered its biggest percentage drop in about four months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.52 points, or 0.15%, to 26,592.91. The S&P 500 gained 2.8 points, or 0.10%, to 2,945.83, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 54.01 points, or 0.66%, to 8,095.39.
For the month, the Dow rose 2.6%, the S&P 500 gained 3.9% and the Nasdaq added 4.9%. All three indexes posted their best monthly percentage gains since January.
The S&P 500 now up 17.5% since the end of December.
The Dow was boosted by gains in  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) The company's shares rose 2% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc committed $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), boosting its chances of snatching a deal from Chevron.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co Inc rose more than 2% each after the drugmakers beat quarterly earnings estimates.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co jumped 4.5% after the industrial conglomerate's first-quarter profit rose and its negative cash flow was smaller than expected.
Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) rose after the card company beat estimates for quarterly profit.
The Fed's two-day meeting that ends Wednesday will be in focus for hints on the direction of U.S. interest rates.
Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hopes to make ""substantial progress"" with Chinese negotiators.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 45 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.56 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The department's Antitrust Division, headed by Makan Delrahim, is reviewing the deal to determine if it will lead to higher prices for consumers or to slower innovation, as critics allege. The Federal Communications Commission also must approve the transaction for it to go forward.
The recusal was first reported by the New York Post. 
In a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in December, Barr acknowledged owning a T-Mobile bond valued at $15,001 to $50,000 and two other T-Mobile bonds and a Sprint bond valued at less than $1,001. Those are to be sold within 90 days of his confirmation, which occurred on Feb. 14.
Barr had also recused himself from considering AT&T's plan to buy Time Warner, which the government opposed, because of his involvement with those companies. That deal has closed.
T-Mobile announced on Monday that the companies were extending a deadline to complete their deal to July 29. The two are among just four national wireless carriers, trailing  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T).

Regulators are expected to make a decision on the deal in early June. They will be weighing a potential loss of competition, and subsequently higher prices for consumers, against the prospect of a more powerful No. 3 wireless carrier which can work to build a faster, better 5G next generation wireless network.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:36PM ET</span>","GE cautious as profit rises, cash burn slows; shares, bonds rise","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co said on Tuesday it generated more profit and lost less cash than expected in the first quarter, suggesting an improving outlook under its new leader that sent its shares and bonds higher.
New Chief Executive Larry Culp cautioned, however, that the results stemmed largely from the timing of payments to suppliers and from customers, and did not alter GE's financial outlook for the year.
""One quarter is a data point not a trend,"" Culp said on a conference call with analysts. 
GE's profit from continuing operations more than tripled as sales rose in GE's aviation, oil and gas, and healthcare units. At the same time, negative cash flow from industrial business was $1.2 billion, much less than the $2.16 billion outflow that analysts, on average, were expecting.
Culp had set low earnings targets in March and warned that GE's industrial cash flow could be negative by as much as $2 billion.
GE's shares rose 4.5% to close at $10.17, after the call. They had risen more than 10% before the market opened.
GE bonds also rallied, extending a recovery in more than $100 billion of GE debt. Yields on dozens of longer-dated issues were at their lowest since Nov. 1. A $1 billion GE Capital bond with a 4% coupon due in July 2035 was up more than 1.5 cents at nearly 87 cents and a yield of 5.2%, compared with a low of 63 cents on the dollar last November to yield more than 8%.
Investors have been keen for a turnaround since GE named Culp last October to restore earnings and improve a stock price that has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016. 
GE took a string of multibillion-dollar writedowns last year, so the slowing in cash outflows in the latest quarter raised hopes that its fortunes have started to improve. 
GE's industrial free cash flow showed a ""much smaller outflow than we expected,"" said Julian Mitchell, an analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), and ""should drive a positive reaction in the stock.""
But while the Boston-based conglomerate stuck to its full-year financial forecast, it noted ""new risk"" from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jet, for which GE engines with partner  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA of France. The plane model was grounded worldwide last month after a second fatal accident in less than five months. 
Profit margins also contracted at GE's aviation, power and renewable energy businesses, the three core units that GE plans to retain as it undergoes a break-up announced last year. 
A 1.6 percentage point drop in GE's industrial margins in the quarter is a ""stark reminder of the challenges that the company still faces,"" said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody's. He added that he expects margins to be flat or slightly improved by year-end.
GE's cash balance was boosted mainly the $2.9 billion sale of locomotive business to Wabtec Corp.
Culp has said the 2019 ""reset"" of GE would result in negative cash flow at its most-troubled business, power, through 2020 before turning positive in 2021. GE wrote down $22 billion in goodwill at the unit last year.
In the latest quarter, power orders fell 14% and profit fell 71% to $80 million on revenue of $5.7 billion, down about 22% from a year earlier, GE said.
Some saw signs that the power unit's prospects will improve. ""This was a business that everyone gave up as dead ... but (it) is more than able to fend for itself,"" William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann told Reuters.
Earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE shareholders rose to $954 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $261 million a year earlier. 
On an adjusted basis, GE earned 14 cents per share. Analysts had expected 9 cents per share, on average. 

Total revenue fell 2% to $27.29 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $27.05 billion.

The four-month gains are the biggest since at least the turn of the century. But the significance of the gains have to be tempered somewhat because of the severity of the late 2018 downturn.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:16PM ET</span>",Uber takes IPO roadshow to New York as demand builds up,"By Joshua Franklin and Carl O'Donnell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and his top management team took the ride-hailing giant's investor roadshow for its initial public offering to New York on Tuesday, as demand for its shares already exceeded supply.
At a lunch presentation in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking New York's Central Park, where fusilli pasta and BLT club wraps were served to investors, Khosrowshahi said Uber's future was not as a ride-hailing company, but as a wide technology platform shaping logistics and transportation.
""Dara was very impressive, he did a good job articulating the story,"" said one of the investors who attended, who requested anonymity because the presentation was closed to the media.
Uber is set to price its $10 billion IPO on May 9, seeking a valuation of up to $90 billion. Investors attending the roadshow said Uber's IPO book was quickly oversubscribing, making a pop in the shares of the company on its first day of trading more likely. Uber declined to comment on how much demand there is for its IPO.
Uber executives arrived in New York after their roadshow in London on Monday. In a ballroom at Claridge’s, the five-star hotel in London’s wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened to Khosrowshahi and Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai talk about the company’s plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping.
In New York, Uber executives fielded questions ranging from autonomous driving to plans to enter into the grocery business. 
Uber has cautioned in its IPO filing that it may never make a profit, and faces hurdles such as increased regulation and local minimum wages that could hamper profitability.
Uber follows smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), which went public with a $24 billion valuation. Lyft's shares are down more than 17 percent since its IPO on March 28, amid investor skepticism over its path to profitability.
Khosrowshahi is also tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed Uber's culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.
Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO.

Uber's IPO is being led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).

The company reported earnings per share of $2.46 on revenue of $58.02 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $2.37 on revenue of $57.58 billion. That compared to EPS of $2.73 on revenue of $61.14 billion in the same period a year earlier.

1467,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:04PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Expected to Keep Rates on Hold
The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting on interest rates tomorrow.
The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to keep rates in the range of 2.25% to 2.5%, with fed funds futures pricing in a 98% chance of no move, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
If the FOMC makes any move this year, it’s expected to be a cut, with a more than 50% chance that rates are lower in September.
With the decision pretty much a foregone conclusion, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference will likely have the most market-moving impact, with investors looking for how the FOMC views economic growth and inflation.
2. Apple and AMD Jump After Hours
Techs look likely to rebound from today’s losses as investors cheered two postmarket earnings reports.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) beat on the top and bottom lines and guided revenue in line with forecasts. The company also boosted its quarterly dividend. Apple shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.
In the semiconductor sector, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) climbed 5% postmarket. The chipmaker reported a profit that beat expectations and revenue that was in line with expectations. Revenue guidance also matched forecasts.
3. ADP Payrolls, ISM Due
Along with the Fed tomorrow, there are plenty of economic indicators on the calendar. ADP will release its measure of private sector nonfarm employment at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT). On average, economists predict that payrolls rose by 181,000 in April.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Institute of Supply Management will release its manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI). Economists are predicting the PMI ticked down to 55 in April.
And March construction spending numbers arrive at the same time. Economists are predicting a rise of 0.3%."
1468,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>",Newmont Goldcorp suspends payments to villages near Mexico's largest gold mine,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Newmont Goldcorp Corp said on Tuesday it had suspended payments and social programs to workers, suppliers, and villages around its Mexico's largest gold mine in response to a blockade by a contractor and members of one of the 25 communities.
Newmont Goldcorp on Monday suspended operations at the Penasquito mine because of the month-long blockade.
Among the programs affected are elementary and high school grants, productive projects, trusts and social investments, the company said.
Mining companies around the world seek to earn the support of villages and towns near their mines by contributing to local development projects. 
Goldcorp's 2017 Mexico operations generated operating costs, wages and benefits, community contributions and government payments of $837 million, from $1.4 billion in revenue, the company said in its most recent sustainability report.
Michael Harvey, director of corporate affairs in Mexico for the company said the suspension of payments, first announced in a newspaper advertisement on Monday, began to take effect on Tuesday. 
""The blockade leaders are trying to extort us and our company will not give in to this extortion,"" Harvey said. 
The mine is part of the portfolio of Goldcorp, whose acquisition Newmont completed this month to become the world's biggest gold producer. It has faced similar problems in the past.
""Now being part of a larger company gives Penasquito greater strength to resist these extortion payments,"" Harvey told Reuters.
The company said the protest had blocked the mine's entrance and exit since March 27.
The miner alleges that a local trucking company and a group of people from San Juan de Cedros, one of the villages near the mine, demanded the company pay $442 million for the ""presumed effects on a body of water in the said community.""
Newmont said the protest leaders in private are more interested in demands for money than the water issue.
Felipe Pinedo, a leader of the blockade said allegations of extortion were a ""smokescreen.""
""They don't want to attend to a harm that they are inflicting on the communities,"" Pinedo told Reuters on Tuesday. 
On Monday, Pinedo said residents were determined the mine ""should go"" if the local water supply was not restored and guaranteed. 
""This blockade affects the income of more than 20,000 people,"" the miner's statement on Monday said, adding that more than 80 percent of the workers are from Zacatecas, the northern state in which the mine is located, and more than 500 from nearby villages.
The open-pit mine produced 272,000 ounces of gold in 2018, company figures show. It accounts for about 17 percent of Newmont Goldcorp's net asset value, according to Scotiabank.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 04:52PM ET</span>",Most U.S. small business preparing for a recession: Bank of America survey,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Small business owners around the country are preparing for a recession, according to a new survey by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
More than two-thirds of business owners surveyed by the bank said they had taken steps to prepare for an economic downturn, including setting cash aside or planning to reduce expenses. 
Of the 69 percent of owners who had started preparing for a recession, only 19 percent had opened a line of credit, a figure that Bank of America's head of small business Sharon Miller said was too low.
""When you need a line of credit, you often can't get one,"" she said in an interview. ""Business owners should be thinking about that now.""
There was less optimism about the U.S. economy than last year, the survey showed. Forty-eight percent of business owners felt the national economy would improve over the next year, down from 55 percent last fall. Concerns about healthcare costs and the impact of trade wars contributed to declining sentiment. 
Although the bank said it is important for businesses to be ready for a potential downturn, top executives pointed to growth in consumer spending and low unemployment to show the economy is still in good shape. 
""We continue to see a good, strong solid U.S. economy,"" said Chief Executive Brian Moynihan on a conference call earlier this month.
The Charlotte-based bank is looking to grow its unit that caters to businesses with fewer than 100 employees and less than $5 million in revenue by putting small business specialists in each of Bank of America's financial centers, Miller told Reuters.
Bank of America currently employs about 2,300 business specialists and has about 4,300 branches. 
Earlier this month, the second-largest bank by assets announced plans to expand its branch and ATM network to cover more than 90 percent of the U.S. population by 2021.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>","For investors, bloom is off Europe amid Brexit, yellow vest worries","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Matt Scuffham
BEVERLY HILLS (Reuters) - Europe, long a major destination of investor capital, is losing luster, say prominent bankers and asset managers, who are reducing exposure to the area because of concerns about issues ranging from Brexit to France's ""yellow vest"" protests.
Instead, investors and bankers at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills this week pointed to increasing U.S. prosperity, and many said they are doubling down on investments in the United States. Panelists and audience members, in contrast, expressed significant worries about what is happening across the Atlantic.
Among the concerns: Great Britain will experience a hard Brexit separation from Europe, resulting in financial calamities; ""yellow vest"" protesters demanding equality in France will push the country toward unsustainable economic policies; Italy is not dealing with underlying issues that sent it to a third recession in a decade; big banks across Europe, including  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), have not dealt with money-losing exposures stemming from the 2008 financial crisis; and the European Central Bank has run out of options to fix all the troubles on its own.
""My main concern is Europe,"" David Hunt, chief executive of PGIM, the asset management arm of U.S. life insurance company Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), said at the conference.
Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, which plowed money into Europe two years ago, agreed. ""You are in a freeze mode in Europe because of Brexit, the yellow vests, the lameduck leadership situation, and Italy,"" he told Reuters in an interview. SkyBridge had roughly 15 percent of its assets invested in Europe in 2017 but has reduced that to around 3 percent now, he added.
The two investors' comments reflected what others, ranging from a Swiss bank executive to U.S. money managers, expressed in interviews and on panels over the past few days. Confidence in Europe's prospects was a rare commodity.
Gross domestic product across the 19 countries that use the euro rose 0.4 percent in the first three months of 2019 from the prior period, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. That was better than economists had expected, but anemic when compared with U.S. growth of 3.2 percent in the first quarter.
Many at the Milken conference, which brings together globally prominent business leaders and major investors, 
said they have been moving money from investments in Europe to what they view as more stable assets in the United States.
Even though the U.S. stock market is in the 10th year of a bull run and credit markets are thought to be tenuous, conference attendees still saw more opportunities in them.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG's chief risk officer, Lara Warner, said the Swiss bank is most worried about exposure to Europe. She highlighted growth in the United States, saying that the Trump administration's posture toward the economy gives investors a better feeling about prospects ahead.
""There really are no more monetary policy and fiscal options open to Europe,"" she said. ""We are steering away from Europe.""
The U.S. Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold off on further rate hikes has fueled stock and credit markets and put a lid on the cost of consumer credit.
A number of Trump administration officials, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney spoke at the Milken conference. They participated in events that invoked the theme of increased prosperity.
Panelists said Europe was suffering from reduced lending by banks on account of over-zealous regulation since the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, said Deutsche Bank's failed attempt to combine with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) left unmet the region’s need for a dominant bank to emerge with the capability to support economic growth and compete globally.
""The discussion focused on the need for a German champion but what Europe needs is a European champion,"" he said.
Minerd, whose firm says it has more than $265 billion in assets under management, added that the European Union needed to make structural changes to prosper but was unlikely to do so in the immediate future.

""The only hope Europe has in the near term is to kick the can down the road and try to keep the experiment going,"" he said.

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Borealis Strategic Capital Partners, which invests in new hedge funds, has written its first check to commit capital to Europe-oriented stock fund Vor Capital, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Vor Capital launched a year ago with a plan to invest in mid-sized European internet companies. It is run by Brant Rubin, who previously worked for hedge fund Luxor Capital.
Borealis did not answer a call for comment. Vor did not return an email seeking comment. 
The sources did not say how much Borealis was committing but one said it would bring Vor Capital's total assets under management to roughly $100 million.
Many institutional investors are giving hedge funds the cold shoulder, criticizing their high fees and generally lackluster returns. But investors are still eager to find promising newcomers who could outperform existing rivals and often wait until an established investor has made a commitment that could prompt others to follow along.
During 2018, its first year in business, Vor delivered returns of 10 percent, a person familiar with the returns said. Since January the fund has returned roughly 15 percent and it made money in December 2018, a time when most hedge funds lost money, the source said.
The average hedge fund gained roughly 6 percent in the first three months of 2019 after having lost 5 percent last year, Hedge Fund Research data show.
Borealis plans to provide start-up capital to roughly four to six funds, including some that might pursue activist strategies, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
The firm is run by Scott Schweighauser and traces its roots to Aurora Investment Management, a fund of funds that once managed $14 billion in assets. Schweighauser was Aurora's president and oversaw the firm's liquidation in 2016 after its owner Natixis Global Asset Management decided to shut it down.
Borealis is getting into the seeding business at a time it is becoming ever tougher for new hedge funds to sign up clients. Firms like Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, Paloma Partners, Protege Partners and Reservoir Capital Group also make start-up investments with new hedge funds.

Fast-growing countries such as China and India have been a focus area for Mondelez over the last few years, with the company tailoring products and marketing to the local regions.
Core, or organic, net revenue, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and currency fluctuations, rose 3.7 percent, beating analysts' average estimate of a 2.3 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Core revenue in emerging markets rose 8.4 percent. 
Pricing in Latin America rose 9.9 percentage points as Mondelez, like other food companies, had to hike prices of cookies, gums and chocolates in the face of rising raw material and transportation costs. 
Net earnings attributable to the company, which also makes Cadbury chocolates, fell to $914 million, or 63 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $1.05 billion, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 65 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 61 cents.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 03:55PM ET</span>",Frothy markets turn dealmaker Warren Buffett into a bankroller,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - For Warren Buffett, when all else fails, repeat what works.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's plan to inject $10 billion into Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) extends Buffett's strategy of extracting high-yielding preferred shares and stock warrants to fatten his company's bottom line.
The move came as the billionaire slogs through the fourth year of a drought in finding major acquisitions for Berkshire, which ended 2018 with nearly $112 billion of cash.
Berkshire already owns more than 90 businesses such as auto insurer Geico, BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.
""This is one of the best things Berkshire could do,"" said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, which invests one-sixth of its $1.5 billion of assets in Berkshire. ""This is a template for a model that has been very good for the company.""
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Occidental offered last week to buy Anadarko for $38 billion, topping the $33 billion that  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) had agreed to pay.
The companies are battling for Anadarko's prized assets in West Texas' Permian shale oil field. Anadarko said on Monday it had agreed to start negotiations with Occidental.
Buffett entered the battle two months after he said in his annual shareholder letter that acquisitions of whole companies did not look imminent because prices were ""sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects.""
He will likely be questioned about Occidental and Berkshire's cash at his company's annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska, which typically draws more than 40,000 people.
""This transaction falls short of an outright acquisition by BRK, something the market is craving,"" CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert wrote. She rates Berkshire a ""hold.""
LENDER OF LAST RESORT
Buffett has been seen since the global financial crisis as a lender of last resort to blue-chip companies desiring a financial boost and his imprimatur.
From 2008 to 2011, Berkshire invested more than $25 billion in high-yielding stocks and bonds of such companies as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Harley-Davidson.
Occidental follows that template.
Berkshire would buy $10 billion of preferred stock throwing off $800 million of dividends annually for at least 10 years.
The 8 percent payout is roughly double the yields on Occidental's longer-term debt.
Buffett would also get warrants to buy up to 80 million Occidental shares at $62.50 each, 4 percent above their Monday closing price.
Analysts said Berkshire's financing looked expensive for Occidental but could help it buy Anadarko without taking on too much leverage.
""We are thrilled to have Berkshire Hathaway's financial support,"" Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said.
And for Buffett, fear of overpaying may be allayed by the dividends and the knowledge that as a preferred shareholder he ranks ahead of common stockholders if something goes wrong.
The Bank of America investment has been among Berkshire's most lucrative in recent years.
In 2017, Berkshire exercised warrants to acquire 700 million common shares, which it paid for by swapping $5 billion of preferred shares it had bought six years earlier.
By the end of 2018, Berkshire owned 918.9 million Bank of America shares worth $22.6 billion, its largest common stock investment other than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and sat on an $11 billion profit.
Other investments have been less successful.
Berkshire received since-redeemed preferred stock in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) when that packaged food company was created in a 2015 merger.

But in February, Berkshire took a $3 billion writedown on its 26.7 percent stake in Kraft Heinz, which failed to adapt to changing consumer tastes. Buffett has said Berkshire overpaid in the merger.

LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC has reshuffled its global banking division as former JP Morgan banker Greg Guyett put his stamp on the business, which has been under pressure in recent years.
Under Guyett, who took on responsibility for the business in February, HSBC has appointed Patrick Nolan, vice chairman of global banking, to global head of corporate banking, following a turbulent period for HSBC's investment banking business.
The division, which advises clients on finance and mergers, has lost senior dealmakers and slipped down the rankings in merger advisory and equity capital markets amid internal questions over its strategic direction.
Hugo Heath moves to the vice chairman role, while Peter Enns and Matthew Wallace become global co-heads of corporate finance coverage, overseeing HSBC's teams of sector coverage bankers, an internal memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday showed.
A spokesman for HSBC confirmed the contents of the memo, which also showed that among the 16 appointments mentioned in Friday's reshuffle, only one went to a woman, Katia Bouazza, who became head of global banking for Latin America.
HSBC has faced criticism from insiders for the male-dominated nature of its investment bank, and the lender has the worst gender pay gap among major British firms at 61 percent.
The bank said it is working to address this by including gender-balanced shortlists and promoting more women.

Robin Phillips, a former co-head of the division along with Guyett, left in February.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",California synagogue shooting casts harsh light on mutual-fund darling Cloudflare,"By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - The gunmen accused of attacking U.S. synagogues and New Zealand mosques over the past six months brewed their ideas on online hate sites, pulling U.S. cyber-defense firm Cloudflare Inc into a debate on the balance between online speech and security.
The attacks have prompted some investors to ask fresh questions about the company's services allowing the sites to mask their real locations on the Internet to thwart hackers. That is one of the core services used by clients that have more than 12 million Internet properties, including government agencies and major ecommerce operations.
""The temperature has turned up,"" said Doug Kramer, general counsel for the privately-held San Francisco-based company. 
Investors ask questions after Cloudflare's services were linked to reports about shooters' activity on hate sites, Kramer said in an interview this week.
""They understandably want to know how we think about these things,"" Kramer said, declining to name investors.
Fidelity Investments and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) Inc's Franklin Templeton funds hold stakes in Cloudflare. Both declined to comment.
The alleged gunman who killed one person and wounded three at a San Diego synagogue on Saturday, as well as one who massacred 50 people at New Zealand mosques in March, had posted hate-filled screeds on the 8chan message board, a Cloudflare client. The man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October did likewise on Gab, also a Cloudflare client, according to Internet records.
Cloudflare helped both those sites mask their real Internet protocol addresses. The service obfuscates where its customers are hosted, making it more difficult to hold them accountable, said Micah Schaffer, a technology policy consultant and former  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) executive.
'CLOAKING' PEOPLE
Cloudflare does not passively move information, said Alex Stamos, a Stanford University professor who previously served in top cybersecurity roles at  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA). 
""They are cloaking these companies and cloaking the people behind them,"" Stamos told the information security ""Risky Business"" podcast shortly after the New Zealand shootings.
Stamos squared off against Islamic State terrorists as Facebook's chief security officer and said, compared to ISIS, white supremacist terrorists can more easily find a home on sites like 8chan.
""Nobody was willing to be the official ISIS chatboard, but 8chan is willing to be that (for white supremacists), and that changes the entire texture of the effort to fight it,"" he said in a phone interview. Officials at 8chan did not respond to requests for comment.
But Kramer said Cloudflare treats all clients the same, citing far more banal content.
""It's stuff like cat photos and family reunion photos,"" Kramer said, adding that Cloudflare does not believe its role is to monitor the legality and appropriateness of content on client sites. ""If we do that, it gets messy really quickly.""
One notable exception came in 2017 when Cloudflare stopped routing the traffic for neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer after the site falsely labeled the company as a secret supporter of the hate ideology.
Cloudflare is private, but the company is interested in an initial public offering that could value it at more than $3.5 billion, Reuters reported in October, citing people familiar with the matter.
Fidelity funds, including Contrafund, value their investment in Cloudflare at more than $100 million, according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Cloudflare said it has never provided law enforcement with a feed of customer content. However, should law enforcement contact the company about unlawful activity, it will provide information about the hosting provider, as needed, the company said in an email.
Brittan Heller, a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said Cloudflare is in an awkward position dealing with clients that run hate sites.

""Sometimes they have to hold their nose at the clients,"" she said.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 12:54PM ET</span>",European regulators fear Deutsche Bank U.S. stress test failure: source,"By Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is in danger of failing U.S. stress tests, a European bank supervisor told Reuters, adding to pressure on Germany's biggest lender to make changes to its investment bank after failed merger talks with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
European Central Bank regulators are concerned that Deutsche Bank's standing has weakened since it flunked U.S. stress tests in 2015, 2016 and 2018 and a repeat would cause a bigger dent in confidence among customers and business partners.
The Federal Reserve, which will complete its examination of Deutsche Bank's U.S. operations in the coming weeks, could also impose conditions curbing its Wall Street investment bank, further undermining its earning power, the official said.
A spokesman said Deutsche Bank had ""invested heavily to ensure that the bank meets regulators' demands and has made significant progress"". The Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce the results by July, and the ECB declined to comment. 
While Deutsche Bank had made significant improvements in recent years and eased relations with the Federal Reserve, systems it uses to monitor its business and risks, which determine how much capital it needs, remained weak.
Deutsche Bank's future in the United States, where it opened 40 years ago with just 76 employees before expanding rapidly in 1999 by buying Bankers Trust, is already in doubt.
Investors and credit rating agencies have expressed worries about Deutsche Bank's investment bank, which accounts for most of the 9,000 people it now employs in the United States, after last week's collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank. 
""The key challenge for Deutsche Bank remains to demonstrate that the investment bank can effectively compete ... and earn acceptable and stable returns,"" ratings agency Moody's said.
Rating agency Fitch said Deutsche Bank's investment bank ""has yet to show that it can recover lost market share and navigate an uncertain market environment."" 
Both agencies have the group tagged for a possible credit-rating downgrade. 
In the first quarter revenue at Deutsche Bank's investment bank, which accounts for more than half its overall revenue, slid 13 percent from a year ago. Costs were higher than its income.
Nonetheless, Deutsche Bank's management is signaling no major changes as it aims to be a credible competitor to U.S. powerhouses JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing told analysts last week that he would continue to review strategic alternatives but that it was ""non-negotiable"" that the bank remains ""globally relevant"", including in the U.S. and Asia.
Soon after assuming office in a sudden management reshuffle last year, Sewing made cuts at the investment bank, mainly affecting the loss-making equities division and the business that serves hedge funds in New York and London.
But some investors have been calling for more drastic measures, with concerns heightened after six weeks of frantic yet fruitless merger talks.
Berlin had pushed to create a national champion and end questions over the future of the banks. 

But management on both sides called off talks, blaming a need for capital, restructuring costs and difficulties implementing a deal.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Mallinckrodt shares drop after U.S. joins cases over expensive drug,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has joined a pair of whistleblower lawsuits alleging a drugmaker now owned by  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc improperly promoted an expensive multiple sclerosis treatment and paid kickbacks to doctors who prescribed the drug.
News of the department's decision to intervene in the lawsuits after conducting an investigation into the whistleblowers' allegations sent the stock price of Mallinckrodt Plc down nearly 14 percent on Tuesday.
The lawsuits, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, claimed Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which Mallinckrodt acquired in 2014, defrauded government healthcare programs by illegally marketing H.P. Acthar Gel.
The drug is used to treat infantile spasms and multiple sclerosis. In 2007, Questcor hiked Acthar's price for a single a vial from about $2,000 to $23,000, one of the lawsuits said. The price of the drug has since soared to more than $40,000.
Last year, Acthar represented 35 percent of Mallinckrodt's $3.2 billion in net sales.
CNN first reported on the case on Tuesday. Mallinckrodt in a statement said it disagrees with the allegations and has been in ""advanced settlement talks with the government over the past several months.""
Mallinckrodt's shares were trading at $15.77, down 13.97 percent, at midday on Tuesday.
The lawsuits were filed in 2012 and 2013 by former Questcor employees Charles Strunck and Scott Clark under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims.
The lawsuits are filed under seal so the government can investigate their claims. The Justice Department following an investigation may intervene in the cases, which is typically a major boost for them. 
In his complaint, Strunck alleged Questcor in an effort to boost sales paid doctors illegal kickbacks in the form of bribes, speaker fees and consulting deals in exchange for promoting and prescribing Acthar.
His lawsuit also alleged that Questcor's sales staff used deceptive and misleading marketing tactics to promote Acthar for uses and treatment regimens not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The Justice Department in court filings in both lawsuits made public on March 11 said it was intervening in the cases and planned to file its own complaint within 90 days. The lawsuits were then unsealed.

Mallinckrodt in January 2017 agreed to pay $100 million to resolve claims that Questcor violated antitrust laws by sharply increasing the price of Acthar while ensuring that no rival medicine appeared on the market.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 11:38AM ET</span>","Lyft elevates GM first-quarter profit, pickups in driver's seat","By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted by revaluations of shares it holds in ride-hailing company  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP). 
Excluding the benefits of those revaluations, GM delivered results in line with analyst predictions, driven mostly by highly lucrative pickup truck sales in the U.S. market. 
The No. 1 U.S. automaker's shares were down 2.7 percent in morning trading.
The earnings came after a 7 percent decline in U.S. new-vehicle sales in the first quarter, in which smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's pickup trucks outsold GM's. 
""We remain concerned with the U.S. auto cycle, both from a pricing and volume perspective,"" Buckingham Research analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note. ""Moreover, specific to GM, we are concerned about recently monthly pick-up truck and market share stats.""
GM's sales in China also dropped almost 20 percent and profit there declined 37 percent. Auto sales in China industrywide fell 2.8 percent last year and were down again in the first quarter.
GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters that the Chinese market remains ""volatile.""
""From an economic standpoint, there are green shoots,"" she said. ""But we have yet to see that translate to vehicle demand.""
GM will launch 20 new models in China in 2019, most of them in the second half of the year. 
In the United States, the automaker had around four months supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck on the ground as of the beginning of April, a high level in an auto market that overall is expected to decline in 2019.
CFO Suryadevara said that the company's inventory would be brought down over the course of the year without use of heavy consumer discounts. 
She said that tariffs and higher commodity prices would cost GM around $1 billion in 2019.
As recently as late last year, GM executives insisted the automaker's Cruise self-driving unit would launch a commercial ride-hailing service by the end of 2019. 
However, when asked several times on Tuesday when that service would launch, neither CFO Suryadevara nor Chief Executive Mary Barra would provide a date, repeatedly responding that GM's efforts would be ""gated by safety."" 
GM said it is ""bullish"" on pickup truck sales for the rest of 2019 as more versions of its new Silverado hit dealer showrooms and its heavy-duty trucks launch in the second half of the year. 
Last week, rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market and said it was confident its 2019 results would be better than those of last year.
Ford said last week it will invest $500 million in U.S. electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC, joining Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in backing the potential rival to Silicon Valley's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. According to sources, GM had previously been in talks with Rivian about a possible investment.
GM CEO Barra told analysts on Tuesday the automaker will produce a full range of electric vehicles, including an all-electric pickup truck, but she did not provide details.
General Motors has preferred shares in Peugeot from when it sold its German Opel unit to the Paris-based automaker in 2017. Lyft completed an initial public offering at the end of the first quarter and the value of GM's stake rose $300 million. The increased value of those stakes added 31 cents per share to GM's first-quarter profit.
GM reported a first-quarter net profit of $2.2 billion, or $1.48 per share, up from $1.05 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-items, the company earned $1.41 per share. 
Analysts on average expected $1.11. 
The company's revenue for the quarter fell to $34.9 billion from $36.1 billion a year earlier. 
GM reiterated its full-year 2019 profit outlook for earnings per share of between $6.50 and $7.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Former Barclays trader claims bank fired him for misconduct after whistleblowing,"By Lawrence White and Jonathan Stempel
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) allegedly pressured a former senior trader in the United States to ignore internal risk controls and then forced him out when he raised complaints, according to a public court document seen by Reuters, the latest in a string of allegations about the British bank's handling of whistleblowers.
Brian La Belle, the bank's former head of commercial real estate trading, alleged his bosses compelled him to perform trades and contact clients in August and December 2017 while he was on mandatory leave, contrary to regulations.
He also alleges in the court filing that managers called him to complain that he had raised concerns in emails about being made to work during 'block leave', a period of absence required by regulators to ensure bosses can detect rogue trading and other potential misconduct.
When La Belle raised concerns with compliance officials at the bank he was first sidelined before he was sacked in Aug. 2018, he alleged in New York district court filing dated April 29.
A spokeswoman for Barclays declined to comment, citing a policy of not commenting on ongoing legal proceedings.
La Belle's alleged ousting came at a time when the bank's handling of whistleblowers was under intense scrutiny after its Chief Executive Jes Staley was in May 2018 fined by British regulators for attempting to unmask one in contravention of rules designed to protect them.
The 1.1 million pound ($1.4 million) fine ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority was the first such punishment imposed on a sitting CEO of a major British bank. It cast a pall over Staley's efforts to show the bank has improved its culture since the 2008 crisis.
Barclays launched a review of its whistleblowing procedures in 2017, and in its 2018 annual report published in February this year it said it had implemented recommendations from the review including creating a centralized team to review all complaints.
After La Belle complained internally about being asked to complete trades while he was supposed to be on leave, he said that Larry Kravetz, one of his managers, asked him on a phone call: ""How could you be so fucking stupid to put that in an email.""
Kravetz could not immediately be reached for comment.
La Belle said he raised further complaints about separate deals that he said were too risky but were pushed through nonetheless, before the bank ultimately fired him. He is seeking reinstatement and over $10 million in compensation.
The case continues in New York on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wizz Air's chief executive is confident his low-cost carrier can grow in Britain and tackle the challenges presented by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Jozsef Varadi told Reuters on Tuesday that Wizz still had work to do to meet EU rules after Brexit but said it was time for Britain to ""just get it done and move beyond Brexit"" as the deadline for the country's departure has been pushed back.
""We remain very bullish, and very committed to the UK market. Even if I look at the current performance, it is pretty solid,"" Varadi said in an interview, adding that he found the furor around Brexit ""tiring"".
""I don't really care how Brexit plays out, to be honest. I think I would like to see the end of it, whatever it is.""
Budapest-based Wizz Air, which is focused on central and eastern Europe, said this month its net profit for the year would be in the upper half of its guidance. 
That contrasts with bigger rivals, such as easyJet (LON:EZJ), which have been cautious about how Brexit will affect demand.
Varadi said Wizz had grown 30 percent in London since the Brexit vote and that demand was still robust.
The new deadline for Britain's departure from the EU is set for Oct. 31. Travel firm Thomas Cook said on Monday holidaymakers were delaying decisions on where to go and opting for non-EU destinations due to the impasse.
Wizz does not compete with easyJet or Ryanair on busy UK routes to the Mediterranean, but does offer routes from London to fast-growing non-EU destinations like Georgia.
Varadi said Brexit posed complications for airlines, but added: ""I don't think that we're going to end up with a disastrous scenario on aviation.""
Airlines that will no longer be majority owned by EU nationals once Britain leaves the EU are set to lose their right to fly within the bloc after Brexit due to share ownership rules.
Varadi said Wizz had ""some work to do"" on this issue, as it was not close to being 50 percent owned by EU nationals outside of Britain. He said he was seeking more EU investors, but added shareholders could be disenfranchised to ensure rules were met.
Like other airlines, Wizz has clauses in its articles of association which can allow it to remove voting rights from all non-EU shareholders as a last resort to comply with the rules.
Varadi said Wizz had set up a subsidiary in Britain in a bid to protect flights between the EU and the UK after Brexit, as well as flights from the UK to elsewhere.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 09:50AM ET</span>",Jaguar to move Land Rover Defender production to Slovakia,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will move the assembly of its Land Rover Defender to its plant in Slovakia to make room for newer models at its factory in Britain, the company said on Tuesday.
The Defender 4X4, which is designed and engineered in Britain, will be unveiled later this year, JLR, owned by India's Tata Motors, said. 
""This decision is in parallel with plans for significant investment at the company's Solihull plant in the UK to support the production of the next generation of flagship Range Rover and Land Rover models,"" JLR said. 
This is the second model to be built at the Slovakia plant, which was officially launched in October, where JLR expects to hit annual production of 100,000 cars by 2020.
The plant was built with an initial capacity of 150,000 vehicles and started by taking over production of the carmaker's Discovery model.
The British government has been wary of carmakers moving production outside the country after the industry warned that it would face possible risks if Britain's impending exit from the European Union is disorderly. 
The risks, including delays to the supply of parts and finished models, new customs bureaucracy, the need to re-certify cars and an up to 10 percent tariff on finished vehicles, have forced carmakers to draw up contingency plans and even briefly shut production at their plants.

Together JLR, Mini, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) and Peugeot's Vauxhall, branded as Opel in the rest of Europe, built over 750,000 of Britain's 1.52 million cars last year.

Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) set a negative tone for the tech sector, reporting its slowest revenue growth in three years over the first quarter.
Among positive reports from Dow components, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) delivered better-than-expected revenue and profit, while U.S. same-store sales also beat consensus.
Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also topped estimates and both lifted their full-year guidance.
Still ahead for a busy day of earnings, the spotlight will fall on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when the iPhone-maker reports after the market close.
In M&A news, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) fell over 3% on fears of dilution after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) said it will invest $10 billion in the company to help finance the acquisition of Anadarko (NYSE:APC).

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were in Beijing for another round of negotiations with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that will continue next week in Washington D.C.
Mnuchin said Tuesday that he hopes to make “substantial progress”, without giving further details.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, began its two-day meeting on Tuesday amid expectations that it will keep interest rates on hold. At its March meeting, the Fed indicated that it expects to hold off from hiking rates for the rest of the year, after lowering its growth forecast for the year.
Although data released last week showed that growth in the U.S. economy unexpectedly accelerated in the first quarter, the expansion was boosted by gains in trade and inventories which may be transitory. The core personal consumption expenditures price index, generally considered to be the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, cooled off in March, supporting arguments for a pause in policy tightening.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting ends on Wednesday.

The agreement would allow for Ford's workers to transition from employment with the U.S. automaker to a potential buyer, if a deal closes. The pact includes an exit package for workers, although the details have not been disclosed, as well as psychological support. 
Ford had announced earlier this year it would shut its Sao Bernardo do Campo plant https://reut.rs/2V72C4q, the company's oldest in the country, and exit the heavy truck business in South America, which is based in that factory.
The decision left the future uncertain for some 3,000 workers and triggered long strikes, paralyzing production for weeks at the sprawling plant. It also prompted the governor of the state of Sao Paulo, where Sao Bernardo is located, to act as a broker to try to find a buyer for the plant that might be able to maintain the jobs. 
Local manufacturer CAOA, which already produces cars for China's Chery and Korea's Hyundai, has said it is in talks to buy the plant. A representative for CAOA said on Tuesday the company had no further updates on the negotiations.

Ford has also announced layoffs at a separate plant, located in Camaçari in the northeast state of Bahia, where the company has said it has 700 workers in excess of its needs.

Eight brokerages cut their price targets for the platform's owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc after the release of its results on Monday, helping knock 8 percent - or around $70 billion - off one of the New York market's most popular stocks.
Much of the commentary focused on Google's drive, like other social media companies including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), to remove fake and harmful content from its platforms, and the rising costs of doing so.
In a conference call with analysts on Monday, the company's management talked about making hundreds of product changes every quarter, but refused to give examples of changes, making analysts suspicious that the company may be hiding a trend that points to more dramatic damage to future growth. 
""The fact is we aren't sure what changes GOOGL made in the quarter that drove the deceleration and this is something the Street must figure out,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
Alphabet, which gets most of its revenue from ads, said its quarterly revenue rose 17 percent to $36.3 billion, but that was still about $1 billion short of Wall Street's average estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We view the lack of specificity around product changes as a new overhang, with investors already somewhat concerned about the impact of competition, regulation, and disruptive technologies,"" Baird analysts said.
Advertisers on YouTube, bought by Google more than a decade ago and now a strong earner, have been pressuring the company to ensure that their ads do not appear to be sponsoring adult or offensive content.
To counter a rise in such content, Alphabet has added thousands of reviewers and developed automated software to take down problematic posts faster. YouTube has also made changes that reduce recommendations for content that comes close to violating its guidelines or that misinforms in harmful ways.
""We believe the algorithm changes build on efforts in 4Q18 when it removed 2.4 million channels and 8.8 million videos,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said.

The consensus was also that Tuesday's losses for now are a blip. Out of 43 brokerages covering the stock, only two have a ""hold"" rating and all others have ""buy"" or higher ratings.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>",How to train your machine: JPMorgan FX algos learn to trade better,"By Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), a top player in the $5.1 trillion-a-day global currency market has started applying a new technology that enables machine-trading programs to learn from previous trades and search for the most profitable way to execute them.
Algorithmic trading is a growing trend in currency markets where banks have cut back on trading teams, relying more on automated computing strategies to trade efficiently. 
Algos, as these programs are known, are used by market makers to search at lightening speed for platforms with deeper liquidity pools or break up large orders into tiny bits tor reduce market impact. 
But large banks have been investing millions of dollars into technology to grab a greater share of the algo trading market.
JPMorgan told Reuters its new algorithm -- named DNA or Deep Neural Network for Algo Execution -- effectively combined what a multitude of algos currently do, into a single strategy and allowed the framework to judge how a client order should be executed.
For example, a typical time-weighted average price order executed by an algorithm may aim to buy a particular amount of currency over a few minutes or hours. But if the order is not executed within that time frame, the machine will trade aggressively toward the end to buy the required amount.
The new algo aims to take that decision-making process one step further by determining on how best to execute the transaction, based on results of past trades. 
The algo has already been deployed for trading G7 currencies such as the euro, dollar and sterling, where it has access to data from thousands of past trades. 
""The objective of an algo is to minimize market impact by executing in an efficient and timely manner,"" Chi Nzelu, head of macro eCommerce at JP Morgan, told Reuters. 
""What we have done is establish a neural network using a machine learning technique which determines how to place the order, at what price and execution style.""
Unlike equities which trade on exchanges, currency trading takes place on a multitude of platforms, enabling the usage of such automated trading strategies.
Trading platform EBS estimates as much as 70 percent of orders on its platform now originate from algorithms, whereas in 2004, all trading was undertaken by humans.
JP Morgan's own trading platform too has seen algorithmic turnover surge. 
Order volumes of over $5 million rose 50 percent on an annual basis, and 80 percent of orders were driven by algos, the bank said, adding that December had set a record for its algo franchise in terms of orders as a proportion of spot turnover. 

A report by Greenwich Associates last week found JP Morgan and Citibank were at the top of the field in of electronic currency trading, which now accounts for 80 percent of global turnover.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Siemens pips GE in race for $14 billion Iraq electricity infrastructure rebuild,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Siemens is well placed to win the bulk of orders flowing from a $14 billion scheme to rebuild Iraq's electricity infrastructure following years of war, the country's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said in Berlin on Tuesday.
The announcement, at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, is a blow to arch-rival GE, which has also been in the running to upgrade the country's power grid.
Speaking after bilateral talks between the two leaders, Abdul-Mahdi said the German engineering group had a good chance of being awarded a majority of contracts generated by the project.
In a statement, Siemens said it had already signed three contracts worth a total of $700 million - one to build a 500 MW gas-fired power plant, one to upgrade 40 gas turbines and another to install dozens of substations and transformers across Iraq.
Last year, Iraqi officials said they had come under heavy pressure from the U.S. government to choose GE over the German company.
As part of the deal, Siemens has committed to building a health clinic, donating $60 million dollars of software to Iraq's universities, and providing training to 1,000 Iraqis. 
Over the longer term, the roadmap signed between Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser and Electricity Minister Luay al-Khateeb, envisages building new generation capacity, upgrading existing power plants and expanding transmission grids.
""We are also committed to supporting Iraq in arranging financing for the projects, creating attractive jobs and opportunities for small and medium enterprises,"" Kaeser said in the company's statement.
Iraq was engulfed in the overspill from Syria's civil war in 2014, when Islamic State militants grabbed large swathes of the country.

Since the militant group's loss of its last piece of territory in March, Iraq has become a target of Western and Gulf investment and aid interest, as Riyadh and Washington seek to counter Iran's growing influence in the country.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and slightly raised its earnings forecast for the year, as the largest U.S. drugmaker reined in costs and recorded higher sales of cancer drug Ibrance and pneumonia vaccine Prevnar.
Shares of the company rose 1 percent to $39.98 in trading before the bell.
To push growth and reduce bureaucracy, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has ordered a reorganisation of Pfizer into three businesses since taking over in January. Analysts are impatiently awaiting the changes that will spur growth for the company in the next few years.
Pfizer expects mid-single-digit operational revenue growth from post-2020 through 2025, said Bourla.
Meanwhile, the company is relying on its growth drivers such as Ibrance and Prevnar. 
Ibrance brought in sales of $1.13 billion during the quarter, up 21.4 percent from a year earlier, just ahead of analysts' estimates of $1.12 billion. Prevnar raked in $1.49 billion, beating the average estimate of $1.39 billion. 
""Overall we think these results are good enough given the pressure the stock has felt in recent weeks, but probably do not do much to change the fundamental debates around the stock,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Vamil Divan said.
Pfizer is under pressure as one of its biggest drugs, Lyrica, faces generic competition. The company, therefore, has been investing in cancer treatments and gene therapies, and expects to gain approval for a new heart drug, touted as a potential blockbuster, later this year.
It has also signed a joint venture agreement with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc to form the world's biggest consumer health business, with brands such as Advil and Chapstick, by the second half of the year.
Pfizer pushed its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast marginally higher to between $2.83 and $2.93 , from a prior estimate of $2.82 to $2.92. It also reiterated its full-year revenue target of $52 billion to $54 billion. 
Excluding special items, the company earned 85 cents per share, beating analysts' estimate of 75 cents.
Net income rose 9 percent to $3.88 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarter.
Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $13.12 billion, ahead of estimates of $12.99 billion.

During the first quarter, McDonald's launched a new two for $5 deal, tweaked its breakfast menu to add donut sticks, and offered applewood smoked bacon with a selection of its burgers and breakfast sandwiches.
The company is modernizing its stores by introducing digital menus and adding wooden tables and faux leather chairs as it seeks to attract diners in a competitive market.
Those efforts helped drive a 4.5 percent growth in same-store sales in the United States, beating the 3.03 percent rise expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES. The beat was also its first in four quarters. 
Net income fell to $1.33 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $1.38 billion, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.78 per share. Total revenue fell about 4 percent to $4.96 billion, due to its move to franchise a majority of its restaurants. 

Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.75 per share on revenue of $4.93 billion.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Indonesian-Chinese consortium building a high-speed rail project between the capital Jakarta and the textiles hub of Bandung expects to earn $18 billion from developing satellite towns and industrial centers along the line, an official said.
The rail project, part of Beijing's sweeping Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond, and was delayed for nearly three years over land ownership issues. 
State-owned construction company Wikya Kayra heads the Indonesian side of the project, and CEO Tumiyana - who uses only one name - told reporters the company expected to book 266 trillion rupiah ($18.67 billion) from four train-oriented developments by 2070.
The Indonesian side, which also includes state rail company KAI, owns 60 percent while the Chinese side, led by the China Railway Engineering Corporation, holds 40 percent. 
Construction on the rail line finally kicked into gear in 2018 and is financed principally by a $4.5 billion loan from China's Development Bank.
The project is the most high-profile of the Belt and Road projects in Indonesia. China's ambassador to Indonesia, Xiao Qian, last month described it as ""the first high-speed rail of Southeast Asia"". 
Tumiyana said that 15 percent of the line has been completed, with 60 percent to be finished by the end of 2019. 
Analysts say the consortium's plan to develop four new towns and industrial centers mimics China's own approach to high-speed rail development.
""This seems like it's copying the general model of China's urban development - if you build it, they will come,"" said Nick Marro, a China analyst at the Economic Intelligence Unit.
One of the sites previously visited by Reuters on an old tea plantation is due to be transformed into a sleek 5,000 hectare city with high-rise blocks and the campus of a new university.
Indonesian and Chinese officials told Reuters they consider the project's success a gauge for future cooperation on infrastructure.
Indonesian vice-president Yusuf Kalla recently headed a delegation to China's BRI forum, where it pitched to Chinese companies for up to $91 billion of infrastructure projects.
Jakarta insists on a business-to-business structure for all potential BRI deals instead of China's traditional government-to-government loan format, which has limited the amount of overall projects.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>",Supervisors ignored Russian warnings over money laundering at Danske: document,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia's Central Bank sent warnings in 2007 and 2013 to Estonian and Danish financial supervisors over suspect transactions worth billion of dollars at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank but they were largely ignored, a confidential EU document shows.
The EU paper, seen by Reuters, is the outcome of an investigation by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and details for the first time the extent of supervisory shortcomings in the two countries over the Danske case.
The EBA investigation followed the disclosure last year of a money-laundering scandal at Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, which has admitted that 200 billion euros of suspicious transactions flowed through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The EBA document cites internal communications between the Russian Central Bank and the Estonian and Danish supervisors in which Moscow warned of money laundering risks and tax evasion linked to payments to clients of the Estonian branch of Danske Bank.
The EBA document showed that regulators did not take sufficient action to address risks after the Russian warnings, in what the EBA said was a breach of EU rules. 
Earlier this month, the EU's national banking supervisors, who control the EBA, rejected the watchdog's proposal on the rule breach and effectively blocked further action against the Estonian and Danish regulators.
The two regulators from Estonia and Denmark and the Russian Central Bank did not respond to Reuters requests for a comment. The EBA declined to comment. 
In a letter to the Commission dated April 26, the EBA said national supervisors acknowledged failings in Estonian and Danish financial supervision but they did not consider them to mean EU law had been broken. 
EU lawmaker Sven Giegold, who sits on the EU parliament's committee on financial crime, said in a letter to the EU Commission that the EU executive should start legal proceedings against Denmark and Estonia for their flaws in applying EU laws.
""The case of the Danske Bank is not closed for us, regardless of the decision of EBA,"" EU justice commissioner Vera Jourova said in a statement, without elaborating on whether Brussels will open a legal procedure on this case. 
""DOUBTFUL TRANSACTIONS""
Danske Bank lowered its outlook for 2019 after a disappointing first quarter, due in part to the effects of the impact of the scandal.
The EBA document showed that a few months after Danske Bank had acquired Finland's Sampo Bank and its Estonian business in February 2007, the Russian Central Bank sent a warning to the Danish and Estonia authorities.
In a letter dated June 8, 2007, the Russian Central Bank alleged that ""clients of Sampo Bank permanently participate in financial transactions of doubtful origin"" worth billions of rubles monthly. 
The Central Bank's letter alleged that Sampo's clients resided mostly in offshore jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Britain, noting these clients were receiving transfers from Russian shell companies that were not justified by real exchanges of goods or services and were instead likely concealing tax evasion and money laundering. 
The EBA document said neither the Estonian nor the Danish authorities properly followed up on the Russian warning.
The EBA document also said that two years after the Russian warning, the Estonian regulator said Danske had adopted measures ""in line with the highest international standards.""
But problems at the Estonian branch of the bank continued, according to the EBA document.
The EBA cited a second letter to the Estonia supervisor from the Russian Central Bank sent in February 2013 which alleged that Danske's branch in the country had executed transactions to accounts of non-resident clients meant ""to launder proceeds of crime from Russia."" 
This letter alleged the suspicious transactions amounted to more than $3 billion in 2011 and 2012 alone.
The EBA document, citing this second warning from Russia, concluded that the Estonian and Danish supervisors did nothing meaningful to immediately address the situation.
The EBA document found that the two national watchdogs were in breach of their EU obligations for the period between 2007 and 2014. 
In that period the two regulators had the opportunity to address risks but ""despite identifiable risk indicators, they did not cooperate with each other to do so effectively, nor did they take appropriate supervisory action separately,"" the draft EBA report said.

The authorities changed tack from 2015, EBA said, which led to the disclosure by Danske Bank last year of alleged money-laundering activities at its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier AMS on Tuesday was upbeat on the current quarter and the rest of the year, pointing to steady orders for optical sensors from its major customer and a growing share of income from Android smartphone makers.
The Swiss-listed company's optimism echoed a positive tone from Samsung (KS:005930), which has also said it expects a pick-up in memory chip and smartphone sales.
Other chipmakers have been more cautious on the outlook, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), and Infineon. 
AMS's shares rose as much as 22 percent in a relief rally, taking them back to where they were before the company's revenue forecast cut in November.
""It’s the good news of a strong outlook for the second quarter sales versus expectations,"" said Martin Moeller, equity portfolio manager at Swiss private bank UBP. ""Also, investors have been nervous about oversupply and high inventories in semiconductors, especially after the recent Intel forecast cut."" 
DEMAND STABILIZES
Chief Executive Alexander Everke said: ""We see a more stabilized consumer demand and smartphone demand."" 
When asked whether its ""major customer"" - a reference to Apple - has become more predictable after difficulties surrounding the launch of the latest iPhones last year, Everke said on a conference call: ""We feel very comfortable with a view of a strong second half of this year."" 
AMS supplies the Californian tech group with face recognition technology but has been working on diversifying in the face of slow demand for new phones. 
The CEO said recent order wins from Android smartphone makers had started to materialize and would ""increasingly do so in the second quarter and to the rest of the year."" 
AMS's Android customers include Samsung as well as China's Xiaomi and Huawei, also among the biggest smartphone makers worldwide.
Chipmakers get a large portion of their revenue from China and trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing have caused concern in recent months. 
AMS expects second-quarter revenue of $390-430 million and an operating margin of around 10 percent. 
Revenue in the three months through March fell 20 percent from the fourth quarter of 2018 to $390.2 million, at the upper end of its guidance. The operating margin came in at 6 percent, with adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at $23.5 million.
AMS also cut costs in the first quarter, partly because it cut staff and increased the utilization rate at its Singapore plant. 

Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $96.1 million, nearly twice as much as a year earlier.

The company also cited a number of challenges for the year including increased generic competition for drugs such as erectile dysfunction treatment Cialis and the global withdrawal of its cancer drug Lartruvo.
Under intensifying pressure from lawmakers to lower drug prices, Lilly agreed to offer a half-priced version of insulin injection Humalog earlier this year. The drugmaker is one of the three main global providers of insulin products.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>","Global funds favor bonds, but say most assets expensive: Reuters poll","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended a cut in equity holdings this month and an increase in bonds allocations to the highest since August 2017, a Reuters poll showed, reflecting a generally cautious mood among long-term investors.
That was despite a rally in equities, with the S&P 500 index setting an intra-day record high on Monday amid hopes of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war, upbeat earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve. That has bolstered views the decade-long bull market has further to run.
But fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan polled by Reuters warned most asset prices look expensive, an issue increasingly weighing on market sentiment, given the abundance of risks.
In the latest survey of 36 fund managers conducted April 17-30, global equity allocations accounted for 47.0 percent of the model portfolio from 47.6 percent in March.
Bond holdings were increased to the highest since August 2017, to 40.5 percent from 39.8 percent, also at the expense of cash, which was cut to 5.2 percent from 5.8 percent.
""Risky assets extended the rally in April. (But) valuations are getting more expensive across the board, with volatility falling to the lowest level in six months,"" said Filippo Casagrande, head of investments at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments Partners.
""Given the still-unconvincing signs of an economic rebound in the euro area and softer data in the U.S., we confirm a neutral stance on risky assets.""
Against conventional wisdom, stock and bond prices have broadly risen in tandem over the past several years, driven by large amounts of cash poured in by major central banks, leaving most asset classes looking stretched.
Key central banks have recently hinted at a move away from hiking rates, and nearly 60 percent of more than 200 economists in a separate Reuters poll said they were confident the global tightening cycle was now over.
That is likely to keep equity markets buoyed.
""The Fed's dovish pivot means the rally has longer to run. U.S. President Donald Trump will keep the pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, which will fuel the equity markets to record highs,"" said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth.
STILL SEEKING SOME SAFETY
A majority of fund managers who answered an additional question said they would roughly maintain their current risk positioning over the next six months, suggesting average equity allocations will remain relatively modest given where indexes are trading.
""Our view is that markets are moving toward over-bought levels and prices have moved ahead of economic fundamentals. Granted there have been some green shoots of economic growth, but the price moves are not consistent with mediocre growth and stagnant corporate earnings,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma.
Funds have retained a significant exposure to government bonds in spite of low yields and high valuations.
That suggests the multi-decade long bull run in the global bond market is not over and dovish central banks would mean interest rates remaining ""lower for longer"".
Within bond portfolios, investors increased North American exposure to the highest in nearly four years.
""Given the uncertainties in the outlook for growth, we continue to favor the U.S. Treasury market versus other major government bond markets because Europe and Japan are largely asymmetrically priced for a recession,"" said Colin Harte, head of research, multi asset solutions at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management.

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 07:45AM ET</span>",Big banks break away from lobby groups in Brexit trade deal talks,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A group of banks are directly feeding the British government ideas for a Brexit financial services trade deal, bypassing the industry's major lobby groups after their blueprint for a future relationship with the EU was spurned by Brussels last year.
The finance ministry has asked global banks - including Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) - to come up with ideas that could be slotted into a broader UK trade deal with the EU to cover financial services, people familiar with the process said.
""A consortium of banks are looking at this, at what could be workable past Brexit,"" one person said.
Banks liaising directly with the government contrasts with the financial industry's lobbying last year, when asset managers, insurers and banks put on a united front to propose a ""mutual recognition"" system under which Britain and the European Union would broadly accept each other's financial rules as a basis for cross-border trading after Brexit.
But the government, having expressed support for mutual recognition, ditched the proposal at the last minute after it became clear that Brussels had no interest in an untested form of financial services trade.
After that setback, big banks are taking matters into their own hands, working separately from the lobby groups and other parts of the industry. They have hired consultants to come up with practical ways to make the EU's existing equivalence system of financial market access more workable. 
""It's a case of once bitten, twice shy,"" a second banking source close to the situation said.
Faced with differing priorities across the sector, it could be harder for the finance ministry to fashion a coherent trade proposal without creating winners and losers.
A finance ministry spokesman said the government's ""white paper"" report on future EU trade relations published last July referred to seeking an improved version of equivalence.
""Obviously we have an ongoing dialogue with financial services firms on this and many other matters. This is a valuable but routine part of the process of developing policy,"" the spokesman said.
INDUSTRY SPLIT
Under equivalence, Brussels decides if the home rules of a foreign bank, insurer or trading platform are ""equivalent"" or aligned enough to those in the EU to grant market access.
But the financial sector is split, with big wholesale banks keen for Britain to stay aligned with the EU to avoid duplication of rules.
This, however, could turn Britain into a ""rule taker"", having to continually copy EU regulation to maintain access, a step UK regulators have warned against.
Insurers want to ditch parts of the bloc's Solvency II capital rules, which would make it hard to maintain equivalence. The Association of British Insurers said that being a long-term rule-taker would be a wholly unacceptable risk for the sector.
Britain's retail banks are ""somewhere in the middle"", wanting some rules made less onerous for domestic-focused lenders, bankers said.
Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, one of the lobby groups behind last year's mutual recognition blueprint, said it was now for individual sectors and companies in some cases to set out their own priorities as it was now clear that a one-size-fits-all template was not viable.
""It's meaningless to try and create some sort of artificial unanimity. It just isn't there and it would not be taken very seriously. It's absolutely right that it's for the Treasury to try and make appropriate trade offs, but industry would expect to be sighted,"" Celic said.
But other senior finance industry officials said a price would be paid for failing to find common ground.
""It is clear that we need a single voice. If we are leaving, we need a way out that helps the UK. We must forget the self-serving crap – everyone’s future is at stake here,"" one said.
The EU is Britain's biggest financial services customer, with exports worth about 26 billion pounds ($33.6 billion) a year in mostly wholesale business.
The EU has no set timetable for making equivalence determinations, not all financial activities are covered, and Brussels can cut off access at short notice.
Bankers are looking for ways to make the process more predictable, such as having consultations if either side proposes new rules that could jeopardize equivalence.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, said last week it would be ""dangerous"" for Britain to seek equivalence without such ""rules of the game"".
Industry expectations on access are tempered after the mutual recognition setback, and the fact a trade deal could be years away in practice. 
Brexit has already prompted Brussels to make equivalence harder to obtain in areas like derivatives clearing.
""There is no way the UK will get access that is superior to what the Swiss or the United States get, but there is an appetite in the EU to improve the process,"" a banker said.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 07:37AM ET</span>",Equities drop after China data; euro zone growth lifts single currency,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged down on Tuesday after weak Chinese business surveys doused appetite for risk, while the single currency climbed after euro zone growth beat expectations. 
Bourses in Britain, France and Germany lost ground after the surveys on China manufacturing missed forecasts, offering another sign that Beijing's efforts to spur growth in the world's second-biggest economy have yet to bear fruit. 
Both official and private business surveys suggested slower Chinese factory growth this month, dashing hopes for a steady reading or even a faster expansion. Data also showed a slower expansion in China's services sector. 
Those figures underscored questions over prospects for the Chinese economy, with investors across the world already on edge over growing signs of a two-speed global economy where a robust United States outpaces its peers.
Just before noon the Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.1 percent. British shares were off 0.2 percent while the German and French markets were flat and 0.2 percent down respectively. 
Amid uncertainty on China's prospects, investors in Europe focused on data that could offer clues to the health of their own region's economy. 
The euro gained a quarter of a percentage point after figures showed growth in the euro zone grew more than expected in the first quarter, a fillip after poor manufacturing inflation data last month.
German consumer inflation data is due at 1200 GMT. Inflation in the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria nudged up, data released ahead of the nationwide figures showed. 
Inflation in the euro zone is the key issue for the bloc's policymakers, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
""Unemployment is down, wages are starting to edge higher but inflation remains very subdued,"" he said. ""That is the biggest problem for the European Central Bank in terms of its policy response in trying to lift demand in the euro area."" 
France earlier reported steady growth for the first quarter, while Spain's economy also grew faster than expected.
Beyond economic data, corporate earnings were another major factor on Monday. 
Chipmaker AMS jumped 16 percent after beating forecasts for first-quarter profit. AMS is a supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is due to report its results later. 
Banks dragged heavily on the STOXX 600. Danske Bank, hit by money-laundering scandals, fell more than 6 percent after lowering its outlook for 2019, while No. 1 euro zone bank Santander (MC:SAN) also slipped after a drop in first-quarter net profit.
In contrast,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) climbed 4 percent after unveiling plans for share buybacks of up to $1 billion, its first in at least 20 years.
Asian markets had fallen earlier on the Chinese data, albeit in thin trading. MSCI's broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.5 percent. Bourses in South Korea and Hong Kong also fell. 
Japan's financial markets are closed this week as Japanese Emperor Akihito prepares to abdicate. Crown Prince Naruhito, Akihito's elder son, will take the Chrysanthemum Throne on Wednesday.
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, ticked up 0.1 percent. Wall Street futures gauges were flat or marginally down.
BUNDS CLIMB
Germany's 10-year government bond yield rose to a one-week high after the positive euro zone growth data and regional inflation figures, breaking above zero percent.
And as the euro gained ground, FX traders were focused on whether European data would push currencies out of recent trading ranges.
Even marginal growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23.
""The data offers some relief to traders, though it is still too early to say if the economic risks have completely lifted,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) FX strategist Esther Maria Reichelt.
Analysts had warned that markets could dial back predictions of an interest rate increase by the European Central Bank next year if the data was weak. 
The Chinese data fueled gains in Japan's yen, which rallied to a three-week high in holiday-thinned trading. 
Against a basket of currencies the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 97.845 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday. 
The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it seeks to balance robust economic growth against low inflation.
In commodity markets, oil prices rose 1 percent after Saudi Arabia said a deal between producers to withhold output could be extended beyond June to cover the whole of 2019.
Brent crude futures were last at $72.72 a barrel in late morning, up 0.9 percent.

1542,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 06:50AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Hover Close to Highs on Mixed Data; Fed Eyed,"Investing.com -- U.S. futures were flat early Tuesday after a mixed bunch of economic data from China and Europe overnight and ahead of another heavy day for earnings, domestic data - and the start of the Federal Reserve's regular policy meeting.
Tech stocks appeared set for a marginally weaker opening after a disappointing quarterly update from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that showed a marked slowdown in revenue growth. More gloom came out overnight from Samsung (KS:005930), which said it expected the market for memory chips to be depressed by oversupply for another three months before recovering later this year.
Dow futures were up 21 points or 0.1% by 6:45 AM ET (10:45 GMT), while S&P 500 futures were up less than a point from Monday's record high and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures was down 5 points or 0.1%.
Among the welter of earnings due out today,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) beat expectations for both revenue and profit, while pharma Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) also surprised to the upside. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are all also due to report before the bell, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announcing its figures after the close.
Overnight, business surveys in China showed a slight slowdown in factory activity in April, indicating that fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to revive the economy still haven’t had quite the desired effect. However, the euro zone’s economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter, at 0.4%, with Spain growing at an annualized pace of over 2.5% and Italy emerging from recession.
Crude oil futures have bounced again, to $64.42 a barrel, after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister indicated in an interview with the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that he wants the current supply restraint agreement to stay in place through the end of the year.
That’s despite pressure from President Donald Trump to increase output and bring prices down.
Khalid al-Falih said that market remained amply supplied and that there was room for Saudi Arabia to raise its output without breaching the ceiling agreed with its partners at the end of last year. Al-Falih’s audience in Russia is more skeptical about keeping barrels off the market beyond June.
Prices were also supported by reports that Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido had called on the country's soldiers to overthrow the government of President Nicolas Maduro.
Elsewhere in commodities, gold futures edged higher to $1,286.85 a troy ounce, while in the currency market, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.3% at 97.32 as the Eurozone data revived the euro, while movements in oil supported the Canadian dollar."

Indian merchants were exporting more than 140 million products on Amazon's app and website, with cumulative sales expected to top $5 billion in the next four years, country head Amit Agarwal told reporters in Bengaluru.
Amazon launched its Global Selling Program in 2015, as part of its efforts to get more small-and-medium sized vendors on board. Vendor consolidation is key in India, which is among the Seattle-based company's top growth markets. 
More than 80 percent of the company's current export vendors were from small towns and cities, vice president of seller services Gopal Pillai said. 
Amazon is fighting with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart for market share in the country, while dealing with constantly changing government rules. 
In February, a new set of ecommerce regulations caused widespread disruption on Amazon's India website, when products started disappearing from its virtual shelves for some time.

Agrawal said Amazon was fully compliant with government regulations.

Southwest was ranked third this year out of 10 airlines, behind Alaska Air Group Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp that climbed one place each to claim the first and the second spot.
""Recent deadly crashes of the Boeing 737 Max (for Ethiopian Airlines and Air Lion) have left Southwest particularly vulnerable to safety concerns,"" ACSI said in a report.
Passenger satisfaction for all airlines on average in 2019 was up 1.4 percent to 74 points, with Alaska scoring 80 points on a scale of 0 to 100, and JetBlue and Southwest got 79 each.
American Airlines Group Inc, the No.1 U.S. airline that has the second-biggest fleet of the grounded MAX jets in the United States, lost 1 point to score 73, but maintained its fifth rank in the chart.
American has grounded its 24 737 MAX jetliners until Aug. 19, leading to about 115 daily cancellations during the peak summer travel season.
Southwest lost more than $200 million in revenue during the first quarter and has taken its 34 MAX aircraft out of the company's flying schedule through Aug. 5.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) gained 1 point to get a score of 75 and maintained its rank at the fourth spot. United Continental Holdings Inc added 4 points to earn a score of 70, while also keeping its seventh rank as last year.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 06:15AM ET</span>",Proxy adviser ISS recommends against three directors at Sturm Ruger,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services recommended investors withhold support from three directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co ahead of its May 8 annual meeting, the top proxy adviser said in a report seen by Reuters on Friday.
Sturm Ruger has been under pressure from gun control activists over how it might respond to a series of mass shootings across the United States, including at schools, houses of worship and workplaces.
ISS recommended investors withhold support from Sturm Ruger Chair Michael Jacobi and the heads of its governance and risk oversight committees. It did recommend investors back the company's six other board nominees including Chief Executive Christopher Killoy and Sandra Froman, who is also a director of the National Rifle Association and was its president from 2005 to 2007.
In a separate report, rival proxy adviser Glass Lewis recommended support for all nine of Sturm Ruger's director nominees.
Last year a majority of Sturm Ruger investors backed a call for a safety report, but ISS said the document the company produced ""provides little new information.""
ISS also wrote that contrary to the board's policy of non-engagement with investors, many U.S. companies routinely engage with their shareholders.
Sturm Ruger general counsel Kevin Reid said via e-mail, ""We are disappointed with the ISS report and strongly disagree with the withhold recommendations.""
He said the company is confident the 34-page report it issued Feb. 8 ""was fully responsive to the shareholder proposal"" passed last year and said investors should read it and judge for themselves, via the firm's website.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank lowered its outlook for 2019 after a disappointing first quarter, due in part to the effects of a massive money laundering scandal at its Estonian branch that has sent ripples across the Nordic banking sector.
Denmark's biggest lender is trying to restore trust among investors and clients after it said last year that it had channeled 200 billion euros ($223 billion) of suspicious payments through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
On Tuesday it said the considerable investments it is making in compliance to repair its image had pushed up costs, while higher funding costs also weighed on its first quarter performance. That heaped further pressure on its share price, which slid more than 8 percent in morning trade.
""The Estonia case continues to require considerable management attention, including the ongoing investigations and our efforts to restore trust in us,"" interim Chief Executive Jesper Nielsen said in a statement.
Investors are still waiting to find out the scale of potential fines from authorities in the United States and other countries. However, the size and timing of any potential fine is still unclear, casting uncertainty over the bank's prospects.
Danske said it now expects net interest income for the full year to be lower than last year's level. It had previously said it expected net interest income to be around the 2018 level.
The bank kept its forecast for full-year net profit in the range of 14 billion to 16 billion Danish crowns ($2.1 bln-$2.4 bln), but said that would now include an expected gain of 1.3 billion crowns on the sale of its Danica Pension unit in Sweden.
Its share price, which has more than halved since March last year, was trading 8.3 percent lower at 119.85 crowns at 0936 GMT.
On top of the troubles related to money laundering cases, net interest income at Danske Bank was hit by a challenging market in the quarter. 
""There are difficult structural problems with lower interest rates and tough competition,"" said Sydbank analyst Mikkel Emil Jensen.
Danske's money laundering woes are rippling across its Nordic rivals, with Nordea booking a 95 million euro provision on Tuesday for a possible fine for alleged money laundering, after reporting a 36 percent fall in its first quarter operating profit.
Sweden's SEB called for joint initiatives between banks and regulators and authorities to combat money laundering, after saying in its first quarter statement that it couldn't guarantee it would never be used for criminal activity.
Nordea's shares were down 3 percent after its results, while shares in SEB fell 2.6 percent. 
A confidential EU document, seen by Reuters, showed that Russia's central bank sent warnings to Estonian and Danish regulators in 2007 and 2013 about suspect transactions at Danske Bank's Estonian branch, but they were largely ignored.
Danske said expenses in the first quarter were 9 percent higher than a year ago, primarily due to investments in regulatory requirements, compliance and anti-money laundering efforts. 
""Some of the increased cost is Estonia-related, but in my mind something all banks have to go through to increase their general activities around fighting financial crime,"" Chief Financial Officer Christian Baltzer told Reuters in an interview. 
The bank had seen ""very little"" effect on its financial result from 8,500 retail customers in Denmark leaving the bank in the first quarter, Baltzer said.
The bank said it has spent considerable resources hosting around 750 town hall meetings with customers.
""When we meet business customers, they are no longer talking about (money laundering). So we're starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel,"" Baltzer said. 
Profit before tax fell 35 percent to 4.01 billion Danish crowns in the period, below the 4.47 billion forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.

Analysts at DnB Markets said the strike could cost SAS as much as 100 million Swedish crowns ($10.5 mln) a day.
SAS pilots went on strike on Friday after talks over wages and conditions broke down, grounding around 70 percent of the airline's flights and affecting about 280,000 passengers through Tuesday.
DnB Markets lowered its rating on SAS shares to ""hold"" from ""buy"" after nearly halving its 2019 earnings per share estimate due to the strike and high fuel prices, and said it may cut estimates further unless the strike is ended by Wednesday. 
Analysts said the 13 percent wage rise sought by pilots looked unrealistic in a period of high and rising fuel prices, intensifying competition and causing numerous airline bankruptcies.
""We believe investors will remain lukewarm as long as the earnings trend remains negative and as the pilots' strike puts the targeted 3 billion crown cost savings by 2020 in jeopardy,"" they said in a note.
SAS shares were down 2.4 percent at 0914 GMT, lagging the broader market in Stockholm and taking the drop since before the strike to over 9 percent.
""In 2016, a 5-day pilots' strike in Sweden cost SAS around 150 million Norwegian crowns. However, this time the strike is across all three Scandinavian countries simultaneously,"" analysts said.
SAS and unions said on Tuesday that the sides had not contacted each other since the start of the strike, and no new talks were scheduled.

1554,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",StanChart Plans $1 Billion Buyback After Two-Decade Wait,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
 Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc is buying back ordinary shares for the first time in more than 20 years as Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters seeks to put misconduct and profitability woes behind the Asia-focused lender.
The $1 billion purchase plan comes weeks after a settlement between the bank and U.S. regulators over its repeated violations of sanctions with Iran. Standard Chartered also on Tuesday delivered its latest quarterly results, which put it on course to deliver its key targets for shareholders. The shares jumped as much as 6.1 percent during morning trading in London, the most since October.
“The resolution of our legacy conduct and control issues means we can now manage our capital position more dynamically,” Winters said in the statement. Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told journalists that the bank is “done” with legal expenses for the time being.
Winters has been fighting a near-constant stream of misconduct issues old and new in his four-year tenure at the lender, which operates in more than 60 markets including Angola, Indonesia and Hong Kong. The scandals have overshadowed his efforts to turn around the bank and weighed on the shares, which have fallen by about a third since he took the helm in mid-2015.
He has also been under pressure to cut costs at the bank and the latest results showed a 2 percent drop in operating expenses to $2.4 billion, the lowest quarterly figure in two years. The lender also said that income had risen faster than costs in the first three months of the year, achieving so-called positive jaws. Standard Chartered also said it would “invest significantly” in its business with a focus on its digital services.
“We’re funding that as we go through, fundamentally changing the bank, opening up new digital operations in different countries,” said Halford during a Bloomberg TV interview.
Standard Chartered said its first-quarter return on tangible equity, a key measure of financial performance, was 9.6 percent. It reiterated its target of a 10 percent return by 2021, a goal that’s been met with skepticism. Analysts have questioned the bank’s ability to hit the figure as it attempts to grow income while keeping a lid on costs. The lender also aims to double its dividend per share by 2021.
The group’s “exposure to relatively high growth emerging markets positions” bodes “well to deliver on its medium-term return on tangible equity target,” said Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood. “We also see scope for significant earnings and value accretion from the return of surplus capital to shareholders in due course.”
The buyback program may cause Standard Chartered’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, to fall 35 basis points in the second quarter. Standard Chartered aims to keep the ratio, which stood at 13.9 percent on March 31, at 13 percent to 14 percent.

1555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",The Relationship Between Asian and U.S. Stocks Is Falling Apart,"(Bloomberg) -- Something strange is happening in the world of global stocks. After years of trading in line with American stocks, Asian equities are no longer moving in tandem.
Asia’s regional benchmark has slumped almost 7 percent in the past year, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index still not recouping all of the losses during the global market rout if late 2018. By contrast, the U.S. S&P 500 is up 11 percent, hitting all-time highs as recently as Monday.
Several themes have been playing out in Asia:
“We’re starting to see a bit of a breakdown in the correlation as investors look a bit deeper into markets now that we’ve had such a successful start to the year,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia in Sydney. “Underlying data is certainly painting a better picture in the U.S. than in many other jurisdictions.”
While the Asia Pacific index has done better since the start of the year, gaining 11 percent, it is still lagging behind the S&P 500, which has jumped 17 percent. And it’s done little since the end of January.
Here’s some further perspective on the disconnect:
Tech Sector
Most of the FAANG complex has posted strong earnings, but the semiconductor industry -- which has had its best start to the year since the dot-com bubble -- may have hit a rough patch.
The fourth-largest contributor to the regional Asian index, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., has been hit by setback after setback. On Tuesday, it reported profit that missed recently reduced analysts’ estimates. That came after the tech giant delayed its first foldable smartphone, while grappling with falling memory-chip revenue.
Prior to Samsung’s results, peers SK Hynix Inc. and LCD panel maker LG Display Co. added to sector concerns after earnings results were lower than expected.
Japan
And then there’s Japan. The Topix index has slumped 8.8 percent in the past year and it’s still among the worst-performing equity indexes in the developed world in 2019. Fund managers have lost interest in Japanese stocks as trade-war and profit outlook concerns cloud the overall sentiment.
China
MSCI Inc.’s plan to expand the weighting of China-listed shares in benchmark indexes tracked by global investors, could be another reason for the rest of Asia falling behind. That decision could see billions of dollars flow into one of the world’s most volatile major stock markets. And the capital has to come from somewhere.
While billions of dollars will head to so-called A-shares as a result, the weighting of Southeast Asian markets will likely drop to about 7.7 percent from 8 percent now,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts Sean Gardiner and Aarti Shah wrote in a February report.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts also said in a report that India might get hit.
Renewed Correlation?
With Asian central banks largely following the Federal Reserve’s dovish pivot, policy direction is becoming better aligned. And all signs point to a U.S.-China trade deal in coming weeks or, at least, months, which may help turn regional export figures around. China’s economic stabilization in time could start lifting more boats.
“The U.S. and Asian markets have shown a rise in correlation again,” looking at the first quarter of 2019, said Tai Hui, chief market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in Hong Kong. “A more patient and dovish Fed, economic stimulus from China and ongoing negotiation between Beijing and Washington have prompted both markets to re-rate and recover.”

1556,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",Biggest Nordic Banks Hit by Selloff After Bleak Results,"(Bloomberg) -- The two biggest banks in the Nordic region saw their market values shrink on Tuesday after publishing first-quarter results that disappointed investors.
 Danske Bank  A/S (CO:DANSKE) said it now expects net interest income to be lower this year than in 2018 as the higher cost of funding brought on by its money-laundering scandal erodes its top line. Its shares plunged more than 7 percent after the market opened in Copenhagen. At Nordea Bank Abp (ST:NDASE), net interest income missed market expectations amid growing pressure from its biggest investors to boost revenue. Its shares fell as much as 4 percent.
Not that long ago, Nordic banks were seen as the darlings of European finance, boasting some of the region’s highest capital buffers and business models that seemed impervious to years of negative interest rates. But those days are over. Tuesday’s development shows how banks in one of the world’s richest regions have lost their luster, after a series of money laundering scandals and the cost of restructurings dismayed investors.
At Danske, net interest income in the first quarter missed estimates and net income lagged behind even the lowest prediction in a survey of analysts. Acting Chief Executive Officer Jesper Nielsen said on Tuesday that the dirty-money scandal continues to weigh on the bank’s business.

Danske is trying to regain the trust of customers and investors after last year revealing that a large part of $230 billion that flowed through an Estonian unit was suspicious. Authorities in several countries are investigating the bank, which is still looking for a permanent CEO to replace ousted Thomas Borgen.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
“A near double-digit downgrade to 2019 profit guidance, almost certainly driven by revenue and margin weakness, heap further uncertainty on Danske’s outlook and suggest to us that valuation will remain below peers. On top of fears about a money-laundering fine, some investors may consider the bank currently uninvestable.”--Philip Richards and Georgi Gunchev, European bank analystsClick here to view the research
The bank has felt the fallout of the laundering case on its share price, which plunged almost 50 percent last year, and on funding costs, with debt issuance costing more since the Estonian affair erupted. Danske Chief Financial Officer Christian Baltzer said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that the bank is continuing to devote considerable resources to compliance.
Compliance Costs
“With the investments we are doing to make sure we are as strong as we can be to fight financial crime, that will increase costs significantly,” he said. Baltzer also pointed to the negative interest-rate environment in Denmark as a continued challenge. “When and if Danish rates increase, that will significantly lift our profits,” he said.
The bank revealed on Tuesday that it will effectively need to cut its 2019 outlook for profit as well as net interest income. It still sees net profit in a range of 14 billion kroner ($2.1 billion) to 16 billion kroner, but the forecast now includes an expected 1.3 billion-krone gain from the sale of its Swedish pension assets.
At Nordea, which moved its headquarters to Helsinki from Stockholm last year, investors have been putting pressure on management to deliver revenue growth after years of focusing on cost cuts. But on Tuesday, the bank’s miss on net interest income was met with concern.
“This was again a big disappointment. Net interest income was clearly weaker than expected and represented a drop from already low levels,” said Antti Saari, an analyst at OP Group in Helsinki. “Erosion of the top line remains an acute problem for Nordea.”
Chief Executive Officer Casper von Koskull has struggled to revive revenue growth after his strategy to focus on costs and automation drew mixed responses from some key shareholders. Both Sampo Oyj, Nordea’s biggest owner, and activist investor Cevian, have voiced concerns that revenue isn’t growing fast enough.
“Through the actions we have taken in recent quarters there are now some encouraging signs of improved business momentum, although lending margins are under continued pressure and market making activities remain challenging,” von Koskull said in Tuesday’s statement.

(Reuters) - Logitech International SA shares fell nearly 9 percent on Tuesday as investors cashed in on the computer peripheral maker's gains this year and success providing fast keyboards and mice for players of online games like Fortnite.
Traders said the sell-off followed Logitech shares' gaining 40 percent since the start of the year, rather than the latest earnings and sales which were roughly in line with forecasts.
The Swiss-U.S. company, which also makes mobile speakers and video conferencing equipment, reported a 22 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit to $42.1 million. Revenue increased 5.4 percent to $624.3 million, matching analyst estimates.
The surprise departure of Chief Financial Officer Vincent Pilette ""to pursue a senior management role at another company"" and Logitech's not upgrading its guidance for its next financial year could also have played a role, traders said.
""The figures are fundamentally OK, but Logitech's shares have risen very strongly this year, so there is now some consolidation,"" one Zurich-based trader said.
Pilette's departure, after six years at Logitech, could also be a contributory factor, the trader said.
""The CFO leaving is a secondary reason, although everyone is replaceable these days,"" he said.
At 0830 GMT Logitech shares were down 3.7 percent to 40.81 Swiss francs. The stock started 2019 at 30.92 francs.
For the year as a whole, Logitech sales increased 10 percent, when currency swings were removed, to $2.79 billion. 
""We've delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit growth in constant currency and our highest fiscal year sales ever,"" said Chief Executive Bracken Darrell, who has led the turnaround of the company.
Darrell described Pilette, who was popular among the investment community and invested in Logitech before joining the company from Electronics For Imaging, as a ""terrific partner"".
Nate Olmstead, head of finance, will be interim chief financial officer when Pilette leaves at the end of May.
Logitech said it expected to increase its sales in the mid- to high single-digit range and increase its operating income to $375 million to $385 million during its 2020 financial year, confirming the outlook it gave in March.
During the 2019 business year, which ended on March 31, Logitech had twice increased its guidance.
Analysts described the figures as positive with strong profit margins.

""We regret Vincent Pilette's departure and it will be important that his successor pursues the same discipline in executing on the business model,"" said Michael Foeth at Bank Vontobel.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 04:39AM ET</span>",Samsung Electronics bets on better second-half after first-quarter profit slumps,"By Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd flagged improved second-half results on expectations of a pick up in memory chip and smartphone sales, after posting its weakest profit in more than two years in the first quarter.
The world's top maker of semiconductors, however, warned of more short-term pain in the second quarter, with memory chip prices likely to decline further before a rebound in demand as data centers re-stock later in the year.
""For the second half of 2019, the company expects memory chip demand for high-density products to increase, but uncertainties in the external environment will persist,"" the tech giant said in a statement.
Hit by falls in chip prices and slowing demand for display panels, Samsung posted operating profit of 6.2 trillion won ($5.4 billion) in the quarter ended March, smallest since late 2016 but in line with the company's guidance.
Revenue fell 13.5 percent to 52.4 trillion won, also in line with its earlier estimates.
Samsung's core semiconductor business booked a 64 percent fall in operating profit to 4.1 trillion won, while the display business logged 560 billion won in losses.
Memory chip makers have been hit by a downturn in the global smartphone market and a fall in demand from data centers behind cloud computing services amid a broader economic slowdown.
Samsung's smaller rival, SK Hynix, last week posted the slimmest quarterly operating profit in over two years. But it was confident chip demand would recover later this year, a sentiment echoed by Samsung on Tuesday.
Samsung said its server DRAM chip customers would start rebuilding inventories from the end of the second quarter, while new smartphone models would support sales of mobile DRAM. 
For NAND flash memory chips that suffered big price falls since last year, Samsung said market conditions would stabilize in the second half as high-density chip adoption for mobile devices drives up demand. 
An easing in China-U.S. trade tensions could also unlock some demand for consumer electronics and encourage Chinese cloud service providers, which had stockpiled chips in anticipation of a prolonged trade war, to lower their inventories to more normal levels, analysts said.
""On the macroeconomic side, China may give a boost to its IT industry to support the economy and if there's a trade agreement signed between China and United States, these will drive up demand for Samsung's products, like chips,"" senior analyst Song Myung-sup at HI Investment and Securities said.
MOBILE WORRIES
The world's top smartphone maker said its mobile business posted a 40 percent drop in operating profit to 2.3 trillion won in the first quarter.
The Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rival and supplier is hoping to revive flagging growth in its mobile business with its latest handset, featuring a big, bending screen.
But in a blow to its renewed focus on innovation, Samsung delayed global sales of the foldable phone after reviewers discovered problems with the display.
Samsung, which supplies screens for its own folding phones, forecast weak second-quarter earnings in the display business as demand for flexible screens was expected to remain weak.
But it said demand for flexible display panels would likely pick up and sales for its smartphones were also expected to rise in the second half, led by new models in all segments including the low-end Galaxy A series.
There is ""no change"" in the company's push toward foldable phones, said Lee Jong-min, vice president of the company's mobile business.

""Samsung Electronics have been preparing Galaxy Fold for a long period and there's no change to our direction to provide premium experiences for customers desiring innovation,"" Lee said, reiterating Samsung will find the reason behind the problems with the display.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets got off to a shaky start on Tuesday, after a round of weaker-than-expected business surveys out of China reminded participants that the world economy may not be out of the woods just yet.
With earnings season in Europe cranking up, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 0.6 points, or 0.2% at 390.60 by 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT).
Italy’s FTSE MIB 30 was holding up best, still supported by Standard & Poor’s decision to affirm the country’s credit rating on Friday, although bank stocks were suffering on fresh concerns about the stability of the government, and on comments from Treasury Minister Giovannia Tria about the widening budget deficit.
London’s listed mining stocks were broadly lower after the Chinese data forced investors to trim their hopes for commodity demand.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) fell the most after announcing problems of its own too – it cut its forecasts for copper and cobalt production this year due to a spate of problems at its mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Australia.
There has been a welter of earnings updates to digest, with Airbus (PA:AIR) coming slightly off its all-time highs after unchanged guidance on commercial deliveries for the rest of the year underlined how capacity constraints will limit its ability to exploit Boeing's (NYSE:BA) misfortunes (even though it increased output of the A320, its main rival to the 737 MAX). The group also took a charge of 190 million euros ($220 million) to reflect the company’s inability to sell fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia owing to a German government refusal to grant export licenses.
There’s also been mixed reports from the region’s banks, with Spain’s Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA) both falling after disappointing updates marked by problems in emerging markets, while  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) rose 4.6% after announcing its first buyback in years.
Elsewhere,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) was down 0.4% after reports that President Donald Trump, three of his children and his real estate company filed a lawsuit to stop the bank releasing details of its business with them under subpoenas from Congress. Trump’s real estate business had extensive funding from Russian individuals prior to the financial crisis, and disclosures made in 2015 showed that the bank had lent him over $300 million."

The company aims to cut the prices by standardizing systems and requiring customers order the items online, the report said.
After reporting a 36 percent slide in solar installations in the first quarter, Tesla said last week that it introduced a new solar price and selling strategy without giving any specifics.
In 2016, the electric car maker bought SolarCity for $2.6 billion, through which the company planned to offer solar panels and home battery storage systems to consumers.
Tesla sought to sell solar panels in its retail stores and online in a bid to align it with the company's aspirational luxury car brand.
The move was a sharp reversal from SolarCity's populist vision of making rooftop solar accessible to all, and sales under Tesla have lagged. Late last year, Tesla cut prices on its residential solar systems.
At the same time, solar roof tiles that the company unveiled in late 2016 have yet to be produced in meaningful quantities.
Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has said the solar roof, which generates solar energy without the need for traditional rooftop panels, is a cornerstone of his strategy to sell a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle under the Tesla brand.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 04:24AM ET</span>",Why Airbus isn't pouncing on Boeing's 737 MAX turmoil,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - When Boeing (NYSE:BA) launched its 737 MAX jetliner in response to Airbus's record-selling A320neo, a wave of poker-faced satisfaction spread through Airbus headquarters in France.
Its reasons for cheering Boeing's decision to make a similar jet, based on a similar strategy of engine efficiencies, partly explain why Airbus is wary of exploiting Boeing's misery over the global grounding of the MAX today, industry sources say.
Airbus has joined major airlines in expressing confidence that Boeing will emerge soon from a crisis caused by two fatal crashes. In the first place, that is because both giants share a stake in preserving public trust and rarely compete on safety.
""This is not good for aviation,"" new Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said of the MAX crisis earlier this month. 
But the history of the MAX and its competitor, the Airbus A320neo, also illustrates why the two companies are unlikely to come to blows over the future of the MAX beyond their fierce day-to-day competition, strategists and industry officials say.
Airbus and Boeing operate a roughly equal duopoly in the market for single-aisle jets that Airbus values at $3.5 trillion over 20 years. 
Neither can afford to fall too far behind without suffering a big disadvantage on costs, which depend heavily on volumes. 
If one of them did, it would likely take drastic action - anything from launching a price war to developing a new jet - that could destabilize both, and so market forces tend to keep the two companies' strategies in line, industry insiders say.
In 2011, Airbus was testing that alignment with record sales of its recently launched A320neo, offering more efficient engines. It had launched the upgraded A320 after beginning to lose ground to a new competitor, Canada's Bombardier CSeries.
By adopting similar engines, Airbus was able to block the CSeries and stimulate massive orders from its existing customer base, while sending a message to an even bigger potential rival, China, that the core of the jetliner market would be defended.
But Airbus was also worried that its strategy would have to be torn up as Boeing considered leapfrogging it with an all-new jet that would take longer to build but give more efficiencies.
Airbus knew it would have to respond to this with a costlier Plan B aircraft, code-named A30X, but was facing multiple calls on its cash, including problems with its A400M military plane.
Airbus decided it needed to force Boeing off the fence and struck in its backyard with a deal to sell 460 jets to American Airlines, several people familiar with the negotiations said.
Calculating it would lose too many such deals before its all-new jet was ready, Boeing did a U-turn and announced a re-engined 737 in time to win back almost half the American order.
Engine maker  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) was also influential in nudging Boeing to a new strategy, and had a draft engine deal in place even before Boeing officially changed position, two people familiar with the talks said. GE had no immediate comment.
WRONG TIMING
Eight years later, both planemakers have sold thousands of their respective re-engined jets and have seen share prices jump five-fold, lifting the entire commercial aerospace sector.
Not only could the duopoly be destabilized if the MAX had to be replaced, but now would not be an ideal time for a technology arms race in this crucial part of the market, experts say.
Led by Boeing, planemakers widened the use of lightweight carbon-composite materials earlier this decade. Then it was the turn of engine makers to produce a quantum leap in performance.
Future game-changers may lie in artificial intelligence and automation in the cockpit, but these are not yet mature.
""The technology for major new steps in materials, engines and piloting are not there right now. It is not the best time for either side to destabilize the market and launch a new single-aisle plane,"" a senior industry strategist told Reuters.
Furthermore, Airbus is not as ready as it would like for a parallel race in factory technology needed for a new plane.
Add to this investments already made by suppliers, banks and manufacturers, and their reliance on preserving resale values of planes already flying, and few are in a hurry to start afresh.
""Industrially and competitively it is logical in a duopoly that you need a reasonably strong competition,"" said Rob Morris, head consultant at UK-based aerospace advisers Flight Ascend.
In the short term, Airbus has little capacity to push output higher, even though some Boeing customers are already courting it in public - a move partly seen as an effort to negotiate better terms with Boeing.
But the possibility of radically upsetting the duopoly may have receded under new Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer, a market-share pragmatist who helped launch the A320neo, and Faury, a cautious engineer focusing on industrial improvements.
Faury on Tuesday played down the prospect that the MAX crisis would open up new business for Airbus and said the grounding ""does not change the mid-term to long-term picture"".
Airbus has already won a larger share of the single-aisle market than expected, leaving the usual 50/50 split with Boeing skewed toward Airbus, now on 60 percent. Experts say a further land grab could have unpredictable consequences for both.

""Boeing can't accept market share below 40 percent. If the MAX fails, Boeing has to do something fundamental and Airbus has to respond,"" Morris said.

1562,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 04:21AM ET</span>","China Triple Whammy Sees Stocks, Bonds, Yuan All Sink in April","(Bloomberg) -- A huge tumble in government bonds, the worst rout in months for stocks and a weakening yuan -- April was a month of selling in China’s markets.
There was no place to hide as the risk-on rally that had added some $2.5 trillion to the world’s top-performing equities started to lose steam. The Shanghai Composite Index is down for the month amid record foreign selling and small caps just entered a correction. China’s sovereign debt is heading for its worst monthly drop in more than eight years, while the yuan slid the most since October.
With mainland trading shut from Wednesday for three days, investors will be looking for fresh catalysts next week. They’re facing a growing pile of headwinds, the latest being a rallying greenback that often hurts stocks as well as the yuan. A slew of economic reports could bring more volatility to bonds, as traders consider whether good news -- an improving economy -- is bad news for stimulus.
“Chinese bonds will fluctuate in May, as investors take a break from selling and wait to see more data to judge whether the economic recovery is sustainable,” said Liu Dongliang, a senior analyst at China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen. He expects the 10-year sovereign yield to hover around the 3.4 percent level in the near term.
""Stocks might be a better investment relative to bonds, as companies’ earnings will likely improve,” he said.
Fresh off their best quarter since 2014, Chinese stocks slipped in April as investors took profit from some of the most overheated trades. Traders based overseas dumped 18 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) of mainland shares this month via trading links with Hong Kong, the most since the link opened in late 2016. A barrage of uninspiring earnings haven’t helped.
Looking ahead, weaker manufacturing data on Tuesday may have helped make a clearer case for more stimulus. Traders have signaled they think economic recovery isn’t yet strong enough for Beijing to scale back support measures.
Zhu Junchun, an analyst at Lianxun Securities in Shanghai, is recommending small-cap stocks for May. They lagged their large-cap counterparts in April as investors typically seek shelter in companies with more predictable earnings, as well as state-backed enterprises. ""We will leave the correction behind us as April comes to an end,"" he said.

Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) AG halted capacity expansion at its Eurowings low-cost arm after the group’s first-quarter margins were squeezed by rising fuel bills and overcapacity that’s sparked a Europe-wide fare war.
Europe’s biggest airline is abandoning plans to increase capacity at Eurowings by 2 percent this year. Earlier this month, Lufthansa issued a profit warning that attributed a plunge in earnings before interest and tax on fuel prices, cheap airline tickets and tough comparisons with year-earlier figures.
The decision to dial back growth at Eurowings comes after the German carrier in March said it would slow group capacity increases to 1.9 percent this summer from the 3.8 percent previously planned in an effort to bolster prices. Revenues for airlines across Europe have been crimped by a capacity glut and fuel-price squeeze that’s forced eight airlines out of business since the summer.
“We are confident, though, that we will see a recovery in our unit revenues as early as the second quarter,” Lufthansa Chief Financial Officer Ulrik Svensson said. “Our confidence is based above all on our favorable booking levels for the months ahead.”
Lufthansa dropped as much as 3.1 percent in Frankfurt trading. The shares were down 1.1 percent at about 22 euros at 10:10 a.m. They’ve gained about 12 percent this year.
The company has used Eurowings to defend itself from low-cost carriers in its home market, often racking up losses. Having said that Eurowings will break even this year, its parent needs to rein in growth to achieve this, according to Davy Research analyst Stephen Furlong.
The company said Tuesday it still expects an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes margin of between 6.5 to 8 percent this year. Lufthansa anticipates that conditions in the aviation market will improve later this year.
The airline said it expects 2019 fuel costs at its network airlines to be 600 million euros ($671 million) higher than in 2018, above the 550 million euros it previously predicted. Kerosene prices have surged this year as U.S. President Donald Trump ratchets up trade sanctions on Iran, a major crude oil producer.
Lufthansa said earnings at its cargo division slumped amid an ongoing contraction in global trade. Germany’s export champions, users of Lufthansa cargo services, are struggling to find buyers for their products amid simmering trade tensions
The European airline industry is coming off a tough year, with bad weather, air-traffic-control strikes and trade conflicts among factors that have weighed on profit. Irish low-cost giant Ryanair Holdings Plc has warned that fares will remain depressed.
American Airlines Group Inc., the world’s biggest airline, last week cut its earnings forecast due to rising fuel costs and the worldwide grounding of the 737 max.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 08:58PM ET</span>","China developers push land prices up as credit, purchase rules ease","By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The premiums developers in China pay for land rebounded sharply in the first quarter of 2019 as credit conditions and purchase requirements eased, taking some firms by surprise and prompting caution from others on the pickup in prices.
Many land auctions failed to secure bids or the reserve price in the second half of last year, as developers faced tighter credit conditions and thinning profit margins following a prolonged government campaign to rein-in hot property prices and a slowdown in the economy.
But in the first quarter of 2019 the premiums land buyers are willing to pay over reserve prices rose to 19.1 percent on average, according to property researcher CRIC. The 2018 average premium was 9.4 percent - the lowest level in some years.
Second-tier cities have led the 2019 gains, with premiums in eastern Hefei and southwestern Chongqing's at 86 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
Some auctions received hundreds of bids, in another sign that developers are eager to grab land.
""Q1 land prices in some cities have already surpassed the market peak in 2016,"" said CRIC researcher Xie Yang-chun, citing Chongqing and Zhengzhou, in east-central China, as examples. House prices reached record highs in 2016, prompting the government to introduce tightening measures.
""These cities have large land supply and high inventory risks, developers should be more careful when they acquire land at a high premium there,"" Xie said.
Many land parcels in second-tier cities that failed to sell at auction last year were put back on the market in the first quarter and fetched prices above the reserve price of last year, CRIC said.
But with official price caps on houses still in place in some cities, the more expensive land costs may not translate into higher home prices just yet, potentially putting more pressure on profit margins.
The rebound comes hand in hand with looser credit conditions this year. China has cut the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve five times since last year to encourage more lending. Banks responded by making it easier for both home buyers to borrow and for developers to secure new funds. 
Funds raised by China's real estate developers in the first three months grew 5.9 percent from the same period a year earlier, compared with a 2.1 percent rise in January-February, government data shows.
Another factor behind the land revival is that some land sales removed a requirement that part of the land developers buy must be set aside for rental housing, which could delay returns on investment.
Property investment in China grew 11.8 percent in the January-March quarter compared with a year earlier, the fastest quarterly increase since 2014. The value of land sold during the period however, was 27 percent lower than a year earlier.
New home prices also grew slightly faster in March and property sales by floor area rose at their fastest pace in seven months.
RISKS
Still, the rebound doesn’t come without dangers, some major developers warn.
Sun Hongbin, chairman of Sunac China, the country's No. 4 developer, is not optimistic this year, he told an earnings conference last month. The company should tread cautiously because asking prices were high, while home sales would not recover significantly, he said.
James Hui, president of Shimao Property, the 11th largest in China, said he preferred to build the company's land bank through mergers and acquisitions, rather than land auctions, because prices were easier to control.
""After the Chinese New Year, the market was very hot, especially the land market, which surprised us,"" Hui said, referring to the holiday in early February.
""Luckily, we have already worked on a large volume of acquisition deals before the Chinese New Year, otherwise the (buying) prices would be high,"" he said. ""I don't really understand the recent market.""
Louis Kuijs, Oxford Economics' head of Asia economics, said the rise in house sales and new builds should be subdued for the rest of the year, although inventories of unsold homes are quite low.
""Thus, if sentiment holds up, it is possible that land sales and housing starts continue to do well even in the absence of any easing of housing restrictions,"" he said.
Though many homebuilders prefer to acquire land through M&As, deals can take a long time to complete. So some companies have to tap the open market to replenish land banks.
Xiamen-based developer Yuzhou Properties bought land in Hefei last month at a 121 percent premium.
""Chasing 'land king' is not our style,"" an official of Yuzhou said, referring to the expression used to describe developers willing to pay the highest of prices to secure land. The person declined to be identified in the absence of company authorization to speak to the media.
Despite the premium, the land would provide a solid return because the price of around 11,000 yuan ($1,633.77) per square meter was much lower than the 20,000 yuan per square meter selling price for homes in the area, she said.

""We're also actively looking at M&As, but M&As require a relatively long time to do due diligence,"" she said. ($1=6.73 yuan)

Shares in Thailand’s biggest television broadcaster soared 36 percent in April, extending this year’s rally to about 90 percent. That makes it a standout among Asia’s publishing and media companies with a market value of at least $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
But the stock’s consensus rating -- equivalent to a hold -- ranks it sixth lowest among about 100 peers in the region, the data show. BEC World trades at about 60 times 12-month forward earnings, more than double its five-year average.
Costly licensing fees and a slump in television viewing, in favor of online media and platforms such as Netflix, have eroded earnings at Thailand’s traditional media companies.
That prompted the nation’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha to this month invoke measures to support the industry, including allowing digital TV licenses to be returned to the state. BEC World’s shares climbed 10 percent the day the ruling became official.
The broadcaster stands to be the biggest beneficiary of the measure as it will probably return licenses of two television channels that have been a major drag on its earnings, according to Ktb Securities (Thailand) Pcl.
""Earnings should improve significantly with the expected return of two unprofitable TV channels,” said Amnart Ngosawang, an analyst at Ktb Securities in Bangkok. ""Still, the stock’s rally may have been too fast, as any cause for optimism is probably too far ahead.""
BEC World spends about 400 million baht ($12.5 million) a year on royalty fees and network rental and is studying details including the number of TV licenses it may return, Thai-language Thunhoon reported on its website, citing President Ariya Banomyong.
The company’s board will consider proposals before May 10, the last day for TV digital broadcasters to submit their intention to return licenses, the report said. Ariya wasn’t available for comment in calls placed to his office.
The company’s shares slumped to a record low in January, before it posted a net loss of 330 million baht for 2018 a month later.
The annual shortfall was its first since at least 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and was attributed to a drop in TV advertising spending and a shift in consumer behavior toward watching media online, according to BEC World’s Feb. 22 statement.

1. Google Dips
Tech may struggle after Google’s disappointing earns report today. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares fell nearly 7% after hitting new closing and 52-week highs in regular trading on a day when the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite finished at record highs.
Alphabet reported earnings per share of $11.90 on revenue of $36.34 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had forecast earnings of $10.53 on revenue of $37.3 billion.
The earnings were down 10.7% from a year ago because of a $1.7 billion fine levied by the European Commission over anticompetitive practices. Without the fine, Alphabet said it would have earned $11.50 a share.
2. Pending Home Sales Seen Rebounding
Housing data leads the economic calendar tomorrow. The National Association of Realtors releases their measure for pending home sales in March at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). On average, economists expect that homes awaiting construction rose 1.1% last month, based on forecasts compiled by Investing.com. Pending home sales fell in February, following a large spike the moth before.
3. API Inventories
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data, which showed a weekly build last week, will garner attention Tuesday, as traders eye fresh direction for oil prices.
Crude Oil WTI Futures remain at year-to-date highs of around $64 a barrel, as President Donald Trump has recently tightened sanctions against Iran by ending all exemptions previously granted to crude buyers.
But even with tighter sanctions on Iran, China has increased its crude imports from the Islamic Republic, according to Citigroup. Shipping data show that Chinese purchases have picked up lately, with some 700,000 barrels a day of oil in transit to China in recent weeks, Citi said. Citi expects China to import at least 200,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil in May.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 set an intraday record high on Monday, bolstering the view that the decade-long bull market has further to run, after consumer spending rose in March and inflation data was benign.
The benchmark index topped its intraday record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21, rising to a session high of 2,949.52. The S&P 500 is now up more than 17% for the year to date. The index along with the Nasdaq posted another record close as well on Monday. 
Hopes of a resolution of the U.S.-China trade war, upbeat earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve have powered the rally in stocks this year, and even though the Monday's gains were small, strategists said recent new highs encourage further buying.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>",Boeing CEO keeps job intact after facing questions on 737 MAX crashes,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg emerged with his job intact at an annual meeting on Monday and promised to win back the public's trust after facing tough questions in the wake of two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX plane.
Battling the biggest crisis of his nearly four years as chief executive officer, Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles.
He later told reporters he would continue to lead the company through a crisis that has triggered the grounding of Boeing's fastest-selling plane, lawsuits, investigations and lingering concerns over the 737 MAX's safety.
""I am very focused on safety going forward,"" he said after the meeting when reporters asked if he had considered resigning. ""I am strongly vested in that. My clear intent is to continue to lead on the front of safety, quality and integrity."" 
However, Boeing will need to win back the trust of customers, passengers and regulators following the crashes. 
""We know we do have work to do to earn and re-earn that trust and we will,"" Muilenburg said before ending the 16-minute news conference and ignoring shouted questions from reporters as he walked away.
The family of one American victim, 24-year-old Samya Stumo, staged a silent protest outside the meeting site in Chicago, while the families of other victims among the 157 killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX on March 10 held a tearful press conference at a Chicago law firm. 
That plane plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, five months after a similar Lion Air nosedive in Indonesia that killed all 189 passengers and crew.
The families spoke after filing a wrongful death lawsuit against Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, which designed the sensors used in the 737 MAX, in Chicago federal court, one of dozens of lawsuits Boeing is facing over both crashes.
STUBBED TOE
Daniel Johnson, an engineer and an intermittent Boeing shareholder since 1984, said the company ""really stubbed their toe"" by allowing the plane's anti-stall system - called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS - to rely on only one sensor.
""The question is: Will they need to rebrand? We don’t know how much the general public actually knows what a 737 MAX is,” Johnson said outside the meeting.
About 150 shareholders gathered in the auditorium of the Chicago Field Museum for the meeting, but only a handful questioned Muilenburg over the MAX. 
One shareholder asked Muilenburg what Boeing was doing on safety assessments following the crashes. The CEO said the company's commitment to safety has not wavered.
“Safety is at the core of what we do. Every day, we try to get better,"" Muilenburg said at the meeting, which took place exactly six months after the Lion Air crash.
Shares of the company, worth $214 billion, have lost nearly 10 percent of their value since the March 10 crash. 
Boeing is under pressure to deliver a software fix to prevent erroneous data from triggering the MCAS system and a new pilot training package that will convince global regulators, and the flying public, that the aircraft is safe. 
Boeing has acknowledged that the accidental firing of the software based on bad sensor data was a common link in the chain of events leading to the two accidents.
""We know we can break this link in the chain. It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Muilenburg told shareholders. When asked by reporters if the MCAS system was flawed, he said only that Boeing was making improvements to it.
$1 BILLION IMPACT
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration could clear Boeing's 737 MAX jet to fly in late May or the first part of June, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday, though Boeing has yet to submit the updated software and training for review. 
Some pilots have warned that draft training proposals do not go far enough to address their concerns.
Boeing repeated on Monday it was making progress to certify its grounded jets with the software update. 
Meanwhile, deliveries of the 737 MAX, which airlines around the world had been relying on to service a growing air travel industry for years to come, are on hold. 
Muilenburg said Boeing has been talking to customers and is sensitive to the impact of the crisis on their operations. He said the focus is on getting the MAX flying again.
Last week Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production due to the 737 MAX grounding had cost it at least $1 billion so far.
Shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of defrauding them by concealing safety deficiencies in the plane. The model is also the target of investigations by U.S. transportation authorities and the Department of Justice.
The FAA is also investigating at least four calls from whistleblowers on concerns including the angle of attack sensor and MCAS, a government official said on Monday.
Boeing declined to comment.
Manant Vaidya of Canada, who lost six family members in the Ethiopian crash, said he had repeatedly heard Muilenburg defending the design and certification of the 737 MAX.

""At the end of the day, if everything was followed how could the crash have occurred?"" Vaidya asked at the news conference at Clifford Law Offices.

1573,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Shares of Google's Parent Slide as Earnings Beat but Revenue Misses,"Investing.com - Shares of Alphabet, the corporate parent of search giant Google, were falling after hours Monday after the company reported first quarter earnings  that beat analysts' expectations but revenue that fell short of forecasts.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares fell nearly 7% after hitting new closing and 52-week highs in regular trading on a day when the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite finished at record highs.
Alphabet reported earnings per share of $11.90 on revenue of $36.34 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had forecast earnings of $10.53 on revenue of $37.3 billion.
The earnings were down 10.7% from a year ago because of a $1.7 billion fine levied by the European Commission, charging agreements that Google had with AdSense for search partners infringed on European competition law. Without the fine, Alphabet said it would have earned 11.50 a share.
A year ago, Alphabet earned $13.33 on revenue of $31.15 billion. The company had reported earnings of $12.77 on revenue of $39.28 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Total revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $36.33 billion, but investors slammed the shares because the gain in the first quarter of 2018 was 26%. In addition, the operating margin fell to 18% from 25% a year earlier. Most of the decline was due to the EU fine. Without the fine, the margin would have been 23%, still lower than a year ago.
Google advertising revenue grew 15.3% to $30.72 billion. Traffic acquisition costs -- or payments to vendors using the Google system -- rose slightly to $3.48 biilion.
Capital expenditures were lower than expected at $4.64 billion. Alphabet has been spending heavily in recent years adding data centers and the like, and analysts had expected capital spending of $6.06 billion.
With the regular close, Alphabet shares were up 24% on the year and were close to a market capitalization of $900 billion. If the after-hours price of $1,207.10 holds on Tuesday, the year-to-date gain would drop to 15.5% with the market cap closer to $840 billion."
1574,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Uber quizzed on growth at IPO roadshow in London,"By Clara Denina and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi sought to persuade money managers in London that the loss-making ride hailing firm's growth plans justified a valuation of up to $91.5 billion in an initial public offering (IPO).
In the ballroom at Claridge's, the five-star hotel in London's wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened on Monday to Khosrowshahi and Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai talk about the company's plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping. 
Uber is trying to show investors that it can shift from being simply a ride-hailing service to a technology platform for services ranging from delivering groceries and take-away meals to organizing freight transportation. 
""While they didn't call themselves Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they made several references to their platform and how they intend to build that out,"" said one investor who attended the hour-long presentation but declined to be named. 
Uber reported on Friday it was aiming for a valuation of between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion, less than the $120 billion investment bankers told the company last year it could fetch.
It also disclosed it suffered a loss of around $1 billion on sales of roughly $3 billion in the first quarter of 2019.
Uber has cautioned in its IPO filing that it may never make a profit and some investors at the roadshow said the ride-hailing industry faces hurdles such as increased regulation and local minimum wages that could hamper profitability. 
""It's going to be much more difficult and cumbersome to extract profitability,"" said another investor who attended the roadshow. Uber's lower valuation target follows the poor performance of smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), whose shares are down around 20 percent from when the company listed last month.
Lyft was the first U.S. ride-hailing company to go public and one challenge investors grappled with was how to value a company with no clear peer. 
The second investor who attended the Uber roadshow said people should look at the airline industry, as opposed to other technology companies, when assessing Uber's business model. 
""If you think about airlines, there's a lot of barriers to entry and there are capital intensive barriers, but ultimately airlines are not massively profitable,"" the investor said. 
A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the investor comments. 
DISCREET CAMPAIGN
After widespread media coverage of Lyft's IPO marketing, Uber appears to be aiming for a more discreet roadshow. 
Investors were not told the presentation's venue until around three hours before it began, and attendees all had to show government-issued identification before being granted admission with media firmly barred. 
One investor, who declined to be named like the others, complained that the event was relatively brief, saying they did not have a chance to ask many questions. 
A source working on the roadshow said the presentation - the only one for investors outside of the U.S. - lasted only around 10 minutes, with another 50 spent on questions and answers.
As well as growth and cost-control, several questions focused on the company's culture and business practices following a string of embarrassing scandals have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.
In London, the transport authority refused to renew Uber's license in September 2017 citing safety concerns, though it was granted a 15-month probationary operating license last June, telling a court it had improved its procedures. 
""The CEO was very impressive and their governance is much better now, they've done so much in a short space of time,"" said the first investor. Khosrowshahi took the role in Aug. 2017, succeeding co-founder Travis Kalanick.
The Uber IPO, which is expected to price on May 9 according to people familiar with the matter, would rank as the largest in the United States since that of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014.

The Uber IPO is being led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 03:17PM ET</span>",Tesla says may seek new funding; shares up after SEC agreement,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Monday it could seek alternative sources of financing, days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reached a deal with U.S. securities regulators to settle a dispute over his Twitter use, removing an overhang on the stock.
Shares of the electric carmaker rose 1.8 percent to $239.42 in late trading. 
Tesla said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects cash generated from its business to be enough to fund its investments and pay down debt for at least the next 12 months, but that it may decide to raise debt to fund growth. 
Wall Street has been looking for more details after Musk last week said, ""It's probably about the right time"" to raise capital. He was speaking after the company posted a $700 million loss for the first quarter.
Many analysts had predicted the company would need to raise funds for its expansion, including the Shanghai factory, the upcoming Model Y SUV and other projects. 
Musk's agreement with the SEC on Friday puts the focus back on execution as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time. 
So far, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, several rounds of equity sales, issued convertible notes, a $1.8 billion junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes.
The company's preferred method for raising capital in public debt markets has been through convertible securities, with seven issued since 2013. These have allowed it to raise funds at a lower interest rate than plain-vanilla bonds because investors are willing to accept a lower coupon for the prospect of converting the debt to equity. 
Of Tesla's three convertibles to have reached maturity to date, however, only one has been converted into equity. The company's stock failed to reach the conversion price for the other two, forcing it to repay the bondholders in cash.
The company paid off $920 million in debt earlier this year and a $566 million repayment is due in November.
""It's all speculation but beyond the bond and equity markets Tesla could do a direct cash investment from an investor like a big private equity firm or a firm like SoftBank,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston said. 
He said the company is more likely to just issue equity, adding that ""the share count is so small relative to big automakers and the cash raise would ease any investor anxiety that the market probably would not severely punish the dilution, if at all"".
Tesla is rated six notches into noninvestment grade, or junk bond, territory by both Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. Both rating agencies have a negative outlook on the company's debt.
""If it was just straight debt they'd have to pay a higher interest rate. But convertible investors are willing to pay for some potential future upside in the equity,"" Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management said after Musk's comments on Wednesday. 
""Tesla, of all companies, sells the story of their upside.""
The company expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for the next two fiscal years, a spokesperson told Reuters. 
Tesla's $1.8 billion junk bond sank half a cent to yield 8.42 percent on Friday, more than 3 percentage points above the bond's coupon rate of 5.3 percent.
Its spread, or the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding Tesla debt rather than a safer U.S. Treasury security, widened by about 15 basis points to a near-record 611 basis points.

Tesla has in the past talked about raising funds through alternative sources, but interest has spiked following Musk's comments on raising capital.

1577,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>",Colombia's Avianca says bankruptcy of Avianca Brasil causing 'reputational harm',"(Reuters) - Colombia's Avianca Holdings SA said on Monday it is experiencing ""reputational harm"" from its association with Avianca Brasil, an air carrier that licenses its name and has canceled over 1,000 flights amid a bankruptcy restructuring. 
Both Aviancas belong to the same family-owned business group, led by brothers German and Jose Efromovich, but are maintained as separate companies. Bogota-based Avianca Holdings is the larger, better-known airline and licenses its brand for free to two smaller airlines owned by the Efromovich brothers, one in Brazil and one in Argentina.
The disclosures were made by Avianca Holdings in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission on Monday. It added in the filing that association with the Argentine and Brazilian carriers ""could generally result in an overall decrease in customer confidence, any of which could lead to a significant loss of business.""
Avianca Holdings and Avianca Brasil had been planning a merger but it was abruptly canceled when the Brazilian airline filed for bankruptcy in December, crippled by high fuel and leasing payments.
While Avianca Brasil managed to keep most of its planes after filing for bankruptcy, its operations have unraveled in recent weeks leading to more than 1,000 flight cancellations.
Avianca Brasil's bankruptcy also has meant that Avianca Holdings will need to absorb four planes it had subleased to its sister airline, according to the securities filing. Avianca Holdings said it was looking into incorporating the planes to its fleet or selling them. 
In late 2018, Avianca Brasil operated as many as 60 Airbus aircraft but is now operating with fewer than 10, according to court documents. The airline has also canceled all of its international routes, and Brazil's civil aviation regulator said last week that Avianca Brasil was now operating out of just four domestic airports. 

The Argentine airline, which was bought from the family of now-president Mauricio Macri, is similarly troubled. A planned flight between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires was announced but canceled before its inaugural flight due to financial troubles. Earlier this year, Avianca Argentina started a so-called ""crisis procedure"" with Argentine authorities to allow it to dismiss certain employees.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 05:13PM ET</span>",Boeing CEO keeps job intact after facing questions on 737 MAX crashes,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg emerged with his job intact at an annual meeting on Monday and promised to win back the public's trust after facing tough questions in the wake of two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX plane.
Battling the biggest crisis of his nearly four years as chief executive officer, Muilenburg survived a shareholder motion to split his chairman and CEO roles.
He later told reporters he would continue to lead the company through a crisis that has triggered the grounding of Boeing's fastest-selling plane, lawsuits, investigations and lingering concerns over the 737 MAX's safety.
""I am very focused on safety going forward,"" he said after the meeting when reporters asked if he had considered resigning. ""I am strongly vested in that. My clear intent is to continue to lead on the front of safety, quality and integrity."" 
However, Boeing will need to win back the trust of customers, passengers and regulators following the crashes. 
""We know we do have work to do to earn and re-earn that trust and we will,"" Muilenburg said before ending the 16-minute news conference and ignoring shouted questions from reporters as he walked away.
The family of one American victim, 24-year-old Samya Stumo, staged a silent protest outside the meeting site in Chicago, while the families of other victims among the 157 killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX on March 10 held a tearful press conference at a Chicago law firm. 
That plane plunged to the ground shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, five months after a similar Lion Air nosedive in Indonesia that killed all 189 passengers and crew.
The families spoke after filing a wrongful death lawsuit against Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, which designed the sensors used in the 737 MAX, in Chicago federal court, one of dozens of lawsuits Boeing is facing over both crashes.
STUBBED TOE
Daniel Johnson, an engineer and an intermittent Boeing shareholder since 1984, said the company ""really stubbed their toe"" by allowing the plane's anti-stall system - called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS - to rely on only one sensor.
""The question is: Will they need to rebrand? We don’t know how much the general public actually knows what a 737 MAX is,” Johnson said outside the meeting.
About 150 shareholders gathered in the auditorium of the Chicago Field Museum for the meeting, but only a handful questioned Muilenburg over the MAX. 
One shareholder asked Muilenburg what Boeing was doing on safety assessments following the crashes. The CEO said the company's commitment to safety has not wavered.
“Safety is at the core of what we do. Every day, we try to get better,"" Muilenburg said at the meeting, which took place exactly six months after the Lion Air crash.
Shares of the company, worth $214 billion, have lost nearly 10 percent of their value since the March 10 crash. 
Boeing is under pressure to deliver a software fix to prevent erroneous data from triggering the MCAS system and a new pilot training package that will convince global regulators, and the flying public, that the aircraft is safe. 
Boeing has acknowledged that the accidental firing of the software based on bad sensor data was a common link in the chain of events leading to the two accidents.
""We know we can break this link in the chain. It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk,"" Muilenburg told shareholders. When asked by reporters if the MCAS system was flawed, he said only that Boeing was making improvements to it.
$1 BILLION IMPACT
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration could clear Boeing's 737 MAX jet to fly in late May or the first part of June, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday, though Boeing has yet to submit the updated software and training for review. 
Some pilots have warned that draft training proposals do not go far enough to address their concerns.
Boeing repeated on Monday it was making progress to certify its grounded jets with the software update. 
Meanwhile, deliveries of the 737 MAX, which airlines around the world had been relying on to service a growing air travel industry for years to come, are on hold. 
Muilenburg said Boeing has been talking to customers and is sensitive to the impact of the crisis on their operations. He said the focus is on getting the MAX flying again.
Last week Boeing abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and said lowered production due to the 737 MAX grounding had cost it at least $1 billion so far.
Shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing the company of defrauding them by concealing safety deficiencies in the plane. The model is also the target of investigations by U.S. transportation authorities and the Department of Justice.
The FAA is also investigating at least four calls from whistleblowers on concerns including the angle of attack sensor and MCAS, a government official said on Monday.
Boeing declined to comment.
Manant Vaidya of Canada, who lost six family members in the Ethiopian crash, said he had repeatedly heard Muilenburg defending the design and certification of the 737 MAX.

""At the end of the day, if everything was followed how could the crash have occurred?"" Vaidya asked at the news conference at Clifford Law Offices.

1582,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Shares of Google's Parent Slide as Earnings Beat but Revenue Misses,"Investing.com - Shares of Alphabet, the corporate parent of search giant Google, were falling after hours Monday after the company reported first quarter earnings  that beat analysts' expectations but revenue that fell short of forecasts.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares fell nearly 7% after hitting new closing and 52-week highs in regular trading on a day when the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite finished at record highs.
Alphabet reported earnings per share of $11.90 on revenue of $36.34 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had forecast earnings of $10.53 on revenue of $37.3 billion.
The earnings were down 10.7% from a year ago because of a $1.7 billion fine levied by the European Commission, charging agreements that Google had with AdSense for search partners infringed on European competition law. Without the fine, Alphabet said it would have earned 11.50 a share.
A year ago, Alphabet earned $13.33 on revenue of $31.15 billion. The company had reported earnings of $12.77 on revenue of $39.28 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Total revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $36.33 billion, but investors slammed the shares because the gain in the first quarter of 2018 was 26%. In addition, the operating margin fell to 18% from 25% a year earlier. Most of the decline was due to the EU fine. Without the fine, the margin would have been 23%, still lower than a year ago.
Google advertising revenue grew 15.3% to $30.72 billion. Traffic acquisition costs -- or payments to vendors using the Google system -- rose slightly to $3.48 biilion.
Capital expenditures were lower than expected at $4.64 billion. Alphabet has been spending heavily in recent years adding data centers and the like, and analysts had expected capital spending of $6.06 billion.
With the regular close, Alphabet shares were up 24% on the year and were close to a market capitalization of $900 billion. If the after-hours price of $1,207.10 holds on Tuesday, the year-to-date gain would drop to 15.5% with the market cap closer to $840 billion."
1583,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>",Uber quizzed on growth at IPO roadshow in London,"By Clara Denina and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi sought to persuade money managers in London that the loss-making ride hailing firm's growth plans justified a valuation of up to $91.5 billion in an initial public offering (IPO).
In the ballroom at Claridge's, the five-star hotel in London's wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened on Monday to Khosrowshahi and Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai talk about the company's plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping. 
Uber is trying to show investors that it can shift from being simply a ride-hailing service to a technology platform for services ranging from delivering groceries and take-away meals to organizing freight transportation. 
""While they didn't call themselves Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), they made several references to their platform and how they intend to build that out,"" said one investor who attended the hour-long presentation but declined to be named. 
Uber reported on Friday it was aiming for a valuation of between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion, less than the $120 billion investment bankers told the company last year it could fetch.
It also disclosed it suffered a loss of around $1 billion on sales of roughly $3 billion in the first quarter of 2019.
Uber has cautioned in its IPO filing that it may never make a profit and some investors at the roadshow said the ride-hailing industry faces hurdles such as increased regulation and local minimum wages that could hamper profitability. 
""It's going to be much more difficult and cumbersome to extract profitability,"" said another investor who attended the roadshow. Uber's lower valuation target follows the poor performance of smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), whose shares are down around 20 percent from when the company listed last month.
Lyft was the first U.S. ride-hailing company to go public and one challenge investors grappled with was how to value a company with no clear peer. 
The second investor who attended the Uber roadshow said people should look at the airline industry, as opposed to other technology companies, when assessing Uber's business model. 
""If you think about airlines, there's a lot of barriers to entry and there are capital intensive barriers, but ultimately airlines are not massively profitable,"" the investor said. 
A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the investor comments. 
DISCREET CAMPAIGN
After widespread media coverage of Lyft's IPO marketing, Uber appears to be aiming for a more discreet roadshow. 
Investors were not told the presentation's venue until around three hours before it began, and attendees all had to show government-issued identification before being granted admission with media firmly barred. 
One investor, who declined to be named like the others, complained that the event was relatively brief, saying they did not have a chance to ask many questions. 
A source working on the roadshow said the presentation - the only one for investors outside of the U.S. - lasted only around 10 minutes, with another 50 spent on questions and answers.
As well as growth and cost-control, several questions focused on the company's culture and business practices following a string of embarrassing scandals have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.
In London, the transport authority refused to renew Uber's license in September 2017 citing safety concerns, though it was granted a 15-month probationary operating license last June, telling a court it had improved its procedures. 
""The CEO was very impressive and their governance is much better now, they've done so much in a short space of time,"" said the first investor. Khosrowshahi took the role in Aug. 2017, succeeding co-founder Travis Kalanick.
The Uber IPO, which is expected to price on May 9 according to people familiar with the matter, would rank as the largest in the United States since that of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014.

The Uber IPO is being led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 03:17PM ET</span>",Tesla says may seek new funding; shares up after SEC agreement,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Monday it could seek alternative sources of financing, days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk reached a deal with U.S. securities regulators to settle a dispute over his Twitter use, removing an overhang on the stock.
Shares of the electric carmaker rose 1.8 percent to $239.42 in late trading. 
Tesla said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects cash generated from its business to be enough to fund its investments and pay down debt for at least the next 12 months, but that it may decide to raise debt to fund growth. 
Wall Street has been looking for more details after Musk last week said, ""It's probably about the right time"" to raise capital. He was speaking after the company posted a $700 million loss for the first quarter.
Many analysts had predicted the company would need to raise funds for its expansion, including the Shanghai factory, the upcoming Model Y SUV and other projects. 
Musk's agreement with the SEC on Friday puts the focus back on execution as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time. 
So far, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, several rounds of equity sales, issued convertible notes, a $1.8 billion junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes.
The company's preferred method for raising capital in public debt markets has been through convertible securities, with seven issued since 2013. These have allowed it to raise funds at a lower interest rate than plain-vanilla bonds because investors are willing to accept a lower coupon for the prospect of converting the debt to equity. 
Of Tesla's three convertibles to have reached maturity to date, however, only one has been converted into equity. The company's stock failed to reach the conversion price for the other two, forcing it to repay the bondholders in cash.
The company paid off $920 million in debt earlier this year and a $566 million repayment is due in November.
""It's all speculation but beyond the bond and equity markets Tesla could do a direct cash investment from an investor like a big private equity firm or a firm like SoftBank,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston said. 
He said the company is more likely to just issue equity, adding that ""the share count is so small relative to big automakers and the cash raise would ease any investor anxiety that the market probably would not severely punish the dilution, if at all"".
Tesla is rated six notches into noninvestment grade, or junk bond, territory by both Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. Both rating agencies have a negative outlook on the company's debt.
""If it was just straight debt they'd have to pay a higher interest rate. But convertible investors are willing to pay for some potential future upside in the equity,"" Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management said after Musk's comments on Wednesday. 
""Tesla, of all companies, sells the story of their upside.""
The company expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion this year and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for the next two fiscal years, a spokesperson told Reuters. 
Tesla's $1.8 billion junk bond sank half a cent to yield 8.42 percent on Friday, more than 3 percentage points above the bond's coupon rate of 5.3 percent.
Its spread, or the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding Tesla debt rather than a safer U.S. Treasury security, widened by about 15 basis points to a near-record 611 basis points.

Tesla has in the past talked about raising funds through alternative sources, but interest has spiked following Musk's comments on raising capital.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>",Colombia's Avianca says bankruptcy of Avianca Brasil causing 'reputational harm',"(Reuters) - Colombia's Avianca Holdings SA said on Monday it is experiencing ""reputational harm"" from its association with Avianca Brasil, an air carrier that licenses its name and has canceled over 1,000 flights amid a bankruptcy restructuring. 
Both Aviancas belong to the same family-owned business group, led by brothers German and Jose Efromovich, but are maintained as separate companies. Bogota-based Avianca Holdings is the larger, better-known airline and licenses its brand for free to two smaller airlines owned by the Efromovich brothers, one in Brazil and one in Argentina.
The disclosures were made by Avianca Holdings in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission on Monday. It added in the filing that association with the Argentine and Brazilian carriers ""could generally result in an overall decrease in customer confidence, any of which could lead to a significant loss of business.""
Avianca Holdings and Avianca Brasil had been planning a merger but it was abruptly canceled when the Brazilian airline filed for bankruptcy in December, crippled by high fuel and leasing payments.
While Avianca Brasil managed to keep most of its planes after filing for bankruptcy, its operations have unraveled in recent weeks leading to more than 1,000 flight cancellations.
Avianca Brasil's bankruptcy also has meant that Avianca Holdings will need to absorb four planes it had subleased to its sister airline, according to the securities filing. Avianca Holdings said it was looking into incorporating the planes to its fleet or selling them. 
In late 2018, Avianca Brasil operated as many as 60 Airbus aircraft but is now operating with fewer than 10, according to court documents. The airline has also canceled all of its international routes, and Brazil's civil aviation regulator said last week that Avianca Brasil was now operating out of just four domestic airports. 

The Argentine airline, which was bought from the family of now-president Mauricio Macri, is similarly troubled. A planned flight between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires was announced but canceled before its inaugural flight due to financial troubles. Earlier this year, Avianca Argentina started a so-called ""crisis procedure"" with Argentine authorities to allow it to dismiss certain employees.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Is Buffett still a buy? Wall Street splits on Berkshire Hathaway as annual meeting looms,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Two longtime analysts of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc appear deeply divided over prospects for the company led since 1965 by billionaire Warren Buffett, in reports issued on Monday ahead of this weekend's shareholder extravaganza.
Jay Gelb of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital, who rates Berkshire ""overweight,"" said the company appeared well-positioned to benefit from economic expansion, share buybacks and major acquisitions despite problems at Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, where it has a 26.7 percent stake.
In contrast, Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who rates Berkshire ""market perform,"" said the company's sprawl makes it difficult to generate outsized returns, especially after Buffett, 88, is no longer chief executive officer.
Berkshire owns more that 90 companies such as the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad, several industrial parts and equipment companies, and See's candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.
It also owns big stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), financial services companies including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, and the four largest U.S. airlines.
Tens of thousands of people will be in Omaha, Nebraska this weekend for Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend, including the May 4 annual meeting.
This, despite that many shareholders have not recently fared as well at Berkshire as they might have elsewhere.
The company's stock price has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 since 2009. And in 2019, it had risen 4.9 percent through Friday while the S&P was up 17.3 percent.
Barclay's Gelb said CEO succession has been an overhang though the quality of Berkshire's management is ""among the best,"" with Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, 56, and Ajit Jain, 67, among the top candidates.
He also said Kraft Heinz has ""become a weakness"" for Berkshire, which in February took a $3 billion writedown because the packaged food company has failed to keep up as consumers shifted to healthier and private-label products, but other investments could help overcome the drag.
Shields of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods was less forgiving.
He said Kraft Heinz may signal that transformative dealmaking may ""not be Berkshire's strong suit,"" and ""internet-era information democratization"" may make it harder for Buffett to assess brand loyalty and pricing power.
Shields also said Berkshire investors may have become too reliant on Buffett's public persona and past investment successes, rather than looking at the Berkshire of today.

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its Class A shares were up $4,542 at $325,542 in early afternoon trading. Gelb's price target is $375,000, and Shields' is $338,160.

1593,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 01:04PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Mattel Rides Wave of Avengers: Endgame Fanfare; Shares up 5%,"Investing.com – Mattel rallied on Monday, as investors bet that record box office revenue for the hit film ""Avengers: Engame"" would ramp up sales of the toy-maker's Avengers toys.
""Avengers: Endgame"" hauled in $1.2 billion in global ticket sales in its opening weekend, raising expectations for sales of ancillary products. Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) shares jumped more than 5% Monday. They're up 26% this year after falling 35% in 2018.
The fanfare is unlikely to fade any time soon, with analysts touting the prospect of ""Endgame"" becoming the highest grossing film of all time.
“When considering that international box office proceeds generated 67% of ‘Infinity War’s’ ultimate world-wide box office take, we believe 'Endgame could be positioned to generate $2.7 billion to $3.5 billion in ultimate world wide box office,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a research note Monday.
The rally in Mattel comes less than a week after Mattel reported a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter and revenue that beat estimates from analysts polled by Investing.com.
The better-than-expected results were led by strong sales of Barbie dolls and a parade of toy-related films that hit theaters and energized sales of Mattel's ""Jurassic World"" and ""Toy Story"" toys.
But not everyone is backing the toy maker amid concerns over top and bottom line growth.
""(W)e prefer to stay on the sidelines until we see sustainable top and bottom line momentum,"" said CFRA, an independent research provider.
Others have outlined the reputation risk from the company's recent recall of its Rock 'n' Play Sleeper as a concern. About 4.7 million units were recalled.
""We estimate full cash refund for six month ownership of ~$18 million to $22 million, assuming a 100% redemption rate,"" wrote UBS analysts led by Arpine Kocharyan. “We estimate an additional $20 million to $40 million of voucher redemption exposure."" That projection was based on a 50%-to-100% redemption rate, UBS said."

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",European shares end higher as Spanish stocks recover poise,"By Susan Mathew and Agamoni Ghosh
(Reuters) - European shares closed marginally higher on Monday led by gains for  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), as investors chose to focus on the positives of a weekend win for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's ruling socialists in Spain's third election in four years.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.08 percent stronger, with most regional indices ending in positive territory.
Spain's IBEX, down nearly 1 percent earlier in the session, finished up 0.12 percent as losses for utilities were outweighed by the rally in the shares of the country's major lenders.
Sanchez's pro-European PSOE won Sunday's election, but was short of a parliamentary majority, meaning it will need the help of regional parties, or the centre-right, to form a coalition government. 
""It looks like we are going to be able to continue with a government under PSOE,"" said Bert Colijn, a euro zone-focused senior economist at ING. 
""I would say it's quite a positive story. I think that in general being pro-European is good for reform and policy and his being pro-euro zone would help markets.""  
Jitters around the result of the poll, added to weak euro zone economic sentiment data, had pushed markets lower in morning trade in Europe. 
But the gains for Santander, leading banks across Europe higher, along with a dip in Spanish bond market yields, pointed to a more positive take on the events from investors.
Europe's banking sector index rose almost 1 percent, with HSBC,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) all among the top ten boosts to the broader STOXX 600 index.
French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) also rose 1.7 percent after positive U.S. and European regulator decisions on cholesterol and diabetes drugs co-developed by the company.
Airbus gained 0.95 percent as Middle East carrier Flydubai's chairman said the airline could order Airbus A320neos as replacements for Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets.
A fall in German drug-maker Bayer (DE:BAYGN), as well as oil majors tracking a decline in crude prices, kept gains in check.
Bayer shares, which were trading ex-dividend, fell as a majority of shareholders rejected the management's actions on Friday, fuelling market talk the company could become a takeover target.
About 30 billion euros have been wiped off Bayer's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which the company finished taking over last year, had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. 

Market participants will watch out for a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Chinese factory data this week for further clues on policy direction in the world's largest economies.

1597,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley's S&P 500 Bear Unbowed After Admitting Bad Call,"(Bloomberg) -- Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson acknowledges he made the wrong call on the U.S. equity market this year. But that hasn’t dissuaded him from holding onto one of Wall Street’s most bearish forecasts.
With the S&P 500 Index at a record high after surging 17 percent this year, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist issued a mea culpa Monday, saying he underestimated a rally that’s been driven in large part by the Federal Reserve’s dovish tilt. Rather than revisiting the 2018 trough, as Wilson had predicted in January, stocks have kept marching higher.
It’s the second time in seven months that Wilson has owned up to an overly pessimistic prediction. Last September, he said his early call for a correction amounted to the same thing as not being right. A few weeks later, stocks began a sell-off that ultimately took the S&P 500 to the brink of a bear market.
Still, Wilson is sticking by his longer-term outlook for the market. Even though this year’s rebound has pushed the S&P 500 about 7 percent above his year-end target of 2,750, fundamentals just don’t support the market’s current levels, according to his analysis.
“We have to acknowledge our error and decide if the market is telling us something and if we should raise our targets,” Wilson wrote. “The short answer is no because valuations are full and we still see downside risk to the consensus earnings estimates over the next 12 months.”
At 17 times forecast earnings, the S&P 500 is trading at a multiple that’s 14 percent higher than its 10-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While first-quarter earnings have come in better than expected, analysts have continued to lower estimates for coming quarters. The expected rate of growth for the current quarter just turned negative.
While the size of predicted declines is small, any deterioration would raise the odds for an earnings recession, a scenario that Wilson predicts for this year. Despite the unfavorable profit backdrop, speculation that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates and optimism that a China-U.S. trade agreement will be reached have continued to lift the market.
The S&P 500 could rise to 3,000, about 2 percent above its current level, on the announcement of a trade deal, but that should be seen as a sell signal, according to the strategist. Despite growing talk about a market melt-up, investors shouldn’t chase the rally, he said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) defines a market melt-up as a period when the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio moves to high levels versus its recent past very quickly. The firm identified six instances over the past three decades that fit the criteria and found they shared something in common: they’re either accompanied by monetary or fiscal stimulus.
While the Fed has tilted more market friendly, Wilson suggested the current environment lacks other elements that would embolden a melt-up, such as a weaker dollar, better growth outlook and a potential uptick in consumer confidence. In particular, companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). have cut capital spending while small-caps and cyclical shares have trailed the market, all evidence pointing to subdued growth prospects.
“The positive spin is that maybe last week’s spike is like the spike in early January 2018 and we still have another spike to look forward to as people decide they have to pile in,” Wilson wrote. “Use at your own peril, but our advice is to not bet on it at this stage because the fundamental conditions are different from past periods that exhibited such exuberance.”

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 12:23PM ET</span>",The obscure advisory committees at the heart of the U.S. drug pricing debate,"By Caroline Humer
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Expectations were high last year for three new migraine drugs hitting the market from  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA). 
Priced around $7,000 each, the drugmakers called them ""breakthrough"" treatments designed to prevent migraines when taken year-round, and estimated that millions of patients could benefit. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration said Amgen's Aimovig – the first of the three drugs approved – was an ""important addition"" to available treatments.
But a small group of external medical experts who quietly advise U.S. health insurers on new drugs was not impressed, according to a private meeting held at UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) Group's OptumRx offices in Chicago that was attended by Reuters. 
They concluded that all three medicines offered no clear benefit over drugs already on the market and that insurers could consider them optional when it came to health coverage. They advised putting limits into place on their use. 
While these experts do not discuss drug costs, their view of the clinical value of the new migraine drugs emboldened OptumRx, which manages prescription drug benefits, to demand steep discounts from the three manufacturers. Similar ""pharmacy and therapeutics"" (P&T) committees at rivals CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Cigna (NYSE:CI) Inc's Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) came to the same conclusion. 
The impact of their rulings will be on display on Tuesday, when Amgen, which co-markets the drug with Novartis AG, and Lilly report on their quarterly financial performance. 
When asked by Reuters about the OptumRx committee decision, the three drugmakers said the new therapies represent an important advance to patients who are not helped by existing treatments, or who have struggled to stay on their medications. They stress that for some patients, the new migraine drugs cut by half the number of days they experience headaches each month. 
These relatively unknown expert committees have been involved in drug coverage decisions for decades. Their identities are kept secret due to federal regulations aimed at preventing pharmaceutical industry interference. The committees make their decisions based on a drug's clinical value, independent of cost, pharmacy benefit managers say. But their power has grown more recently with the consolidation of most of the U.S. pharmacy benefits business under OptumRx, CVS and Express Scripts. Taken together, their three advisory committees now guide drug coverage for more than 90 million Americans. 
P&T committees also hold sway over record numbers of novel and expensive medicines introduced into the U.S. market each year, more often with less evidence of effectiveness or safety than in the past. 
New drugs that may fall under their scrutiny in the next year include potentially life-saving therapies for spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as oral treatments for migraine, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. 
Their decisions have new consequences as the pharmacy benefits companies they advise are more likely to exclude a new treatment from coverage if it is deemed on par with existing therapies. Or they can demand discounts - or rebates - from drugmakers in exchange for the coverage. 
""If the committee says (a treatment) is no better than the existing drug, there is a very decent possibility that it might get a less preferred status or not be included"" for reimbursement, said Jack Hoadley, a health policy expert at Georgetown University. 
OptumRx's ability to call the shots on drug coverage for more than 30 million people make it a formidable negotiator for clients like Ben Johnson, a pharmacy director for a health plan in Utah that covers about 20,000 railroad union workers. Johnson once relied on his own P&T committee to determine whether a drug was effective and worth the price. 
Now he is often among the dozens of OptumRx clients and consultants invited to observe the quarterly P&T committee meetings in Chicago. Handing that role to OptumRx has tripled the value of rebates that his plan receives, Johnson said. 
FROM ""BREAKTHROUGH"" TO ""OPTIONAL"" 
Drugmakers say pharmacy benefit managers such as OptumRx are middlemen that take too great a cut of the discounts they negotiate and ultimately drive prices higher. 
U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump have taken up that criticism, and the administration has proposed banning rebates in government health programs unless benefits managers hand over the savings to patients. 
OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS say that their method of reviewing a drug's benefit and subsequent price negotiations has lowered prescription drug costs, and that 95 to 98 percent of the discounts they receive are passed on to their clients. 
In the case of the migraine drugs, Amgen, Lilly and Teva were quick to advertise the potential benefits directly to U.S. consumers once they were approved, months before the pharmacy benefits companies made decisions on how to cover the drugs. 
Television commercials from the drugmakers highlighted how some patients had their headache days cut in half, or more. The manufacturers offered the drugs to commercially insured migraine sufferers for free for up to a year or even longer to entice people to try them. Their primary competition is older, cheaper generic drugs.
Migraines affect more than 39 million Americans, mostly women, and Amgen estimated 8 million could be candidates for the preventative therapies, which are delivered by injection every month or few months. Analysts forecast $4 billion in annual sales by 2026 in major global markets. 
OptumRx convened its advisory committee of a dozen doctors and pharmacists last November to review the new migraine drugs.
These experts pointed to clinical trial data showing that patients taking the new drugs experienced an average of 1 to 2.5 fewer migraine days a month than those treated with a placebo, and said that was on par with existing therapies, though there were no clinical studies directly comparing the two groups of medicines. 
The committee acknowledged that some patients saw a much bigger benefit from the new drugs, but said the data did not show who might be helped the most. They questioned the limited safety data and the unknown long-term effects on the body. 
""Let's be cautious and see how it all plays out, but we need to look at these studies with a jaundiced eye,"" one of the members said. The committee's verdict: All three drugs should be considered ""optional"" treatments that provide no unique benefit. OptumRx Chief Medical Officer Sumit Dutta said the decision, based on available clinical data, provided balance to the drugmakers' claims. 
""There are plenty of examples of drugs that have a lot of enthusiasm in the beginning,"" but that later turned out to be problematic, Dutta said. 
Because OptumRx could choose not to cover any of the new migraine drugs, it could push aggressively for discounts. On February 1, it began to cover Amgen's Aimovig and Lilly's Emgality. Teva's Ajovy would only be covered if patients did not benefit from the other two drugs. 
Leerink biotech analyst Ami Fadia estimates manufacturer rebates on the drugs are as high as 50 percent. 
Amgen said 200,000 U.S. patients have been prescribed Aimovig, with about half of prescriptions being filled for free. Teva and Lilly have not provided figures on patient use. Teva said in February it expects 2019 sales for Ajovy of $150 million. 

For its part, Express Scripts estimates that only 128,000 of its covered patients will be good candidates for the new therapies, and has a program to closely manage who receives them. OptumRx and CVS declined to provide similar forecasts.

1602,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",Anadarko Board to Consider Occidental Bid ,"(Bloomberg) -- Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). plans to resume talks about a potential $38 billion takeover by Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY)., a move that threatens to scupper a previously agreed deal with  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
In a unanimous decision, Anadarko’s board of directors determined the Occidental bid ""could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal,"" the company said in a statement Monday. It added that an earlier agreement to merge with Chevron remains in effect.
The move sets the stage for Chevron to come back with a sweetened offer. Under the terms of the companies’ April 12 merger agreement, if Anadarko formally declares the Occidental offer to be superior, Chevron then has four days to make another proposal. While it has ample financial firepower to top Occidental’s offer, it may opt instead to avoid an expensive bidding war. Taking the $1 billion break-up fee that’s part of their accord and walking away would be an acceptable outcome for Chevron, Jefferies LLC analysts Jason Gammel and Daniela Almeida said.
""Chevron CEO Mike Wirth’s mantra is ‘costs matter,’"" the analysts wrote in a note that came out just before the Anadarko statement. ""Chevron’s primary rationale for the acquisition is return enhancement, which erodes as the cost increases.""
Anadarko shares were unchanged as $72.80 at 8:14 a.m. in early trading in New York, while Occidental dropped 1.2 percent. Chevron was little changed.
“We hope Anadarko will proceed quickly to securing this superior transaction for its shareholders,"" Occidental spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said in a statement.
The tussle for Anadarko has transfixed the oil industry over the past two weeks. A takeout of the company would be the largest deal in the sector in at least four years. Chevron and Occidental are targeting the company to expand their presence in the Permian Basin, the world’s largest oil patch.
Occidental went public April 24 with a bid to buy Anadarko for $76 per share in cash and stock. That compares with Chevron’s agreement to buy The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko for $65 a share.
Based on the current per-share valuations of the bids, Occidental’s proposal is about $7 billion higher than Chevron’s, compared with a difference about $5 billion when the deal was first announced. “We believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko’s shareholders,"" Chevron said Monday in an emailed statement.
Investor Vote
That valuation gap has created pressure from investors. New York-based investment firm D.E. Shaw urged the company to run an open sale process, people familiar with the matter said last week.
Although Occidental’s offer is higher, the company’s smaller size and balance sheet compared with Chevron have raised uncertainty over its ability to complete a deal. Unlike Chevron, Occidental would also have to put the deal to a shareholder vote.
“We believe the market has already priced in a higher bid from Chevron,” Jefferies’ Gammel and Almeida said. “We don’t expect that a sweetened Chevron bid would need to meet Oxy’s given the Anadarko board’s evident preference for Chevron stock.”

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 11:49AM ET</span>",Anadarko to negotiate sale to Occidental 'superior' to Chevron deal,"By Arathy S Nair and David French
(Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) said on Monday it would negotiate with Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) over its $38 billion cash-and-stock bid, after determining it could get a better deal than its agreed $33 billion sale to  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
The development represents a breakthrough in Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub's two-year effort to buy Anadarko, one of the top U.S. oil and gas producers in the lucrative Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. Anadarko announced a deal with Chevron on April 12 after snubbing a higher bid from Occidental, prompting Occidental to try to upend the Chevron deal.
""We hope Anadarko will proceed quickly to secure this superior transaction for its shareholders,"" an Occidental spokeswoman said.
Anadarko said its board had unanimously decided that Occidental's offer could result in a ""superior proposal"" but added that its deal with Chevron remained in effect until it decided to cut a new deal with Occidental.
Anadarko asked Chevron on Sunday if it wanted to raise its bid and Chevron declined, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Chevron is reluctant to pay more for Anadarko and does not want to be drawn into a bidding war, the sources said. Chevron also wants to see if Occidental will manage to ink a deal for Anadarko, and whether Occidental shareholders will support it, one of the sources said.
""We believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko's shareholders,"" Chevron said in a statement on Monday.
Chevron and Occidental are vying for one of the biggest prizes in the oil industry: Anadarko's nearly quarter-million-acre holdings in the core of the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field.
The two companies each control land adjacent to Anadarko's properties and expect a deal will add deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.
Occidental unveiled its bid for Anadarko last Wednesday, offering to pay for it half in cash and half with its own shares. Chevron's deal with Anadarko was structured as 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock. Occidental's stock was down 2.38 percent to $59.85.
Anadarko shares were up 0.4 percent to $73.05, slightly below the value of Occidental's offer.
OCCIDENTAL SHAREHOLDERS GET A SAY
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Chevron has four days after being notified by Anadarko's board to respond with a counter-offer. If Anadarko proceeds with a sale to Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee.
The acquisition of Anadarko would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental's holdings in the Permian shale basin, and double its global oil and gas production to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
A key hurdle that Occidental has to overcome in its negotiations with Anadarko is that its proposed deal is contingent on Occidental shareholders voting to approve it. 
These could make a deal more vulnerable to shareholder agitation. For example, activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP tried to shoot down Bristol-Myers Co's $74 billion deal to acquire biotech  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG) earlier this year by trying to convince Bristol-Myers shareholders to vote it down. It was ultimately unsuccessful.
A deal with Chevron offers more certainty to Anadarko in that regard, because Chevron shareholders will not be given a vote. Anadarko shareholders will be given a vote on the sale of the company, be it with Occidental or Chevron.

Chevron and Occidental also have put forward different estimates on the value of the operational synergies they can derive from Anadarko. Chevron projects the synergies to be worth $1 billion a year, while Occidental says it can extract $2 billion annually in synergies.

1605,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>",Siemens Wins $15 Billion Iraq Power Plan Over GE,"(Bloomberg) -- Iraq approved a plan to develop power stations in the country with help from  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), which has been vying with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. to win a deal worth as much as $15 billion.
The cabinet picked Munich-based Siemens, Europe’s biggest engineering company, as a partner in the plan to develop electricity projects in the country, according to a government statement that gave no further details.
The Iraqi order is crucial to both Siemens and GE as it would prop up either company’s ailing power-generation businesses. The race between them led to a flurry of activity by Germany and the U.S. on behalf of the respective companies. Boosting power output is also an urgent priority for Iraq, where sporadic outages and unpredictable supplies of electricity have hobbled the economy ever since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.
In October, U.S. officials said that intervention by President Donald Trump’s administration successfully quashed an agreement for Siemens to develop the power generators and instead persuaded Baghdad to sign an accord with Boston-based GE. But Iraq’s government then said the two companies were on equal footing.
About month later, Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser criticized apparent U.S. political pressure on Iraq to sign the deal as skewing competition.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>","Amazon speeds up shipping, but rivals' stores buck its challenge","By Lisa Baertlein and Nandita Bose
LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon's promise of one-day shipping threatens to upend the retail sector, but its rivals' physical stores give the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  powerful assets that Amazon itself is scrambling to match. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), seeking to stem slowing sales growth, is plowing $800 million this quarter alone into its next-day package delivery project, something even Walmart Inc, the world's biggest retailer, will be hard-pressed to duplicate.
But there is another battle brewing behind the scenes, with Amazon racing to reproduce the assets of the businesses it aims to upend. The move to expedite shipping is a sign of growing pressure from such brick-and-mortar competitors, experts said.
The e-commerce giant, which has a mixed record with brick-and-mortar retail projects, is racing to open shops that sell top-selling items ranging from books to cell phones; rolling out same-day curbside grocery pickup – a service popular with time-crunched suburban Walmart and Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) shoppers; and gearing up to accept returns at all U.S. Kohls Corp department stores.
""This is a sign Amazon needs to compete with its rivals, who now offer free two-day shipping, free pickup, free returns and are using their stores to pose a serious challenge,"" said Frank Poore, chief executive of CommerceHub, a technology company that works with retailers like Walmart, Best Buy and Macy's Inc, helping them manage e-commerce inventory and increase product assortment. 
The ability of brick-and-mortar rivals to catch up with Amazon using their stores indicates the e-commerce giant could be vulnerable as it invests billions of dollars to build out the service.
A source with knowledge of Walmart's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Walmart's current infrastructure will not allow it to match Amazon's one-day shipping in every market but that it is aggressively building up its own network.
""I will not make the assumption that we can't do it as quickly as they can,"" said the source, referring to Amazon, which already offers free one-day shipping to Prime members in more than 10,000 cities and towns.
That confidence pushed the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company to take a jab at Amazon's $119 annual prime service. ""One-day free shipping... without a membership fee. Now THAT would be ground breaking. Stay tuned,"" Walmart tweeted on Friday.
Walmart already offers free, two-day shipping around the country for purchases of $35 and up. Its existing network of 156 distribution centers in densely populated urban areas will make it easier to build out a one-day service, Brandon Fletcher, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a note. 
""One-day shipping is neither shocking nor difficult for retailers at scale,"" Fletcher said.
Walmart declined to comment on Amazon's next-day shipping plans. Target said its shoppers can shop same-day and receive their purchases within hours, including grocery delivery, curbside pickup and order pickup. The last two services are free and require no membership.
Walmart is also moving faster on what the source with knowledge of its plans called the “next wave” in delivery – fresh food – as well as same-day pickup for general merchandise orders and groceries. It has enlisted delivery services like DoorDash to drop shopping bags on customer doorsteps and tapped drive-thru-trained suburbanites to pick up their own online orders.
As of Jan. 31, Walmart offered same-day grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and same-day grocery delivery from nearly 800 stores. It runs nearly 4,700 U.S. stores.
Such efforts are a cost-effective way to fight Amazon, which is building a shipping network to contain costs. But they depend on investors continuing to funnel millions of dollars into unprofitable delivery startups, said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix and SJ Consulting Group.
There is also the risk that next-day shipping could woo fans of order pickup programs.

""Most people didn't need two-day delivery until Amazon made it 'necessary.' The same is likely to happen with one-day,"" said John Bonno, a managing director in the retail practice at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EBRD's Africa expansion plans facing resistance - sources,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's plan to expand its operations into sub-Saharan Africa is facing resistance from some of its top shareholders, several sources at the London-based development bank told Reuters.
Set up in 1991, originally to help ex-communist countries of eastern Europe shift to market economies, and majority owned by G7 top economic powers, the EBRD has spread rapidly over the last decade to more than 35 countries from Morocco to Mongolia.
Ambitions to continue that into sub-Saharan Africa were laid out last year but governments including the United States, Germany and France as well as many in its eastern European heartland have reservations, sources say.
The struggle isn't the only issue shaping the bank's future. Europe is looking to streamline its development financing this year, the bank is due a new president next May, a move to new London headquarters is bogged down by Brexit and the Africa push is part of a broader identity shift. 
EBRD management had hoped to overcome some of the scepticism after internal analysis showed only a fraction of a 3 billion euros-a-year ($3.34 billion) proposed increase to its near 10 billion annual lending could be done in its existing bloc. 
Two national sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said management had proposed an ""Africa full-speed ahead"" agenda for the bank's annual meeting in Bosnia next week, only to see government representatives who sit on the bank's board of directors intervene.
""It was almost unprecedented,"" one of the sources, involved in the discussions, said. ""It was a rare example of where the board comes together and said 'no this is not what we want' and changed it.""
Sixty-seven countries are EBRD shareholders. Previous expansions have required unanimous backing but changes since mean a 'qualified majority' might now be enough. That would give the United States, which holds 10 percent of EBRD shares, and Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Japan with 8.5 percent each, by far the most clout. 
The EBRD declined to comment on the discussions, but sources said months of toing and froing over the Bosnia agenda resulted in a drastically reworked final version with five key 'work streams' tied to the bank's 'Medium-Term Directions' - its priorities for the next five years.
Feasibility work on African countries with ""strong links"" to the existing EBRD region may get approved, but emphasis will now be on expansion into Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Syria, as well as doing more in its existing bloc.
IDENTITY ISSUES
Potentially eye-catching too is a still-to-be-quantified increase to the EBRD's financial buffers to give it additional protection in case the slowdown in the European and global economy worsens and causes losses on its loans.
Though not directly linked, one source added a ""significant"" chunk of the bank's Turkish investments were now on an internal ""watch"" list after the country's slump into recession.
Turkey’s Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is due at the Bosnia meeting and will give a public presentation and Q&A session on May 8.
The agenda shows governments will also discuss disbursing some of the bank's identified surplus capital to governments for the first time. The bank had promised to review the possibility after it received a 10-billion-euro capital increase in 2011. 
The United States also floated the idea of dividends in 2008 when there was talk of winding down the bank or merging it with the European Investment Bank (EIB).
""It is just one of the options,"" one of the sources said.
The idea of a broader overhaul of the bank is back on the radar. A European Commission group is looking at how to streamline the region's development financing efforts, which could lead to calls for some radical changes to the EBRD and EIB. 
The work is expected to be finalised around October but some initial findings could emerge by the end of May, people who have followed the work say.
The EBRD's heavy investments in Turkey and Egypt - and now its Africa ambitions - reflect the tilt away from the former Eastern Europe bloc, where there is little prospect of restarting lending in Russia and mainstay markets like Hungary, Romania and even Poland have seen relations turn with the European Union. 
""This is going to be a very political meeting,"" said a third EBRD source. ""There are a lot of difficult issues.""

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: PepsiCo accused of coercing farmers by group close to India's ruling party,"By Mayank Bhardwaj and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An influential Hindu nationalist group with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc of coercing four Indian farmers who have been sued by the U.S. company for allegedly infringing a patent.
After suing four farmers for cultivating the FC5 potato variety, grown exclusively for PepsiCo's popular Lay's potato chips, the snack food and drinks maker on Friday said it wants to ""amicably settle"" the issue. 
The Purchase, New York-based company said the four farmers had to either sell their potatoes to PepsiCo or stop cultivating the FC5 potato variety. In return, PepsiCo said it would withdraw the suit filed against the farmers.
Ashwani Mahajan, who heads the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said PepsiCo was ""coercing"" the farmers by using legal action to force them to either sell their output to the company or to stop growing the FC5 potato variety at all.
SJM is the economic wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of Modi's BJP. 
The dispute comes at a particularly sensitive time in India, which is about half-way through a 39-day staggered general election, in which its rural population still has a dominant voice. Modi and the BJP are seeking a second term and most political strategists think they will likely get it.
""Other than coercing these farmers, PepsiCo is also intimidating and exploiting them. It is a clear case of a large MNC (multi national corporation) arm-twisting India's poor farmers,"" Mahajan told Reuters.
The federal government should step in to ensure that the farmers do not get harassed by PepsiCo, he said. 
In response, a PepsiCo India spokesman said in a statement that it ""has already proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety."" 
Adding: ""The company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming program.""
LESS MOISTURE
The FC5 variety has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips.
PepsiCo maintains that it developed the FC5 variety, which has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips, and registered the trait in 2016.
In April, the company filed the lawsuit in a court in Ahmedabad, the business hub of Gujarat, requesting the court to retrain the four farmers from growing the FC5 variety. The court has asked the farmers not to use the variety until the next hearing scheduled for June 12.
The court also appointed an officer to examine the issue.
Other than filing the lawsuit, the company has also sought more than 10 million rupees ($142,840) each from the four farmers for alleged patent infringement.
PepsiCo shouldn't have gone to the court seeking heavy damages from farmers and a large corporation cannot be allowed to take on a handful of farmers, Mahajan said. 
PepsiCo, which set up its first potato chips plant in India in 1989, supplies the FC5 potato variety to a group of farmers who in turn sell their produce to the company at a fixed price.
The state government of Gujarat has assured the farmers that it will help them, Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister said last week.
The opposition Congress party has also criticized PepsiCo for suing the farmers.
""Pepsi’s decision to take Gujarat’s potato grower farmers to court is ill-advised and brazenly wrong,"" senior Congress party leader Ahmed Patel, who comes from Gujarat, said in a Tweet. 
The All India Kisan Sabha, or All India Farmers' Forum, has asked the Indian government to protect the farmers and also called for a boycott of Lay's chips and PepsiCo's other products.
So far the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare has not commented on the issue.
PepsiCo is the second large U.S. company to face major patent infringement issues in India.

Stung by a long-standing intellectual property dispute, seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), now owned by German drugmaker  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), withdrew from some businesses in India over a cotton-seed dispute with farmers. (reut.rs/2ncBknn)

The company announced in a  Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Friday that it expected to pay about $300 million to more than 1.1 million drivers worldwide on or around Saturday.
""To acknowledge drivers who have participated in our success, we are paying a one-time cash driver appreciation reward to qualifying drivers in jurisdictions where we operate through owned operations,"" Uber said in the filing.
Uber said eligible US drivers would receive one of six cash rewards based on the number of Uber trips they've completed: $100 for making at least 2,500 trips, $500 for at least 5,000 trips, $1,000 for at least 10,000 trips, $10,000 for at least 20,000 trips, $20,000 for at least 30,000 trips, and the largest, $40,000, for at least 40,000 trips.
To qualify for the reward, drivers must have completed at least 2,500 trips, including one this year, as of April 7, and have an account in good standing. Uber said payouts to non-US drivers would be adjusted to reflect different average hourly earnings across regions.
Uber is also giving its drivers a chance to buy its stock before the general public, saying it had reserved 5.4 million shares for drivers through a directed-share program. Drivers who qualify for the driver-appreciation reward will be able to buy those shares at the IPO price, which Uber expects to be between $44 and $50."

Monthly active users reached 217 million, slightly below analyst consensus expectations of 219 million. Average revenue per user totaled 4.71 euros, which was flat year-on-year. A slight decline is expected as the company expands into emerging markets.
The growth in users was partly attributed to an expanding partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), utilizing the Google Home Mini voice speaker. Spotify has identified the use of voice speakers as a critical area of growth. Competitors such as Apple Music and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Music have made strong inroads into music streaming with their Siri and Alexa voice speakers. Spotify also has partnerships in place with Samsung (KS:005930) and Hulu.
Despite the growth in revenue and users, the company has struggled in reaching profitability. Spotify missed expectations of adjusted earnings per share by reporting a loss of 0.79 euros, nearly double the Bloomberg consensus. Total losses for the quarter reached 47 million euros.
Looking ahead, Spotify sees monthly-active-user growth of between 23% and 27% for next quarter and paid subscribers of 107 million to 110 million. The company predicts losses will continue through 2019, amounting to between 180 million euros and 340 million euros.
 Spotify was up 27% this year through Friday."

1613,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Rises as Consumer Spending Jumps,"Investing.com - Although U.S. stocks ticked slightly higher in cautious trading on Monday, the rise was sufficient for the S&P 500 to mark new all-time intraday highs, topping the previous record seen last September.
A jump in consumer spending, while inflation remained in check, boosted bullish sentiment in equities.
At 9:59 AM ET (13:59 GMT), the S&P 500 advanced 3 points, or 0.1%, to 2,942.74 points, close to the record intraday high of 2,945.95 points. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones was little changed, at 26,543.53 points, while the Nasdaq Composite edged forward 6 points, or 0.1%, to 8,152.27 points.
On the economic front, government data released Monday provided a strong picture of the American consumer, responsible for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Personal spending surged 0.9% in March, its largest increase more than nine-and-a-half years.
Meanwhile, inflation data released Monday left expectations intact that the Federal Reserve will make no changes to interest rates this week.
The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, generally considered the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator, slowed to 1.6% in March, its smallest annual gain in 14 months.
Muted inflation has been a key factor to support the Fed’s decision to drop thoughts of further policy tightening this year. Markets continue to go even further, pricing in the possibility of a rate cut by the end of the year.
The fact that the first-quarter earnings season has been more upbeat than expected has also helped to push stocks higher.
What will be a busy week for earnings - with more than 150 S&P 500 firms reporting - started off slow on Monday. Although Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) posted a wider-than-expected loss, a revenue beat and the fact that its paid subscribers topped the 100 million milestone sent shares higher.
On the downside, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) saw shares slide after earnings missed consensus. While sales at its Burger King and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen chains beat expectations, Tim Hortons comparable store sales unexpectedly fell, dragging down results.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be the star of Monday’s earnings when it reports after the close. “The company’s escalating costs create a major concern that could put pressure on its stock after the Q1 report,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar warned in an earnings preview.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, inched up 0.1% to 97.81 by 10:03 AM ET (14:03 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury advanced 2.5 basis points to 2.53%.
In commodities, gold futures fell $7.65 or 0.6%, to $1,281.15 a troy ounce, while crude oil traded down 22 cents, or 0.3% at $63.09 a barrel."

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 09:39AM ET</span>",Swiss group files criminal complaint against Credit Suisse over Mozambique loans,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A Swiss anti-corruption lobby group has filed a criminal complaint against  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) over alleged fraud in the arrangement of $2 billion of loans to Mozambique, the group said on Monday.
Mozambique, one of the most indebted countries in the world, in 2016 admitted to billions of dollars of undisclosed borrowing, sparking a debt crisis and leading to the arrest of government officials and international bankers in the United States, United Kingdom and South Africa.
Three former Credit Suisse bankers were arrested in London in January on U.S. charges of conspiring to violate anti-bribery law and to commit money laundering and securities fraud, while former Mozambique finance minister Manuel Chang was arrested in South Africa as part of the same case.
Public Eye, a Switzerland-based advocacy group focused on financial crimes, said even though the transactions were facilitated by Credit Suisse's UK subsidiary, the bank should also be investigated in its home jurisdiction.
""With its criminal complaint, Public Eye is calling on the Office of the Attorney General to investigate whether Credit Suisse Group AG fulfilled its corporate responsibility to oversee its subsidiary and prevent unlawful conduct as required of companies by the Swiss criminal code,"" the pressure group said in a statement.
The Office of Attorney General, which previously said that no criminal proceedings had been opened in Switzerland, confirmed it had received the complaint and would review it to see whether it warranted opening a criminal case.
Credit Suisse said it continued to cooperate with regulatory and enforcement authorities in connection with multiple investigations related to the Mozambique maritime transactions.
""Credit Suisse is not currently in a position to disclose details of those processes, given pending investigations,” a spokesman for the bank in London said. 
The maritime transactions, or so called tuna bonds, refer to a fleet of sea vessels bought by Mozambique using loans arranged by international banks for a self sustaining fishing program that never materialized. The cash came in the form of a government-backed bond to state tuna-fishing company Ematum.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 08:12AM ET</span>",Global shares turn flat as sentiment wanes,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares were steady on Monday as a weak euro zone sentiment survey and political uncertainty in the wake of Spain's elections proved a drag on earlier gains driven by strong economic data out of China and the United States. 
The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was flat in early afternoon trade in London, giving up earlier gains of as much as 0.06 percent.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a subdued open on Wall Street. 
European shares, which had firmed at the open, were hit by uncertainty related to the formation of a government in Spain and weak euro zone economic sentiment data that exacerbated fears over slowing global growth. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent.
Spain's IBEX 35 index underperformed peers, falling as much as 0.8 percent, and Spanish government bond yields dipped after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez overcame a challenge from right-wing nationalists in elections on Sunday. 
Shares in Italian banks got a boost and Italian government bonds rallied after S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) affirmed Italy's sovereign credit rating. 
Still nagged by uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy, investors were looking to a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve this week and Chinese factory data for further clues on policy direction in the world's biggest economies.
""For stock traders, it seems that the important catalysts are pointing higher: the U.S. sees strong domestic growth, low inflation keeps the Fed at bay and could potentially trigger a rate cut so it seems that equities have nowhere to go but higher - at least in the short term,"" said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS.
Chinese blue-chips rose over 1 percent after losing 5.6 percent last week, leading Shanghai shares to an intraday high in afternoon trade.
In China, fresh data showed industrial profits grew in March after four months of contraction, but analysts said sentiment remained fragile. Economists polled by Reuters expect factory activity in the world's second largest economy to grow at a steady but modest pace in April.
In contrast with weakness in Asian markets last week, Wall Street ended Friday on a high note, propelled by GDP figures.
Australian shares were down 0.4 percent after hitting an 11-year closing high on Friday, while Seoul's KOSPI was up 1.4 percent.
Japan's financial markets are closed for a long national holiday this week, but the Nikkei 225 futures index in Singapore was 0.9 percent higher.
U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, although some analysts sounded a cautious note.
""The details (of the GDP release), however, were distinctly less impressive with underlying domestic demand growing only 1.3 percent, the slowest rate since 2015,"" said Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood.
""Given this mixed picture, this coming week’s spate of U.S. data releases will be of heightened importance for markets.""
The March reading for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed's favored inflation measure, is due later on Monday. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, with Chairman Jerome Powell expected to balance the strong domestic growth data against persistent concerns over the global outlook.
Markets will also be looking to global factory activity surveys this week, particularly official and private readings on Chinese manufacturing which will both be released on Tuesday.
Currency markets were calm. The dollar was 0.2 percent higher against the yen at 111.74, and the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1162. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly flat at 98.039.
Oil prices fell, extending a slump from Friday that ended weeks of rallying, after President Donald Trump demanded that producer club OPEC raise output to soften the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran.
Brent crude fell half a percent to $71.81 per barrel. 
Spot gold fell 0.4 percent, trading at $1,280.62 per ounce.

With another barrage of earnings due this week, plus the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting and the April employment report, there is little incentive to make big bets in the near term.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 06:42AM ET</span>",Exclusive: GAM whistle blower concerns focused on bonds sold by metals tycoon,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - A whistle blower at Swiss asset manager GAM Holding AG who alerted UK financial regulators last year did so over concerns about the purchase of more than half a billion pounds of bonds from commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The bonds related to a biodiesel-fueled power generating business, the people familiar with the matter said. But the employee who brought his concerns to regulators believed the operation was unlikely to make enough money to repay the bonds partly because of the high cost of the fuel it planned to use, these people said. A Reuters analysis of corporate filings, regulatory documents and market data supports that view.
UK-based GAM fund manager Tim Haywood paid more than 550 million pounds in 2017 for the bonds that were due to repay about 1 billion pounds over 20 years, according to the people familiar with the matter and corporate filings.
But the assets backing the bonds were generators and related equipment installed at a cost of around 22 million pounds, corporate accounts show. Those generators have largely sat idle for two years, according to public company accounts and Ofgem data.
GAM has previously publicly said it suspended and then dismissed Haywood following an internal whistle blower alerting UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, but the company has not disclosed which securities it related to or what the concerns were. The details of the bonds, including how much GAM paid and the underlying business, also haven’t previously been reported.
GAM has seen a more than billion-dollar drop in its stock market capitalization and placed restrictions on client withdrawals following a wave of redemption requests.
Gupta, an Indian-born British national, is executive chairman of GFG Alliance, which manages the industrial, finance and metals investments of the Gupta family. GFG, which encompasses the company that sold the bonds, said both the company and Gupta declined to comment.
Haywood, via a spokesman, said he disputed GAM's allegations of gross misconduct, is appealing his dismissal to GAM and that he looked forward to clearing his name.
LITTLE RED BOXES
The business model behind the bonds was to generate electricity from biodiesel that would qualify for UK government-issued green energy credits, according to company filings. The proceeds from selling the green energy credits would be used to repay the purchaser of the bonds.
It was a novel plan. No other company was commercially generating electricity from biodiesel, according to industry specialists and data from the UK’s power regulator, known as Ofgem.
Reuters' analysis is based on benchmark figures from published market data, equipment manufacturers and regulatory information, which it confirmed with at least four industry experts. They said the cost of biodiesel and the sale price of power can vary over time but said the business model was unlikely to be break even due to the high cost of the fuel, let alone generate sufficient profits to repay the bond holder.
“Diesel generation is not very common because it’s expensive. Given that biodiesel is even more expensive than diesel, it’s not really something that has been used,” said Prashant Vaze, Head of Policy at advisory group Climate Bonds Initiative.
GFG named the bond plan Project LRB, or “Little Red Boxes,” a reference to the red-painted steel shipping containers that held the generators, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. These had been installed at its factories in Wales, Scotland and Northern England in 2016 and 2017.
GFG planned to run the generators on hydrotreated vegetable Oil or HVO, the person added; Ofgem data shows the generators did a short run with HVO.
HVO is an expensive way to produce power, say industry specialists. GFG would have to spend around 180 pounds or more on fuel to generate each Megawatt hour unit of power, or MWh, according to a Reuters analysis of data from fuel retailers, Ofgem and generator manufacturers.
Gupta’s generator business could potentially have sold power for as much as about 80 pounds per MWh by selling directly to a commercial customer if they found one willing to accommodate a generator on site, said Diane Dowdell, of energy consultant Ganninon Ltd. Gupta’s generator business could also have sold power wholesale to the grid, but that price would be lower, according to Ofgem data.
Another potential source of revenue for Gupta was the green energy credits, called Renewable Obligation Certificates or ROCs, that the UK government issues to companies that generate power from renewable sources. Gupta’s biodiesel-fuelled power business could have sold these to electricity retailers on the market for about 64 pounds per MWh, according to data from regulator Ofgem.
Based on this analysis, Gupta’s operation would face losses of at least 35 pounds for every MWh produced even if the power was sold to commercial clients and credits were sold.
SILENT CONTAINERS
GAM announced Haywood’s dismissal in February, saying he didn’t comply with due diligence procedures and had signed certain contracts by himself where internal policies required two signatures, but it hasn’t specified the transactions that led to his dismissal.
The FCA, the regulator, declined to comment on which individuals, companies or assets it might be investigating.
U.S. investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) acted as placement agent of the bonds. UK-based financing group Greensill Capital structured the notes, according to filings with the Luxembourg corporate registry. Both companies declined to comment.
Last week, GAM announced that GFG Alliance had agreed to repurchase the remaining assets in Haywood’s funds at the valuation at which they were purchased, without elaborating why.
Those assets were the biodiesel business bonds, known as Liberty Industries PPA Ltd. bonds, that GAM purchased almost two years earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.
The bond repayments were made with Gupta funding payments from other companies that fall under the GFG group, as he is allowed to do under the terms of the bonds, the two people familiar with the matter said.
GFG is now examining ways to allow the generators to operate profitably, according to Kerry McDonald, general manager of the Liberty Aluminium plant in Scotland.
Walking across a yard where eleven of the red containers sit silently, McDonald said the group was looking at using less expensive biofuels and selling waste heat to commercial clients.

“You can produce a cheaper fuel using waste from animal processing” he said.

The European Commission, which has waged a decades-long crackdown on payment and credit card fees, says that so-called interchange fees in which the merchant's bank pays a charge to the cardholder's bank, result in higher prices for consumers.
This is because the fees, which are a lucrative source of revenue for banks, are ultimately borne by the merchant.
""This, together with our January 2019 decision on Mastercard's cross-border card payment services, will lead to lower prices for European retailers to do business, ultimately to the benefit of all consumers,"" Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The companies' commitments will cut such fees by 40 percent on average, the European Commission said on Monday.
Visa, the world's largest payments network operator, and closest rival Mastercard have proposed a 0.2 percent fee on non-EU debit card payments carried out in shops and a 0.3 percent fee on credit card payments, the Commission said late last year.

This would bring their fees in line with those charged for EU cards, which were the subject of a long EU investigation after a 1997 complaint by business lobby EuroCommerce.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 05:17AM ET</span>",Investors call for reprieve for Bayer bosses after AGM rebuke,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Three of Bayer's largest German investors said the drugmaker's embattled management needed to stay at the helm to avoid further upheaval, despite their unease over a share price slump in the wake of the $63 billion  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) takeover.
The backing for Chief Executive Werner Baumann comes after an unprecedented rebuke at the annual shareholder meeting on Friday, where a majority of investors cast a vote of disapproval of top management's actions.
""A hasty replacement of the CEO would only increase the risk of a break-up and therefore can't be in the interest of long-term oriented investors such as Union Investment,"" said Janne Werning, an analyst at Germany's Union Investment which is a top-20 shareholder.
""The scale of the litigation risks won't become clearer before next year, that's why we think it's fair and necessary to grant top management more time,"" he said in a written statement over the weekend.
DWS, the asset management arm of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said on Monday it currently also saw no merits in ousting Bayer's top managers.
Union had been among top-20 investors who cast a 'No' vote in Bayer's annual AGM poll to ratify management's business conduct during the year under review, saying the legal risks associated with Monsanto had been known for many years.
LOST VALUE
About 30 billion euros ($33 billion) have been wiped off Bayer's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. More than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages.
Bayer (DE:BAYGN) shares were 2.3 percent lower by 0910 GMT on Monday, as the stock traded without the right to a 2.80 euro per-share dividend for the first time.
Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the Roundup verdicts and has pointed to global regulators' findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, is safe.
Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Deka Investment, said on Friday that management change would only compound the chaos.
""It can't be in anyone's interest to see the daily operations being neglected, on top of all the existing chaos,"" he said at the AGM.
In a cautionary reminder of the risks of management turmoil, shares in German engineering group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) continued to slide after both the CEO and chairman quit last year amid calls from activist investors to change strategy.
Markus Mayer, an analyst at brokerage Baader Helvea stressed the potential benefits of a management shake-up.
""Activist investors or strategic buyers ...might replace the supervisory board and management and split up and/or take over parts of Bayer. As we see significant valuation upside for Bayer,"" he said on Monday.
Over the weekend, Bayer's management was at pains to reassure staff over any fallout from the AGM vote, saying it was the backing from the non-executive board that counted.
""The stockholder vote will generate press attention and speculation about Bayer's leadership. You will likely read about it in the media or face questions from friends and family,"" Bayer's executive board told employees in a letter seen by Reuters.
It said the vote had no legal consequences.
""The Supervisory Board's vote of confidence in us as the Board of Management gives us a clear mandate to lead our company,"" managers went on to say.
Bayer's non-executive supervisory board won 66.4 percent of the votes ratifying its business conduct at the AGM. Though a majority, the result came in far below a nod of 95 percent or more that is the norm at German AGMs.

1628,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>","Market `Melt-Up' Exposes Investor Gap, Bernstein Quants Say","(Bloomberg) -- This year’s market rally has revealed a schism among investors, according to quantitative strategists at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
In equities, indicators such as fund flows point to neutral investor confidence even as global markets set fresh records. By contrast, traders have increased short positions on assets such as gold, U.S. Treasuries and volatility that typically offer protection in the case of a stock sell-off. That behavior suggests an overall bullishness “to a degree that is becoming alarming,” according to a research note from the brokerage.
“The shorting of tail hedges does likely put more of a limit on the ‘melt up’ scenario,” even if it isn’t sufficient to justify becoming bearish just yet, analysts including head of global quantitative and European equity strategy Inigo Fraser-Jenkins wrote in a research note dated April 29.
Stocks and bonds have advanced this year as investors speculate on a resolution to the U.S.-China trade conflict and global central banks tone down their previously hawkish stances.
Gauges of volatility have also fallen to the low end of their historical ranges as investors bet the market calm will continue. Speculative investors including hedge funds have built up the biggest short position on record in the Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
To be sure, some investors believe that the picture is more nuanced, and that bets that volatility could bounce back are also sizable.
Given high investor demand for low-volatility stocks in the U.S., Bernstein’s quants recommend scouring global markets and within sectors for stocks which have not been bid up to the same extent.
“While cross-asset traders are increasing short VIX positions, at the single stock level the opposite is happening and near-record premia are being demanded for low vol U.S. stocks,” the note said. “However, globally the picture is very different.”

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:51AM ET</span>",UK pulls up Rolls-Royce for slow supplier payments,"(Reuters) - Engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) said on Monday that it had been suspended from the UK government's Prompt Payment Code (PPC) after failing to pay suppliers in time.
The PPC is administered by the Chartered Institute of Credit Management and sets standards for payment practices including prompt payment as well as wider payment procedures.
The company said it was suspended from the Code as it did not pay at least 95 percent of its supplier invoices within 60 days.
This month the government warned more than 10,000 businesses that they must pay their suppliers on time or face being prevented from winning further government contracts, in an attempt to level the playing field for small businesses.
""The significant volume of invoices we receive from our large suppliers - and the removal of the consideration of our preferential treatment for smaller suppliers – has pushed us below the compliance criteria,"" Rolls-Royce said.

1630,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",Deloitte Resigned as Ferrexpo Auditor Over Charity Probe Delays,"(Bloomberg) -- Deloitte LLP said it resigned as  Ferrexpo  Plc's (LON:FXPO) auditor over delays by the Ukrainian iron-ore producer in investigating its own charitable donations.
While Deloitte said it called for a forensic investigation to start last November -- after charitable foundation Blooming Land failed to cooperate fully with Ferrexpo requests -- the probe only began in February. With the investigation incomplete, Deloitte said it could only express a qualified opinion on aspects of Ferrexpo’s annual report published last week.
“We consider that the company’s response to the situation, including its delay in conducting an independent forensic investigation,” is incompatible with us continuing as auditor, Deloitte said in a statement published by Ferrexpo on Monday.
Ferrexpo plunged the most in three years on Friday as its auditor and two directors resigned amid the money laundering investigation at Blooming Land. Last week, the company disclosed a disagreement between Deloitte and Ferrexpo’s board over the role of majority shareholder and Chief Executive Officer Kostyantin Zhevago at the charity.
Ferrexpo said it initiated the review of the charitable foundation at the “appropriate time.”
Independent Review
“We are naturally disappointed by Deloitte’s resignation and its reasons,” Ferrexpo Chairman Steve Lucas said Monday. “We are also committed to completing the independent review into Blooming Land as quickly as possible.""
Ferrexpo shares climbed 8.4 percent by 9:11 a.m. in London. The stock fell 28 percent on Friday, wiping out more than $500 million in market value.
The iron ore company said on Monday that it continues to trade strongly, with realized prices for Ferrexpo pellets in 2019 staying at high levels. Ferrexpo said it remains a competitive producer in a favorable segment of the iron ore market, underpinning near-record margins for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and strong cash generation.
The company announced late on Friday that two directors, Mary Reilly and Bert Nacken, who had both been part of the audit committee, would resign from the board. On Monday, Ferrexpo said that both of the directors have decided to resign with immediate effect.
Opinions Differ
Ferrexpo reiterated on Monday that Blooming Land “is not considered a related party of the group.” The interim findings of its independent review committee established that neither the CEO nor the company’s executive management control or exercise significant influence over Blooming Land, Ferrexpo said.
That clashed with Deloitte’s assessment. The auditors have been ""unable to conclude"" whether the CEO has significant control, according to Ferrexpo.
The resignation of Deloitte also comes as the so-called big four accounting firms face increased scrutiny. Last week, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority renewed its demand for the firms to split their operations into separate business units.
Stung into action by a series of high-profile corporate failures, the regulator said in its final report that a fragile auditing market could only be fixed with government action. The accounting industry has been under fire in the wake of corporate collapses such as those of building contractor Carillion Plc and bakery chain Patisserie Valerie Holdings Ltd.
For Ferrexpo, the investigation into the charity is fueling worries about governance and financial controls at the company. Ukrainian authorities are probing whether the charitable foundation was used to launder money and evade taxes. There are indications that some funds may have been “misappropriated,” Ferrexpo said again on Monday."
1631,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 04:21AM ET</span>","StockBeat: IBEX's Knee-Jerk, Bayer's Teflon CEO Catch the Eye","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The bad news in Europe’s stock markets after early trading in Monday is that Spain’s stock market doesn’t like its election result.
The good news is that it doesn’t matter.
The IBEX 35 has fallen on every Monday after an election since 1993, according to this intriguing table unearthed by independent fixed-income analyst Luis Benguerel on Twitter.



Fair’s fair - markets generally don’t like an inconclusive election, but that is the only kind of election that Europe is producing at the moment, and it was entirely in line with opinion polls ahead of the event. The result, which will probably see milk-and-water Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez stay at the head of a minority government, constrained from rocking the boat too hard with irresponsible budgets, is far from the worst imaginable.
That said, the collapse of the center-right Partido Popular’s vote suggests it will be some time before Spain gets a government that is naturally sympathetic to business.
The bottom line, as Benguerel’s table shows, is that the IBEX’s 0.6% drop this morning is a knee-jerk and it has a nearly 50-50 chance of unwinding over the next four days.
All other major indexes were following Asia higher, preferring to focus on the positive elements of the U.S. GDP report on Friday. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.2% at 391.64, a little off its opening high. Germany’s DAX index was up 0.5%, while the U.K. FTSE was up 0.2%.
Elsewhere Monday, the most eye-catching development was with German chemical giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN) after an unprecedented shareholder revolt against CEO Werner Baumann and the rest of the management board at a shareholder meeting on Friday
Over 55% of shareholders voted not to endorse the board’s performance in protest at the destruction of billions of dollars of shareholder value with the ill-judged acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
However, Bayer’s supervisory board, which notionally exists to serve the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders, chose to ignore the vote and stood by Baumann.
The truly interesting thing here is that the 2% drop this morning in Bayer’s stock price is entirely accounted for by the share going ex-dividend. Were it not for that, the stock would actually be up.
That still doesn’t change the fact that it’s the 2nd-worst performing stock in the Dax over the last 12 months, having lost 38%. But if such cavalier treatment of shareholders can’t push the share price any lower, it’s tempting to wonder what would."

This year’s rally in Chinese shares is threatening to unravel almost as quickly as it began.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.8 percent and ended the session below its 50-day moving average. That follows its 5.6 percent slump last week, the worst performance versus global equities since early 2016. The ChiNext Index dropped 2.6 percent.
China was the best place in the world for equity investors in the first quarter, with its major benchmarks entering a bull market and volume surging. The rally has lost momentum amid a lackluster earnings season, while better-than-expected economic data prompted investors to scale back their expectations for additional stimulus. Data on manufacturing growth for April is due tomorrow.
“The market needs to drop more to fully price in the expectations that China might tighten its monetary policy,” said Zhang Gang, a Shanghai-based strategist with Central China Securities Co. “Poor corporate earnings hurt confidence and profit taking in stocks that had reaped strong gains added to the selling.”
Traders have been taking profit from some of the year’s biggest winners, including brokers, 5G-related stocks and firms on the tech-heavy ChiNext Index. Eastern Communications Co., a maker of mobile communication products, has fallen 40 percent from its March peak after surging more than 250 percent this year.
Mainland markets will be shut from Wednesday for a three-day break. While northbound trading remains open through Tuesday, investors in China are unable to trade Hong Kong stocks through the exchange links until May 6. Volume on the Hang Seng Index, which rose 1 percent as of 3:12 p.m. in Hong Kong, was about 32 percent lower than the 30-day average for this time of day.
Foreign investors bought 4.5 billion yuan ($673 million) of China stocks via the trading links with Hong Kong, the most this month.
Brokerages retreated as investors worried trading volumes in the country’s stock market may slide. Huatai Securities Co., Citic Securities Co. and Guotai Junan Securities Co. all fell more than 2 percent.

1633,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 03:21AM ET</span>",The Exodus From European Stocks Continues,"(Bloomberg) -- Another week, another exodus from European equities. Stock funds for the region lost $1.9 billion in the period and have now had 56 weeks of outflows out of the past 58. The Stoxx 600 is still bumping along recent highs despite a relatively good earnings season.
About a quarter of companies in the Stoxx 600 have reported figures so far and we’ve seen growth in both sales and profits, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC). If the numbers continue to look good this week, it may help reverse the massive outflows.
Strategists at Barclays point out that earnings, which had been expected to contract in the first quarter, are off to a good start, while fears over margin pressure haven’t materialized.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists share the optimism and see the resilience of topline growth in both the U.S. and in Europe as encouraging. This could prove to be helpful for continued earnings delivery in the second half of the year and beyond, they write.
Separately, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch strategists highlighted in their earning tracker that European stocks are having their best quarter in seven, with a 52 percent beat on earnings per share. And it might not be over. Their quantitative models suggests that the worst period of low profit growth is now behind us. The  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Earnings Revision Index seems to show a similar trend.
Drilling down, the best-performing sectors regarding earnings so far in the season have been: banks, food, health care and technology, according to BofAML. Retail and personal goods are at the bottom, taking into account industries where at least five companies have already reported. Consumer-related sectors are the only ones where less than half of stocks have surpassed EPS estimates.
Finally, 73 percent of value stocks have beaten forecasts so far, BofAML said. Could this be the good news investors were waiting for to begin some rotation? The next few weeks will tell. Bloomberg Intelligence strategists recommend not getting too excited though, especially as reactions seem muted after the recent rally.
In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading up 0.1% ahead of the open.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 03:18AM ET</span>",Former auditor says Ferrexpo delayed investigation into charity partner,"(Reuters) - Ferrexpo Plc's former auditor Deloitte believes the miner delayed an investigation into the use of funds by its charity partner in Ukraine, the accounting firm has said.
Ferrexpo, led by Ukrainian billionaire Kostyantin Zhevago, disclosed the auditor's statement on Monday, saying that it initiated the formal independent review at an appropriate time, ""given the other steps it was taking and all the surrounding circumstances"".
Deloitte quit as Ferrexpo's auditor on Friday, days after saying it was unable to conclude whether the iron ore miner's CEO controlled a charity being investigated over its use of company donations.
Blooming Land, which coordinates Ferrexpo's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, came under scrutiny after auditors found holes in the charity's statements.
Funding for Blooming Land's CSR activities is provided by one of Ferrexpo's units in Ukraine and Khimreaktiv LLC, an entity ultimately controlled by Zhevago, who is also the miner's majority owner, according to the company.
Ferrexpo's board has maintained that Zhevago did not have significant influence or control over the charity, but Deloitte said earlier it was unable reach a conclusion on this.
""Ferrexpo would like to re-emphasize that Blooming Land is not considered a related party of the group,"" Ferrexpo said on Monday.
Ferrexpo said its chairman will be speaking to investors during the course of this week.
""While there are indications that some funds could have been misappropriated, further work is required before any final conclusions can be drawn,"" Chairman Steve Lucas said.

""Board would like to make clear that to date no conclusive evidence of misappropriation of funds has come to light.""

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 02:55AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank chair against strategy change at investment bank: FT,"BERLIN (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Chairman Paul Achleitner told the Financial Times that Germany's largest lender did not need to fundamentally overhaul its investment bank after attempts to create a German champion with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) failed.
Achleitner defended Deutsche Bank's strategy after merger talks with Commerzbank failed due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
""Every executive has to constantly adjust to a changing market environment ... but in this regard, we are not talking about strategy, we are talking about execution,"" Achleitner told the paper.
The idea of merging with Commerzbank has now been abandoned ""once and for all"" Achleitner said, adding that Deutsche Bank is aware that Commerzbank could be taken over by a foreign lender.
Deutsche Bank has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. It is trying to turn itself around, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests. 
Turnaround efforts will continue but no fundamental strategy shift is underway, Achleitner said. 
""In particular, in a business like the capital markets one, which is so volatile and so rapidly changing, there will be permanent adjustments,"" said Achleitner, who was seen as a backer of the proposed merger with Commerzbank. He said that was his personal view.
Earnings released on Friday showed net revenue at Deutsche's sprawling global investment bank, which accounts for more than half the German bank's overall revenue and which relies heavily on its bond trading earnings, fell 13 percent to 3.3 billion euros ($3.68 billion) in the first quarter.
Even strong players such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have shown weaker revenues in bond trading, an area where Deutsche has been strong.
On being asked whether Deutsche Bank would have needed 10 billion euros in extra capital to finance the Commerzbank merger, Achleitner told the Financial Times that this number was ""excessive"".
Deutsche Bank has considered a significant restructuring of its United States operations after the lender failed stress tests. The Federal Reserve this month said it would relax the capital and stress test requirements for the subsidiaries of foreign banks.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 01:44AM ET</span>","DBS posts record profit on lending gains, raises bar for Singapore banks","By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asia's biggest lender DBS Group Holdings Ltd beat market estimates to post a record quarterly profit, as strong lending income offset weakness in wealth management, brokerage and investment banking fees.
DBS, the first Singapore bank to kick off the sector's results, posted an 8.5 percent rise in first-quarter net profit from a year earlier, and said the macro-economic environment had stabilized.
""By and large, I'm relatively sanguine about the business momentum,"" CEO Piyush Gupta told a news conference. DBS maintained its forecast of mid-single-digit loan growth for this year and stable net interest margins, a key gauge of profitability.
The lender's shares advanced 2.8 percent to their highest since June 2018, outperforming a 0.9 percent rise in the broader market.
""Overall, core driver was in line with expectations, we expect similar trends for peers as well,"" Jefferies analyst Krishna Guha said in a report. ""We were positively surprised by strength in trading gains,"" he said.
United Overseas Bank reports results on May 3 followed by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp a week later.
DBS reported a net profit of S$1.65 billion ($1.21 billion) for the three months to end-March, up from S$1.52 billion a year earlier and an average estimate of S$1.48 billion from four analysts, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
After three years of strong loans growth, Singapore's banks are gearing up for tougher times as the city-state's export-reliant economy slows.
Preliminary data for Singapore's first-quarter GDP released earlier this month confirmed the city-state was experiencing its weakest year-on-year growth in almost a decade. A trade war between the United States and China - two of Singapore's biggest export markets - has disrupted global supply chains in a blow to growth in many trade-reliant economies including the city state. 
DBS, nearly 30 percent owned by state investor Temasek Holdings, said its loans grew 1 percent in the latest quarter from the fourth quarter. Non-trade corporate loans rose 3 percent while trade loans declined 4 percent.
When asked about the big risks for the business for this year, Gupta highlighted a steep collapse in the interest rate environment if the U.S. Federal Reserve started to cut rates, but said he doesn't foresee that happening.
He, however, singled out the Singapore mortgage market as a weak spot. ""For the first time in a long, long time, we actually show a shrinkage in our mortgage loan book in the first quarter,"" Gupta said.
""Our bookings continue to be soft and the amount of refinancing transactions in the market are actually very low, about half of what they were a year ago.""
Still, DBS's return on equity rose to 14 percent, its highest in more than a decade. Net interest margin rose five basis points to 1.88 percent, in line with higher interest rates in Singapore and Hong Kong.
""The record earnings and return on equity (ROE) progression demonstrate the strengthened profitability of our franchise from digitalization, a shift toward higher-returns businesses and more nimble execution,"" Gupta said.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 12:03AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Anadarko to pursue deal talks with Occidental Petroleum - sources,"By David French and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC), the U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company that agreed this month to sell itself to  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) for $33 billion, decided on Sunday to begin negotiations to sell itself to Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) instead, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques. 
Anadarko's board of directors has decided that Occidental's $38 billion cash-and-stock bid could lead to a deal that would be superior to the one it has with Chevron, the sources said. Without such a formal determination, Anadarko's contract with Chevron prevented it from engaging with Occidental. 
Anadarko will now kick off negotiations with Occidental to see if it can finalize a deal, the sources said. 
There is no certainty that Occidental, which was vying for Anadarko before Chevron clinched its deal, will be able to secure its own deal, the sources said. 
If it does, Chevron will be given a chance to match the new deal. If Chevron finally loses out to Occidental, Anadarko would have to pay Chevron a $1 billion break-up fee, according to the terms of their agreement. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
Anadarko and Occidental did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson declined any immediate comment. 
The acquisition of Anadarko would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental's holdings in the Permian shale basin, and double its global oil and gas production to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Occidental unveiled its bid for Anadarko last Wednesday, offering to pay for it half in cash and half with its own shares. Chevron's deal with Anadarko was structured as 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock. 
Chevron declined to say on Friday during its earnings call how it would respond if Anadarko’s board determined Occidental's proposal the better of the two deals. Chevron's finance chief Pierre Breber, however, said the company had the ability to put more cash into its deal. 
A key hurdle that Occidental has to overcome in its negotiations with Anadarko is that its proposed deal is contingent on Occidental shareholders voting to approve it. A deal with Chevron offers more certainty to Anadarko in that regard, because Chevron shareholders will not be given a vote. 

Anadarko shareholders will be given a vote on the sale of the company, be it with Occidental or Chevron.

Reforms at state-linked companies, more political clarity and stimulus could see the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index surge to 1,800 in the base scenario, or even reach 1,900 in the bullish case, Macquarie analysts wrote in the April 26 note. That implies a 10 to 16 percent return from Friday’s close.
Malaysian stocks have bucked the global rally this year, losing more than 3 percent in 2019 while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 11 percent. An economic growth slowdown and uncertainty over the new administration’s policies led to $4.4 billion of equity outflows in the past 12 months.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has shown signs of moving away from his earlier budget-cutting stance to revive large state projects and seek foreign investments. Malaysia struck a deal with China to resume the East Coast Rail Link at a lower cost and revived the $34 billion property and transport hub Bandar Malaysia.
“Fiscal stimulus, per resurrection of ECRL and Bandar Malaysia projects, is returning, oil prices are exceeding target and liquidity is ample,” the bank said in the report. “Government policy-centric catalytic news flow alone could allow the KLCI to recover to 12-month highs of 1,850.”
Macquarie expects similar developments to happen with MRT 3 and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail project, as well as in the telecom sector and within the Petroliam Nasional Bhd. group of companies.
The KLCI is showing some signs of a revival. It climbed 1 percent last week, halting five straight weeks of declines, the longest stretch of losses since 2015.
The main risk remains Malaysia’s potential exclusion from FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index, which could lead to $23 billion of government bond outflows as other index providers follow suit and worsen foreign selling in the country’s equities, the bank said.
The investment bank prefers “yield-resilient” plays, corporate banks, government-linked companies:

1641,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",Goldman Sees China Stocks in Hong Kong Catching Up to A-Shares,"(Bloomberg) -- The stocks of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are set for a bout of catch-up after having underperformed their counterparts on mainland exchanges by an unusually large amount so far this year, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The bank’s analysis highlighted some key conditions currently in place that should reverse the trend seen so far in 2019:
“The catch-up case appears in place,” Goldman strategists including Kinger Lau wrote in an April 28 note. The thesis is being put to the test after Chinese shares last week fell more than equities in Hong Kong.
Shares on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index are up 14 percent this year, well off the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index’s 29 percent advance. The last time that H-share underperformed A-shares by more than 15 percentage points was in 2015, the Goldman strategists calculated.
“Empirically, valuation gaps at such high levels usually precede decent H-share outperformance over their A-share tickers in the ensuing months,” they wrote.
Investor positioning also suggests further gains in Hong Kong, according to the analysis. Mutual funds are underweight offshore equities by a record 316 basis points, while valuations on the Hong Kong China gauge remain at, or slightly below, average for this stage in the cycle, they wrote. In addition, southbound flows have strengthened recently after a muted first quarter, Goldman said.
A-shares are arguably more sensitive than H-shares to perceptions of policy and liquidity, according to Goldman. A-shares have suffered lately thanks in part to worries that China’s leadership isn’t prepared to expand its stimulus efforts. An April 19 statement from a meeting of the Politburo indicated the economy is stable enough that extended policy support won’t be necessary. Officials later tried to reassure investors their “prudent” stance hadn’t changed.
Insurers, brokerages and consumer-staples companies are best-positioned for the potential catch-up rally, the Goldman strategist wrote, citing valuation gaps revisions to earnings-per-share estimates. The strategists recommended stocks including China Pacific Insurance Group Co., Citic Securities Co. and Tsingtao Brewery Co.

1642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2019 11:10PM ET</span>",China's Recovery Still Relies on Stimulus as Outlook Upgraded,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic recovery continued this month, underpinned by expansive fiscal policy as investors await a potential resolution of the trade war with the U.S.
That’s according to a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest available indicators on market sentiment and business conditions. Although stocks weakened in the second half of April, the big gains since the start of the year kept the the three-month weighted average positive. Copper prices, sales managers and smaller enterprises reported weaker readings.
After a stronger-than-expected rebound in March, policy makers have signaled they are shifting away from broad monetary easing while maintaining supportive fiscal policy. The impact of sustained policy stimulus, plus heightened expectations for a deal that would end the trade battle with the U.S., have bolstered confidence even as downward pressures remain.
“Policy support is still necessary -- that means the government needs to keep spending and drive investment to keep domestic demand stable,” Bloomberg China economist Qian Wan said. “There is no improvement on the production side from the previous month.”
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg have upgraded their forecasts for gross domestic product growth in 2019, as policy feeds through into an improved outlook for businesses and households.
The economy will expand by 6.3 percent in 2019, according to the median of 67 replies in the survey, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous result. Analysts also upgraded their expectation for average inflation this year to 2.1 percent, a rate still in line with the government’s target despite the food-price gains driven by a major outbreak of African swine fever.
Better sentiment is being tested though, after top leaders signaled less stimulus ahead as the economy recovers. U.S. trade negotiators are due back in Beijing this week to push forward talks on ending the year-long tariff war.
Despite the easing of trade tensions, external demand remains a significant risk. Outbound shipments from South Korea -- a major supplier of components to Chinese assemblers of electronics such as iPhones -- fell 8.7 percent from a year earlier in the first 20 days of the month, dropping for a fourth month.
“Policy makers will continue to keep fiscal supporting measures in place,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). “Policy makers still pay considerable attention to the downside risks. The global economy is not doing very well this year, so it’s wise to have some policy reserve.”
On the ground, smaller businesses are sending mixed messages, according to a survey of more than 500 companies conducted by  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc. Conditions reported by sales mangers also weakened this month, according to London-based World Economics Ltd.
“Resilient sales following the Lunar New Year holidays drove a recovery in production activity and hiring,” Beijing-based Standard Chartered economist Shen Lan wrote in a note. ""However, downward pressure on output prices weighed on the profitability outlook. Investment appetite remained sluggish in April, partly due to the weaker expectations on profitability.""
A gauge of banks’ willingness to lend to small and medium-sized firms rose to a record high in April, underscoring that policy is still supporting businesses, Shen wrote."

Chinese stocks continued to fall, pressured by reports from last week that Beijing may be reluctant to add stimulus.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.1% and 0.8% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT).
Last week, state-owned Xinhua reported that the Chinese government might not add stimulus in the short term amid concerns over assets bubbles.
The news was cited as a headwind for Chinese stocks, which fell about 5% last week.
While not a directional driver, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter, that China’s securities regulator is aiming to speed up the review process for initial public offerings. China is hoping approve at least four IPO applications each week, according to the report.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.9%.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.8%, while Australia’s ASX 200 was down 0.5%.
Japan’s markets are closed as the country kicks off a week of holidays.
Traders now look forward to the Federal Reserve policy meeting and U.S. jobs numbers due Wednesday and Friday respectively this week.
U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday following strong U.S. gross domestic product in the first quarter.
Sino-U.S. trade headlines remained in focus as U.S. sends a high-level delegation to Beijing this week for more talks.
The White House said in a statement last week that the two sides would be discussing trade issues including intellectual property, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases, and enforcement.
“I think they are now pretty close to the moment where there will be a breakthrough, ” Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, told CNBC in an interview.
“I think it is in the common interest of the largest economy in the world, the U.S., and the second-largest economy in the world, China, to find solutions on those trade issues. That implies that both of them have to show flexibility in these negotiations,” Brende added.

The deal, which could be announced as soon as this week, would involve a mixture of cash and stock for Ingersoll shareholders, the WSJ said, citing sources. 
The deal would be structured as a so-called Reverse Morris Trust, a tax-efficient way for companies to sell off a division, and Ingersoll shareholders are expected to own just over half of the new company.
Gardner Denver Chief Executive Vicente Reynal would lead the merged company, the newspaper said. 
Gardner Denver, part-owned by private-equity firm KKR & Co Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ingersoll-Rand declined to comment on the deal.

Ingersoll's climate segment, which includes its heating, ventilation and air- and temperature-controlled transport businesses, would not be part of the deal, the WSJ said.

Turkey and Tunisia are among the biggest beneficiaries from the trend towards non-EU bookings, the firm said in a report, with demand for both recovering after security concerns curbed bookings in recent years.
Britain was due to leave the EU on March 29, but an impasse in parliament over the terms of Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal has delayed departure. A new deadline of Oct. 31 was agreed with Brussels.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel company, said it was ""clear that the prolonged uncertainty around the manner and timing of Britain's exit from the European Union has led many to delay their decision on when and where they book for their summer holidays.""
But a majority of the 3,422 UK holidaymakers surveyed by the company nevertheless said they were more likely to holiday abroad than last year, with a quarter saying that a foreign holiday was higher in their spending priorities than in 2018, compared to just 8 percent who said it was lower.
""Britain may be living through unique times from a political perspective, however our desire to holiday abroad is clear,"" said Will Waggott, Chief of Tour Operating for Thomas Cook. 
""The political turmoil is having an impact in other ways, revealing itself in a clear shift to non-EU countries."" 
Thomas Cook said 48 percent of its UK package holiday bookings for this summer so far were to non-EU destinations, up 10 percentage points on the same time last year. 
Turkey has overtaken Greece to be the second most popular destination, with Spain remaining in top spot. 
And a slight increase in ""all-inclusive"" holidays could reflect a desire for travelers to ""lock in"" food and drink costs given the possible volatility in the pound, the company said.

Earlier this month easyJet (LON:EZJ) warned that travelers were holding off booking their summer holidays due to uncertainty over how Brexit would go, weakening demand for tickets and thus prices.

(Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's largest auto manufacturer, said on Monday it is testing software that will allow drivers of its cars to earn the IOTA cryptocurrency as a reward for sharing data.
The company is developing what it calls ""smart wallet"" technology to be installed in its automobiles. This would reward Jaguar car drivers with IOTA coins for actions such as enabling their vehicles to automatically report useful data, such as traffic congestion or potholes to navigation providers or local authorities.
Drivers could also earn rewards if the car participates in a ride-sharing program, Jaguar said. The tokens earned could be used to pay for tolls, parking and charging for electric cars.
The overall goal was to ""achieve zero emissions, zero accidents, and zero congestion,"" the company said.
Global car companies are exploring blockchain applications, figuring out different ways in which they can leverage the technology to suit their different needs. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.
The British car company is testing the technology at the new Jaguar Land Rover software engineering base in Shannon, Ireland, where engineers have already equipped several vehicles, including the Jaguar F-PACE and Range Rover Velar, with ""smart wallet"" features, the company said.
It does not yet have a timetable for when it will be commercially available, said Jaguar, a subsidiary of Tata Motors.
The IOTA token is based on a distributed ledger technology that enables people and machines to transfer money and data without any transaction fees. IOTA trades on digital asset exchanges and was last at 27 U.S. cents per token.
""The smart wallet technology ... can be easily adapted into all new vehicles,"" Dominik Schiener, IOTA co-founder and co-chairman of its board, told Reuters on Friday.
""IOTA wants to enable interoperability with all these different players. So there is no Jaguar coin, no BMW coin, but one universal token for this machine economy,"" he added.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",Pilots demand better training if Boeing wants to rebuild trust in 737 MAX,"By Tracy Rucinski 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines pilots have warned that Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's draft training proposals for the troubled 737 MAX do not go far enough to address their concerns, according to written comments submitted to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and seen by Reuters. 
The comments were made by the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents pilots at American Airlines Group Inc, the world's largest airline and one of the biggest 737 MAX operators in the United States.
Their support is important because Boeing has said pilots' confidence in the 737 MAX will play a critical role in convincing the public that the aircraft is safe to fly again.
Boeing's fast-selling 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 on board just five months after a similar crash on a Lion Air flight that killed all 189 passengers and crew.
Now it is readying for regulatory approval a final software update and training package to address an anti-stall system known as MCAS that played a role in both nose-down crashes. 
A draft report by an FAA-appointed board of pilots, engineers and other experts concluded that pilots only need additional computer-based training to understand MCAS, rather than simulator time. The public has until April 30 to make comments. 
Protesters are expected outside Boeing's annual meeting in Chicago on Monday, where shareholders will also question the company over its safety record. 
APA is arguing that mere computer explanation ""will not provide a level of confidence for pilots to feel not only comfortable flying the aircraft but also relaying that confidence to the traveling public.""
It said the MAX computer training, which originally involved a one-hour iPad course, should include videos of simulator sessions showing how MCAS works along with demonstrations of other cockpit emergencies such as runaway stabilizer, a loss of control that occurred on both doomed flights.
APA also called for recurring training on simulators that includes scenarios like those experienced by the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines pilots, in addition to computer training.
""When pilots visually experience the failure modes and then apply them, the lesson is cemented in their minds,"" APA wrote.
American Airlines has said it is looking at the potential for additional training opportunities in coordination with the FAA and its pilots union.
Canada, Europe and South Korea are all weighing the need for simulator training, going above the recommendations in the draft FAA report, sources have said.
Required simulator training could delay the MAX's return to service because it takes time to schedule hundreds or thousands of pilots on simulators. Hourly rates for simulators range between $500 and $1000, excluding travel expenses.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said on Friday that even if other countries delay the ungrounding of the MAX, once the FAA approves it, American will start flying its 24 aircraft. 

Union pilots for Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, the world's largest operator of the MAX with 34 jets and dozens more on order, have said they were satisfied with the FAA draft report but would decide on additional training once they see Boeing's final proposals.

The Shenzhen-based car and battery maker, which has a joint venture with  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) in China, said last month it expected first-quarter profit to rise by up to nearly 800 percent.
Profit surged to 749.73 million yuan ($111.4 million), up from just 102.4 million yuan a year ago, when its earnings fell sharply due to cuts to subsidies for electric vehicles.
BYD said it expected half-year net profit to rise to 1.45 billion yuan to 1.65 billion yuan, versus 479.1 million yuan in the same period last year.
""New energy vehicles are expected to continue to sell well in the second quarter, and new energy vehicle sales and revenues continue to maintain strong growth,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing, adding that new passenger and commercial vehicle models will help boost revenue.
China's market for electric cars is booming, but profits in the sector have been squeezed by fierce competition between established firms and rival startups, as well as moves by Beijing to cut subsidies for the market to improve product quality and standards.
The company sold 117,578 vehicles in the first three months this year, up 5.2 percent from a year earlier. BYD, whose popular models include its Tang-series electric cars, has said it aims to sell 650,000 vehicles in 2019.
Overall electric car sales in China jumped 61.7 percent in 2018 to 1.3 million vehicles, according to China's top car industry body China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). It sees electric vehicle sales hitting 1.6 million this year.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian budget airline Flyadeal's decision on whether it goes ahead with an order for 30 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets is ""imminent"", its chief executive said on Sunday.
The airline is reconsidering the order after two MAX jets fatally crashed in Ethiopia in March and in Indonesia in October. 
""We've kept an open position in terms of which way we will go on fleet given the situation with the MAX,"" Con Korfiatis told Reuters at the Arabian Travel Market exhibition in Dubai.
""At the moment we still don't have a decision but it is imminent.""
Flyadeal has ordered 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8s with purchasing options for 20 more in a deal Boeing said was worth $5.9 billion at list prices.
The airline, owned by the government of Saudi Arabia through state carrier Saudia, has not finalised contractual terms and would be able to cancel the order if it wants to do so.
""It was effectively on the basis of an MoU (memorandum of understanding) subject to final agreements. We haven't signed final contracts,"" Korfiatis said in an interview.
Flyadeal would order the Airbus A320neo, a comparative narrow-body jet it had considered when selecting the MAX, if it cancels the Boeing deal, he said. 
Switching the order would not significantly affect the airline's expansion plans because due to a production backlog, it would have to wait several years to receive the new Boeing jets.
Flyadeal, which operates 11 older, leased A320ceo aircraft, had planned to lease aircraft as it waited for the new planes.
The airline, which started flights in 2017, expects to have a fleet of around 50 leased and ordered aircraft by 2025, Korfiatis said. 
The MAX is currently banned from flying in most countries after a total of 346 died in the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.
Boeing is developing a software fix and new pilot training for regulatory approval in order to get the company's best-selling plane recertified.
The additional training that Boeing is developing would be ""relatively incremental"" to what was already required, Korfiatis said, meaning associated costs are unlikely to be significantly more.
Korfiatis praised Boeing's communications with customers since the March crash that grounded the plane.
""Obviously this a significant issue for them and they are managing it very professionally.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has reached a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle a dispute over his use of Twitter, agreeing to submit his public statements about the company's finances and other topics to vetting by its legal counsel, according to a court filing on Friday.
If it is approved by a judge, the deal means the Tesla founder no longer faces the prospect of being held in contempt for violating an earlier settlement with the agency, which had required him to submit statements ""material"" to investors for prior review.
The new agreement, disclosed in a filing in Manhattan federal court, lays out in more detail exactly what kinds of statements must be reviewed.
Shares of Tesla rose 1.4 percent to $238.50 in after hours trading. The agreement lifts a cloud that has hung over Musk as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time.
""It could really have turned out far worse for him,"" said Stephen Diamond, a professor of securities law at Santa Clara University. ""The consequences of thumbing his nose at the SEC could have been far worse for him and the company.""
Tesla has struggled with logistics difficulties in delivering its Model 3 to global customers, a declining share price and lingering questions about the sustainability of demand. Earlier this week, the electric vehicle maker posted a $702 million loss, and warned of a loss in the second quarter.
Musk's lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.
TWEET APPROVAL
The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla's share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk's privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.
Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company's lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.
In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla's production numbers that had not been vetted by the company's attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.
At an April 4 court hearing, the judge declined to rule on the contempt motion and told the SEC and Musk to work out their differences and come to a settlement.
Musk's lawyers have argued that the February tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.
They also argued the settlement was too ambiguous for Musk to be held in contempt.
The new agreement unveiled Friday addresses that ambiguity by listing what kinds of statements must be vetted. They include statements about Tesla's financial condition, proposed or potential deals, production numbers, performance projections, financing or lending arrangements and Musk's own transactions in the company's securities.
It also gives the company's board of directors the right to seek preapproval about additional topics if they believe doing so would protect shareholders' interests.
Diamond said the new language adds clarity to the original agreement and places significant restraints on Musk's use of Twitter.
""Any attempt by Musk to circumvent the process will be much more easily policed,"" he said. 
Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission.""
In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: ""Something is broken with SEC oversight.""

Musk has been CEO of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even as the lift from optimism over prospects for U.S.-China trade detente shows signs of wearing off for the wider U.S. stock market, upbeat sentiment around China's economy could bolster shares of materials companies.
Shares of S&P 500 industrial and technology companies, which were buffeted by last year's tit-for-tat tariffs as well as slowing global demand, have been very responsive to progress in U.S.-China trade relations and a strengthening Chinese economy. This year, those sectors have outpaced the ascent in the S&P 500, which reached a record closing high on Tuesday.
Materials stocks have not been as sensitive, however, even though they also stand to benefit as a stronger Chinese economy lifts global consumption and industrial output. As China has taken measures to stimulate its economy, its economic data have turned more upbeat. That in turn could aid global growth, which has flagged as a result of China's cooldown.
""What we're seeing is China spending more on stimulus: fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""That's likely to be a positive for materials.""
The People's Bank of China has cut banks' reserve requirement ratio five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs. The stimulus appears to have boosted Chinese economic data, with factory activity growing in March for the first time in four months.
Yet so far in 2019, the S&P 500 materials index has underperformed the S&P 500 at large, rising just 11.9% compared with 16.7% for the benchmark index. Moreover, it is among the biggest decliners in the period since the S&P's previous record closing level on Sept. 20. The materials index has fallen 7% over those seven months, versus a 5.2% gain for technology and a 3% loss for industrials. Only the energy index has dropped more over that period.
A trade agreement could serve as a catalyst for a bump in materials shares as a drag on China's economy is lifted, some market strategists say. Some commodity prices, including those for copper and oil, have ascended this year as the prospects for the global economy have somewhat brightened.
""It all goes back to the global growth outlook,"" said Andrea DiCenso, portfolio manager for alpha strategies at Loomis Sayles in Boston. ""With the front run in hard data, we're beginning to see a pretty significant rally.""
Additionally, a trade agreement is expected to include commitments from China to purchase higher quantities of U.S. products such as soybeans, which could benefit companies that make agricultural chemicals, including DowDuPont Inc and CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF).
CF Industries is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday, and DowDuPont is scheduled to report before the market open on Thursday.
To be sure, even with a trade agreement, some materials companies could face price pressures. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc fell 10.1% on Thursday after the copper mining company posted a lower-than-expected profit as its production slipped and its costs rose.
A rollback of tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly aluminum and steel, would likely prompt a fall in some commodity prices, which could hurt prospects for certain materials companies, said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management in El Segundo, California.
Even so, those drawbacks may be outweighed by the support for global demand fostered by a U.S.-China trade agreement. 

""You could see a number of companies with lowered expectations bring them back up as they talk favorably about the impact that a trade deal would have on them,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 08:05PM ET</span>","Brazil's Petrobras details refinery, other asset sale plans","By Marcelo Teixeira
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras on Friday for the first time detailed long-awaited plans to sell a series of refineries and other assets as the company focuses on its core oil and gas exploration business.
Petrobras, or Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said its board had approved a plan to sell eight refineries in Brazil, including its large, recently built Abreu e Lima unit, according to a securities filing.
The company also said it will sell a gas station chain in Uruguay, called PUDSA, and an additional stake in Brazil's No. 1 fuel distribution company BR Distribuidora SA as part of a massive divestment drive that aims to cut debt and raise money to be invested in its core oil exploration area.
Petrobras, which currently has a 71 percent stake in BR Distribuidora, said it is evaluating a secondary share offering to reduce its stake in that business. 
A source with direct knowledge of the decisions taken by the board told Reuters earlier on Friday that the oil company could reduce its stake in BR to as low as 40 percent.
Petrobras said that among the other refining assets to be put up for sale are its Gabriel Passos unit, located in central Minas Gerais state, the Getúlio Vargas refinery, in southern Paraná state and the Landulpho Alves unit, in northern Bahia state, one of the largest refineries in the country with capacity to process 323,000 barrels per day.
The Abreu e Lima unit is emblematic. Launched in 2005 as a joint project for Brazil and Venezuela, in a collaboration of the leftist governments of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Hugo Chavez, the unit had successive cost overruns that led to total capital expenditure of around $20 billion from an initial estimate of $2.3 billion.

Venezuela's PDVSA later abandoned the project, that was partially concluded in 2014.

State-owned entities, such as oil firm Pemex, are banned from entering into a contract with Odebrecht or receiving proposals from the firm for three years, the ministry said in a statement.
Odebrecht did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The construction firm has been at the center of one of the world's largest corruption scandals for paying billions of dollars in bribes across Latin America in exchange for public-works contracts. 
Mexico last year banned federal institutions and state governments from doing business with Odebrecht for 2-1/2 years, but has not brought criminal charges against the company. 
Friday's statement did not address the previous ban, but the public administration ministry said Odebrecht's Mexico subsidiary had provided false information in fulfilling a construction contract, and that Odebrecht's Construtora Norberto unit had overcharged Pemex.

BONN (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) shareholders on Friday cast a vote of disapproval of the German drugmaker's top management amid anger over a stock price slump as litigation risks mount from the $63 billion takeover of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).
A 55.5 percent majority of shareholders at its annual general meeting voted against ratifying the executive board's business conduct during 2018, the company said.
Such a vote, which features prominently at every German AGM, is largely symbolic because it has no bearing on management's liability or tenure but it is seen as a key gauge of investor sentiment.
Bayer's non-executive supervisory board, in turn, won a 66.4 percent majority of the votes ratifying its business conduct during 2018, the spokesman said. 
About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) have been wiped off Bayer's market value since August, when a U.S. jury found the pesticide and drugs group liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup.
Bayer suffered a similar defeat last month, while more than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages.
Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the verdicts and has pointed to global regulators' findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is safe.
No incumbent executive board members at companies listed in Germany's blue-chip index DAX has flunked the vote, meaning receiving an approval vote of less than 50 percent at an AGM. Approval rates above 95 percent are typical results.
In a recent low for a company leadership team, former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) co-CEOs Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen scored approval ratings of about 61 percent during the bank's 2015 AGM. Both announced their resignation within weeks.
Top 20 Bayer investors who earlier on Friday said they would cast a 'no' vote included Deka Investment and Union Investment.
""The vote is a disgrace. To be gambling away the trust of so many investors within such a short time has historic proportions,"" said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment.
He added he hoped management will listen more to shareholders in future.
This month, shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis recommended that investors not give the executive board their seal of approval.
Earlier on Friday, various shareholders vented their anger at the AGM.
CEO Baumann said Bayer's true value was not reflected in the current share price.

""There's no way to make this look good. The lawsuits and the first verdicts weigh heavily on our company and it's a concern for many people,"" he said, adding it was the right decision to buy Monsanto and that Bayer was vigorously defending itself.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 05:47PM ET</span>",S&P and Fitch warn UK rating still at risk from a no-deal Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's credit rating remains at risk of a further downgrade despite the extended deadline for its departure from the European Union, ratings agencies S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Fitch Ratings said on Friday.
""The agreement between the EU and the UK to further extend the process ... to 31 October 2019 reduces but does not eliminate the risk of a 'no-deal' Brexit over the next six months,"" Fitch said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May secured the extension to the Brexit deadline earlier this month after failing to bridge the divide within her own Conservative Party over the terms of Britain's departure from the EU.
The delay averted the risk of an immediate no-deal Brexit which would deliver a shock to the world's fifth-biggest economy but the uncertainty remains, weighing on many companies which have cut back on investment.
S&P said its negative outlook reflected the risk of sustained economic weakness and a hit to government finances if Britain lost access to EU markets, investors took fright or sterling's status as a reserve currency came under pressure.
Fitch and S&P both have a AA rating on British government debt.
S&P said it could revise its outlook to stable if negotiations with the EU provided more certainty for the economy, and if key sectors retained access to EU markets without penalizing tariffs or significant non-tariff barriers.
However, the ratings agency said it saw no easy end to the Brexit impasse in parliament, and even if Britain avoided a no-deal Brexit, its outlook was sobering.
S&P expected the economy would grow by just 1.1% this year - its slowest pace in a decade - before picking up only slightly over the next three years.
That sluggish growth was likely to constrain the government's ability to raise public spending, despite promises by Finance Minister Philip Hammond that he would be able to end austerity if Britain secured a Brexit deal.
S&P also said the extension to the deadline for agreeing to Britain's exit from the EU meant London and Brussels would have even less time to thrash out their future trading relationship, the planned second phase of their negotiations.

""The originally envisaged 21 months was already a rather ambitious timeframe and the considerably shorter 14-month transition period may well prove to be inadequate, in our opinion,"" it said.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 05:04PM ET</span>",Uber unveils IPO terms that are well below expectations,"By Joshua Franklin and Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, the world's largest ride-hailing company, plans an initial public offering that values the company as much as one-third below what the startup's insiders had hoped for, between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion. 
The valuation, outlined in a regulatory filing on Friday, is less than the $120 billion that investment bankers told Uber last year it could fetch, and closer to the $76 billion valuation it attained in a private fundraising round in 2018.
The lower valuation reflects the poor stock performance of smaller rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) following its IPO last month. Lyft shares ended trading on Friday down 20.5 percent from the IPO price, amid investor skepticism over the company's path to profitability.
Lyft completed its IPO at a valuation of $24.3 billion, which corresponded to around 11 times its 2018 revenue. By comparison, the top end of Uber's valuation target is around eight times revenue last year. 
""We believe that recent price reductions for both Uber and Lyft may be indicative of investor hesitance to invest in highly capital-intensive, deeply unprofitable and untested business models at this late stage of the economic cycle,"" PitchBook analyst Asad Hussain said. 
In the filing, Uber set a target price range of $44 to $50 per share for its IPO. The company will sell 180 million shares in the offering to raise up to $9 billion, with a further 27 million sold by existing investors for as much as $1.35 billion. 
Reuters reported this month that the combined value of Uber shares sold in the IPO would be around $10 billion.
The Uber IPO would rank as the largest in the United States since that of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in 2014.
The updated public filing comes as Uber begins its 10-day investor road show, in which management will pitch the company to public markets investors.
Uber executives kicked off the road show in New York on Friday. They will host an investor presentation in London on Monday, before returning to the United States for visits to New York a second time, and to Boston, San Francisco and the Midwest.
Uber expects to price the IPO on May 9 and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day, people familiar with the matter have said. 
Of the stock being sold in the IPO by existing Uber investors, 6.86 million shares are from Uber co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, meaning the two men could jointly pocket $343 million if the IPO prices at the top end of its current range. 
Uber will face a host of questions from investors, including when it will turn a profit, how it will navigate the transition to autonomous vehicles, and whether its business model can support higher driver costs from minimum wage rules. 
Underscoring the company's ability to generate revenue but also the scale of its losses, Uber reported in the filing a net loss attributable to the company for the first quarter of 2019 of around $1 billion on sales of roughly $3 billion. 
""When it comes to Uber, we believe there are still questions over the current car-sharing model, the economics of which are not immediately or obviously attractive for sustainable, long-term investment,"" Mark Hargraves, head of Framlington Global Equities, wrote in a note. 
Uber also said PayPal had agreed to purchase $500 million of stock in a private placement at the price at which the IPO eventually settles. The two companies said they were extending an existing partnership to ""explore future commercial payment collaborations.""
This agreement is similar to when Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBCUniversal invested $500 million in Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), around the time of the latter's IPO in 2017. 
CONSERVATIVE VALUATION
Two other IPOs this month, those of online scrapbook company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc and video conferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc, have performed much better than Lyft. Uber, however, has chosen to value itself conservatively.
One advantage Uber will likely seek to emphasize to investors is that it is the largest player in many of the markets in which it does business, as well as that it operates around the world. 
Analysts consider building scale crucial for Uber's business model to become profitable.
Unlike Lyft, Uber also has a restaurant delivery business, Uber Eats, which generated $1.5 billion in revenue last year and competes with the likes of Grubhub Inc and DoorDash.
During Uber's IPO road show, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company's culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years. Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.

The Uber IPO is being led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) , Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.

New York (Reuters) - A surprisingly strong report card on the U.S. economy helped power the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes to record high closes on Friday, capping a week of gains for stocks that came largely on the back of resilient corporate profits.
While  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) was the biggest drag on the day after it gave a bleak outlook, Amazon.com's results provided the biggest boost and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) also offered support as it basked in strong box office numbers.
After staying close to flat for much of the day the S&P, Nasdaq and the Dow gained ground in the last hour of trading to register their second record closes for the week. The S&P's peak for the day was a point below its intraday record. 
Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey, said the GDP number was a positive for the market, and investors were satisfied with earnings despite some negative surprises.
""There's a lot of momentum buying. And with the thought that new highs are likely, there is continued optimism."" said Meckler, adding that the ongoing equity rally has ""dragged more believers into it, and it's sort of self-fulfilling."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 81.25 points, or 0.31%, to 26,543.33, the S&P 500 gained 13.71 points, or 0.47%, to 2,939.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.72 points, or 0.34%, to 8,146.40. 
For the week, the S&P rose 1.2%, while the Dow lost 0.06%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.86%. 
After a late 2018 sell-off, stocks have rallied this year in large part due to a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve as well as hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution.
Before the market open, U.S. Commerce Department data showed gross domestic product rising faster than expected due to high inventories while consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and homebuilding investment contracted for a fifth straight quarter. 
""The economy's not going off a cliff. Some of the numbers were a little soft but everything that could have gone wrong this week didn't,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. 
""Earnings season has been mixed but it's been a net positive,"" said Battle. ""The theater now pivots from earnings season to the Fed meeting next week."" 
The U.S. Federal Reserve meeting is due to start on Tuesday.
The S&P's biggest boost on Friday was from the consumer discretionary sector, which rose 0.9%. 
Its biggest support was from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which rose 2.5% after the e-commerce giant's quarterly profit doubled and beat Wall Street estimates though its second quarter guidance was lower than expectations. 
Also Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co surged 10.7% and was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market.
The S&P's technology index was the biggest drag on the benchmark, with a 0.4% decline. 
Intel slumped 8.99% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed the sales estimate for its key data center business in its quarterly report late Thursday. 
Out of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors, energy was the biggest percentage loser with a 1.2% drop as oil prices sank more than 3 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump again pressured the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. [O/R]
Also, shares in oil giant  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) fell 2% after its quarterly profit missed estimates.
Walt Disney Co rose 1.95% after Marvel Studios superhero spectacle ""Avengers: Endgame"" hauled in a record $60 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices during its Thursday night debut.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 39 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.45 billion shares, compared to the 6.64 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 gained 0.47%, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.34% and the Dow gained 0.31%.
Tech and energy proved an exception to the broader market rally, as investors fled the sectors following poor quarterly results from Intel and oil majors like Exxon.
Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) soft revenue forecast for 2019 offset better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, sending its stock down 9%, knocking 35 points out of the Dow. The weak results weighed on chip stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) ending the day sharply lower.
 Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) was also hit by a wave of red as Baird downgraded the chipmaker’s shares to underperform, highlighting an increasing ""disconnect between significant stock appreciation (year to date) and a continued deterioration in NAND flash fundamentals.""
In energy,  Exxon Mobil  's (NYSE:XOM) first-quarter profits missed estimates from Investing.com, as its refining business came under pressure. Its shares fell about 2.1%.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), meanwhile, posted first-quarter revenues that fell short of estimates, sending its share price down 0.7% on the day.
The weakness in Chevron comes as investor attention is fixed on the company's battle with Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) to acquire oil and gas driller Anadarko Petroleum.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said in a call that the company's $33 billion deal to buy Anadarko (NYSE:APC) is a ""superior"" offer to Occidental's $38 billion offer to buy the company.
""Our companies simply have the best strategic fit,"" Wirth added.
Losses in energy stocks were also exacerbated by a slump in oil prices globally as President Donald Trump again called on OPEC to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. West Texas Intermediate crude was off 2.9%. Brent crude fell nearly 3%.
But it wasn't all doom and gloom on the earnings front, as shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) rose on better-than-expected earnings, propping up consumer discretionaries.
So far, 77% of the 229 S&P 500 components that have reported have posted better-than-expected earnings, according to data by Refinitiv published today.
Economic data was also in the spotlight as a deeper dive into first-quarter U.S. growth data showed gains more mostly driven by temporary factors such as private inventory investment and foreign trade. But personal consumption, which makes up about two-thirds of economic growth, slowed. This would likely result in a drag on second quarter growth, analysts said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's stock price slumped 5% on Friday to its lowest in two years, rounding out a rough week that included worse-than-expected quarterly results and a pitch by Chief Executive Elon Musk on autonomous cars that failed to win over investors.

In the options market, Tesla contracts changed hands at twice the usual pace, with sentiment leaning toward defensive bets, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.
Tesla's $1.8 billion junk bond sank half a cent to yield 8.42%, more than 3 percentage points above the bond's coupon rate of 5.3%. Its spread, or the premium investors demand for the added risk of holding Tesla debt rather than a safer U.S. Treasury security, widened by about 15 basis points to a near-record 611 basis points. 
One positive development for Tesla: a U.S. District Court judge on Friday granted a request by Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission for a second extension to resolve a dispute over Musk's use of Twitter.
On Wednesday, Tesla posted a worse-than-expected loss of $702 million for the March quarter. Musk said Tesla would return to profit in the third quarter and that there was ""some merit"" to raising capital.

Musk is still battling to convince investors that demand for the Model 3, the company's first car aimed at the mass consumer market, is ""insanely"" high, and that it can be delivered efficiently to customers around the world.
Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, down from $3.7 billion in the prior quarter, and the company is planning expansions including a Shanghai factory, an upcoming Model Y SUV, and other projects. 
On Monday, Musk hosted a self-driving vehicle presentation, where he predicted Tesla would have over a million autonomous vehicles by next year. Some analysts perceived the presentation as a way to deflect attention from questions about demand, margin pressure, increasing competition and even Musk's ongoing battle with U.S. regulators.
Tesla's stock has now fallen 29 percent in 2019 and the company's market capitalization has declined to $41 billion from $63 billion in mid-December.
After overtaking the market capitalizations of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) in 2017, Tesla slipped back below GM in January, and on Friday it dipped back below the market value of Ford, which saw its stock surge 10% after reporting a better-than-expected quarter.

Tesla's stock has fallen below the level of its most recent capital raises.

Analysts now expect Tesla's revenue to expand 19% in 2019, compared with 83% growth in 2018 and 68% growth in 2017, according to Refinitiv.

Following Tesla's quarterly report, 12 analysts recommend selling the stock, while 11 recommend buying and eight are neutral. The median analyst price target is $275, up 17% from the stock's current price. Berenberg analyst Alexander Haissl has the most optimistic price target, at $500, while Cowen and Company's Jeffrey Osborne has the lowest, at $160, according to Refinitiv.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>","Slack is loss-making but revenue continues to grow, filing shows","By Bharath ManjeshR and Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) - The owner of popular workplace instant messaging app Slack made public strong year-on-year growth numbers on Friday, and an annual loss of $140.7 million, as it filed formally for its long-awaited market debut.
The San Francisco-based company, Slack Technologies, seeking to go public via a direct listing similar to that of music streaming app Spotify last year, published numbers showing it had more than 10 million daily active users as of the end of January.
Paying customers or organizations numbered 88,000, up almost 50 percent from a year earlier and more than double the 37,000 it had in 2017, the company's regulatory filing showed.
Big customers that pay Slack at least $100,000 a year numbered 575 as of year ended January, up from 298 in the previous year. These customers accounted for about 40 percent of its total revenue in fiscal 2019 and no one paid customer accounted for more than three percent.
The company said it had more than 500,000 organizations on its free subscription plan and that revenue jumped 82 percent from last year to $400.6 million and up from $105 million in 2017. 
Reuters had previously reported that the company was hoping for a valuation of more than $10 billion in the listing, which should now happen within weeks. 
Some early investors and employees have been selling the stock at around $28, valuing the company close to $17 billion, Kelly Rodriques, Chief Executive Officer of Forge, a brokerage company, told CNBC on Thursday.
The company's big issue, like many startups, is costs. Total operating expenses rose 49 percent to $503.5 million in fiscal 2019, the company said, largely due to higher sales and marketing costs.
""The company is a classic tech company with scalability,"" said Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida. ""There is the potential for profitability in the next few years, with rapidly growing profits after that."" 
""Many tech companies, such as Dropbox and Spotify, offer free use to people or organizations, with the idea that a certain fraction of them will become heavy users and paying customers. As long as the churn rate is not too high, this can be a successful business strategy.""
The company, which expects to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""SK"", reported a loss of $181 million a year earlier.
Slack's biggest shareholders include Accel Partners, an investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Dropbox, which holds 24 percent, followed by Andreessen Horowitz, with 13.3 percent. Japanese conglomerate SoftBank owns 7.3 percent.
The company, whose competitors include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams, a free chat add-on for Microsoft's Office365 users, said it expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
The company, which was launched in 2013, counts Trivago, BBC,  Lyft , 21st Century Fox, Shopify, and Survey Monkey as its customers.
This year has already seen a run of technology sector IPOs, with Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Zoom Video Communications launching to various degrees of success.

Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc unveiled the terms of its IPO on Friday, seeking a $91.5 billion valuation in what could prove the year's biggest launch.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision has given broker-dealers more time to comply with amendments to a rule that increases transparency around how they handle their customers' stock orders, according to a recent regulatory filing.
The extension of the compliance date for amendments to the SEC rule, known as Rule 606, to Oct. 1 from May 20, was made to give broker dealers enough time to make changes to their electronic order-routing systems and test them for compliance, the April 24 filing said. 
""The Commission believes that an extension of the compliance date for the recently adopted amendments to Rule 606 is reasonable to provide broker-dealers with adequate time to implement fully the systems and other changes necessary to comply with amended Rule 606,"" the SEC said.
The regulator acknowledged that the extension of the compliance date would delay the ability of investors to better compare and monitor broker-dealers' order-routing practices. 
The SEC voted to amend its 18-year-old order-handling rule on Nov. 2 to make it easier for investors to evaluate how brokers handle their orders, including more details around payments the brokers receive for sending orders to certain exchanges or private trading venues. 
The amendments will give institutional investors a better idea of how their order executions are impacted by their brokers' order-routing decisions, shedding more light on potential conflicts of interest in the process. 
The information available through the current Rule 606 quarterly reports describing payment for order flow and profit-sharing arrangements will increase once the amendments kick in. 
A bigger change in the amended rule is that brokers will be required to collect substantially more information on order routing and provide clients that request it with a report on an order-by-order basis detailing how their orders were handled during the prior six months.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",ADM's move to spin off ethanol assets speaks to industry's woes,"By Chris Prentice, Jarrett Renshaw and P.J. Huffstutter
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Biofuels pioneer Archer Daniels Midland took another step toward abandoning its pure-play ethanol assets on Friday, the latest sign of the industry's struggles with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade wars, thin margins, and overproduction.
U.S. law requires ethanol to be blended into gasoline but domestic demand for the biofuel added to gasoline has flatlined in recent years as consumers have opted for greater fuel-efficiency and electric vehicles. Ethanol producers have been forced to look abroad for demand growth.
They had banked on China to buy excess capacity, but punitive tariffs in the last two years have halted buying, exacerbating the industry's substantial overcapacity. ADM executives acknowledged that problem on Friday when the company reported that profit tumbled 41 percent in the first quarter.
ADM said it may spin off three large dry mills, which primarily produce only ethanol, after unsuccessfully searching for a buyer for those mills since 2016. At the time, its move to exit ethanol shocked the industry due to ADM's status as a leading biofuels producer. 
ADM Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said on an earnings call that the industry must stop the self-inflicted wounds.
""Our decision to monetize the dry mills is frankly a strategic decision on our part to basically help the industry consolidate,"" Young said.
Last week, U.S. ethanol production hit 1.05 million barrels per day, highest in at least five years seasonally, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Inventories climbed to 22.75 million barrels, not far from the record of 24.45 million hit in March. 
Producers such as Green Plains and Pacific Ethanol have laid off workers and idled or sold plants to stay afloat during the sustained downturn. Ethanol prices are down 42 percent in the last five years, while Green Plains and Pacific Ethanol have seen their shares fall 33 percent and 92 percent, respectively, in that time. 
""We don't have a demand problem as much as we have a supply problem. There are just too many inefficient plants out there, and they need to go before we see a rebound,"" said one ethanol trader on Friday. ""It's not like we are producing DVDs or CDs that no one wants.""
China emerged in 2015 as a significant buyer for the first time, and subsequent plans to use ethanol in gasoline nationwide by 2020 raised hopes that the world's second largest economy would scoop up excess U.S. supply.
But Beijing hiked import taxes on the biofuel in 2017, and then twice in 2018 as the United States and China ratcheted up the stakes in a trade war that has killed demand for U.S. imports. The two countries are still negotiating a trade deal that would end the tariff conflict.
Young said margins will improve with resolution of the trade dispute and purchase commitments from China expected to accompany any pact. 
Still, some say that will be a temporary boost.

""Exports may provide some temporary relief,"" said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. ""(But) without substantial growth from higher ethanol blends you are looking at situation where the U.S. ethanol industry has to shrink"" over the next 5-10 years.""

1678,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Toyota Plans Lexus SUV Investment for Canadian Plant,"(Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. plans to begin building two more Lexus SUVs in Canada, according to people familiar with the matter, a major win for the nation’s otherwise-struggling auto sector.
The Japanese automaker will produce the Lexus NX crossover and three-row version of its luxury brand’s top-selling RX sport utility vehicle in Cambridge, Ontario, starting in 2022, according to one of the people. They asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement the company has said it’s making at the plant on April 29 that will “further re-affirm” its commitment to manufacturing in Canada.
A Toyota Canada spokesman declined to comment.
Toyota is delivering a much-needed boost to Ontario after the blows General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have dealt to plants in the country since late last year. GM has said it has no future product planned beyond this year for its Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedan factory in Oshawa that employed almost 3,000. Fiat Chrysler has said it plans to cut a production shift and about 1,500 workers at its minivan plant in Windsor this fall.
Passenger-vehicle production in Canada is projected to drop by 20 percent this year as GM winds down operations in Oshawa, Fitch Solutions Macro Research said in December. Production in Oshawa fell to about 148,000 vehicles in 2017 from a peak of 940,000 in 2003, a drop of about 85 percent, according to Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc.
Hybrid Shuffle
A year ago, Toyota announced it would invest C$1.4 billion ($1.1 billion) to build gasoline and hybrid versions of the RAV4 crossover at its plant in Cambridge, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Toronto. It’s pivoted from that plan somewhat, deciding to instead build the gas-electric RAV4s in Georgetown, Kentucky.
That shift is opening up room in Cambridge for Toyota to build SUVs that, to this point, have only been built in Japan, the people familiar with the company’s plans said. The Ontario factory was built in 1988 and employs more than 8,000, according to the company’s website.
The RAV4 ascended to the top of Toyota’s U.S. sales chart in 2017. The crossover extended its edge over the company’s No. 2 model, the Camry sedan, last year to almost 84,000 units.
The RX is the longtime leading model in Lexus’s lineup, and the NX became the brand’s second-best seller in the U.S. in 2017.

1679,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Bayer Faces New Weedkiller Hurdle as Brazilians Plan U.S. Visit,"(Bloomberg) --  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has a tough audience scrutinizing its latest crop technology.
Brazil’s most influential soybean growers group, along with authorities from the South American exporting giant, plan to travel to the U.S. to assess whether the country should allow the use of some of Bayer’s weedkillers and resistant seeds.
The Brazilian delegation wants to get first-hand insight into America’s experience with the use of dicamba, according to Antonio Galvan, the head of Aprosoja, which is organizing the trip. They’re going because of concern about the consequences of potential approvals after scores of American growers sued the firm over the pesticide.
“We want to gather more reports and information about the use of dicamba in the U.S. to know what may really happen to Brazil’s agriculture,” Galvan said in a telephone interview. “Our recommendation to the Agriculture Ministry is to be very cautious on this matter.”
Bayer has been battling lawsuits across the U.S. Midwest after farmers alleged its dicamba-based herbicide, known as XtendiMax, vaporized and drifted onto nearby fields, damaging crops that weren’t resistant. The company says the problems were due to farmers applying the chemical incorrectly, and that current formulations won’t drift if labels are followed.
In Brazil, two dicamba-based herbicides are approved for soybean crops -- Atectra, from BASF SE (DE:BASFN), and Dicamba, from  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), a company that Bayer bought last year. Another 27 products are under evaluation, according to Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry.
Bayer will start trials on its new dicamba technology in 2019-20 in the South American nation, with an expected commercial launch for 2021, pending approvals, the company said in an emailed response to questions. The seed’s technology has been approved by a special commission while the Agriculture Ministry needs to approve the varieties that are going to market, Bayer says. It’s also waiting for approval of a new dicamba formulation in the country.
The U.S. trip, probably to the Midwest, should take place mid-year and include officials from Aprosoja and the Agriculture Ministry, Galvan said, adding that details of the agenda still need to be set. The ministry declined to comment on the trip.
“We have neither demand for this kind of product nor urgency on approval,” he said. “The herbicides currently available are enough for weed control.”
Bayer says its XtendiMax and VaporGrip Technology are a critical tool for helping growers manage tough-to-control weeds.
“We’ve continued to enhance our training and education efforts to help U.S. growers use this technology successfully, and U.S. customers continue to report that they have achieved on-target applications and outstanding weed control with XtendiMax,” the company said.
Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry met growers, researchers and multinationals to discuss the approval of dicamba-resistant crops last month. The government also heard Bayer executive Otavio Cancado earlier this month, according to information on the ministry’s website.
Legal Protections
Farmers in the South American nation are also seeking protection from possible lawsuits involving the use of dicamba.
“If the product is approved, the government will need to create specific legislation to make clear who will be responsible for production losses caused by dicamba,” Galvan said. “We need clarity that the company will be responsible for losses in neighboring properties, and not the farmers who will use the product.”
In 2018, U.S. farmers sprayed dicamba on about 50 million acres of soybean and cotton crops. Of that, about 1 million acres of soybeans were damaged by the herbicide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency renewed registration for the products for the 2019 and 2020 U.S. growing seasons, though with stricter requirements.

The e-commerce giant's announcement on Thursday could cause other brands, manufacturers, retailers, and logistics companies to have to invest more aggressively to compete with Amazon and its delivery, analysts said.
Retailers in recent years have poured billions into ecommerce and faster shipping options and are trying to close the gap with Amazon.

""The faster you ship, the more people buy,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.
The challenge for non-Amazon players was that very few of the existing logistics and parcel delivery players now have the ability to do nationwide one-day delivery,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak said. 
""And even fewer can do it at the vast scale and reasonable cost that AMZN would need for Prime delivery,"" Nowak said in a note.

1686,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>","Ferrexpo Plunges as Auditor, Directors Resign Amid Charity Probe","(Bloomberg) -- Ukrainian iron-ore producer Ferrexpo Plc plunged the most in three years as its auditor and two directors resigned amid a money laundering investigation at a charity supported by the company.
Ferrexpo announced on Friday morning that Deloitte LLP had resigned without providing any details about the reason. Three days ago, the company disclosed a disagreement between the auditor and Ferrexpo’s board over the role of majority shareholder and Chief Executive Officer Kostyantin Zhevago at the charity, called Blooming Land.
The shares fell 28 percent, the most since 2015, to 192.60 pence in London, wiping out more than $500 million in market value.
For Ferrexpo, the investigation into the charity is fueling worries about governance and financial controls at the company. Ukrainian authorities are probing whether the charitable foundation was used to launder money and evade taxes. There are indications that some funds may have been “misappropriated,” Ferrexpo said on Tuesday.
The company announced late on Friday that two directors, Mary Reilly and Bert Nacken, who had both been part of the audit committee, will resign from the board.
“Any further potential problems with corporate governance are able to trigger the stock’s selloff, even if they do not significantly undermine the current sound fundamentals of the company,” said Alexander Martynenko, the head of corporate research at Investment Capital Ukraine LLC in Kiev.
On Tuesday, Ferrexpo said its board had a ""unanimous view"" that Zhevago didn’t have influence over the charity. That clashed with Deloitte’s assessment. The auditors have been ""unable to conclude"" whether the CEO has significant control, according to Ferrexpo’s statement.
If Ferrexpo board members start changing their opinion, or if the U.K. or Swiss regulators start questioning the links between Blooming Land and Zhevago, the company could face further trouble, wrote Dmytro Khoroshun, an analyst at Concorde Capital in Kiev.
“If Zhevago was able to prove he was not related to Blooming Land, he could have done so already at the stage of Deloitte’s inquiry, preventing the auditor from resigning,” he said in a note.
Accounting Irregularities
The problems at Blooming Land came to light earlier this year after Ferrexpo’s auditors received bank statements from the foundation containing “irregularities.” Ferrexpo has set up an independent review committee to investigate discrepancies in payments to the charitable foundation, established primarily to coordinate the company’s philanthropic activities.
A spokeswoman for Deloitte and a spokesman for Ferrexpo declined to comment. Under U.K. rules, the auditor is likely to make its resignation letter public in the next two weeks.
Through donations to Blooming Land, Ferrexpo says it supports charitable activities in Ukraine. A unit of the iron-ore miner gave the foundation about $110 million over the past six years to fund causes such as diabetes awareness and care of the elderly.
The resignation of Deloitte also comes as the so-called big four accounting firms face increased scrutiny. Last week, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority renewed its demand for the firms to split their operations into separate business units.
Stung into action by a series of high-profile corporate failures, the regulator said in its final report that a fragile auditing market could only be fixed with government action. The accounting industry has been under fire in the wake of corporate collapses such as those of building contractor Carillion Plc and bakery chain Patisserie Valerie Holdings Ltd.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's emissions certification process in the United States, the automaker disclosed on Friday, saying it was cooperating fully with the probe and still conducting its own internal review.
Ford said in a statement the Justice Department had notified it earlier this month of the criminal investigation, which made the automaker the latest to come under scrutiny for adherence to emissions standards by U.S. officials.
""Ford is fully cooperating with the government, and we’ll keep them posted on what we’re finding through our investigation and technical review,"" the company said.
Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The Environmental Protection Agency also declined comment.
Ford has held meetings with the California Air Resources Board and EPA officials and turned over documents related to its review, a person briefed on the matter said. The No. 2 U.S. automaker has also submitted a testing plan that has been approved by regulators, the person said. The first vehicle Ford is evaluating is the 2019 Ranger pickup truck.
Ford potentially faces significant financial penalties as regulators have taken a tough line on emissions issues.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said earlier this month the agency had other enforcement actions against other automakers ""in the works."" 
""When people are not playing by the rules and they are creating more pollution ... we will catch them, we will hold them accountable,"" Wheeler said.
Ford disclosed an issue with emissions to the EPA and the California in February, and hired outside law firm Sidley Austin and experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns about analytical modeling that is part of its fuel economy and emissions compliance process.
Ford said previously it did not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers. But the company reiterated in a regulatory filing Friday that the emissions issue does not involve the use of so-called defeat devices. (https:// U.S. and California regulators have been cracking down on automakers for emissions cheating following revelations in 2015 that German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG had used defeat devices to make models equipped with diesel engines appear to comply with emissions standards when they emitted far more pollution than allowed in real-world driving. Ford said it had been looking into concerns raised by employees since last fall that incorrect calculations were used to translate test results into vehicle mileage and emissions data submitted to regulators. Ford is evaluating changes to the process it uses to develop fuel economy and emissions figures ""including engineering, technical and governance components,"" the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said. In January, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. A Justice Department criminal investigation is pending. U.S. regulators are also investigating  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, but the Justice Department and EPA have declined to comment on the status of the probe. Daimler has declined to comment, but has previously acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States over the diesel emissions scandal, for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and it offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. 
Ford has been embarrassed in the past by errors in fuel economy claims. In 2013, the automaker cut by seven miles (11 km) per gallon the claimed fuel economy for its C-Max hybrid model following complaints that real-world mileage did not match the claimed fuel economy. In 2014, Ford lowered fuel economy ratings for six other models and offered compensation to customers.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo taps headhunter Spencer Stuart to find new CEO - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's board has retained executive search firm Spencer Stuart to hunt for a new chief executive, ideally a woman who can tackle its regulatory and public perception issues, two people familiar with the matter said.
Wells Fargo's ambition to become the only major U.S. bank with a female CEO underscores the need to restore its image with a wide range of constituents, including customers, shareholders, regulators and politicians, after it became mired in a scandal in 2016 for opening potentially millions of unauthorized accounts.
Former CEO Tim Sloan left abruptly last month, becoming the second CEO to leave the bank in the scandal's fallout. 
The board plans to approach  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's Latin America chief Jane Fraser, one of the sources said. During Fraser's 15-year tenure at Citigroup, she has gained experience running consumer and commercial businesses as well as its private bank. 
Fraser could not be immediately reached for comment. 
The board also discussed approaching JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's Marianne Lake, but after the bank named her to run JPMorgan's consumer lending business last week, that option became less viable, the source added. The board wants someone who can convince regulators, employees, investors and customers that the bank has fixed problems underpinning the sales scandal, the sources said.
The bank's board feels that choosing a woman might please lawmakers in Washington who have been critical not only of Wells Fargo’s misbehavior, but of the broader banking industry for a lack of diversity and gender equality, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
It also believes that such a move could bolster Wells Fargo’s image with the households of customers where women play a leading role in managing finances, one of the sources added. 
The new CEO will also have to resolve litigation and regulatory matters. There are 14 outstanding consent orders with government entities, as well as probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice.
To be sure, Spencer Stuart will approach and consider several male candidates for the CEO job as well, one of the sources said. The top priority is to find an external candidate who can navigate the bank’s regulatory issues, the source added.
Finding an outsider who meets all those qualifications and wants the job will be difficult, the sources said. There are few people with the necessary experience, even fewer of those who are women, and it is not clear if any of the obvious candidates would be open to taking the role.
The sources asked not to be identified because Wells Fargo’s board deliberations are confidential.
Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and Spencer Stuart declined to comment. 
Wells Fargo’s board has not made any public statements about its requirements for a new CEO, beyond Chair Betsy Duke saying the job should attract the “top talent in banking.”
The board wants to complete the search within the next three to six months, one of the sources said.
STALLED SHARES
After Sloan's ouster, Wells Fargo’s board appointed Allen Parker, who had been general counsel, as interim CEO. The board has said it is looking for an external candidate as a permanent replacement. It is not clear whether Parker will stay at the bank. 
Others whose names have been mentioned by analysts, recruiters and industry sources as perspective CEO candidates include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc finance chief Ruth Porat and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's chief technology officer Cathy Bessant. 
Wells Fargo shares have stalled since Sloan's departure on March 29th, while the KBW Bank index has rallied more than 7 percent.
Wells Fargo would be ""the best stock on earth to buy"" if it had the right CEO, said Greg Donaldson, chairman of Donaldson Capital Management in Indiana.
Donaldson held about 50,000 Wells Fargo shares, but sold the stake last year as problems mounted. The CEO change could convince him to re-invest, depending on who it is, he told Reuters.

""It would be very smart for them to get a woman,"" he said.

The company on Thursday beat brokerage estimates for quarterly same-store sales on the back of demand for its new Cloud Macchiato, Matcha tea and cold brews in the United States.
However, BTIG's Peter Saleh was one of a number of sector analysts who said while customers forking out for higher-priced new drinks had helped drive growth in same-store sales, ""anemic"" traffic at cafes remained a concern.
He and others pointed to a 1 percent decline in footfall at cafes in the Chinese market, viewed as crucial to the chain's growth for the foreseeable future. 
More broadly, transaction numbers, the substitute analysts use for customer traffic, were unchanged in all three of the company's global regions.
Shares in the company, which hit a record high after the results on Thursday, fell 1 percent in morning trade.
""We remain cautious given near-term headwinds surrounding China, including cannibalization, increasing competition (and) a slowing economy,"" Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan said. 
Starbucks has also poured money into beefing up its delivery network in China as it battles with local startup Luckin Coffee, whose speedy growth led it to file for an IPO in the United States earlier this week.
New menu items and partnerships with delivery services, the heart of the company's strategy to win back customers lost to artisanal coffee shops and cheaper fast-food rivals, did help Starbucks' sales in its home market.
However, analysts said growth in China may continue to be subdued. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expects store expansion in China to take priority over comparable sales growth. 
She downgraded her rating on Starbucks' to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"", arguing that the company facing tough sales comparisons later on in 2019 from last year and the current rich valuation of shares meant the stock had limited room to rise.
""Investors will be hesitant to invest new money in a stock with a topline that, while still strong, is unlikely to meaningfully accelerate,"" Herzog said. 
Still, the company's solid same-store growth in the United States, improving profit margins and a lower tax rate for the rest of the year led at least 6 Wall Street brokerages to raise their price targets on the stock to as high as $81.

11 of 29 brokerages rate Starbucks ""buy"" or higher, 17 ""hold"" and 1 ""sell"" or lower. Their median price target is $75.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank focused on solo destiny after Commerzbank deal demise,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Within hours of the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Christian Sewing scrambled to convince investors and employees that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) can stand on its own two feet.
The Deutsche Bank chief executive told staff, many of whom opposed a merger because of significant job losses, that while he had not been ""skeptical"" about the Commerzbank talks, he was cautious about the chances of success from the start.
And another top Deutsche Bank executive said on Friday that it had been Commerzbank that initiated the talks, suggesting there was no desperation on their part for a deal.
Commerzbank denied that version of events, ending the apparent truce between the normally highly competitive cross-town Frankfurt rivals over the past six weeks.
German hopes of creating a national banking champion able to challenge global competitors were finally dashed on Thursday when Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank ended their talks due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands.
For Sewing, the failure to clinch a deal has left the 49-year-old chief executive of Germany's largest bank, who took over just over a year ago, with his back to the wall.
Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which downgraded Deutsche Bank last year, said on Friday that Deutsche Bank ""will remain under strain"", adding that it ""seems to have acknowledged the need to adjust its strategy"". 
Under Sewing, a new leadership has tried to revive Deutsche Bank's fortunes, but it has faced money laundering allegations and failed stress tests, as well as ratings downgrades.
At the heart of the debate over its future is whether it should focus its business on Germany and draw a line under its costly global ambitions to take on Wall Street's big guns.
""MARKET PLAY""
Without a deal, Deutsche Bank now finds itself back at the mercy of equity and debt markets, with UBS analysts warning that in a ""stress scenario"" it could again ""be forced into a 'debt-driven capital increase' even with solid capital ratios"".
""Deutsche remains a levered market play vulnerable to external events,"" the UBS analysts said in a note.
Sewing, along with many analysts, believes Deutsche Bank can go it alone in the short-term, but will be counting on a turnaround in market conditions to do so in the long-run given its dependence on volatile investment bank earnings.
""To reach our return objective, we also need to see a revenue recovery in our more market-sensitive business,"" Sewing said on Friday after reporting results.
""These revenues are available to us in better market conditions given our leading positions in many of these businesses, but we need to capture them,"" he added.
Revenue at Deutsche Bank's bond trading division fell 19 percent in the first quarter, it said on Friday, underscoring weakness at its investment bank. 
If those earnings do not improve, Berlin's desire to keep its biggest bank out of foreign hands may start to wane. 

""Germany's globally active companies need competitive financial institutions that can support them around the world,"" German finance minister Olaf Scholz said on Thursday.

Chevron's oil and gas production rose during the quarter, and profits in its U.S. exploration business jumped 15 percent from a year earlier. But weakness in refining and international exploration knocked overall profit down 27 percent on a 6.8 percent decline in revenue. 
""Earnings declined from a year ago largely due to lower crude oil prices and weaker downstream and chemicals margins,"" Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said. 
Wirth signalled that Chevron considers itself on track to make a deal for Anadarko. He said combining the shale, deepwater and liquefied natural gas businesses of the two companies ""will unlock significant value to shareholders."" 
Although earnings topped Wall Street's consensus, investors are focused on the takeover battle for Anadarko, wrote analysts at Edward Jones. The brokerage firm rates Chevron a buy.
""We would not be surprised to see Chevron raise its offer,"" they said in a research note on Friday, saying the company's bid will ""ultimately be the successful one."" 
Chevron's daily production of oil and gas rose to 3.04 billion of barrels, from 2.85 billions of barrels in the year-ago period. But the price for each barrel of U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids fell to $48 from $56 a year earlier. Chevron's take from international output, slipped to $58 per barrel from $61 a year earlier. 
The lower prices and weakness in gasoline margins knocked first-quarter net income to $2.65 billion, or $1.39 per share, from $3.64 billion, or $1.90 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street consensus was $1.30 per share.
Revenue fell nearly 7 percent to $35.2 billion from $37.64 billion a year ago. 
Shares of San Ramona, California-based Chevron slipped less than 1 percent to $117.18 in morning trading. 
Rival  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Friday reported its earnings were well below analysts' estimates, citing the effects of weaker crude prices, heavier maintenance and weaker margins in its refining and chemicals businesses.
Exxon shares were off 2.4 percent at $80.25 in morning trading.

1696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>",Goldman-Backed Firm May Be First Russian IPO in U.S. Since 2013,"(Bloomberg) -- HeadHunter Group PLC plans to raise as much as $253 million in what would be the first initial public offering of a Russian company in the U.S. since Washington began imposing sanctions in 2014 to punish the Kremlin for its role in the Ukrainian crisis.
HeadHunter, Russia’s largest online-recruitment firm, plans to offer up to 18.75 million American Depository Receipts on Nasdaq at between $11 and $13.50 a share, the company said in a statement Thursday. The shares will be sold by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Elbrus Capital, which acquired the company from Mail.ru Group Ltd. in 2016.
If it goes through, this will be the first time a Russian company tests the American market since 2013, when fintech firm Qiwi Plc and software developer Luxoft Holding Inc. sold shares. Geopolitical tensions following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and later charges of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election have led to escalating sanctions against Moscow and dampened investor appetite.
Goldman, which is managing the HeadHunter listing along with five other banks including  Morgan Stanley  & Co (NYSE:MS)., VTB Capital Plc and Sberbank CIB, may be seeking to take advantage of investor enthusiasm for the technology sector after offerings by  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., according to Alina Sychova, head of capital markets at Sova Capital in Moscow.
HeadHunter postponed plans for a U.S. offering last April following a new wave of sanctions that pummeled Russian markets, Kommersant reported at the time.
The market for Russian equity sales remains frail. Not a single Russian company held an initial public offering last year and Globaltruck Management was the last firm to list shares on the Moscow Exchange, in November 2017. Earlier this month, Russian railroad carrier Rustranscom PLC dropped plans for a London offering. Cherkizovo Group PJSC, which delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2017, shelved a potential share sale because it said the situation on capital markets wasn’t favorable.
“The banks managing the HeadHunter IPO also participated in marketing Rustranscom and Cherkizovo deals and understand the level of investor demand for Russia,” Sychova said. “It seems they are hoping U.S. demand for the technology sector will take this deal over the finish line.”"
1697,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>","American to take $350 million hit from 737 MAX, sees ungrounding this summer","By Sanjana Shivdas and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc cut its 2019 profit forecast on Friday, blaming an estimated $350 million hit from the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX planes, but said it was confident that the jets would start flying again before mid-August.
American, with 24 of the 737 MAX jetliners that were grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes on other airlines, has removed the aircraft from its fleet until Aug. 19, leading to about 115 daily cancellations.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) is developing a software fix and new pilot training to be approved by regulators globally, and American Chief Executive Doug Parker said he had 95 percent certainty that passengers would actually be able to use tickets the airline sells on MAX flights past Aug. 19. 
While American's daily summer cancellations over the MAX only represent about 2 percent of its flight capacity, it said, the financial impact is disproportionate as revenue during its busy summer travel season is lost while the vast majority of costs remain in place.
As a result, Fort Worth, Texas-based American said it now expects its 2019 adjusted profit of $4.00 per share to $6.00 per share, from a previous forecast of between $5.50 per share and $7.50 per share.
Analysts on average expect 2019 earnings of $5.63 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares were down 2.3 percent at $32.64 in early trading.
American, the No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, also said it expects fuel expenses for the year to be about $650 million higher than its earlier forecast, citing a recent run-up in oil prices.
The airline reported first-quarter net income of $185 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $159 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the airline earned 52 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 51 cents per share.
Between the MAX and American's grounding of another 14 aircraft of a different model for now-completed work on faulty overhead bins, American said, first quarter pre-tax income suffered about an $80 million hit. 
Total operating revenue rose 1.8 percent to $10.58 billion, marginally missing estimates of $10.60 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Still, Parker said demand remained strong heading into the summer. American expects unit revenue, a closely watched performance measure that compares sales with flight capacity, to rise between 1 percent and 3 percent in the second quarter.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>","SAS pilots strike, travel plans of 170,000 passengers at risk","By Esha Vaish and Andreas Mortensen
OSLO/COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - SAS pilots in Norway, Sweden and Denmark went on strike on Friday as wage talks broke down, threatening the travel plans of some 170,000 passengers over the weekend.
The airline canceled around 70 percent of its flights on Friday and Saturday.
SAS is in the midst of renewing an aging fleet after spending years cutting costs in the face of competition from budget carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
At airports across Scandinavia stranded passengers were queuing at SAS counters to get help.
At Copenhagen Airport, Spanish teachers Juan Manuel Gonzalez and Miguel Angel, on a trip with 23 students to Chicago, had been re-booked on a flight on Saturday, but the delay was proving costly for their students.
""The kids had tickets for basketball and theaters tonight, so they won't be able to get a refund. It is a nightmare for them and they're in a very bad mood,"" Gonzalez said. 
On her way from the Faroe Islands to her home in Frankfurt, Astrid Melbert did not know when she would be able to leave Copenhagen.
""The last two times I've been traveling, I was hit by strikes, so I thought I would book with SAS this time. See how that went,"" she said.
Many flights at regional rival Norwegian Air were sold out on Friday with some ticket prices on its website soaring. A flight between Oslo and Stockholm cost 9,000 Swedish crowns ($948), several thousand more than might normally be expected.
TALKS ON HOLD
SAS, whose shares traded 5.3 percent lower in Stockholm on Friday, said it hoped to resume negotiations and reach an agreement with its pilots as soon as possible.
""As a consequence of the strike, domestic, European and long-haul flights have been canceled, and thousands of travelers will be affected,"" it said in a statement.
SAS said it was prepared to continue to negotiate, but that if the pilots' requirements were met, it would have ""very negative consequences"" for the company.
Analysts at Sydbank expect the strike to cost SAS 60-80 million Swedish crowns ($6.3-$8.4 million) per day, wiping out an expected net profit for the year if it lasts for two weeks.
""The SAS pilots' strike...makes it clear that SAS is more vulnerable than we previously expected,"" Sydbank analysts said.
In total, 1,409 pilots from a total of around 1,500 across the three countries went on strike on Friday. Flights operated by SAS partners, which make up approximately 30 percent of all departures, were not affected, the airline said.
""The strike could have been avoided, if SAS had shown a real willingness to meet us halfway,"" said Rene Arpe, chairman of the Danish pilot union.
The aviation industry's employer body in Sweden said pilots held onto their ""extreme wage claims"", demanding a 13 percent wage increase despite what it called already high average wages of 93,000 Swedish crowns ($9,759.89) a month.
The unions dispute the figure, saying salaries start at 34,000 SEK, increasing over 25 years to 98,000 for a captain. 
LABOR TENSION 
The SAS Pilot Group, a federation representing 95 percent of the airline's pilots in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, said in a statement it had tried to gain greater transparency about working hours. 
Most pilots don't have fixed schedules and in some situations risk working seven weekends in a row, the group said, adding that pilots were prepared for a ""prolonged"" strike.
Close to bankruptcy in 2012, SAS was forced to sell assets and cut wages and thousands of jobs in return for a life-saving credit facility. It has posted a net profit in each of the last four years.
But fuel costs are rising in line with crude prices and European airlines face continued overcapacity and currency volatility, factors that have toppled several smaller players in the past year.
Labor tensions have also risen in the past two years as the industry faces a global pilot shortage.

That has bolstered pilots' bargaining power, as seen at other airlines including Ryanair, Lufthansa and Air France.
