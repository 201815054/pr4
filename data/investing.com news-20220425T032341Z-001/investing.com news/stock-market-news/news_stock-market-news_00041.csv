ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira, bonds and shares gained on Monday after the opposition dealt a stinging blow to President Tayyip Erdogan by winning control of Istanbul in a re-run mayoral election on Sunday.
Turkish assets have lost value since March amid uncertainty over how the vote might affect Erdogan's economic policies and concern over strained relations between Ankara and Washington related to Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems.
One banker said the outcome had removed a source of political uncertainty and markets were hoping the government would now shift its attention to the economic reforms that Turkey needs.
""This optimism could be limited or temporary as the S-400 issue and possible sanctions by the United States are still the most important risk element,"" said the banker, who requested anonymity.
Economic data on Monday also provided some encouragement. A manufacturing confidence index rose to 102.5 points in June. The capacity utilization rate rose to 77.1%.
The lira gained to 5.72 overnight after the election outcome emerged, rallying from a close of 5.8140 on Friday. The currency stood at 5.7270 at 0743 GMT.
Ekrem Imamoglu of the Republican People's Party (CHP) secured 54.21% of votes, according to the head of the High Election Board - a bigger margin than his narrow win three months ago.
Michael Every, a senior strategist at Rabobank, said the key question is whether the government focuses on economic reform or tries to keep Imamoglu from using his mayorship to build enough momentum to challenge Erdogan in the 2023 parliamentary and presidential elections. 
POSSIBLE SANCTIONS
Ankara and Washington have sparred publicly for months over the S-400 missile systems, expected to be delivered to Turkey as early as next month. Washington has said that would trigger U.S. sanctions under CATSAA, a law calling for sanctions against countries procuring military equipment from Russia.
Erdogan and President Donald Trump are set to meet at a G20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka on June 29-30, in part to discuss the S-400s and the threat of U.S. sanctions. Investors have held out hope the leaders can find a solution.
""We have a low conviction that bold reforms will be implemented after Treasury and Finance Minister Albayrak did not provide concrete details of his economic program in April. The S-400 and F-35 issues are even more pressing,"" Every said.
Turkey's main BIST 100 index rose some 2% at morning trade and the banking index was up more than 3%, after election results. The two-year benchmark bond yield fell to 18.65% from 19.92% on Friday.

Turkey's dollar bonds also gained, with longer-dated bonds rising more than 1 cent to hit multi-month highs, according to Tradeweb data.

The currency climbed as much as 1.8% against the dollar, the most in the world, bringing the dollar-lira pair closer to its 100-day moving average, a level it hasn’t closed below since late March. The main equity guage added more than 2% at the open.
“Perhaps this retracement in USD/TRY may extend to around 5.50 if the external backdrop is favorable for risky assets,” said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. Still, “President Erdogan and his AKP remain at the helm and their policies -- or lack of them -- will drive the market” over the longer-term, he said.
Opposition candidate Ekrem Imamoglu won the redo of the Istanbul mayor’s race by a landslide, which suggests President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party won’t challenge the result again. The original vote in March had been overturned after the ruling AK Party narrowly lost, fueling concerns that Turkey’s democratic foundations were fraying and spurring a drop in the lira.
While the market is rightly welcoming the fact the results of this election won’t be contested, investors will be looking for answers for what comes next, said Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura Plc in London. “Will there be more populism? Will there be a cabinet reshuffle? Will there be increased nationalist influence?”
One-month risk reversals on the dollar-lira pair, the premium traders pay for options to sell the local currency over those to buy, fell the most in two weeks on a closing basis.
No Early Election
The leader of Erdogan’s key governing ally, Devlet Bahceli of the nationalist MHP, dismissed the prospect of an early national election, helping to remove another element of uncertainty for some traders.
Investors are eager to see authorities press on with mending the beleaguered economy, which is at risk of a double-dip recession. The lira, which traded 1.6% higher at 5.7278 per dollar as of 10:38 a.m. in Istanbul, has lost over 7% of its value this year, the worst performer in emerging markets after the Argentine peso.
The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index, among the cheapest in developing nations, has added 5.2% in 2019.
While President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accepted the outcome of Sunday’s election, he has hinted the new mayor could run into legal problems.
“The knee-jerk reaction was to buy the lira, but we expect rising political tensions ahead and so remain skeptical of this recent rally,” according to Win Thin, the New York-based head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura Holdings Inc won shareholder approval on Monday for the re-appointment of its chief executive officer, overcoming concerns about the leaking of market information and its first annual loss in a decade.
CEO Koji Nagai kept his job despite opposition from influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, which had recommended shareholders vote against his re-appointment. 
The vote was in effect an endorsement of Nagai's efforts to turn around the investment bank, which reported an annual loss in April and said it would not pay out bonuses to directors.
Nomura was ordered by the financial watchdog last month to improve its internal controls following the leak of information related to listing and delisting criteria at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
""We sincerely apologize for causing great trouble and worry to investors,"" Nagai told the annual general meeting on Monday. All the executives on stage bowed in contrition following his remarks.
The meeting lasted for more than three hours as shareholders threw questions at executives. When asked why he did not resign, Nagai said he felt a duty to ""steadily proceed with business improvement measures"".
Nomura has said an employee from its Nomura Research Institute affiliate leaked information about expected changes to listing rules to the chief strategist of its securities arm, who informed sales staff. The sales staff then told clients.
Nagai, who became the group CEO in 2012, has said he will take a 30% pay cut for three months over the scandal. 

While Nomura's share price has been trending down, it surged more than 10% last week after the firm announced a $1.4 billion buyback. It rose 0.3% in Monday's trading.

Banco Popular, saddled with debt, became the first bank to be wound down using new European rules aimed at avoiding taxpayer funded bailouts and was sold to Santander for a nominal one euro in June 2017. 
Santander agreed to pay 936.5 million euros ($1.07 billion)for Allianz Group's 60% stake in Allianz Popular which distributed insurance products for Banco Popular in Spain. 
Allianz Popular owned life insurance group Allianz Popular Vida, asset management group Allianz Popular Asset Management and Allianz Popular Pensiones. 
The agreement, which concludes the reorganization of the Spanish insurance, asset management and pension plan businesses following the Popular acquisition, would reduce Santander's fully-loaded CET1 capital by around 8 basis points, the bank said. 

The agreement is expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2020 subject to permission from the regulatory and anti-trust authorities.

Lufthansa said it would pay out a regular dividend of 20-40% of net profit, adjusted for one-off gains and losses, in the future. Its previous dividend policy was based on a payout ratio of 10-25% of earnings before interest and tax.
""The payout range of the new dividend policy offers the Group more flexibility compared to the previous policy to achieve dividend continuity,"" the group said, without elaborating further.
Shares in Lufthansa, which is due to hold its capital markets day on Monday, were up by 1.8% in early Frankfurt trade, according to data from Lang & Schwarz.
Based on Refinitiv estimates for the year 2019, the new payout ratio would result in a total dividend payment of 305 million to 611 million euros ($347-$696 million), compared with 233-583 million under the old regime.

Poor margins at Eurowings compared with sector rivals were cited by Lufthansa last week as a major reason for the profit warning. Eurowings' revenue was also forecast to fall sharply in the second quarter.

China, the world's largest new energy vehicle (NEV) market, has seen increased investment from South Korean battery makers LG Chem Ltd and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd amid expectations for a gradual change in policy. [nL4N1Y829E]
The list, which did not include foreign firms when it was first published in 2015 to spur a domestic battery sector, was abolished on Friday as part of government management reforms, the ministry said on its website. It gave no further details.
Foreign makers complained the list discouraged competition and became linked to generous subsidies for recommended domestic companies such as Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD Co Ltd.
""We are relieved that these lists are going away, but we cannot be certain if the Chinese government is committed to abolish subsidies until they actually remove all subsidy policies,"" said an official at one foreign battery maker who declined to be named.
China has raised its standards for new energy vehicles (NEV) that qualify for subsidies and reduced the amount it is willing to provide to relevant companies, as it looks to wean the sector off government support. [nL3N21E1LO]

Officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve are concerned on learning about Deutsche Bank's strategy and have sought further details of the plan, which is part of the lender's move away from investment banking, FT reported, citing sources.
Deutsche Bank and the Fed did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter. 
Reuters reported earlier this month that Deutsche Bank was planning to overhaul its trading operations by creating a so-called ""bad bank"" to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets.
The overhaul would also include shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside of Europe, a source had told Reuters.
The bank also reportedly faces probe over its alleged failure to comply with laws meant to stop money laundering and other matters. The investigation involves problematic transactions, some of which are linked to U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.

Malaysian prosecutors had previously issued summonses to three Goldman Sachs units in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Singapore, requiring them to respond to criminal charges filed against them over bond issues that the bank had arranged for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing.
On Monday, a lawyer for the bank said Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, based in Hong Kong, had only received its summons in the past week, while another summons issued to the bank's Singapore unit was incomplete, with just three out of four charges served.
""Under such circumstances, we ask for another date... so that we will have enough time to take instructions from our clients,"" lawyer Hisyam Teh told the court. 
The court then fixed Sept 30 for case management. 
Last December, Malaysian prosecutors had filed charges against the three Goldman Sachs units for misleading investors by making untrue statements and omitting key facts in relation to bond issues that the bank had arranged for 1MDB.
The bank says certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.
Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then prime minister Najib Razak. 

Najib, who lost a general election last year, is facing 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. casino operator Eldorado Resorts Inc has agreed to merge with Caesars Entertainment Corp in a cash and stock deal that values its peer at about $18 billion including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 
The agreement comes three months after Reuters reported that Caesars had agreed to give Eldorado access to its books under pressure from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who earlier this year was awarded seats on Caesars’ board.
The deal, which is expected to be announced on Monday, values Caesars at close to $13 a share, according to the sources. The combined company's ownership would be split roughly between Eldorado and Caesars shareholders, the sources said. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. An Eldorado spokesman said the company did not comment on rumors or speculation. Caesars did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The combination of the two companies would create a serious competitor to larger casino industry players, such as Las Vegas Sands Corp, Wynn Resorts Ltd and MGM Resorts International. 
Caesars' shares closed on Friday at $9.99. The company, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2017, operates casinos with the Harrah's and Horseshoe brands. It had 53 properties in 14 U.S. states and five countries outside the United States at the end of December. 
Eldorado has a market value of $4 billion. It also had long-term debt at the end of March of $3.1 billion. It owns and operates 26 properties in 12 U.S. states.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - Several major projects in U.S. President Donald Trump's $50 billion economic blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian peace mirror previous proposals stalled by conflict, analysts said on Sunday.
The plan, spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, calls for the creation of a global investment fund to boost the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies with some 179 infrastructure and business projects.
Shaul Arieli, a former Israeli peace negotiator, said many were not new.
""Most of the plans have already been presented under the Obama administration,"" said Arieli, now an analyst at the Economic Cooperation Foundation think-tank that advocates for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In an interview with Reuters, Kushner said the plan's authors had studied why previous peace efforts had failed in formulating a fresh initiative.
""We tried to take the good things they did and then come up with a new approach to try to bring this forward,"" he said.
The plan, presented in a slick 40-page document, aims to cut the Palestinian poverty rate in half and double the amount of drinkable water in the Palestinian territories but some of the ideas require Israeli agreement and have been knocking around for decades.
""Even by the lowest threshold of anticipation – offering innovative economic prospects – this plan fails to impress,"" said Tareq Baconi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. 
The Trump administration's decision to release the economic portion of its peace plan without any discussion of political solutions has prompted a mixture of derision and exasperation among Arab politicians and commentators.
However, Mohammad Abu Jayyab, a Palestinian economist in Gaza, said the plan might still work.
""Chances of it getting implemented are there: the Gulf money and the influential American policy and the regional satisfaction to achieve common interests,"" he said.
Proposed projects include:
GAZA-WEST BANK CORRIDOR, VIA ISRAEL
Under the plan, a proposed $5 billion transportation corridor - a highway and possibly a rail link - would be built between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, crossing Israel.
Gaza and the West Bank are around 35km apart at their closest point. However, they are divided not just by geography but by long-standing and bitter divisions between President Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority (PA), whose power base is in the West Bank, and the PA's Islamist rival, Hamas, which controls Gaza
A 47km long ""safe passage"" through Israel between Gaza and the Hebron in the West Bank was envisaged by interim peace deals in the 1990s. Proposals included railroads, tunnels, elevated roads and a monorail.
But the ideas went nowhere, stymied by political upheaval and bloodshed, three wars between Israel and Hamas and the collapse of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in 2014.
""There are two areas with Palestinians in them. They have been saying for many years, 'let us pass, we can't pass through roadblocks every day, give us a different logistic infrastructure',"" Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Sunday.
""It will be relevant, and I definitely think it should be relevant, when Gaza ceases to be a pro-Iranian realm of terror. That means, it is not relevant now nor in the foreseeable future,"" he told Israel Radio.
But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas put the blame back at the doors of Israel and the United States.
""If Israel had not obstructed the Oslo Accords, the corridor would have been established. America is reinventing the wheel. Those agreements are already there,"" he said in Ramallah on Sunday.
The plan also entails upgrading facilities at key crossing points along Gaza's border, including with Egypt. Citing security concerns, Egypt has often kept its Rafah crossing closed, cutting off Gaza's main gateway to the world.
POWER PLANTS
The Kushner plan proposes a $590 million upgrade to Gaza's sole power plant. The enclave has suffered for years from unreliable electrical supply, with daily, prolonged blackouts the norm. Within a year of the project's implementation, Palestinians in Gaza would receive at least 16 hours of electricity per day.
Before the proposal's publication, Qatar was already in talks with Israeli officials about building a new power line from Israel to Gaza, which the Gulf nation would help to fund. The new line would provide 100 megawatts to Gaza, which currently gets a total of 120 megawatts from Israel, short of the 500 megawatts to 600 megawatts that Palestinians say the blockaded enclave needs.
The Kushner plan also includes $1.2 billion in loans and private sector financing for gas-fired power plants in Hebron and Jenin in the West Bank.
    The Palestine Investment Fund (PIF), which is the PA's sovereign fund, is the lead investor in an ongoing initiative to build a power plant in Jenin. PIF says the power plant requires $600 million in capital, which matches the figure quoted in the Trump team's proposal. 
    A cornerstone was laid for the project in late 2016 and PIF and its partners have issued bids for the plant's construction.  According to documents reviewed by Reuters, project shareholders will finance $180 million, with ""$420 million from international development and finance institutions"".
    Even if the project is fully financed and built, it cannot be operated without a gas supply, which requires Israeli approval, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. 
   
GAZA DESALINATION PLANT
The U.S. plan calls for channeling ""significant investments"" into infrastructure to increase water supply in Gaza, including desalination facilities aiming to double the amount of potable water available to Palestinians, per capita, within five years.
The Palestinian Water Authority, in partnership with international institutions including the European Commission (EC), the European Investment Bank, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Islamic Development Bank and World Bank, has already prepared a comprehensive and integrated investment program for the Gaza central desalination plant.
    In 2018, the EU said it had received €456 million in international financial support for the project.
Work still has not been carried out, but the EC noted in April ""substantial progress"" in ongoing discussions between the PA and Israel on the entry of building materials to Gaza. Israel maintains tight controls on Gaza imports, saying some material might be used to build weapons.
GAZA MARINE GAS FIELD
The Trump team's proposals include $1 billion in grants, loans and private sector financing for the development of a natural gas field offshore of Gaza. The gas field is currently fully-owned by the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF). 
    PIF estimates the field's development would cost $1 billion, which matches the figure quoted in the Trump team's proposal.
    Plans to develop the field have been put off several times over the past decade due to Palestinian political disputes and conflict with Israel, as well as economic factors, analysts say.
    In 2018, Shell (LON:RDSa) relinquished the 55 percent stake in the field that it took over as part of its acquisition of BG Group in 2016, after struggling to find a buyer. PIF then became the field's sole owner. It is searching for an operator and buyer for a 45 percent stake. 
    Gaza Marine, located about 30 km (20 miles) off the Gaza coast between the giant gas fields Leviathan and Zohr, respectively in Israeli and Egyptian waters, is estimated to hold over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

    Gaza Marine has long been seen as an opportunity for the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority to join the eastern Mediterranean gas bonanza.

On Friday, EP Global Commerce, an acquisition vehicle owned by the Czech and Slovak investors, made the takeover offer, which valued the company at 5.8 billion euros ($6.6 billion).
The retailer, noting that the offer price was only 3% above the closing share price on Friday, said the bid ""substantially undervalues the company and does not reflect its value creation plan"".
Metro said management was continuing to transform the company. It said it would comment further once the full offer document was available and that shareholders should take no action in the meanwhile.
EP Global Commerce, which already held a stake of nearly 11% in Metro, said on Friday that its offer price of 16 euros for each ordinary share and 13.80 euros for each preferred share represented a 34.5% premium to when EP Global Commerce made its initial investment in August.
The firm, co-owned by Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky and Slovak partner Patrik Tkac, said the offer was ""a compelling value and a unique opportunity"" for shareholders given the difficult market and challenges facing Metro.
Once a sprawling retail conglomerate, Metro has in recent years been restructuring to focus on its core cash-and-carry business, selling off the Kaufhof department stores and then splitting from consumer electronics group Ceconomy.
It still operates in 26 countries with 771 stores and 150,000 employees, but it is trying to offload its loss-making Real hypermarkets chain, as well as its operations in China. 
The Czech and Slovak bidders signaled that further changes were needed at Metro, though they said they would not close stores in Germany and its core markets, or cut jobs substantially.

""Metro needs to regain the capability to swiftly react,"" they said, adding that otherwise, it ""would be exposed to significant risks due to stagnant or declining results.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Trading in Neil Woodford's 3.7 billion pound ($4.69 billion) Equity Income Fund may not be reopened swiftly after it was suspended on June 3 because of the illiquid assets it holds.
The fund's authorized owner, Link Fund Solutions, must update investors on whether it intends to keep the fund closed to trading at least every 28 days. The first deadline is July 1.
The main reason trading was suspended was to allow time for the fund to sell its stakes in unlisted and illiquid assets. This is also the main factor determining when it can reopen.
Woodford had been trying to sell those stakes before the suspension. His plans included moving five holdings into his listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT) in a March share swap. But redemptions outpaced that effort.
Britain's markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said at the time of the suspension that a fifth of the fund's assets were in such illiquid assets. 
The illiquid assets include preference shares in four firms listed on the Guernsey stock exchange that have never traded. 
FCA data show how difficult it will be to reopen the fund quickly, indicating that just 8% of the holdings could be sold in a week. The rest are expected to take much longer to sell.
The data showed selling 29% of the fund's holdings could take up to a month, about 30% would require six months and another third would need from six months to more than a year.
""I doubt very much whether that fund will be unsuspended until much later this year, possibly not until next year,"" said Chris Bailey, analyst at Raymond James.
Tracking Woodford's handling of the process has been made harder since he stopped publishing a list of holdings on the company website.
A Woodford spokesman told Reuters on June 13 that the frozen fund had sold 100 million pounds in more liquid listed British stocks. He declined to offer an update when contacted on June 21. 
According to the 2018 annual report, the fund had stakes in 24 unlisted or Guernsey-listed companies, excluding those subsequently removed in the share swap. The companies equated to 18.26% of the portfolio with a value of 850 million pounds, based on assets under management at the end of 2018.
The fund's investment include stakes in 14 unlisted healthcare or biotechnology companies.

(Reuters) - The success of Hudson's Bay Co Executive Chairman Richard Baker's $1.3 billion bid to take the department store operator private hinges on whether an independent valuator will view the company more as a retailer and less as a real estate owner, corporate governance experts and analysts said.
Much of Hudson's Bay's value is locked up in its real estate. Were the company to sell off some of its properties to raise cash, it could fetch more than what Baker offered, but would then be forced to pay rent to run some of its stores.
Baker's buyout consortium, which already owns 57% of Hudson's Bay, has made a C$9.45 per share offer for the remainder of the Canadian company, a 48% premium to where the stock was trading before the announcement. 
However, some of the minority shareholders, including hedge fund Land & Buildings Investment Management LLC, say they value the company's assets at between C$28 and C$33 per share. Hudson's Bay shares ended trading on Friday at C$9.73, above the C$9.45 offer price, as investors bet on a sweetened bid.
The big valuation gap is due to disagreements over how much of Hudson's Bay's prime real estate can be divested while keeping it operational. Selling off property raises cash but also makes it more financially burdensome for the company to rent the space for the stores it operates. As a result, it would likely close stores, and its retail footprint would begin to shrink.
""There is judgment to be exercised on the valuation, which can always be challenging,"" said Catherine McCall, the executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance, an organization representing institutional shareholders in Canadian public companies.
Hudson's Bay operates 39 stores under its Saks Fifth Avenue brand, 133 stores under its Saks OFF 5th brand, more than 40 stores under the Lord + Taylor banner, 90 Hudson's Bay department stores, as well as 37 stores in Canada which the company plans to close this year under the Home Outfitters brand. 
Hudson's Bay's trophy asset is the Saks Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan, which this year completed a $250 million renovation.
Hudson's Bay's most recent public estimate for the value of its real estate was in September 2018, when CEO Helena Foulkes pegged it at $28 per share. Baker has offered about a third of that because he argues that the company would have to all but liquidate to achieve all the real estate value.
Toronto-Dominion Bank, which has been hired by a Hudson's Bay board committee to independently evaluate the take-private deal, will recommend whether the company should accept the offer as fair, or reject it and try to negotiate further. 
The board committee excludes representatives of Baker's buyout consortium and is granted power to prevent any deal, even if the prospective acquirers otherwise control the company. In an illustration of this, a special board committee sank the hopes of Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Inc's founding family group last year to take the U.S. department store operator private, after it rejected their $8.4 billion offer.
The methodology Toronto-Dominion Bank uses to value the bid for Hudson's Bay will be key to the outcome and will be scrutinized heavily by shareholders. The bank will likely be assessing how comparable companies' shares trade, research similar deals and consider how much a financial buyer like a private equity firm would pay, said Andrey Golubov, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto.
""It's not done just to justify the offer. That said, valuation is not a science,"" Golubov said. 
Hudson's Bay declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Baker's buyout consortium. Spokespeople for TD Bank did not respond to requests for comment.
CASHING OUT ON REAL ESTATE
Sale lease-back arrangements in which retailers sell their properties and become tenants in their stores have become increasingly popular in the last few years as the downturn in brick-and-mortar retail brought about by the rise of internet shopping has put pressure on retailers to raise cash.
However, some retailers resist them because they view the rent obligation as burdensome, a stance that often attracts investor criticism. Macy's Inc for example, another department store operator, was pressured by hedge fund Starboard Value LP three years ago to do more to cash out on its real estate. 
Even if Toronto-Dominion Bank blesses an offer from Baker's consortium and the board committee negotiating a deal approves it, the acquisition still faces some hurdles.
A majority of the shareholders who are not affiliated with the buyout consortium have to vote for it, accounting for about 21.5 percent of the company's shareholder base. Opponents could still challenge the deal in court when the company seeks approval for it before a judge under the Canada Business Corporations Act. 
But successful legal challenges of deals that have followed the process for management buyouts outlined by the Ontario Securities Commission, as Hudson's Bay is seeking to do, are rare.

""Most of these deals get done once they get board approval and a transaction agreement gets signed,"" said Jeremy Fraiberg, chair of the mergers and acquisitions group at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 06:55PM ET</span>",California governor proposes a $21 billion wildfire fund,"By Alex Dobuzinskis
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed helping utilities create a fund of up to $21 billion to compensate future victims of wildfires sparked by the companies' equipment or employees, an aide said on Friday.
The proposal by the Democratic governor follows the bankruptcy filing earlier this year of San Francisco-based utility PG&E Corp, which anticipates $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires that have been blamed on its equipment, including the state's deadliest blaze which killed more than 80 people last year.
The state's other two large utilities, Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, have seen their credit ratings downgraded over wildfire concerns.
Since 2000, California has endured 15 of the 20 most destructive wildfires in state history. Newsom has blamed climate change for much of the increased risk from fires.
""Wildfires don't discriminate - they are a rural, suburban and urban danger,"" Newsom said in a statement. 
His plan is part of an effort by political leaders in the state to shore up the utilities, protect electricity rate payers and cut the risk of new fires.
Newsom has proposed the $21 billion fund to compensate wildfire victims in blazes tied to utilities, such as when a downed power line sparks a blaze. Half the fund would come from extending a surcharge on electricity bills and the other half would come from a new massive, utility-funded insurance policy, said an aide to the governor, who declined to be named.
The proposed fund would need to be created by the state legislature. The state could issue bonds to securitize over 15 years the portion of the fund underwritten by extending the rate hike, the aide added.
Utilities would have to spend a combined $3 billion on wildfire safety measures to qualify for aid from the fund.
UTILITIES' CHOICE
If lawmakers approve the plan, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric would have 15 days from the enactment of legislation creating the fund to choose whether to join it, the aide said.
Bankrupt PG&E would be allowed to participate in the $21 billion fund if the other two utilities elect to join, the aide said.
If the utilities elect not to join the $21 billion fund, the state would create a $10.5 billion liquidity fund, underwritten by the extension of the electricity surcharge, according to the aide.
The liquidity fund would provide fast compensation to victims in the aftermath of a wildfire, while a process is under way to determine a utility's liability for the blaze, which can take years, the aide said. 
California lawmakers are awaiting some details of the governor's proposal, but they expect to hear them on Monday, state Senator Bill Dodd, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. 
""Where I'm at right now is I want to work with the governor to get something comprehensive,"" Dodd said.
Separately, Bloomberg reported that PG&E has been proposing a $14 billion fund to deal with past claims from wildfires. It also wants a $20 billion statewide fund for future fires, Bloomberg said.

""PG&E's leadership is committed to continuing to work with the governor and all stakeholders on shared solutions that will compensate wildfire victims fairly and equitably and mitigate the ever-growing threat of wildlife risk,"" the utility said in a statement.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 06:47PM ET</span>",FDA approves drug for loss of sexual desire in women,"By Saumya Joseph
(Reuters) - The U.S. drug regulator on Friday approved Palatin Technologies and Amag Pharmaceuticals' drug to restore sexual desire in premenopausal women, the latest attempt to come up with a therapy that some have dubbed as ""female Viagra"".
The therapy, Vyleesi, will compete in a market which has seen previous attempts fail. Analysts have said that a drug that safely and effectively treats loss of sexual desire in women could eventually reach annual sales of about $1 billion. 
Palatin's shares jumped 44% to $1.93, while Amag shares rose 11.5% after market.
Vyleesi, chemically known as bremelanotide, activates pathways in the brain involved in sexual desire, helping premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). 
The drug will compete with Sprout Pharmaceuticals' Addyi, a once-daily pill that was approved for HSDD in 2015 with a warning restricting alcohol use when on the medication. It will be available from September through select pharmacies.
Addyi was approved under intense pressure from advocacy groups despite a review by scientists at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that deemed it minimally effective and possibly unsafe.
Vyleesi, which does not restrict alcohol use, is seen as having several advantages over Addyi, including tolerable side effects, rapid-acting nature and not having to take it every day, according to analysts.
Side effects reported during clinical trials included mild to moderate nausea lasting no more than two hours and mostly occurred over the first three doses, Amag said. About 40% of patients in clinical trials experienced nausea.
The drug is administered as a shot into the abdomen or thigh using an auto-injector at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity, with the FDA recommending patients not to take more than one dose within 24 hours or more than eight doses per month.
The drug was developed by Palatin and Amag holds exclusive North America sales rights. Palatin will get $60 million from Amag for the approval plus additional payments for certain sales milestones and royalties.
HSDD affects about 6 million women in the U.S., but few seek or receive treatment.
SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia said there will be a need for more direct-to-consumer advertising through social media, which could help in building awareness about HSDD.
""These women are just suffering in silence and so the market doesn't really exist today,"" Amag CEO William Heiden said.

Ladenburg Thalmann analyst Michael Higgins forecast Vyleesi sales could reach $732 million by 2030.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 04:38PM ET</span>",Bang-up week on Wall Street ends with a whimper,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street edged lower on Friday, as U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's decision to defer a speech on China policy increased optimism on upcoming trade talks between Washington and Beijing, while tensions between the United States and Iran undercut sentiment.
The S&P 500 briefly hit a record high.
Pence called off a planned China speech that had been cast initially as a sequel to a blistering broadside he delivered in October, a move aimed at averting increasing tensions with Beijing, a White House official said.
The benchmark S&P 500 index hit an intraday record high of 2,964.15, but then stepped back as the rising tensions between the United States and Iran kept investors on edge. 
Top for investors next week, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to restart trade talks at the Group of 20 summit in Japan on June 28-29. 
""People will be focusing on what happens at the G20 with Presidents Trump and Xi,"" said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager with the Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. Any indication of progress from Trump following the meeting would be positive for Wall Street, he said.
Stocks logged a third straight week of gains after posting their worst monthly performance this year in May on fears the prolonged trade war would hit global economic growth. 
Trump said on Friday he aborted a military strike on Iran in response to Teheran's downing of a U.S. drone, but the possibility of a U.S. retaliation pushed crude prices higher and helped lift the energy sector by 0.82%. [O/R]
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.13% to end at 26,719.13 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.13% to 2,950.46. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.24% to 8,031.71.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq was weighed down by a 2.2% fall in  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) after the digital payments company said its chief operating officer, Bill Ready, would step down.
For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 2.20%, the Dow added 2.41% and the Nasdaq rose 3.02%.
During Friday's session,  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) rose as much as 3.2% to a record high after the used-vehicles retailer posted quarterly results above analysts' expectations.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp fell for a second day, down 4.4%, and among the biggest decliners. Several brokerages trimmed their share price targets after the cruise operator cut its 2019 profit forecast.
Reflecting ""quadruple witching,"" as investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration, volume on U.S. exchanges hit 8.6 billion shares, compared with the 7.0 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 65 new lows.

SANTIAGO/SEOUL(Reuters) - South Korea's POSCO has pulled out of a project to build battery parts in Chile, the Asian steelmaker said, little more than a year after winning guaranteed access to cheap lithium from top producer Albemarle. POSCO, together with partner Samsung (KS:005930) SDI, won a 2018 Chilean government tender to build a battery-parts factory in the country's northern desert in exchange for a 27-year supply of low-cost lithium. The problem, POSCO told Reuters, is that the project it proposed requires lithium hydroxide, a type of the metal increasingly favored by EV battery makers but one not produced by Albemarle in Chile. Albemarle in Chile produces primarily lithium carbonate, a variety of the metal that is widely used in smaller consumer electronics. Samsung, the world's largest maker of smartphones, told Reuters that it is still reviewing the project following Posco’s announcement. POSCO's decision is yet another in a string of setbacks for Chile, which has struggled to modernize its lithium policies, boost output and develop a domestic battery industry, despite having the world's largest supplies of the metal and rising global EV demand.
Albemarle and the Chilean government in 2016 signed an agreement that allows Albemarle to more than triple its output of lithium. But the deal requires the company reserve as much as 25 percent of its production for companies seeking to build batteries or their parts in Chile. The agreement does not specify whether Albemarle should produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide at its facilities.
Albemarle and Corfo, which leases the company its mining rights in Chile, initially disagreed on how to price the lithium it would provide to the battery makers, but have since come to agreement. Neither has offered details of the settlement. 
Albemarle did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Posco's decision.
China's Sichuan Fulin Transportation Group Co and Chile's privately held Molymet also won access to the discounted lithium in last year's tender.
Fulin and Molymet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Following last year's tender, Chile's government said the price tag for the three projects was $754 million. At least 664 jobs would be created.
The deals were widely seen as a foot in the door into Chile as countries and global corporations scramble to lock down supplies of key metals used in batteries that power cell phones, tablets and electric vehicles. 

POSCO last summer said it would build a lithium plant in Argentina to help secure its own supply. That announcement came as POSCO also said it would buy lithium mining rights in Argentina from Galaxy Resource Ltd's in a deal worth $280 million.

The S&P 500 ended down 0.13% after hitting a new high of 2,964.15 early in the day. The Dow Jones industrials sagged at the close, ending down 0.13%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped back 0.24%. The declines were the first for the indexes after four-straight gains.
Among influences this week, there was the U.S. drone shot down off the coast of Iran that nearly caused a U.S. attack on Iranian military facilities. The Federal Reserve signaled an interest-rate cut, and maybe more, was coming. Its chairman said the central bank was worried about the health of U.S. manufacturing and global economic growth. President Donald Trump agreed to meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping at next week's G-20 summit in Tokyo in hopes of negotiating a trade deal. And the president held back on imposing big tariffs on Mexico.
For the week, the S&P 500 was up 2.2%, while the Dow rose 2.4% and the Nasdaq was up 3%. The weekly gains were the third straight for the major indexes. But June has been one of the strongest Junes for stocks since the 1950s, The Wall Street Journal noted. The S&P 500 is up nearly 7.2% so far this month, with the Dow is enjoying a 7.7% gain, and the Nasdaq up 7.8%.
Only 12 of the 30 Dow stocks were higher, led by UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ). The laggards included Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).
Energy, healthcare and utilities were among the strongest sectors on the day. Real estate, technology and industrials were the weakest. But gains and losses were modest.
Crude oil jumped 9% on the week, hitting $57.42. Gold Futures topped $1,400 an ounce, its highest close in nearly six years as interest rates fell. The 10-Year Treasury yield briefly dropped under 2% and the dollar index also fell.
Next week isn't big on corporate earnings. The reports of note include  Lennar  (NYSE:LEN) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), both on Tuesday.
There are some important economic reports to look for, including new home sales on Tuesday and a revision on first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday. The biggerst economic event is the G-20 summit that starts Friday in Tokyo.
Interest rates moved up slightly, despite the Fed's signal it could cut rates soon. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool puts the odds of a rate cut at the Fed's July meeting at 100%. The Fed's key federal funds rate is 2.25% to 2.5%.
S&P 500 winners and losers
Healthcare giant Humana (NYSE:HUM), auto-dealer operator CarMax (NYSE:KMX) and oil-services company Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE) were among the top gainers in the S&P 500.

The lawsuit, filed in state court in California in Santa Clara County on June 14, names Martin DeBono, SunPower's former executive vice president of global channels; Standard Industries; and Standard's solar division, GAF Energy, as defendants.
The lawsuit alleges that DeBono began working for Standard several months before he left SunPower in April 2018. It states that in 2017, DeBono forwarded emails containing proprietary sales information to a personal account and drafted a PowerPoint presentation called ""Solar Overview for Standard"" based on SunPower's proprietary and confidential information.
Privately held Standard Industries, which is based in New York, said the lawsuit was without merit.
""SunPower's claims are meritless. Talented people are joining GAF Energy because we are driving a more modern approach to residential, rooftop solar and clearly, SunPower is threatened,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
DeBono did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Standard launched GAF Energy earlier this year with DeBono at the helm. The company is leveraging its existing roofing manufacturing business, GAF, to offer an integrated solar roof product.
SunPower has sued competitors and former employees in the past alleging theft of trade secrets, including SolarCity in 2012 and SunEdison in 2015.
""As the industry leader in solar technology, we take protecting our intellectual property very seriously,"" SunPower said in a statement.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 03:32PM ET</span>",U.S. judge tosses former SAC Capital trader's insider trading guilty plea,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday threw out the 2013 insider trading guilty plea of a former trader at SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund once run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, saying recent changes in the law meant there were not enough facts to support the plea.
The trader, Richard Choo-Beng Lee, 62, had been a major cooperating witness and one of the first to plead guilty in former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's insider trading crackdown, which began in 2009 and led to more than 80 guilty pleas and convictions.
While rejecting Lee's claim that new evidence showed he was actually innocent, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe found no evidence that Lee knew of any personal benefits that insiders at Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc and 3Com Corp might have received by divulging confidential information on which prosecutors said he traded.
Gardephe said such knowledge was central to establishing insider trading liability for accused ""tippees"" like Lee, under decisions issued in 2014 by the federal appeals court in Manhattan and 2016 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
""There is no reason to believe that Lee - in using the phrase 'breach of fiduciary duty' during his 2013 allocution - understood that phrase to include the liability components"" in the later decisions, Gardephe wrote. ""His guilty plea must be vacated.""
James Margolin, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan, declined to comment. Lee's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gardephe scheduled a July 10 conference to discuss the next steps in the case.
The decisions Gardephe cited had previously led to the overturning of several insider trading guilty pleas and convictions won by Bharara, including the conviction of former SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg.
Another convicted former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, is serving a nine-year term.
Now called Point72 Asset Management LP, SAC pleaded guilty to fraud and paid $1.8 billion in U.S. criminal and civil settlements. Cohen was not criminally charged.
Lee helped manage $1.25 billion at SAC before admitting to securities fraud and conspiracy charges, court papers show. 
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel sentenced him in 2015 to three weeks in prison, which Lee's lawyer at the time called ""unfair"" given his client's cooperation.
In asserting his innocence, Lee said he would not have pleaded guilty had he known about instant messages uncovered in 2017 that showed many of his Yahoo trades were based on news of a planned partnership with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) that had already been widely disseminated.

The case is U.S. v. Lee, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 13-cr-00539.

BOSTON (Reuters) - HomeStreet Inc defeated Roaring Blue Lion Capital Management's campaign to unseat one director and install its own candidate, ending a two-year standoff between the financial services company and the activist investor, the company said on Thursday.
Three of HomeStreet's nine directors stood for re-election at Thursday's annual meeting and each received at least 80 percent of the votes cast by shareholders, according to a preliminary tally, the company said.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Mason, lead independent director Donald Voss and independent director Sandra Cavanaugh were re-elected. Shareholders also rejected the fund's call to split the chairman and chief executive roles.
A representative of Blue Lion did not respond to a request for comment. 
Blue Lion, which had called for the lender to restructure itself, originally wanted to install two directors - its founder Charles Griege and Ronald Tanemura - but then amended its proxy statement to try to replace Voss with Tanemura. 
Minutes before the meeting was scheduled to begin and after the largest shareholders had already cast their votes, Blue Lion withdrew the candidacy of Tanemura, HomeStreet said in a statement.
""We have a strong, independent Board that is making significant progress executing against our strategy of transforming HomeStreet into a leading West Coast regional commercial bank,"" CEO Mason said in a statement.
Thursday's outcome marks the seventh time this year that a proxy contest has been decided by a vote instead of a settlement, giving shareholders the final say over who sits on a company's board.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Naspers' pay-television business MultiChoice Group is planning to lay off more than 2,000 workers in South Africa in a shake-up of its customer care service, the company said on Friday.
MultiChoice, which competes with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in online streaming via Showmax, said in a statement it is launching a consultation process to cut 2,194 positions in MultiChoice South Africa's customer care call centers and walk-in centers.
""This has not been an easy decision to make but, in a business driven by advancing technologies, we must continue to drive efficiencies yet be agile enough to adapt to evolving customer needs,"" MultiChoice Group Chief Executive Calvo Mawela said. 
""We must act decisively to align to the change in customer behavior and competition from over-the-top services,"" he added, referring to video services that stream directly over the internet. 
""If we don't reposition now, we run the risk of being completely misaligned and we put everyone's jobs at risk.""
Under the Labour Relations Act, the consultation process will take 60 days.
Over the past three years, MultiChoice has seen a steady decline in the number of customer telephone calls and e-mails into its call centers and walk-ins to its customer service centers, the company said.
In contrast, self-service digital channels have continued to grow, now accounting for 70% of all its customer service contacts. 
""The company is also in an environment where it will rely more on technology than people,"" it said. 
Job cuts are politically sensitive in South Africa, where the unemployment rate is more than 27 percent.
In his state of the nation address on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa called the unemployment rate among the youth a ""national crisis"" that demands urgent, innovative and coordinated solutions.
MultiChoice said it will make new roles available for multi-skilled workers with the ""expertise, skills and technological prowess to enhance the customer experience"". 
As part of a support program agreed with unions and other employee representatives, the firm will offer voluntary severance packages, wellness support and financial planning, it said. 
It will also continue paying for the current studies of MultiChoice bursary-funded employees, and some other benefits.
However the Information Communication and Technology Union (ICTU) said in a statement it had not been officially informed of the action, ""which makes the process unlawful"".
""The employer has timed Friday to make announcement, which shows some cowardice tendencies of not dealing with the consequences of their actions,"" it said, adding that it will seek an urgent engagement with MultiChoice.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>",Four U.S. states join lawsuit to stop T-Mobile-Sprint deal,"By Jonathan Stempel and Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four more U.S. states joined an unusual effort by state attorneys general to stop T-Mobile US Inc's acquisition of Sprint Corp, a New York official said at a court hearing on Friday.
Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Nevada will be included in an amended complaint being filed Friday, said Beau Buffier, chief of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's office.
Lawyers for the states and the companies also proposed Oct. 7 for the start of a trial, which could last two to three weeks.
Sprint was down 5.9% percent around midday on Friday while T-Mobile had slipped 2.3%. 
The four states join 10 state attorneys general, led by New York and California and including the District of Columbia.
They filed a lawsuit on June 11 aimed at stopping the purchase by No. 3 U.S. wireless operator T-Mobile of No. 4 Sprint, saying the deal would cost their subscribers more than $4.5 billion annually. The attorneys general from all of the states involved are Democrats.
If the acquisition is completed, the number of U.S. wireless carriers would drop to three from four, with  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) leading the pack.
The Federal Communications Commission has indicated it is prepared to approve the transaction, and the Justice Department is expected to weigh in soon.
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero signaled the case could be affected if the U.S. Department of Justice, which is not involved in the lawsuit, decides to intervene.
""The elephant not in the room is the Justice Department,"" Marrero said, referring to his courtroom. ""Either way, it is likely to affect what is on the table.""
Marrero also noted a possible inconsistency in the states' complaint. He said they maintained that aggressive competition among the four national wireless carriers have resulted in ""falling prices,"" only to then say the companies' ability to signal each other on rates ""has led to higher prices for consumers.""
George Cary, who represents T-Mobile, told the judge the transaction would benefit competition. ""It is taking two smaller companies, putting together complementary resources,"" he said.
Discussing the prospect that the federal government might intervene, Cary said, ""We don't think that what the Justice Department does here is going to affect the pro-competitive nature of this deal.""
FCC chairman Ajit Pai on Friday criticized the states' lawsuit as ""misguided,"" arguing it will harm efforts to boost next-generation 5G wireless access.
""Make no mistake about it, government officials trying to block this transaction are working to stop many upstate New Yorkers and other rural Americans from getting access to fast mobile broadband,"" Pai said in a speech in New York in which he argued that Sprint would not be able to build a 5G network alone.
""If the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction is approved, the combined company will have the capacity to do just that,"" he said.

T-Mobile, which is about 63% owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), has about 80 million customers. Sprint, which is about 84% owned by Softbank Group Corp, has some 55 million customers.

Asked by Reuters about the plan, a PG&E spokesman said: ""We are looking at all options when it comes to working with the governor and legislature, and are committed to resolving wildfire victims’ claims fairly and expeditiously.""
Shares of the company, which is currently hosting its annual general meeting of shareholders, were down nearly 1 percent in a choppy reaction to the report which saw the stock both rise and fall.
On Tuesday, San Francisco-based PG&E said that as part of its reorganization it would pay $1 billion to more than a dozen local governments in California affected by wildfires in recent years.
The Bloomberg report said there would be two funds, one of $14 billion to cover past claims and one of $20 billion to cover future claims, under the plan which it said was expected to be filed formally in August. 
PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January after facing liabilities of more than $30 billion in the wake of Camp Fire, California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire in recent times.

The Camp Fire killed more than 85 people, destroyed over 14,600 houses, mobile homes and other housing units, according to California's Department of Finance.

34,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 03:32PM ET</span>",U.S. judge tosses former SAC Capital trader's insider trading guilty plea,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday threw out the 2013 insider trading guilty plea of a former trader at SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund once run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, saying recent changes in the law meant there were not enough facts to support the plea.
The trader, Richard Choo-Beng Lee, 62, had been a major cooperating witness and one of the first to plead guilty in former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's insider trading crackdown, which began in 2009 and led to more than 80 guilty pleas and convictions.
While rejecting Lee's claim that new evidence showed he was actually innocent, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe found no evidence that Lee knew of any personal benefits that insiders at Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Inc and 3Com Corp might have received by divulging confidential information on which prosecutors said he traded.
Gardephe said such knowledge was central to establishing insider trading liability for accused ""tippees"" like Lee, under decisions issued in 2014 by the federal appeals court in Manhattan and 2016 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
""There is no reason to believe that Lee - in using the phrase 'breach of fiduciary duty' during his 2013 allocution - understood that phrase to include the liability components"" in the later decisions, Gardephe wrote. ""His guilty plea must be vacated.""
James Margolin, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan, declined to comment. Lee's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gardephe scheduled a July 10 conference to discuss the next steps in the case.
The decisions Gardephe cited had previously led to the overturning of several insider trading guilty pleas and convictions won by Bharara, including the conviction of former SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg.
Another convicted former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma, is serving a nine-year term.
Now called Point72 Asset Management LP, SAC pleaded guilty to fraud and paid $1.8 billion in U.S. criminal and civil settlements. Cohen was not criminally charged.
Lee helped manage $1.25 billion at SAC before admitting to securities fraud and conspiracy charges, court papers show. 
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel sentenced him in 2015 to three weeks in prison, which Lee's lawyer at the time called ""unfair"" given his client's cooperation.
In asserting his innocence, Lee said he would not have pleaded guilty had he known about instant messages uncovered in 2017 that showed many of his Yahoo trades were based on news of a planned partnership with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) that had already been widely disseminated.

The case is U.S. v. Lee, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 13-cr-00539.

BOSTON (Reuters) - HomeStreet Inc defeated Roaring Blue Lion Capital Management's campaign to unseat one director and install its own candidate, ending a two-year standoff between the financial services company and the activist investor, the company said on Thursday.
Three of HomeStreet's nine directors stood for re-election at Thursday's annual meeting and each received at least 80 percent of the votes cast by shareholders, according to a preliminary tally, the company said.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Mason, lead independent director Donald Voss and independent director Sandra Cavanaugh were re-elected. Shareholders also rejected the fund's call to split the chairman and chief executive roles.
A representative of Blue Lion did not respond to a request for comment. 
Blue Lion, which had called for the lender to restructure itself, originally wanted to install two directors - its founder Charles Griege and Ronald Tanemura - but then amended its proxy statement to try to replace Voss with Tanemura. 
Minutes before the meeting was scheduled to begin and after the largest shareholders had already cast their votes, Blue Lion withdrew the candidacy of Tanemura, HomeStreet said in a statement.
""We have a strong, independent Board that is making significant progress executing against our strategy of transforming HomeStreet into a leading West Coast regional commercial bank,"" CEO Mason said in a statement.
Thursday's outcome marks the seventh time this year that a proxy contest has been decided by a vote instead of a settlement, giving shareholders the final say over who sits on a company's board. Shareholders backed management in six contests, including at HomeStreet, where Thursday's result marks one of the proxy season's largest majorities. 
Proxy advisory firms International Shareholder Services (ISS), Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones, which often decide the votes of thousands of investors, all sided with management.

""Make no mistake about it, government officials trying to block this transaction are working to stop many upstate New Yorkers and other rural Americans from getting access to fast mobile broadband,"" Pai said in a speech in New York in which he argued that Sprint would not be able to build a 5G network alone.
""If the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction is approved, the combined company will have the capacity to do just that,"" he said.

T-Mobile, which is about 63% owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), has about 80 million customers. Sprint, which is about 84% owned by Softbank Group Corp, has some 55 million customers.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 01:52PM ET</span>",PG&E to float $31 billion restructuring plan: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Power producer PG&E Corp will propose a $31 billion bankruptcy restructuring plan that will include two funds worth a total of $34 billion to cover past and future wildfire claims, Bloomberg reported https://twitter.com/scottdeveau/status/1142117995680030720 on Friday.
Asked by Reuters about the plan, a PG&E spokesman said: ""We are looking at all options when it comes to working with the governor and legislature, and are committed to resolving wildfire victims’ claims fairly and expeditiously.""
Shares of the company, which is currently hosting its annual general meeting of shareholders, were down nearly 1 percent in a choppy reaction to the report which saw the stock both rise and fall.
On Tuesday, San Francisco-based PG&E said that as part of its reorganization it would pay $1 billion to more than a dozen local governments in California affected by wildfires in recent years.
The Bloomberg report said there would be two funds, one of $14 billion to cover past claims and one of $20 billion to cover future claims, under the plan which it said was expected to be filed formally in August. 
PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January after facing liabilities of more than $30 billion in the wake of Camp Fire, California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire in recent times.

The Camp Fire killed more than 85 people, destroyed over 14,600 houses, mobile homes and other housing units, according to California's Department of Finance.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>",Airlines avoid parts of Iran-controlled airspace after U.S. regulator's order,"By Jamie Freed and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Some global airlines are re-routing flights to avoid Iran-controlled airspace over the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman, they said on Friday, after the U.S. aviation regulator barred its carriers from the area until further notice.
Thursday's emergency order from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) came after Iran shot down a high-altitude U.S. drone with a surface-to-air missile, sparking concerns about a threat to the safety of commercial airlines.
The downing of the unarmed Global Hawk drone, which can fly up to 60,000 ft (18,300 m), was the latest in a series of incidents in the Gulf region, a critical artery for global oil supplies, that included explosive strikes on six oil tankers.
According to flight tracking applications, the FAA said, the nearest civil aircraft was operating within about 45 nautical miles of the unmanned aircraft when it was shot down.
""There were numerous civil aviation aircraft operating in the area at the time of the intercept,"" the FFA said, adding that its prohibition would stay in place until further notice.
Hours earlier, United Airlines suspended flights between New Jersey's Newark airport and India's financial capital of Mumbai following a safety review.
Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines, Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd, Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM of the Netherlands said they were re-routing flights to avoid the area.
Emirates Airline and Etihad Airways, which were flying over the area earlier on Friday, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, said later they were also re-routing their flights.
'THREAT IS REAL' 
The FAA said it remained concerned about the escalation of tension and military activity in close proximity to high-volume civil aircraft routes as well as Iran's willingness to use long-range missiles in international airspace with little or no warning.
In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, prompting carriers to take more steps to uncover threats to their planes.
But concerns persist over inadequate government intelligence sharing and a reluctance by countries involved in conflicts to divulge information or sacrifice overflight fees by closing their skies, according to safety experts.
The U.S. ban does not apply to airlines from other countries, but OPSGROUP, which provides guidance to operators, said carriers globally would take it into consideration.
""Since MH17, all countries rely on advice from the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany to highlight airspace risk,"" it said.
""The threat of a civil aircraft shootdown in southern Iran is real,"" it added. 
Restricting airspace complicates airline efforts to keep routes running in a region where airspace is already congested, in part due to ongoing conflicts which have made it unsafe to fly over some countries.
At 0820 GMT on Friday, Flightradar24 showed Qatar Airways flights in the area barred to U.S. carriers. 
On Monday, before the drone was shot down, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told Reuters the airline ""has a very robust plan B for any eventualities, including if there is a conflict in our region.""
Qatar Airways did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Friday on whether it had introduced new measures since the drone was shot down. 
Etihad, which had said it was monitoring the situation, later said in a statement it had agreed ""to change a number of the flight paths we operate to and from the Arabian Gulf"" after close consultation with the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority. 
FLIGHTS SUSPENDED
United said it had suspended its flights to India through Iran airspace after a ""thorough safety and security review,"" but did not say how long the suspension would last.
A United spokesman said customers flying from Mumbai to Newark would be booked on alternative flights back to the United States.
""We continue to explore all our options and remain in close contact with relevant government authorities,"" he added.
A Lufthansa spokesman said the company's planes had been avoiding the Strait of Hormuz since Thursday. He added that Lufthansa had extended the no-fly zone over Iran on Friday, without being more specific. The airline is still serving Iran's capital, Tehran.
Netherlands flag carrier KLM was no longer flying over the Strait of Hormuz, a spokesman said on Friday, while British Airways said it would adhere to the FAA guidance and use alternative routes.
Malaysia Airlines said it was avoiding the airspace, which it had previously used on flights between Kuala Lumpur and London, Jeddah and Medina.
Qantas said it was adjusting flight paths to avoid the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman until further notice. Singapore Airlines said some flights might require longer routings to avoid the area.

On Thursday, two other U.S. carriers, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), said they did not fly over Iran. Japanese carriers Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc also said they did not fly over the area.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 11:49AM ET</span>",U.S. markets regulators reach deal on Dodd-Frank swaps capital rules,"By Michelle Price and Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. markets regulators on Friday unveiled an agreement on how much capital and margin firms must hold when trading swaps based on securities, finalizing a key piece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law introduced following the 2007-09 financial crisis.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) agreed to fend off a regulatory overlap that would have drastically increased the capital burden for many firms already operating under CFTC rules, the regulators said.
The agreement underscores an unusual degree of harmonization between the two U.S. markets watchdogs and comes amid a broader push by two appointees of U.S. President Donald Trump - SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo - to coordinate more closely on policy and enforcement matters.
Friday's announcement was a relief for the industry, which had worried the SEC's final rule could potentially put many firms out of business. 
""Moving these rules is a positive development in getting a big piece of Dodd Frank Title VII over the finish line, completing the mandate that Congress gave us,"" Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, who led the SEC rule-writing effort, said in an interview. 
Title VII of Dodd-Frank handed the CFTC oversight of the vast majority of the U.S. swaps market, including interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, but gave the SEC oversight of the small slice of the swaps market based on individual securities.
Swaps are a type of private derivative contract between two parties, typically banks, that allow investors to hedge the risk of future asset price movements, such as interest rate rises.
Dodd-Frank aims to make the swaps market safer by requiring dealers to hold sufficient capital and margin against swaps, and by pushing more swaps through clearing houses which sit in between trades to guarantee payment in case either party defaults. The CFTC implemented most of its post-crisis rules by 2014 but the SEC has lagged far behind.
The SEC first proposed capital and margin rules for swaps in 2012 but until Friday had failed to finalize them. In a move that caught the industry by surprise, the Republican-led SEC last year said it would try to finalize its Dodd-Frank regime. 
Over the past few months, the agencies have worked together to address problems with the SEC proposal. 
The SEC rule would have subjected swap trading firms already registered and regulated by the CFTC to an additional capital requirement.
Friday's compromise would place the overwhelming majority of uncleared swaps trading by CFTC-registered firms under the CFTC's capital rules, avoiding the additional SEC charge. The new rules will not become effective for at least 18 months. 
Robert Jackson, the SEC's lone Democratic commissioner, voted against the final rule because it allows firms to use internal risk models to calculate the financial cushion for their swaps. 
""Dealers maximize their profits by flirting with failure, and their risk models can be expected to reflect those incentives,"" Jackson said in a statement. 
Brian Quintenz, the Republican CFTC commissioner who led the project at the agency, told Reuters the regulators are also discussing allowing trading firms more ways to reduce margin requirements by offsetting uncleared swap hedges, a process known as ""portfolio margining.""

""Having a good regime in this area can unleash a massive amount of capital in the real economy in a way that is very respectful of risk,"" Quintenz said.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 09:35AM ET</span>",Ex-Barclays CEO Varley cleared of fraud charges,"By Iain Withers and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Former  Barclays  (LON:BARC) CEO John Varley was acquitted of fraud charges on Friday after senior judges said there was insufficient evidence against him in a case about Qatari cash injections that saved the bank from a state bailout in 2008.
The case, pursued by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), was the first time the head of a global bank has faced criminal charges over conduct during the financial crisis, when the banking system was brought to its knees and taxpayers were forced to pay billions of pounds to shore it up.
SFO prosecutors had charged Varley with two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, alleging he plotted to pay Qatar secret fees to help rescue Barclays, one of the few major British banks to survive the credit crisis without direct government aid. 
But judges at the Court of Appeal in London agreed with a lower court's ruling that the SFO's evidence against Varley, who had denied wrongdoing, was insufficient to proceed with the case.
Three other former Barclays executives charged alongside Varley are to be retried at a date yet to be determined. 
Prosecutors alleged the four men misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that the bank paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar during a two-part 11 billion pound ($14 billion) emergency fundraising in June and October 2008. 
Roger Jenkins, the former Barclays chairman of investment management in the Middle East, ex-wealth management head Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, who headed the corporate finance business, also deny any wrongdoing. 
The case is seen as a major test of the SFO, which has been investigating the events leading up to Qatar's investment since 2012, and has faced criticism over its difficulties in holding senior bankers to account. 
The taxpayer-funded investigator and prosecutor won praise from some politicians and lawyers in 2017 for filing criminal fraud charges against Barclays itself and the senior executives after a five-year investigation. 
But Varley's acquittal follows a separate court decision to also dismiss the charges against the bank in 2018.
Varley, an Oxford-educated former lawyer, stood down as Barclays CEO in 2011 and has spent most of the years since embroiled in the SFO probe. 
He joined the bank in 1982, and after 12 years in investment banking, going on to head its asset management division and retail banking. 

He became finance director in 2000 and was promoted to CEO in 2004. He stood down in 2011 when investment banker Bob Diamond took over.

56,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",The Winners and Losers From Surging Iron Ore Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- In the world of metals and mining, sometimes it’s better to sell the raw product rather than the finished one.
This seems to be a lesson for investors who chose to hold shares in ArcelorMittal rather than  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group this year. Despite nagging trade tensions and fears about global growth, Rio is up 30% in 2019, while the world’s biggest steelmaker has dropped 16%.
Global diversified miners have rewarded investors with record payouts and benefited from soaring iron-ore prices due to the supply concerns that followed Vale SA’s dam disaster in January. At the same time, Chinese mills have continued to set new production records, consuming more of the steelmaking ingredient.
Rio Tinto was carried by a “perfect storm,” said Arnaud du Plessis, a senior portfolio manager at CPR Asset Management in Paris, citing iron ore’s gains of about 75% in a year, the star performer among commodities. “Rio, which is highly exposed to iron ore and which benefits from very low production costs, has been the clear winner.” The London-based miner draws investors because of its strong balance sheet and high free cash flow generation, he said.
The gains might not be over. Jefferies analysts including Christopher LaFemina said in a June 12 note that Chinese iron-ore inventories continue to dwindle and should reach critically low levels in the second half of the year. Further economic stimulus from the Asian giant is also likely to support demand, with Rio Tinto among the main beneficiaries, they said.
Iron ore scaled new highs this week after Rio Tinto cut its production guidance, piling more pressure on supplies despite Vale’s authorization to restart a shuttered site.
Weak Autos
The forces that have made Rio Tinto a winner have partly been the cause of ArcelorMittal’s woes. The rising cost of its key raw material have pressured the steelmaker’s margins, while higher production in China and U.S. tariffs on imports have pushed European manufacturers into overcapacity, further weighing on prices.
Du Plessis noted that U.S. steel prices have fallen by more than 40% over the past year. “As a highly leveraged company, ArcelorMittal has not been in a good position at all,” he said. “As it’s highly exposed to the automotive market, the weak environment for that industry over the recent period has also affected ArcelorMittal.”
ArcelorMittal has responded by cutting production, while the industry is lobbying the European Commission for further safeguard measures to stop cheaper Chinese steel from flooding the market. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Eugene King this month upgraded European steelmakers, saying margins are showing signs of inflection, while a decline in iron ore prices could provide further relief.
A positive outcome in China-U.S. trade talks planned around the G-20 meeting in Japan at the end of June could be the ultimate catalyst steelmakers need to start outperforming again. Further dovishness from central banks could also support global growth, as well as a recovery in the carmaking industry, among the biggest consumers of steel materials.
“Trade war resolution will be key for the rest of the year,” said Du Plessis. The fund manager prefers Rio Tinto over ArcelorMittal as long as the crisis remains unresolved. Under a positive outcome, ArcelorMittal could outperform initially, with Rio Tinto lagging behind it, especially after its recent outperformance, he said.
ArcelorMittal’s current trading levels suggests it may be an attractive value proposition, offering 46% return potential over 12 months, according to the consensus of analysts tracked by Bloomberg. In contrast, the average analyst consensus sees Rio Tinto as fairly priced. The problem might be that at the moment, few investors are keen to bet on value."
57,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",Large Exxon Shareholder Starts Divesting Over Climate Change,"(Bloomberg) -- One of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).‘s largest shareholders, Legal & General Group (LON:LGEN) Plc, has divested 19 of its funds from the company and will ask its clients if it can withdraw more money, saying the oil and gas producer isn’t adequately addressing climate change.
Exxon is the only oil major Legal & General is divesting, as competitors including  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc meet or exceed the insurer’s basic standards on climate change action. It would also use its remaining shareholding in the company to vote next year against the reappointment of the chairman, a role currently held by Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.
Big Oil investors have engaged with companies about their response to climate change for years, but major shareholders have rarely escalated those discussions this far. The divestment affects a small portion of the Exxon’s equity -- Legal & General owns about 0.6% of the company, and the divesting funds hold just a fraction of that -- but intensifies pressure on the Irving, Texas-based firm.
It’s also a blow to the wider oil industry, which was already losing its luster compared to hotter sectors like tech. If more investors were to follow suit Exxon could see its share price, which has fallen about 5% in the past year, weaken further.
Divestment is a way to “hold Exxon accountable for something that’s really material for their future,” said Meryam Omi, head of sustainability at Legal & General Investment Management, which oversees more than $1 trillion. “People in the street who have their own pension that’s going to mature in 30 years time don’t get a chance to talk to Exxon themselves.”
Exxon is the largest of 11 companies that Legal & General said it will exclude from its “Future World” funds because of climate change risk. Others include MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET)., Subaru Corp.,  Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL).,  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY). and Rosneft PJSC. Two companies it withdrew capital from last year for the same reason, Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). and Dominion Energy Inc., will be added back to the funds because they addressed concerns raised by the insurer.
While standards differ by sector, Legal & General said it expects oil and gas companies to set targets to cut pollution in their own operations as a bare minimum. It also wants the company to disclose the volume of greenhouse gas emissions its operations and customers are responsible for each year.
“We’re on track to meet greenhouse gas reduction measures we announced last year which are expected to help significantly to improve emissions performance,” Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email. “They include a 15% decrease in methane emissions and a 25% reduction in flaring by 2020.”
Exxon already publishes an annual tally of emissions from its operations and is “providing solutions to consumers to help them reduce their emissions,” Silvestri wrote.
Several other companies are “on the cusp” of divestment when it comes to climate action, according to Sacha Sadan, the director of corporate governance at the insurer’s investment unit, without saying which ones. And even those that were named as particularly strong on sustainability compared to their peers, such as Equinor ASA and French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA, will be expected to continuously move their businesses away from polluting activities or risk being divested.
“This engagement is not about picking up the laggards, it’s about pushing up the whole industry,” said Omi. “We need to keep the pressure on.”
Returns at Legal & General’s Future World funds will suffer very little as a result of the divestments, Omi said. The difference between what the funds would return without divesting and what they will return otherwise, which she called a “tracking error,” will be less than 0.3%.
The insurer is hoping to convince all clients to follow its advice around companies lagging in climate action, partly by demonstrating it doesn’t sacrifice returns. That could lead to further capital outflows.
Still, veering away from companies that are performing well is a major departure from its peers and Legal & General’s own past. The insurer has held Exxon stock for about 20 years, and it’s the asset manager’s seventh-largest equity holding overall, worth about $2 billion at the end of March. Since the day it started its investment in Exxon, the shares have returned 200% in total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

Europe’s economy showed signs of stabilizing at the end of the second quarter, but weak sentiment will keep policy makers on edge about the outlook for the rest of the year.
Days after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi made it clear the ECB is poised to cut interest rates or re-launch asset purchases if the region’s economic outlook doesn’t improve, the monthly Purchasing Managers Index showed a pickup in activity, rising to a seven-month high. German bonds declined and the euro rose.
It’s a “hint that the worst of the current slowdown may be behind,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMI.
The mood was tempered by the fact that expansion remains lackluster, price growth is subdued and executive optimism in the outlook is the lowest in almost five years. Uncertainty about trade and geopolitics is weighing heavily on sentiment, and a continued drop could drag on investment and hiring in the euro area. An ECB paper this week said that “confidence shocks” have had a negative effect on investment this year.
The report also showed that manufacturing -- led by Germany -- continues to contract and remains the region’s weak spot, while services are a pillar of stability. Policy makers are closely watching the divergence between the two sectors, and the worry is that the weakness will spread.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The European Central Bank will welcome the composite PMI survey reading for June. It signals that GDP growth was stable in the second quarter and the service sector remained relatively immune to the weakness in manufacturing. Today’s report does little to increase the chances of monetary easing.”
--David Powell, European EconomistClick here to read the full REACT
Germany manufacturing contracted for a fifth month in June, though Markit noted “tentative signs” that the worst has passed. Europe’s largest economy has suffered in particular from weaker car sales, as well as a drop in semiconductor demand. Siltronic AG this week cut its full-year sales forecast, citing “geopolitical uncertainties” and the impact of U.S. export restrictions against Chinese technology firms.
In France, both the manufacturing and services readings performed better than forecast in June.
German 10-year yields rose slightly on Friday and were at -0.296% as of 11:10 a.m. Frankfurt time. They’ve been below zero since early May, pushed lower by a weaker global backdrop and the prospect of more monetary easing.
“For the ECB, this PMI will surely have come as an encouraging sign, but as manufacturing weakness remains significant, it is unlikely to impact the state of high alert in Frankfurt,” said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING in Amsterdam."

The last glimmer of positive yields on German bonds is in danger of being snuffed out.
Thirty-year yields turning negative would be a first among major bond markets, with a global rally already having sent all of Germany’s out to 20 years below zero. It may only take a further deterioration in trade relations between the U.S. and China, a flare-up of political risk or more hints of stimulus from the European Central Bank to turn the whole curve negative.
The impact could be far reaching. It may mean that insurers and pension funds are forced into buying negative-yielding debt, due to the need to maintain portfolios with high credit ratings. It will also push traders into more risky securities such as Italian, corporate or emerging-market debt to chase yields. And it’s another signal for Europe’s so-called “Japanification” where growth, inflation and bond yields stay depressed long-term.
“If you had asked me just two weeks ago about the prospect of 30-year German yields going below zero, I would have taken a couple of days to get over the laughing fit,” said Luke Hickmore, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Now, we seem to have transitioned to a completely different market environment with yields set to test more eye-watering lows and negative levels around the world. The significance is massive.”
The amount of bonds globally with negative yields surged to a record $12.5 trillion this week after ECB President Mario Draghi gave the clearest signal yet that the institution is weighing up interest-rate cuts and quantitative easing. He has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve and others in mooting renewed stimulus on the growing threats to global economic growth.
Germany only has six conventional securities out of 57 left that offer a positive yield in its 750 billion euro ($846 billion) market, all maturing in more than 20 years. This will make it harder for Europe’s economic powerhouse to resist boosting fiscal expenditure, since it effectively gets paid to do so, at a time when the European Commission is battling with Italy to reign in its spending.
“If that would not encourage them to borrow more and spend, I’m not sure what will,” said Kacper Brzezniak, a money manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. “Frankly, right now, if I was the German finance ministry, I would issue bunds and buy Italian bonds.”
Giffen Good
Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International Plc, described German 30-year bonds as a “giffen good,” defined as a product that people consume more of as the price rises. Investors who follow a benchmark index are likely to buy German bonds, while others may only be permitted to buy securities with a positive yield.
“For those investors who are mandated to hold a certain proportion of German paper, and particularly those who cannot buy negative-yielding paper, they have an ever narrowing window in which to buy,” Chatwell said. “Some real-money investors may well be forced to buy this scarce commodity of positive-yielding German paper.”
German 30-year yields currently provide a yield of 0.29%, having touched the lowest level on record this week. By comparison U.S. 30-year yields are at 2.54% and Italy’s still offer above 3%. Market pricing using options implies a roughly one-in-three chance that German 30-year yields will drop into negative territory over the next year, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Negative Europe
That would be one step further than Japan, where yields on 30-year bonds have never turned negative, touching a low of 0.02% in 2016 and offering 0.34% now. Only Switzerland has seen an entire yield curve in negative territory, but the size of its debt market is less than a 10th of Germany. The whole yield curve in Denmark is also close to going negative.
The Netherlands may follow, with its 10-year yields already negative. The equivalent French, Finnish and Austrian bond yields all dipped below zero this week. The growing stock of debt below zero may mean that insurers have to be stress tested for the impact of negative rates under the European Union’s Solvency II regulations in the future.
“There are many liability-driven investors in the world who are trying to buy long duration assets, and are finding that they still do not have enough,” said Aberdeen’s Hickmore.

“I am looking at that,” Trump said in an interview with “Noticias Telemundo.” Trump also said he had “already created a minimum wage because wages have gone up more than anybody in many decades right now” as a result of the strong economy.
Democratic presidential candidates have embraced protests by workers calling for a higher minimum wage and more protection from workplace harassment, and U.S. House Democrats are building support for a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 but a number of states and localities have adopted higher rates.
Democratic candidates -- Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Representative Beto O’Rourke -- last week joined a demonstrating McDonald’s Corp. workers in Las Vegas. Earlier this month, Senator Bernie Sanders attended Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.’s annual shareholder meeting to call for increased wages for the retailer’s 1.5 million workers.
Trump has given a number of contradictory statements on whether he would support increasing the federal minimum wage.
In 2015, Trump said he wanted to “keep the minimum wage pretty much where it is right now” in an interview with MSNBC, and two months later told Fox News that a New York proposal to raise its lowest wage to $15 an hour was “too high.” But in November and December of that year, Trump said wages were “too low” and told Fox News he supported a $15 hourly wage.
The following year, Trump said alternatively that he did not support any federal minimum wage and that he supported raising the federal level to $10 an hour."

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS has instructed its senior managers to prioritize concerns raised by its rich clients from China, after a bank economist's ""Chinese pig"" comment in connection with food price inflation in the country kicked up a row, sources said.
The reference to pigs was made in an inflation analysis podcast by UBS global chief economist Paul Donovan, who has since been put on a leave of absence by the bank as it reviews the matter. The podcast too has been taken down.
The Swiss private banking giant has asked its senior client advisers to call or even meet customers from China, a key market for UBS, to explain its position on the remark and actions taken so far, the people told Reuters.
""That's the priority for all the senior RMs (relationship managers) and managers in Hong Kong and Singapore now, just to make sure the clients don't get swayed by the reactions mostly in the social media,"" one of the people said.
""Most of the clients understand and appreciate the actions the bank has taken and they are not going to drop the bank over this, but they do ask questions.""
These efforts come after some industry participants rejected UBS' apology last week for Donovan's remarks, criticizing it for a lack of cultural awareness and calling for a boycott.
Donovan had said in the podcast that consumer prices in China had risen mainly due to sickness among pigs. ""Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China,"" he added, in comments some took offence at because of a perceived reference to people.
UBS lost a lead role on a U.S. dollar bond deal for state-backed China Railway Construction Corp this week, and according to a bank source the decision was taken because of the controversy over the comment.
But UBS has not yet seen any Chinese private banking client exits as a result of the controversy, one of the people said.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the banking sector regulator, has also contacted UBS over the incident and asked the bank to keep it informed about the internal investigation, another person said, without giving details.
HKMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for UBS in Hong Kong declined to comment.
China is one of the most important markets for UBS, where the bank's offerings include asset management, and investment and private banking. UBS was the first, in November, to win approval to control its onshore securities joint ventures.
Bulk of the assets managed by private banks in Asia comes from China that mints two new billionaires every week. With $357 billion of assets, UBS was the top wealth manager in Asia last year, as per Asian Private Banker league table.

UBS saw net new money inflows of $16.3 billion in Asia Pacific over January-March, versus $3.2 billion in Switzerland and $2.9 billion in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

64,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",UBS Seeks to Defuse ‘Chinese Pig’ Outcry in Regulator Meetings,"(Bloomberg) -- UBS Group AG is taking steps to ensure its head start over competitors in China isn’t jeopardized by controversial comments by a senior economist that already cost the firm at least one bond deal.
In meetings with Chinese regulators this week, senior Asia-based executives said that economist Paul Donovan’s use of the phrase “Chinese pig” in an analysis of swine flu wasn’t meant to be derogatory, people with knowledge of the matter said, adding that the incident was discussed in previously scheduled meetings on licensing. Regulators responded that UBS should take extra care with the language it uses in research, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.
UBS executives came away from the discussions with the impression that the firm’s China business would avoid a material hit from regulators, the people said.
The meetings suggest a measured response by Chinese authorities after Donovan’s comments sparked a social-media outcry but were interpreted by some observers as innocuous. While China’s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission has informally advised government-run companies to temporarily suspend hiring UBS for deals, it has stopped short of issuing a ban, people familiar with the matter said.
UBS has been quick to capitalize on China’s moves to further open its financial markets, last year becoming the first global bank to get permission to take a majority stake in an existing onshore securities joint venture. The firestorm over Donovan’s comments, made in a regular audio note, illustrates the balancing act foreign investment banks face in China at a time of heightened political tensions globally, with domestic rivals willing to seize on any missteps.
China Railway Construction Corp., a state-owned infrastructure company, excluded the bank from a bond sale last week. UBS expects to lose a few more debt mandates for smaller government-run companies, but the roles are junior and the loss of fees negligible, a person familiar with the firm said.
“Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig,” Donovan said in his audio commentary, which was emailed last week. “It matters if you like eating pork in China. It does not really matter to the rest of the world. China does not export a lot of food. The only global relevance would be if Chinese inflation influenced politics and other policies.”
A spokesman for UBS, which publicly apologized for Donovan’s remarks and put him on leave, declined to comment. SASAC didn’t reply to a faxed request for comment. Last week, an association representing Chinese-owned securities firms in Hong Kong called for UBS to dismiss those involved.
UBS raised its stake in UBS Securities Co., the local joint venture, to 51% in December. Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti has already moved to take advantage of winning control, beefing up the ranks of senior executives at the JV. For UBS, already the world’s largest private bank, the swelling ranks of millionaires in China represents a huge untapped business opportunity.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., Nomura Holdings Inc. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have also bought majority stakes in their Chinese JVs or started taking steps to do so. In about two years, China is expected to let foreign banks purchase full ownership -- a move that may spur them to pour more resources into their local operations.

Huawei consumer business group's smartphone product line president He Gang revealed the numbers at a launch event in Wuhan, China for its new Nova 5 phone. The phone is powered by Huawei's new 7-nanometer chipset Kirin 810. 
Huawei has been hit by devastating curbs ordered by Washington, which threatens to cripple its supply chain.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Nearly three weeks after Chinese regulators took over troubled Baoshang Bank, a mid-sized mutual fund house in Beijing suddenly became unable to borrow cash in the interbank market and was forced to default on some products. 
Around the same time, Great Wall West China Bank, a regional lender in Sichuan province, set out to sell negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) - usually a routine fundraising tool for small lenders - but was only able to raise a tenth of its targeted amount.
Both examples highlight increasing distrust in China's interbank market as smaller banks, asset managers and brokerages find their creditworthiness questioned in the wake of the takeover of Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang.
Fund managers and traders say they are worried about the prospect of further defaults in interbank borrowing as well as more troubled banks coming to light.
""As the old saying goes, when you see one cockroach, you will discover a swarm of them,"" said Liu Haiying, founder of Shanghai-based Haiying Investment and author of the book ""China's Huge Debts"".
""Worryingly, Baoshang Bank is likely that first cockroach.""
Particularly shocking for the market has been the government's decision to only guarantee the principal for interbank deposits with Baoshang worth 50 million yuan ($7.3 million) or less, shattering a widely held belief in full government guarantees for such assets.
Short-term interbank lending rates have spiked to as high as 15% this month from more normal levels of around 3.5%.
""The liquidity stress we're witnessing now is rooted in concerns over insolvency, which is very difficult to cope with,"" said Liu, adding that while authorities were right to try to clean up problems, they risked creating chaos in the financial system.
Many small lenders rely on short-term borrowings for long-term investments and surging financing costs could hit their returns or force them to liquidate assets. That in turn could further strain liquidity conditions in a market that is also a key fundraising channel for smaller fund houses and brokerages.
FUNDING WOES
The Beijing-based fund house, New China Fund Management, told clients on June 12 it needed to sell assets after defaulting on several products, according to a letter it sent that was reviewed by Reuters.
Asked about the letter's contents, the fund house said in an emailed statement it was ""obliged to take active measures to flag and reduce risks"". It has not publicly disclosed the size of the default or whether it has made repayments.
Controlled by Hengtai Securities Co Ltd, New China Fund ranked 62nd in terms of assets among 124 Chinese mutual fund houses as of March 31, according to fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
Great Wall West China Bank, which has an investment grade credit rating of AA, had sought to raise 500 million yuan ($73 million), according to an interbank market statement. It offered a 3.9% yield on one-year deposits, above the 3.25% offered by issuers of NCDs with top-notch AAA+ ratings.
An official at Great Wall West China's capital markets department said the lender had had contingency measures in place and was not suffering from a liquidity shortage.
It is not the only lender to be disappointed.
Estimates by CITIC Securities showed issuers of NCDs with a second-tier investment rating of AA+ or lower raised on average only 15% of their fund-raising targets this month, compared with over 70% before the Baoshang Bank takeover in May.
Wang Ming, a product supervisor at Hua Chuang Securities' trading department, said investors are thoroughly re-assessing counterparty risks and demanding higher-quality collateral.
""Interbank lending used to be a no-brainer. But now, it has become very difficult to borrow money if you pledge securities rated AA+ or below."" 
The China Banking Association declined to comment.
Regulators have said the Baoshang takeover was necessary to stave off risks to the financial system and have tried to limit the fallout, urging larger lenders not to starve smaller players of cash. The central bank has also pumped money into the market. 
Over the past week, the central bank and securities regulator have held meetings with brokerages and mutual fund houses, urging them to support each other rather than blindly blacklisting counterparties.
In one such gathering, regulators put it bluntly: ""If mutual distrust keeps spreading, it will eventually evolve into systemic financial risks,"" according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
For many China experts, the Baoshang takeover is the first shot in a new campaign by Beijing to reduce excessive leverage in the banking system and curb reckless interbank lending. It follows a slew of 'deleveraging' policies between 2016 and 2018 that targeted the shadow banking sector and off-balance-sheet investments.
They also see Beijing's move as a precursor to consolidation in an industry with more than 4,000 players and where smaller lenders account for a quarter of the sector's assets.
Many of those smaller banks have been expanding aggressively, using cash raised via NCDs. Proceeds are channeled into riskier but higher-yielding investments, such as corporate bonds, or even local government pet projects.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Friday, as worries about a threatened U.S. military strike against Iran and a global trade conflict took the edge off a central bank-induced rally from earlier in the week.
The New York Times said U.S. President Donald Trump approved military strikes against Iran on Friday in retaliation for the downing of an unmanned surveillance drone, then pulled back from launching the attacks. 
Iranian officials told Reuters on Friday that Tehran had received a message from U.S. President Donald Trump through Oman warning that a U.S. attack on Iran was imminent.
Worries over possible military strikes persist, and the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell from a seven-week high, driven mostly by weakness in Asian stocks. A rally by European stocks also faded, though a pan-European index was higher on the day. 
"" ... Market risk hasn't been switched off, it's merely gone dim,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets. ""However, it does appear equity markets are tired and may be suffering from a bit of a hangover after partying it up to post FOMC.""
A Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting this week opened the door to rate cuts in the United States. 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.15%. The index was still up nearly 4% on the week, during which it reached its highest level since May 8.
The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5%, Australian stocks declined 0.6% and Japan's Nikkei shed 0.8%.
The promise of rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has kept sentiment strong in stock markets. Wall Street rose to record highs overnight, with the S&P 500 gaining nearly a percent. 
But tensions remain elevated, and safe-haven gold advanced to a six-year high of $1,410.78 an ounce on Friday, boosted by the geopolitical tensions and the prospect of a U.S. rate cut. At one stage, gold was up nearly 5% on the week. 
""While lower real rates in the U.S. and globally make gold more attractive, the metal is being increasingly viewed as a cardinal asset to hedge against the scrim of unpredictability like the fear of recession and war,"" Innes said.
Meanwhile, China and the United States are set to resume trade talks before Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet next week in Japan. Hopes of an agreement grew after the two leaders talked by telephone call, but neither side has signaled a shift from positions that led to an impasse last month.
The Fed's signal that rate cuts were likely brought some relief, but also raised the specter of a global currency war. 
On Friday, the dollar fell against a basket of six major currencies to a two-week low of 96.495. The index has shed roughly 1% this week.
The dollar has fallen 1.35% versus the yen this week, reaching a six-month low of 107.045 yen on Friday.

In oil markets, U.S. crude oil futures were up 0.46% at $57.33 per barrel. They had surged more than 5% the previous day after Iran shot down the U.S. drone.

69,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>",StockBeat - Natixis Falls Again on Jitters Over Fund Liquidity,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- One of the legacies of the last financial crisis has been the acute sensitivity of investors to anything that smells like liquidity risk.
That sensitivity has been in full view in France in the last two days, where  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) has fallen nearly 12% after reports that it has more exposure than seems wise to illiquid corporate bonds, most of them issued by companies linked to Lars Windhorst, a German financier with a chequered past.
The French investment bank and asset manager was down another 2.3% by mid-morning in Paris Friday, the worst performing of any European bank, after a conference call with investors in which management tried to assuage their fears - apparently without much success.
By contrast, the CAC 40 benchmark was up 0.5%, close to a new high for the year, ahead of all other European indexes except Spain’s IBEX 35. All markets have been following the U.S. higher since the Federal Reserve signalled a willingness to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy slows any further.
Natixis’ problems started on Wednesday, when the Financial Times reported that its fund management arm H2O had amassed over 1.4 billion euros ($1.56 billion) in bonds issued by companies controlled by Windhorst, spread across several funds. They got much worse on Thursday when advisory firm Morningstar suspended its rating on one of those funds, Allegro, citing concerns about the liquidity of some of its holdings.
The sums involved may seem small – H2o Allegro Eur-r C has only 2.26 billion euros in assets under management according to data compiled by Investing.com – but the news comes at an awkward time. It’s only two weeks since Neil Woodford, a high-profile U.K. stock-picker, was forced to “gate” one of his flagship funds to protect it against a firesale of assets to meet redemption requests. Woodford, too, had made unsuccessful bets on assets that proved hard to sell.  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), an investment platform which had aggressively promoted Woodford's funds to retail investors, has fallen over 15% since the start of the month.
It’s also less than a year since high-flying GAM (SIX:GAMH), the Swiss-based asset manager carved out of Bank Julius Baer, fired fund manager Tim Haywood and wound down his Absolute Return Bond Fund after similar mis-steps.
But the real reason the market’s heart skips a beat after such incidents is the memory of 2007, when two obscure funds run out of France suddenly ran into liquidity problems, forcing the ECB into an emergency injection of liquidity into the money market and marking the start of a process that was to end with the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year later.
There’s no suggestion that Natixis’ problems have any systemic dimension at all. But the response to the incident is a sobering reminder of how fragile sentiment is, for all that the U.S. S&P 500 hit a new record high on Thursday."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn chose chip-unit boss Liu Young-way as chairman on Friday to succeed Terry Gou, who is preparing to contest Taiwan's presidential elections next year. 
Liu was tipped to take over from Gou, who told Reuters in April that he planned to step down to pave the way for younger talent to move up the ranks of the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer.
Earlier on Friday, Gou told the company's annual general meeting (AGM) in Taipei he will hand over the running of the company to a newly formed nine-member operations committee. Gou retained a seat on the board of the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd.
The change of guard comes as Foxconn - with its big factories in China and large roster of U.S. clients - navigates a trade war between Washington and Beijing. 
But Liu's appointment does not portend big changes in strategy and Gou is likely to keep control of the company he founded 45 years ago, analysts have said.
The handover to Liu is only a formality, said a Taipei-based analyst, who declined to be identified due to Taiwan's trading regulations.
""Gou is still a director ... he can still control much of Hon Hai. He can still give advice or reject proposals,"" the analyst said.
Foxconn said nearly 3,000 shareholders, employees and supporters attended the AGM. Thousands braved the heat to watch a live broadcast of the meeting on big screens outside Foxconn's headquarters, while scores of employees lined up to welcome Gou and Liu inside. 
""In the next four years I want to contribute what I gathered in the past 40 years to (Taiwan),"" said Gou, who was wearing an orchid garland and a dark suit. 
""Give me four years, and give Taiwan a chance of survival.""
Taiwan's election is set to take place amid a period of increasing tensions between Beijing and Taipei, with Gou seeking to represent the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party.
His election bid might be weighed down by his ties to a Chinese leadership that refuses to renounce the use of force to unify with self-ruled Taiwan it considers a wayward province, analysts have said.
Gou, 68, is Taiwan's richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.
Foxconn shares closed down 1.2% on Friday, compared with the flat broader market.
""GET ELECTED!""
""Terry Gou get elected!"" employees chanted and threw flowers as he ended his speech and walked out of the company's offices. 
Scores of police were on standby outside the headquarters, where supporters stood next to dozens of protesters who questioned Gou's policy over labor rights and wages.
Placards saying ""young people are poor - can't afford to buy house, to get married and to have kids"" intermingled with signs calling Gou ""the hope for the youth"".
In his speech, Gou criticized the state of Taiwan's economy, saying growth had hit a bottleneck.
Taiwan's economic growth has slowed, hurt by shrinking global tech demand and the tariff war between its two largest trading partners, China and the United States.
The island's central bank again cut its 2019 economic growth forecast on Thursday after export orders fell for a seventh straight month.
TRADE ANGLE 
Liu, 63, has led Foxconn's nascent semiconductor business, dubbed the S sub-group, since 2017. He gained great trust since joining as a special assistant to Gou in 2007, a source told Reuters in May.
After the AGM, he told Reuters that the company had no plan to increase production capacity outside China at the moment and that he was not aware of client requests for Foxconn to shift part of its production outside China.
Investors are keen to know whether Foxconn will adjust its production line for Apple and others. The Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple has asked its main suppliers to assess the cost implications of moving part of their production capacity from China to Southeast Asia. 
Foxconn said last week it had enough capacity outside China to meet Apple's demand in the American market if the need should arise for the iPhone maker to adjust its production lines due to the U.S.-China trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap further tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods from China, where the bulk of Apple's devices are assembled. The country is also a key market for the firm.

Gou met with Trump in May and sought U.S. support to boost Taiwan's tech industry. He vowed to be a ""peacemaker"" for China, the United States and Taiwan, if he wins.

(Reuters) - Upbeat data and rising oil prices helped European stock markets eke out some marginal gains on Friday, offsetting another jolt for chipmakers from the fallout of a U.S. ban on trading with Huawei Technologies. 
At the end of a week that has seen European markets gain around 2%, and bond yields and the euro sink, escalating tensions between Washington and Iran also gave investors reason to be cautious about pushing ahead with this month's rally. 
Helped by gains in oil prices that drove shares in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  BP  (LON:BP) and Total higher, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index was just 0.05% higher by 0800 GMT.
The benchmark index, has rallied nearly 5% so far this month, on signals from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank that they were ready to act to counter the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on a slowing global economy.
""There is probably lingering positivity from the broadly dovish central bank statements this week from the ECB and the Fed,"" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex in London.
""That rally maybe running out of steam a little bit but it seems to be keeping the indexes in the green.""
Investors will now look to a G20 summit in Japan next week for progress from the United States and China on resolving the differences that drove the worst monthly performance in European stock markets in more than two years in May.
Frankfurt's Dax recouped early losses to trade 0.21% higher after a survey on Friday showed higher activity in Germany's services and manufacturing sector edged higher in June, suggesting that growth in Europe's biggest economy has stabilized at a moderate pace in the second quarter.
Other surveys showed French business activity strengthened more than expected in June, and euro zone business activity picked up a touch this month.
""Both the French and German figures were better than expected but also firmly in contraction territory,"" said Campbell.
The technology index fell 0.4%, and was among the biggest fallers, as British wafer maker IQE Plc warned it would report lower-than-expected revenue in 2019, citing the impact of the Huawei ban. 
Semiconductor companies were the hardest hit with Infineon, AMS and STMicroelectronics, Siltronic, Dialog Semiconductor dropping between 1.2% and 3.2%.

Openwork and St James's Place pulled separate mandates from Woodford totaling nearly four billion pounds shortly after the British fund manager suspended its 3.7 billion pound Equity Income fund on June 3.
The Woodford suspension has provoked strong reactions from British politicians and led to a probe by regulators over the fund's exposure to unlisted and illiquid stocks. Hundreds of thousands of savers invested in the fund and do not know when they will get their money back.
Openwork said in a statement that it decided to change managers in May ""as part of Omnis’ focus on delivering the best outcomes for clients and the advisers that serve them"".
It said it chose Jupiter to run the fund following a competitive selection process, and it will be run by Ben Whitmore, Jupiter's head of strategy, value equities.
Jupiter chief investment officer Stephen Pearson said in a separate statement that the asset manager's UK portfolio manager Richard Curling ""will thoroughly analyse and manage the fund’s small and unquoted holdings and, over time, bring this element of the portfolio in line with Ben's strategy"".

74,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",Europe's corporate bond market soars on ECB re-entry bets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bond investors have sent Europe's 1.7 trillion euro ($1.92 trillion) corporate debt market spiraling to record highs this week, betting the sector will be a prime beneficiary should the European Central Bank revive its asset purchase program.
Government bonds have rallied hard since Tuesday when ECB president Mario Draghi surprised investors by flagging that the bank could cut interest rates and resume bond purchases, less than six months after it ended its three-year-long stimulus scheme.
The bank seems likely to first cut interest rates, leaving Draghi's successor at the ECB to embark on asset purchases if he or she deems it necessary. Because corporate bond purchases were often considered the most effective part of quantitative easing, many predict that this is where policymakers will eventually direct their stimulus fire.
David Zahn, head of global fixed income at Franklin Templeton is among those who have bought corporate and bank capital bonds, as well as Italian and Spanish government debt in anticipation of the ECB's re-entry.
""Corporate bond purchases are the ones that work really well in my view,"" Zahn told a conference a day after Draghi's speech. ""We have been positioned for this for probably around six months.""
Zahn declined to say whether he had added to those positions after Draghi's comments, but many other investors appear to have done so.
On Tuesday, the widely-used iBoxx euro corporate bond index RIC hit a record high and enjoyed its best day since the ECB first announced corporate bond purchases in March 2016. Average yields have dropped 19 basis points this week to an all-time low of 0.76%.
(Graphic: Corporate bonds hit new record highs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RmBadS)
The iTraxx Main, a index of investment grade credit default swaps (CDS) - derivatives used to hedge exposure to a credit - slipped to its lowest level in over a year at 56.5 basis points. 
Vincent Chaigneau, head of research and investment strategy at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, a 450 billion-euro fund, also believes corporate bonds will be the ECB's first port of call. 
""I think we will see corporate bond QE this year and perhaps another round of ABS (asset-backed securities) and covered bonds purchases,"" he said. 
The ECB began the corporate sector purchase program (CSPP) in June 2016, buying between 5-6 billion euros every month up to the end of the program last year. It holds 177.8 billion euros of corporate bonds. 
One reason to expect more is that sovereign bonds are in short supply. Analysts estimate the ECB already holds 25%-30% of the euro zone debt market and is approaching a self-imposed ceiling on some governments' paper. 
""It makes sense to hold credit right now ... there's more juice in credit than in other sectors like non-core (government bonds),"" Chaigneu said. 
In 2016, inflation rose significantly after the CSPP action, with policymakers arguing that this program in particular was more effective than others because indirectly leads to more lending to small and medium enterprises. 
""I've been a relatively big fan,"" ECB ratesetter Ardo Hansson told Reuters. ""All asset purchases are not created equal. We're trying to get the enterprises and households to spend or invest a bit more."" 
The scheme resulted in sharply lower bond yield premia over sovereign debt, allowing companies access to record low funding rates. 
The fact ECB is even contemplating resuming QE shows how much the outlook for the European economy has darkened. Perversely, this leads to investors being more bullish on the European corporate sector; as the old mantra goes, bad news is good news for markets.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands dressed in black blocked Hong Kong roads and surrounded police headquarters on Friday in the latest wave of demonstrations over an extradition bill that has triggered violent protests and plunged the Chinese-ruled city into crisis. 
Demonstrators, mostly students wearing hard hats, goggles and face masks, set up roadblocks and trapped vehicles on key roads in a mostly peaceful protest to demand that embattled leader Carrie Lam, who promoted and then postponed the bill, scrap it altogether. 
""We want to fight for our freedom,"" said high school student Chan Pak-lam, 17, who was protesting in sweltering heat of about 32 degrees Celsius (90°F). 
""We want the law to be withdrawn, not suspended. I will stay here until tonight, 10 p.m. maybe. If the government doesn't respond, we will come again.""
The protests, which pose the greatest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power in 2012, once again forced the temporary closure of government offices over security concerns.

Roads that would normally be jammed with lunch-time traffic near the heart of the Asian financial center lay empty, except for a few dozen demonstrators who were reinforcing roadblocks with metal barriers. 
""Never surrender,"" echoed through the streets as the protesters chanted near police headquarters and called on police chief Stephen Lo to step down.
Police warned activists through loud hailers not to charge. 
Millions, fearing further erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms by China, have clogged the streets of the former British colony this month to rally against the bill, which would allow people to be extradited to the mainland to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
It triggered the most violent protests in decades when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowds. 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, since when it has been governed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including a much-cherished independent judiciary.
But many accuse China of obstructing democratic reforms, interfering with elections and of being behind the disappearance of five Hong Kong-based booksellers, starting in 2015, who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders.
Friday's marchers demanded that the government drop all charges against those arrested in last week's clashes, charge police with what they describe as violent action and stop referring to the protests as a riot. 
Democracy activist Joshua Wong, who walked free from prison on Monday after serving nearly five weeks for contempt of court, urged police chief Stephen Lo to speak to the protesters, while others expressed anger at police treatment. 
""SINCERE AND HUMBLE ATTITUDE""
Opponents of the bill fear the law could put them at the mercy of the mainland Chinese justice system which is plagued by torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions.
The turmoil has also raised questions over Lam's ability to govern, two years after she was selected and pledged to ""unite and move forward"".
Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng became the latest government minister to apologize over the bill.
""Regarding the controversies and disputes in society arising from the strife in the past few months, being a team member of the government, I offer my sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong,"" Cheng wrote in her blog. 
""We promise to adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements in serving the public."" 
While Lam admitted shortcomings over the bill and said she had heard the people ""loud and clear"", she has rejected repeated calls to step down. 
Concerns over the bill spread quickly, from democratic and human rights groups to the wider Hong Kong community, including pro-establishment business figures, some usually loath to contradict the government. Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore.
Protesters had gathered early on Friday outside government offices before marching towards police headquarters. One activist read a letter of support from a Taiwan student. 
""Brave HKers, perhaps when faced with adversity, we are all fragile and small, but please do not give up defending everything that you love,"" the protester read through a loud hailer to applause.
Beijing has never renounced the use of force to take over self-ruled Taiwan, which it regards as a recalcitrant, breakaway province. Many have waved Taiwan flags at recent demonstrations in Hong Kong, images certain to rile authorities in Beijing. 
Taiwan, overwhelmingly opposed to a ""one country, two systems"" formula for itself, has voiced support for Hong Kong. 

After promises that post-handover Hong Kong should enjoy a high degree of autonomy, Beijing's squeeze has fueled widespread resentment and in 2014 sparked pro-democracy protests that paralyzed parts of the city for 79 days.

BASRA, Iraq/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Just weeks ago, U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) looked poised to move ahead with a $53 billion project to boost Iraq's oil output at its southern fields, a milestone in the company's ambitions to expand in the country.
But now a combination of contractual wrangling and security concerns, heightened by escalating tensions between Iraq's bigger neighbor Iran and the United States, has conspired to hold back a deal, according to Iraqi government officials.
The negotiations have been stymied by terms of the contract that Baghdad objects to, said four Iraqi officials involved in the discussions who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The main sticking point, they said, was the means by which Exxon proposed to recoup its development costs, with the company aiming to share the oil produced by two fields - something Iraq opposes, saying it encroaches on state ownership of production.
One of the Iraqi negotiators said Baghdad would not sign anything with the current terms proposed by Exxon.
ExxonMobil declined to comment on the terms of the contract or the negotiations, with a spokeswoman in Texas saying: ""As a matter of practice, we don't comment on commercial discussions.""
The deputy oil minister for upstream affairs, Fayadh Nema, said on Wednesday that talks were ongoing and he expected a deal soon.
The negotiations have also been held up by two separate evacuations of Exxon staff from Iraq, a result of escalating regional tension between the United States and Iran.
The first was in May after hundreds of U.S. embassy staff were sent home over unspecified security threats from Iran, which backs a number of Shi'ite armed groups in Iraq. The second was this week following a rocket attack thought to have targeted the company which local officials blamed on Iran-backed militias.
Tehran has not commented on the attacks, but the evacuations highlighted the persistent instability in Iraq that is hindering business, fueled by the U.S.-Iran tensions.
Iraq one of the only nations in the world to have friendly relations with both Washington and Tehran; the arch-enemies are its two biggest allies and Baghdad is caught in the middle as they vie for influence in the country.
Many Iraqi officials say the stalling of talks with Exxon and disruptions to its staffing point to the limits of American power in Iran's smaller neighbor, and that U.S.-Iran tensions have led to a series of security incidents including unclaimed attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf.
""Exxon pulled its staff from Iraq in response to regional unrest. The question is how they will run a $53 billion project with constant regional instability,"" said an Iraqi oil official who oversees foreign companies' operations in the south. ""They might abandon work again and that will hurt our energy sector."" 
CONTRACT WRANGLES
Iraq is the second-largest oil exporter in OPEC and has long-term aims to boost output curtailed by decades of war and sanctions. Such projects are among the most valuable prizes in the world for international oil companies. 
An initial agreement would be a boost for Exxon's plans to expand in Iraq. Under the deal, it would build a water treatment facility and pipelines needed to boost oil output capacity. It would also get the rights to develop at least two southern oilfields - Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi.
In May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the deal with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi twice in three days, during a telephone call and a surprise visit to Baghdad, a separate Iraqi government official told Reuters.
Mahdi said last month that Iraq was close to signing the $53 billion, 30-year energy agreement with project leader Exxon and its partner for the deal, PetroChina.
But the officials who shared details with Reuters over the proposals from the American oil major said there were differences between the two parties that could prevent even a preliminary agreement anytime soon. 
Exxon has proposed a production-sharing agreement whereby it recoups its development costs by sharing the output of the Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi fields with the government. 
However Iraq has largely opposed such contracts and over the past decade has favored so-called service contracts where companies are paid at a fixed dollar-per-barrel rate. 
""We told them that we totally reject any production-sharing mechanism as it contradicts government energy policy,"" said an official who is part of the negotiating team. 
The official added it was too early to say what kind of contract Iraq would favor. The country has also in the past struck infrastructure deals with investment contracts where companies take a slice of profits.
Another official involved in the talks said Exxon's production-sharing model included a proposal to sell some Iraqi crude itself, rather then through the state oil marketer SOMO, a plan the government strongly rejected.
POLARIZING OIL DEAL
Relations between Washington and Tehran have deteriorated since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew last year from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers agreed by his predecessor Barack Obama, and reimposed and extended sanctions.
The complications facing the Exxon deal have come against the backdrop of a rapid escalation in recent weeks, with Tehran rejecting accusations by Washington it was behind attacks on oil tankers and facilities in the Gulf. 
Tensions reached further heights this week when Iran shot down a U.S. military drone that it said was on a spy mission over its territory, an incident that fanned fears of wider military conflict in the Middle East. Trump said on Thursday that Iran had made ""a very big mistake"".
In a sign of the frustrations felt by Baghdad, Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said in May that Exxon's decision to evacuate all its foreign staff from the country then was ""unacceptable and unjustified"".
He said it was a political move rather than a genuine security precaution, without elaborating, and that it had hampered the dealmaking.
""Now they are out of the country, why should I run after them?"" he said at the time. 
Exxon did not comment on Ghadhban's characterization of its temporary evacuation of Basra staff as ""political"". 
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether U.S. Iran policy might have affected the deal.
The tussle for influence in Iraq between Washington and Tehran is reflected in Iraqi politics, with the proposed $53 billion deal a polarizing issue.
Basma Baseem, an Iraqi lawmaker and a member of the parliament energy committee said Iraq should push forward with the deal with Exxon to help Iraq develop its energy sector.
""It's a major company with billions of dollar of assets and investments across the world and a cutting edge expertise in the oil industry,"" she added. ""Iraq can benefit significantly from this large deal."" 
However politicians from Iran-aligned Shi'ite Muslim parties portray the deal as extortion, calling it ""a new occupation"" by the United States.
""The government is under a lot of pressure from the Americans to sign long-term energy and power deals,"" said lawmaker Kareem Alewi of the Iranian-backed Badr Organization, one of the Iraqi parliament's two biggest groupings. 

""This is a trick to control our economy.""

79,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 01:20AM ET</span>",Malaysia aims to recover about $5 billion in 1MDB-linked assets,"By Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is looking to recover about $5 billion worth of foreign assets linked to state fund 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then prime minister Najib Razak and the subject of money laundering probes, an anti-graft official said on Friday.
Malaysian and U.S. investigators believe about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) by high-level officials of the fund and associates between 2009 and 2014.
But many of the assets sought by investigators may have since increased in value, and include those linked to 1MDB's former subsidiary SRC International, Azam Baki, a deputy commissioner at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters. 
""The amount is about $5 billion...in many countries, all related to 1MDB,"" said Azam, adding a separate taskforce will be set up to recover the assets.
At least six countries, including Singapore and Switzerland, are investigating alleged graft and money laundering at 1MDB. SRC is also the subject of graft and money-laundering probes in Malaysia. 
Najib has been charged with 42 criminal offences related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Investigators allege about $1 billion in 1MDB funds flowed into the bank accounts of Najib, who was ousted in a general election last year amid widespread public anger over the scandal.
On Friday, authorities filed civil forfeiture suits to seize 270 million ringgit ($65 million) disbursed from an account belonging to Najib, MACC's chief commissioner Latheefa Koya said. 
The suits were filed on 41 people, companies and entities, most of them linked to Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation, Latheefa said. 
Malaysia has so far recovered about 919 million ringgit in 1MDB funds, including cash voluntarily returned by those under probe for receiving illegal proceeds, she added. 
Since 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed forfeiture lawsuits on about $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds, including a private jet, luxury real estate and jewelery.
Last month, the United States began returning to Malaysia some $200 million recovered from the sale of seized assets.

80,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 01:00AM ET</span>",Europe's Biggest Economy Is Looking at World Without Bond Yields,"(Bloomberg) -- The last glimmer of positive yields on German bonds is in danger of being snuffed out.
Thirty-year yields turning negative would be a first among major bond markets, with a global rally already having sent all of Germany’s out to 20 years below zero. It may only take a further deterioration in trade relations between the U.S. and China, a flare-up of Italian political risk or more hints of stimulus from the European Central Bank to turn the whole curve negative.
The impact could be far reaching. It may mean that insurers and pension funds are forced into buying negative-yielding debt, due to the need to maintain portfolios with high credit ratings. It will also push traders into more risky securities such as Italian, corporate or emerging-market debt to chase yields. And it’s another signal for Europe’s so-called “Japanification” where growth, inflation and bond yields stay depressed long-term.
“If you had asked me just two weeks ago about the prospect of 30-year German yields going below zero, I would have taken a couple of days to get over the laughing fit,” said Luke Hickmore, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Now, we seem to have transitioned to a completely different market environment with yields set to test more eye-watering lows and negative levels around the world. The significance is massive.”
The amount of bonds globally with negative yields surged to a record $12.5 trillion this week after ECB President Mario Draghi gave the clearest signal yet that the institution is weighing up interest-rate cuts and quantitative easing. He has joined the U.S. Federal Reserve and others in mooting renewed stimulus on the growing threats to global economic growth.
Germany only has six conventional securities out of 57 left that offer a positive yield, all maturing in more than 20 years. This will make it harder for Europe’s economic powerhouse to resist boosting fiscal expenditure, since it effectively gets paid to do so, at a time when the European Commission is battling with Italy to reign in its spending.
“If that would not encourage them to borrow more and spend, I’m not sure what will,” said Kacper Brzezniak, a money manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. “Frankly, right now, if I was the German finance ministry, I would issue bunds and buy Italian bonds.”
Giffen Good
Peter Chatwell, head of European rates strategy at Mizuho International Plc, described German 30-year bonds as a “giffen good,” defined as a product that people consume more of as the price rises. Investors who follow a benchmark index are likely to buy German bonds, while others may only be permitted to buy securities with a positive yield.
“For those investors who are mandated to hold a certain proportion of German paper, and particularly those who cannot buy negative-yielding paper, they have an ever narrowing window in which to buy,” Chatwell said. “Some real-money investors may well be forced to buy this scarce commodity of positive-yielding German paper.”
German 30-year yields currently provide a yield of 0.25%, the lowest level on record. By comparison U.S. 30-year yields are at 2.51% and Italy’s still offer above 3%. Market pricing using options implies a roughly one-in-three chance that German 30-year yields will drop into negative territory over the next year, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Negative Europe
That would be one step further than Japan, where yields on 30-year bonds have never turned negative, touching a low of 0.02% in 2016 and offering 0.31% now. Only Switzerland has seen an entire yield curve in negative territory, but the size of its debt market is less than a tenth of Germany. The whole yield curve in Denmark is also close to going negative.
The Netherlands may follow, with its 10-year yields already negative. The equivalent French, Finnish and Austrian bond yields all dipped below zero this week. The growing stock of debt below zero may mean that insurers have to be stress tested for the impact of negative rates under the European Union’s Solvency II regulations in the future.
“There are many liability-driven investors in the world who are trying to buy long duration assets, and are finding that they still do not have enough,” said Aberdeen’s Hickmore."
81,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>","Trump Approved Air Strikes on Iran, Then Pulled Back, NYT Says","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump approved military strikes on Iran after an American drone was shot down by Iranian armed forces, but then decided not to go through with them, the New York Times reported Thursday night.
The targets included radar and missile batteries, the newspaper said, citing unnamed administration officials. The operation was actually underway on Thursday evening -- with planes and ships heading toward their targets -- when the administration called off the attack, according to the Times.
The White House declined to comment on the report. The Times said it was unclear why the attack did not go forward.
Airstrikes would have marked a dramatic escalation in the already high tensions between the two nations and would raise the specter of a broader conflict in the volatile region, which supplies one-third of the world’s oil.
Earlier Thursday, Trump downplayed Iran’s attack on the U.S. Navy drone in the Persian Gulf that escalated regional tensions and fueled a surge in oil prices, suggesting a “loose and stupid” individual may have been responsible for the strike.
“I would imagine it was a general or somebody who made a mistake by shooting that drone down,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting Thursday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “I find it hard to believe it was intentional. It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid.”
The last time the U.S. launched a significant military operation against Iran was Operation Praying Mantis in 1988. In that operation, U.S. Navy ships sank two Iranian ships and destroyed two Iranian surveillance platforms.
The move came after the USS Samuel B. Roberts was damaged by a mine in the Persian Gulf. According to U.S. Navy history documents, it was the first time the Navy exchanged surface-to-surface missile fire with an enemy.
Later that year, a U.S. Navy cruiser shot down an Iranian commercial aircraft on a scheduled flight in Iranian airspace, killing nearly 300 people. The U.S. expressed regret for the loss of life and said it mistakenly targeted the plane. Iran said it was a deliberate and illegal act.
During his time in office, Trump has ratcheted up economic sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign against the Islamic Republic, he has also said he doesn’t want a war with Tehran and he campaigned in 2016 on withdrawing the U.S. from intractable Middle East conflicts.
Yet regional analysts and lawmakers from both parties warned that the likelihood of a bigger confrontation could be looming, whether intentional or not.
“The president may not intend to go to war here but we’re worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters Thursday after a briefing at the White House.
The top Republicans in the Senate and House both called separately for Trump to take a “measured” response to the Iranian actions.
The U.S. said the Global Hawk drone was flying in international airspace about 34 kilometers (20 miles) away from Iranian territory when it was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz, an oil choke point.
“This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace,” said Navy Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command."
82,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron Phillips Chemical in bid to acquire Nova Chemicals - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - ​Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, a joint venture between  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), has offered to acquire Nova Chemicals Corp for more than $15 billion including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Chevron Phillips Chemical, one of the world's top petrochemical producers, would gain scale and expand its footprint through the acquisition of Nova Chemicals, whose expandable polystyrene and resins are used in a range of industries, from construction to packaging.
Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, the owner of Nova Chemicals, has been exploring a sale of the Canadian plastics maker since the start of the year, and there is no certainty that it will accept the offer from ​Chevron Phillips Chemical, the sources said. 
Another bidder for Nova Chemicals may yet emerge, some of the sources added. Mubadala could also decide to keep a stake in Nova Chemicals in a deal, one of the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Nova Chemicals, Mubadala, Chevron and Phillips 66 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Headquartered in Calgary, Nova Chemicals was founded in 1954. Over the years, it has diversified its business beyond foam packaging and insulation to foam beverage cups and containers. 
Nova Chemicals reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $271 million in the first three months of 2019, down from $418 million a year earlier, according to its website.
Abu Dhabi acquired Nova Chemicals for $500 million in 2009 using its stated-owned International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), saving it from a financing restructuring due to its large debt. Since then, the company's business has grown rapidly, taking advantage of the shale-driven natural resources boom in North America.
Two years ago, Abu Dhabi merged IPIC with Mubadala, which manages over $225 billion in assets. The emirate has looked into consolidating its holdings and retrenching from some overseas businesses. 
Founded in 2000, Chevron Phillips Chemical has 31 production facilities located in the United States, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Belgium. It had total revenue last year of $12 billion, according to its website.

In a separate advisory to operators, FAA said according to flight tracking applications, the nearest civil aircraft was operating within around 45 nautical miles of a U.S. Global Hawk drone when it was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile this week.
""There were numerous civil aviation aircraft operating in the area at the time of the intercept,"" FAA said.

The agency said it remained concerned about the escalation of tension and military activity within close proximity to high volume civil aircraft routes as well as Iran's willingness to use long-range missiles in international airspace with little or no warning.

84,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>",Next China: Regards From Pyongyang,"(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox? Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands and where it's headed.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has a busy 10 days ahead of him.
He’s in Pyongyang now, as you’re reading this newsletter, meeting with Kim Jong Un on how to defuse the stalemate with the U.S. over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Then at the end of the month, he’ll be sitting down with President Donald Trump in Japan to try and iron out their differences on trade.
And as distinct as each of these two issues may appear, they were long ago melded into one by Trump.
Help America rein in North Korea, Trump told Xi in 2017, and Beijing will get a more favorable trade deal. It’ll also stop the U.S. from labeling China a currency manipulator.
Beijing’s sway over Pyongyang is substantial, and its decision to support sanctions against Kim’s regime has had a painful impact on North Korea’s economy. How much Trump’s petitions have affected Chinese decision-making is far harder to gauge.
Finding a peaceful solution to the decades-long conundrum on the Korean peninsula would be a considerable achievement and one Trump would undoubtedly burnish. He’s already boosted of being nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts.
It may well be Xi’s ability to foster a détente between Pyongyang and Washington that becomes the pivot on which the trade war turns.
Prolonged Conflict
And of course that could all be wrong. If the trajectory of the trade war continues to escalate, Giant Manufacturing will be one of the companies that saw it coming first. The world’s largest maker of bicycles began moving production out of China last September when Chairwoman Bonnie Tu says she realized the “Made in China” era had come to an end. Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) also warned investors this week not to ignore the possibility of a protracted trade war. The bank’s analysts’ see tighter Chinese capital controls and threats to Hong Kong’s role as a financial center being among the potential fallout.
Hong Kong
Trade isn’t all Hong Kong is dealing with. The city’s chief executive Carrie Lam “paused” the controversial extradition bill that had prompted hundreds of thousands to protest. That's not stopped calls for Lam to resign. But so far, the spillover for business appears limited. Home sales have continued at brisk pace and the city’s exchange is preparing for Alibaba’s secondary listing, which could raise as much as $20 billion. That’d make it Hong Kong second-largest share sale ever.
Word Choice
Another hot topic of conversation for financial markets in Hong Kong and China was the ongoing controversy surrounding UBS economist Paul Donovan's use of the phrase ""Chinese pig"" in a note about pork prices and inflation. China Railway Construction Corp. this week excluded UBS from a bond sale after the comment set off a furor on Chinese social media. That was after the Swiss bank placed Donovan on leave and the Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong called on UBS to fire those involved.  
Rainbow Economy
Meanwhile, if you're looking for a place to get away for a while, consider Chengdu. The capital of Sichuan province, long famous for its spicy cuisine, is also becoming known for its acceptance of the LGBT community. Businesses are already paying attention, in Chengdu and more broadly in China. The country's so-called rainbow economy, worth about $300 billion a year, is creating new opportunities for companies such as Blued, a gay dating app that also helps couples who want children find overseas surrogates. It's also changing corporate behavior. Weibo, the popular microblogging site, last year reversed a decision to remove content with gay themes after it was bombarded with opposition.
Social Scoring
And finally, a look at China's plan to reward good behavior and punish bad through a social credit system. About a dozen local governments have so far rolled out trial versions, but not without problems. In Suzhou, for example, almost none of the residents are aware their city has a social credit system, or that they've already got scores. It's hard to affect behavior with social scores people don't know exist. Bickering between various government bureaucracies has been another issue. That of course doesn't mean the system won't become more effective with time, nor does it assuage concerns that it will be used to suppress dissent. But for now, the social credit system looks more like Kafka than Orwell.

85,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 10:53PM ET</span>",Trump administration readying final review of new vehicle fuel economy rules,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Trump administration officials defended their controversial proposal to freeze fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels at a congressional hearing on Thursday and said the proposal would be submitted to the White House for final review in the coming weeks.
The administration has rebuffed requests from automakers and some lawmakers to make a last-ditch effort to reach a deal with California to extend national standards after it ended talks in February. The administration plans in the coming months to finalize a dramatic rewrite of fuel efficiency standards through 2026 that would also strip California, the most populous U.S. state, which wants stricter rules to fight climate change, of the right to set its own, tougher emissions rules.
The final regulation potentially faces a multi-year legal battle that could leave automakers in limbo about future emissions and fuel efficiency requirements and ultimately decrease the number of U.S. electric vehicles offered by automakers.
At a joint five-hour hearing of two House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittees, Democrats cast the administration plan as a blow against efforts to combat climate change and a boon for oil companies. Republicans said it would reduce vehicle prices and rein in California.
The Trump administration plan aims to roll back emission standards set by former Democratic President Barack Obama. The Obama administration had made a dramatic jump in fuel efficiency requirements a key part of its climate agenda, and said it would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.
Earlier this month, 17 major automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp urged the White House to resume talks with California to avoid a lengthy legal battle. Automakers warn that the lack of a deal could lead to ""an extended period of litigation and instability.""
The carmakers urged a compromise “midway” between the Obama-era standards that require annual decreases of about 5% in emissions and the Trump administration’s proposal. Reuters reported in April that officials expected the final rule would include a small increase in the yearly fuel efficiency requirements.
Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat whose district is home to many auto plants, implored officials to return to the bargaining table with California. ""I am really not interested in a pissing contest between California and this administration,"" she said at the hearing. 
Deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Heidi King was skeptical of Dingell's idea. ""I don't know whether that would achieve the goal,"" she told Dingell.
EPA Assistant Administrator Bill Wehrum said the agency was moving forward to finalize the rules ""as soon as possible"" after it had engaged in talks with California for about a year.
Trump administration officials argued its plan -- which it says will eventually boost U.S. oil consumption by 500,000 barrels of oil daily -- will save lives because it will reduce the forecasted cost of new vehicles and prod more people to sell older, less safe models. Environmentalists and others disagree.
Representative Frank Pallone, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, called the Obama standards ""our single most important action taken to combat climate change.""
""So, naturally, the Trump administration is trying to gut those standards as part of its reckless anti-climate agenda,"" he said.
""WE LIKE BIG THINGS""
Transportation accounts for 30% of U.S. greenhouse emissions, with light cars and trucks accounting for 60% of that figure.
Republicans cast the issue as a divide between rural areas that use more trucks and urban areas where people are more likely to buy electric vehicles.
""We like big things. We like big trucks. We like big engines,"" said Representative John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican whose district covers a heavily rural swath of the eastern part of the state.
The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, compared with 37 mpg under the Trump administration’s preferred option.
Mary Nichols, who heads the California Air Resources Board, told lawmakers Thursday the Trump proposal will cost Americans millions in fuel costs, kill jobs, add smog, undermine the auto industry and worsen the climate crisis.
""We have been open to accommodations that would adjust compliance timing and flexibility, that would create new paths to promote innovative technologies and zero emission vehicles, and that would benefit the public,” she said.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a letter to lawmakers on Thursday that California did not negotiate in good faith and said Nichols's written testimony was ""false"" -- a claim she strongly denied.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 10:46PM ET</span>",FTC objects to Qualcomm submission of Apple documents in antitrust case,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Thursday objected to a move by mobile chip supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc to introduce internal Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) documents in its fight to stop the enforcement of a May antitrust ruling.
On Tuesday, Qualcomm submitted them to U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in opposition to a sweeping ruling that would alter its business model as it pursues an appeal. In the slides from internal Apple presentations, the iPhone maker outlined goals to ""Create Leverage by Building Pressure"" and ""Hurt Qualcomm Financially."" 
The slides were part of the opening statement presentation in Qualcomm's separate civil trial against Apple in April but were never submitted during Qualcomm's earlier trial with the FTC. If Koh accepts them, they would become part of the record that higher courts review when Qualcomm eventually files an appeal.
FTC officials on Thursday said the submission of the slides was ""improper, unfair, and prejudicial.""
The slides were part of Qualcomm's opening arguments from the Apple trial, in which the company outlined what its attorneys described as a targeted campaign by Apple to attack Qualcomm's patent licensing model. In them, Apple discussed how to ""devalue"" the kind of patents held by Qualcomm and ""Reduce Apple's Net Royalty to Qualcomm.""
The FTC said it had no formal chance to object to the slides.
""Had the document survived a high-priority objection, an Apple witness may have testified to, among other things, the document’s context and purpose and the meaning of the cited language,"" the FTC wrote Thursday.
Qualcomm, which supplies modem chips to connect phones to wireless data networks, is fighting for a freeze of Koh's ruling, which could potentially slice its patent royalties from several dollars per phone to pennies.
Smartphone maker LG Electronics Inc has opposed Qualcomm's efforts to freeze the ruling. The phone maker said it is negotiating chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm and could be forced into signing another unfair deal unless Koh's protections remain in place. The FTC had also opposed Qualcomm's move.

On Tuesday, Qualcomm responded to LGE's allegations by saying that it had continued to supply chips to the Korean phone maker despite the fact that license negotiations ground to a halt and LGE had no license at all with Qualcomm earlier this year, the precise scenario that phone makers have argued could prompt Qualcomm to cut off chip supplies if Koh's ruling is not enforced.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.
""The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,"" a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article. 
While an administration's ""Buy American Hire American"" executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.
It is ""completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,"" the spokeswoman added.
Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: ""We have not heard anything officially from the U.S. government"" on capping such permits for Indians.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.
Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.
There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians.

The market watched closely the possible rate cut in the U.S. and the rising tensions in the Middle East. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.51% and 1.04% respectively by 10:20 PM ET (02:20 GMT),supported by the dovish tone by the U.S. Federal Reserve in its latest policy statement, which signalled a possible rate cut. 
The market expects the Fed to cut interest rates to counter the negative impacts of the U.S.-China trade spat on economic growth. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 jumped 1% to close at a record high. 
 ""There is no doubt that this week's FOMC meeting outcome is positive for the financial markets including those in Asia,"" Kota Hirayama, senior emerging market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Reuters. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are set to meet at next week’s G-20 meeting to discuss trade issues. Market watchers await clues about new trade deals to see how the market will be affected. 
The tensions in the Middle East were also in focus today. Iran shot down a U.S. military drone and escalated the volatile situation between Washington and Tehran. The incident sent the crude oil price higher. 
 “The key issue that we’re struggling with at the moment is the impact of geopolitics on business confidence,” James Sullivan, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research at J.P. Morgan told CNBC. 
 Trump tried to downplay the incident by saying he found it “hard to believe” the attack was intentional. “It could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it . . . But it was a very foolish move,” he said on Thursday. 
Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded 0.15% lower. Protests continued on Friday over the controversial extradition bill that would allow the autonomous government to send criminal suspects to China.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.26% and South Korea’s KOSPI slid 0.13%. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday.

89,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",China's Xi Tells North Korea's Kim World Wants More U.S. Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s Xi Jinping told Kim Jong Un that the world wanted more nuclear talks with the U.S., drawing a complaint from the North Korean leader that he had already attempted to compromise with little success.
The Chinese president said during a landmark visit to Pyongyang on Thursday that he was willing to play a “positive and constructive role” toward achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the official Xinhua News Agency said. “The international community hopes that talks between the DPRK and the United States will move forward and bear fruit,” Xi said, referring to North Korea’s formal name.
Kim responded that North Korea had “taken many active measures to avoid tensions and control the situation on the Korean Peninsula, but has not received positive responses from the party concerned,” according to Xinhua. North Korea’s own state media reports were more general, saying only that that the two leaders agreed to strengthen “strategic” communications “amid a grave and complex” international situation.
The talks came amid a day of pageantry in the North Korean capital, in which Kim rolled out the red carpet for the first visit by a Chinese president in 14 years. Besides showcasing ties that stretch back to the 1950-53 Korean War, Xi and and Kim were expected to use the visit to stake out common ground in their current struggles with Donald Trump.
The trip, which was scheduled to continue Friday, comes just a week ahead of Xi’s planned meeting with Trump on the sidelines the Group of 20 summit in Japan, in what’s shaping up to be a possible turning point in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The visit demonstrates China’s broader influence in the region, especially in North Korea, which relies on its larger neighbor for vital trade and security backing.
Stalled Talks
Nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea stalled after Trump walked out on his second meeting with Kim in February without a deal to reduce the country’s arsenal. Kim has sought to maintain his diplomatic push despite the U.S. setback, meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in April.
While Xi has stayed largely on the sidelines during talks between Trump and Kim, the country has played a key role, both by approving United Nations sanctions against North Korea and by backing Kim. Xi has hosted Kim in Beijing before both of the North Korean leader’s meetings with Trump.
The Chinese president and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Kim at the airport and inspected an honor guard before driving past flag-waving crowds that Chinese state media said contained hundreds of thousands of people. The crowds held banners proclaiming that friendship between the two countries “shall be eternal.”
The welcome demonstrated how far the sometimes fraught ties between the two neighbors have improved since Kim made his first visit to Beijing last year. Later Thursday, Xi attended a performance of North Korea’s mass games, in which hundreds of performers engage in a display of mass choreography.
Top Officials
Xi’s entourage included top diplomats Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, as well as He Lifeng, head of the National Development and Reform Commission. Kim was joined by top North Korean official Kim Yong Chol and his sister Kim Yo Jong, according the Chinese Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper.
Talks between Trump and Kim have made little progress since they held a historic meeting in Singapore a year ago. The pair agreed at that meeting to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” without defining what that meant or setting deadlines.
Those negotiations broke down in February after Trump rejected Kim’s offer to close some nuclear facilities in exchange for the elimination of the most severe UN sanctions on North Korea. While China says it supports a nuclear-free Korea, it advocates a phased approach similar to Kim’s position.
Thae Yong Ho, a former North Korean ambassador to the U.K. who defected, told the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper on Thursday that the summit signaled that Kim saw China rather than South Korea as his preferred mediating partner.
“North Korea is drawing up a new plan for third summit with U.S.,” Thae told the paper. “And the starting point of that is Xi’s North Korea visit.”
What You Need to Know About North Korea and Sanctions: QuickTake
Xi pledged Thursday to continued providing security assurances and development assistance to North Korea, exchanges that have been hamstrung by international sanctions.
“China is ready within its capacity to help the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea address its legitimate security and development concerns, strengthen coordination with it and other relevant parties, and play a positive and constructive role in realizing denuclearization on the peninsula and enduring regional peace and stability,” Xi said."
90,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 08:14PM ET</span>",Walmart to pay $282 million to settle seven-year global corruption probe,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Thursday it will pay $282 million to settle a seven-year-long investigation into whether its overseas units in Mexico, Brazil, China and India violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The retailer will pay more than $144 million to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission and about $138 million to resolve parallel criminal charges by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to court and regulatory filings.
In a separate regulatory filing, Walmart said the $282 million was part of a ""global settlement"" and ended all FCPA-related investigations into the retailer and its overseas businesses.
The Justice Department launched an investigation of the retailer after a series of New York Times articles in 2012 described alleged bribes paid by Walmart in Mexico to obtain permits to build stores there.
The reports spurred a wide-reaching investigation by the department into the behavior of Walmart subsidiaries around the globe, including in Mexico, Brazil, China and India.
""Walmart profited from rapid international expansion, but in doing so chose not to take necessary steps to avoid corruption,” Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said on Thursday.
""In numerous instances, senior Walmart employees knew of failures of its anti-corruption-related internal controls involving foreign subsidiaries, and yet Walmart failed for years to implement sufficient controls comporting with U.S. criminal laws,"" he added.
The Justice Department said the failures led Walmart's subsidiaries in Mexico, India, Brazil and China to hire third-party intermediaries and allowed these middlemen to make improper payments to government officials to obtain store permits and licenses.
Walmart did not voluntarily disclose the conduct in Mexico and only disclosed the conduct in Brazil, China and India after the government had already begun investigating the situation in Mexico, the department added. 
Charles Cain, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit, said ""Walmart valued international growth and cost-cutting over compliance."" 
The retailer's chief executive said on Thursday Walmart had enhanced its ""policies, procedures and systems and invested tremendous resources globally into ethics and compliance.""
Walmart also said it had spent over $900 million on related matters, including FCPA inquiries, investigations and its global compliance program, in the past seven years.
WALMART BRAZIL PLEADS GUILTY 
As part of the settlement, Walmart Brazil has entered a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the retailer said. 
According to court filings, from around 2009 to 2010, Walmart Brazil knowingly led its parent to maintain false records, which then made it into the company's consolidated financial statements.
Walmart Brazil and its employees recorded $527,000 in payments to an intermediary for assistance in acquiring construction permits, as a payment to certain construction companies, the court filings show. 
The intermediary's ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly ""by sorting things out like magic"" earned the middleman the nickname ""sorceress"" or ""genie"" within Walmart Brazil, the court filings said.
In June 2018, the retailer sold a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International.
Walmart has also entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. That means the department will not prosecute the company, if it meets obligations set forth in the agreement for three years.

In October, the retailer agreed to pay $160 million to settle a class action by investors unhappy with the way Walmart handled the foreign bribery investigation. Walmart admitted no wrongdoing as part of that settlement.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 07:30PM ET</span>",Risks to Wall Street's rally abound despite record high,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 index hit a record high on Thursday as an almost giddy euphoria over the prospects of a U.S. interest rate cut fueled the appetite for equities, but there are plenty of pitfalls that could throw the stock market off course.
From the high expectations for something positive on the U.S.-China trade front at next week's Group of 20 summit, to rising geopolitical concerns and a worrying U.S. profit picture, the potential for missteps and stumbles is great. 
Moreover, the rally appears to be based more on hope than reality, strategists said.
""This is probably one of the riskiest points you're ever going to see in the stock market,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""The price level here is not supported by fundamentals. It's supported by sentiment and hype and hopefulness about monetary policy.""
The S&P 500 on Thursday finished at a record closing high and the 10-year Treasury yield dipped below 2% for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years a day after the Federal Reserve signaled the potential for a rate cut as soon as its next meeting in July as it said it was ready to battle risks to the economy, including the U.S.-China trade war.
There were other signs of the risk-on sentiment driving the market. Though it rose slightly on Thursday, the Cboe Volatility index, known as Wall Street's favorite fear gauge, is near its lowest level since early May. And Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a technology bellwether, on Thursday briefly hit $200 a share for the first time since early May, though the iPhone maker is viewed as a major potential casualty in Trump's trade war, should it worsen.
O'Rourke warned that some factors are a double-edged sword. While the market has embraced potential rate cuts, there is a downside to such cuts because they would be more likely if economic conditions deteriorate further, which is also a risk for stocks, he said. On the other hand, a trade deal with China may reduce the need for a Fed rate cut.
The recent gains in stocks follow a sharp selloff in May amid an escalation in the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, which stoked fears of a global economic slowdown.
The rally has come as earnings projections have weakened, making valuations more expensive. The S&P 500 index is trading at 17.1 times forward earnings, up from 16.3 at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, before the optimism over a rate cut took hold.
Graphic: S&P 500 Timeline Image, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rp81Pn 
Strategists said the current risk-on trade will be put to the test in the coming weeks. 
A lot is riding on the upcoming Group of 20 meeting, when U.S. President Donald Trump and China's president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet on the sidelines of the June 28-29 summit in Japan. 
Investors are likely to embrace even the smallest sign of progress, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. 
But ""if something happens and breaks down, then all bets are off as far as risk is concerned. We go back to a risk-off trade because it brings this whole trade war back into the consideration of investors' minds,"" he said.
Adding to the uncertainty for stocks are worries about a potential military confrontation between Tehran and Washington. Oil prices jumped more than 5% on Thursday after Iran shot down a U.S. military drone.
Rising oil prices are a negative for stocks because they cut into consumer spending, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
That's among the many reasons investors are likely to hedge their bets when it comes to buying stocks, cyclicals in particular, she said.
The prospect of ""further escalation of Middle East geopolitical risk creates uncertainty,"" Krosby said.

Legal & General Investment Management, the fund arm of insurer Legal & General, with 1 trillion pounds under management, has been among the most vocal asset managers on climate risks, and will also divest from Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), Korea Electric Power Corporation, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Metlife.
The divestment only applies to LGIMs Future World Funds which it says are set up for clients who want to express a conviction on environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes.
""In all other LGIM (non-Future World) funds that remain invested in those companies that have not met our criteria, we will vote against the election of the chair of the board,"" said Meryam Omi, Head of Sustainability and Responsible Investment Strategy, LGIM.
""We can vote against the chair on any number of issues, so to do so because of a single issue such as climate change sends a powerful message to companies that they should be raising their standards in this area,"" she said.
As part of its Climate Impact Pledge, launched in 2016, LGIM has sought to engage with the largest companies in the oil and gas, mining, electric utilities, autos, food retail and financial sectors on climate change and said it would take action. 
""ExxonMobil Corporation has not met our key minimum requirements, including on emissions reporting and targets,” LGIM said in its report.
LGIM said meeting the 2015 Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would mean cutting fossil fuel use by a third by 2040.
Some institutional investors have pressed Exxon to define a path toward meeting the Paris agreement, but the company has not committed to any targets.
Last month shareholders defeated measures calling for a special board committee on climate change and for a report on the climate risks.
LGIM said Exxon lags behind European peers such as Equinor,  BP  (LON:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) which better disclose their company’s potential climate risks.
Exxon was not immediately available for comment.

Hormel Foods, Korea Electric Power Corporation, U.S. retailer Kroger and U.S. insurance company Metlife also failed to meet LGIM's criteria on climate related risk disclosure, it said.

93,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 07:26PM ET</span>","Apple, Keurig Dr Pepper, Dollar Tree, Fitbit press U.S. to drop China tariff plan","By Chris Prentice
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) Inc,  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Fitbit Inc have joined other companies in filing letters of opposition to a Trump administration plan for more U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including iPhones, MacBooks, and single-serve coffee brewers.
The United States and China are resuming talks to end a trade war after more than a month's hiatus. The countries' leaders are expected to meet at the G20 summit in Japan next week. 
U.S. President Donald Trump had said he would consider extending tariffs to another $300 billion of Chinese goods if his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping does not yield progress on the trade dispute.
The new round of tariffs would reduce Apple's competitiveness and cut the contribution it could make to the U.S. Treasury, Apple said in an online filing on Thursday.
Apple said in the document it is the largest U.S. corporate taxpayer to the U.S. Treasury and reiterated its 2018 pledge to directly contribute over $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years.
Apple said it would also take a hit because Chinese and other non-U.S. firms do not have a significant U.S. market presence. 
""A U.S. tariff would, therefore, tilt the playing field in favor of our global competitors,"" Apple said.
The levies would also hit AirPods, Apple TVs and batteries and parts. Some of these products were spared from the previous round of tariffs imposed last September on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, but were put back on the list when Trump decided to prepare tariffs on virtually all remaining imports from China.
Officials are in the fourth of seven days of hearings for U.S. manufacturers, retailers and other businesses to weigh in on the tariff plan. Many individuals and companies have also filed letters and comments to the U.S. Trade Representative in an online docket https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&so=DESC&sb=commentDueDate&po=0&D=USTR-2019-0004. 
COMPLAINTS LIST GROWS 
Coffee and beverage firm Keurig Dr Pepper and technology giant Apple are the latest in a growing list of U.S. companies pressing the Trump administration to abandon plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on another $300 billion of Chinese imports.
Air conditioner maker Carrier Inc, a unit of United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX), said the latest round of tariffs on air conditioner parts ""will result in significant price increases for U.S. consumers of U.S.-manufactured HVAC equipment,"" making them less likely to replace older, inefficient systems.
The company said it would take 12 to 18 months to find alternative parts sources, and higher costs may force it to exit lower-priced segments of the air conditioning market. 
Companies such as Dell Technologies Inc, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc have already voiced their opposition. 
Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc in a letter said tariffs would result in a competitive advantage for Chinese device makers in the U.S. market, sparking ""national security concerns by placing sensitive U.S. health, location and financial data within the Chinese government's reach.""
Chinese rivals are willing to sacrifice profits to gain market share ""in a manner that U.S. companies like Fitbit cannot afford,"" it said.
FROM COMPUTERS TO K-CUPS
Some 88 percent of all coffee brewers sold in the United States are imported from China, Keurig counsel said in its public comments. The company's own brewers are in over 28 million homes and used in more than 1 million hotel rooms, the letter to the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
""This is significant, for the manufacturers directly affected and coffee-drinking U.S. consumers who will have no choice but to pay higher prices for coffee brewers, or forgo their daily morning brew,"" the company said.
Many U.S. companies rely on China to source a vast array of products. Finding alternative suppliers will raise costs, in many cases more than the 25% tariffs, some witnesses have this week told a panel of officials from USTR, the Commerce Department, State Department and other federal agencies.
The proposed list, which will be ready for a decision by Trump as early as July 2, includes nearly all consumer products. It has been loudly opposed by retailers like Dollar Tree, which is one of the top 50 U.S. employers and seventh largest importer, the company said in its public comments. 
""Simply put, the imposition of an additional 25% duty on the types of everyday, household products that we offer will have a significant and disproportionate negative impact on middle- and low-income American households,"" Dollar Tree said.

The tariffs could also hit Christmas sales hard, particularly cellphones, computers, toys and electronic gadgets.

Parliament's Treasury Select Committee published several recommendations in May on improving access to financial services, including requiring banks to relax their restrictions on opening a basic account.
Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in his response to the recommendations, published by the committee on Friday, that changes to bank account rules were not needed.
""It is our understanding that individuals are already well served by the market for basic bank accounts, making the need to change in account eligibility requirements unnecessary,"" Bailey said.
""Our Financial Lives Survey found that most unbanked customers are unaware of basic bank accounts,"" Bailey said. People could be helped by better ""signposting"" of basic accounts.
Bailey also signaled little appetite to introduce a legal ""duty of care"" on financial firms to act in the best interests of their customers, another parliamentary recommendation.
The committee's chair, Nicky Morgan, said in a statement that ""the vast majority of the FCA's reply to our recommendations appears to be a holding response or lacking in desire to effect any change ... 
""The FCA should have another go at responding to our report and approach our recommendations with a far more inquisitive and curious attitude.""
Bailey will appear before the committee next Tuesday as part of the FCA's regular updates to parliament on the FCA's work.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Initial exchange offerings (IEOs) have been the latest darlings in raising funds for cryptocurrency projects, but intensifying regulatory scrutiny and investors' concern about the viability of the companies raising capital are flashing red flags.
The emergence of IEOs - which sidestep banks and venture capital firms as a way to generate capital for new companies - is emblematic of a market which has long been trying to break free from regulation itself. 
Their launch as well as Facebook's plan to create its own digital currency, or token, have revived interest in a market that slumped last year amid intense regulatory focus. Already, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Congress on the launch of the social networking company's white paper on its digital currency Libra.
IEOs, which take place on exchanges, are a spin-off of initial coin offerings (ICOs), which grew in popularity in 2016 and raised nearly $30 billion since their inception three years ago. ICOs, though, slowed sharply this year amid a regulatory crackdown on fraudulent and illegal offerings led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
""I don't expect IEOs to result in better outcomes,"" said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at advocacy group Coin Center in Washington. ""From a regulatory and legal standpoint, there's not going to be much difference here."" 
""Calling it now an IEO is not going to change your obligation to the potential issuer of that token, if the token fits the test for a security, which I think in many cases it will.""
SEC KEEPING AN EYE
Much like the last three years, the SEC has not changed its tune on digital currency offerings, no matter what they're called.
At last month's Consensus conference in New York, Valerie Szczepanik, SEC's senior advisor for digital assets and innovation, said IEOs could be problematic in the United States if U.S. exchanges are acting as broker-dealers, but not registered as such.
Cryptocurrency exchanges need to follow the registration and licensing requirements for broker-dealers, alternative trading systems, or national securities exchanges. And if they're not, they're going to be in hot water, Szczepanik said.
There is already a precedent at the SEC if and when IEOs become regulated.
In September of last year, the SEC charged Michigan-based TokenLot, a self-described ""ICO Superstore,"" for acting as unregistered broker-dealers. TokenLot received orders from more than 6,100 retail investors and handled more than 200 different digital tokens, which the SEC found included securities, the SEC said.
QUESTIONS ABOUT VIABILITY
Aside from an uncertain regulatory status, start-ups doing IEOs face doubts about viability. 
Cryptocurrency research firm InWara said only 30% of IEOs launched this year had what it calls a ""minimum viable product"" at the time of the token sale, with the majority offering nothing more than a website and a white paper.
At the end of the day, IEOs don't change the fact that the token has to work in the long run as a utility token, said Ransu Salovaara, chief executive officer at crypto advisory firm TokenMarket. 
Some market observers also believe IEOs are not any safer just because exchanges have vetted the projects. Cryptocurrency exchanges effectively act as middlemen in IEOs, performing functions such as due diligence on a project, ""know your customer"" (KYC) screening, marketing and selling tokens to customers.
""Built-in KYC for exchanges? That's a nice explanation if it's true,"" said Arnold Spencer, general counsel at Coinsource, which operates more than 200 bitcoin teller machines in 28 states. ""The problem is it's not true - many of the non-U.S. exchanges have almost no KYC behind them."" 
InWara, in a research report, said not all exchanges screen the projects that launch on their platforms. Often the evaluation of a project is subjective. 

""That's the problem here: there is no standardized vetting process,"" said InWara. ""And as long as exchanges have the freedom to decide where to draw the line, bad actors, and fraud crypto projects will always creep into the limelight.""

96,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 06:58PM ET</span>",Merck CEO sees legal challenge if U.S. adopts drug pricing based on other countries,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Chief Executive Ken Frazier said on Thursday a rule to base the price the U.S. government pays for some prescription drugs in it Medicare program on lower prices in other countries would face legal challenges if adopted.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last year that one way his administration would seek to lower drug costs to consumers could be through an international pricing index (IPI) that would determine what Medicare pays for certain medicines based on the prices set in a handful of other countries. A proposed version of the rule is expected in August.
Other developed nations with single payer systems typically pay far less for drugs than the United States, which Trump called ""global freeloading.""
""I think there will be challenges to the rule,"" Frazier told reporters following the drugmaker's investor day in New York. ""A lot of people have objections to that rule. It's not just pharmaceutical companies."" 
Frazier, a lawyer by trade, did not say whether Merck would launch its own legal challenge to the proposed rule.
The company was one of three U.S. drugmakers that sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week over a new government regulation requiring them to disclose the list price of prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer television advertisements.
Of the Trump administration proposals to lower drug costs, the IPI option is the one Frazier said most concerns him, due to the effect importing price controls from other countries might have on innovation and patient access in the United States. 
""We tell incomplete stories about those markets,"" Frazier said, noting that some countries ration treatments available to patients. He pointed to lower survival rates for lung cancer in Britain, which has an agency that can bar the use of approved new medicines based on their cost.
Earlier on Thursday, Merck executives touted the company's pipeline of experimental drugs beyond its blockbuster cancer treatment Keytruda.
The investor event was also an opportunity for Merck to showcase executives other than Frazier, who turns 65 in December. Last year, the company scrapped its mandatory retirement age of 65 for its CEO, saying it gave the board flexibility around finding his successor.
""I'm extremely pleased by the breadth of the leadership talent at the company,"" Frazier said in response to a question about succession. ""I know that the board feels the same way. And they will continue to look at when the right opportunity is ... to make a selection.""

97,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 06:21PM ET</span>","Slack stock surges at debut, values company at more than $23 billion","By Carl O'Donnell and Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Slack Technologies Inc, the fast-growing workplace messaging and communication platform, soared nearly 50% in their public trading debut on Thursday, valuing the company at more than $23 billion.
The strong performance helped validate the unusual direct listing model the company used to go public as well as underscoring investor demand for business software makers. The stock closed at $38.62, compared with the New York Stock Exchange's reference price of $26 apiece.
Trade opened midday at $38.50. 
Slack's direct listing differs from a traditional IPO because it does not raise fresh funds. The method was pioneered last year by music streaming business Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA.
Slack's trading price gave it a valuation of more than 50 times revenue. That multiple is lower than for other tech companies' IPOs like Zoom Video Communications Inc, which trades at 88 times revenue, but is very high considering that Slack is not yet profitable, said Kathleen Smith, a principal and manager of IPO ETFs at Renaissance Capital. 
""They are going to have to do an awful lot to get the company's fundamentals to justify that kind of valuation,"" she said.
Slack is a business-focused messaging and communications platform, similar to group chatrooms, with the ability to collaborate on documents and order conversations by groups and themes.
The Slack tool began as an internal project to improve communications at video game company Tiny Speck, which eventually became Slack Technologies and focused on developing the communications software.
Slack's listing opened with about 40 million shares trading to outside investors, providing better-than-expected liquidity for the stock, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The debut follows a spate of high-profile technology IPOs, some of which, including Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), had disappointing starts to trading. 
The direct listing model offers Slack an opportunity to save significantly on investment banking fees and avoid restrictions on insider stock sales. 
""We think a direct listing is a more effective and efficient way to get to a normalized level of supply and demand without the constraints of an IPO,” said Allen Shim, Slack's chief financial officer. 
Slack's direct listing could have implications for other large technology companies such as Airbnb Inc, which is considering going public through a similar approach, one person familiar with the matter said.
The strong open built on a string of successful IPOs for enterprise software companies, said Alejandro Ortiz, a principal analyst at SharesPost. 
""Investors have a love affair with enterprise software companies, and with good reason. They continue to perform very well,"" he said. 
Recent enterprise software IPOs include Crowdstrike Holdings Inc and Zoom. Enterprise software IPOs over the past 12 months are trading, on average, at more than 100% above their IPO price, Ortiz said. 
Spotify's direct listing in April 2018 was perceived as a success at the time, although shares have fallen as the company sacrifices profit margins for growth.
""Direct listings are still a pretty new vehicle,"" Fiverr International Ltd Chief Executive Officer Micha Kaufman said in an interview last week after the Israel-based company, which offers an online marketplace for freelance services, went public. 
""But it's definitely more appropriate for companies that have raised larger sums for longer periods of time in the private market, and are really wanting to give their investors an upside or an exit.""
Revenues for San Francisco-based Slack soared more than 80% to $400 million in 2018, but it reported losses from operations of $143.85 million. It has more than 90 million users but so far has only around 100,000 paid customers. 

""We are in a growth phase right now and we are continuing to invest, but we expect to hit breakeven cash flow soon,"" CFO Shim said.

98,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 05:35PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: 3 Things to Watch," Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Existing Home Sales Seen Rebounding
Housing takes the spotlight on the economic calendar tomorrow with the latest numbers on existing home sales. 
The National Association of Realtors will report on May sales of existing homes at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that existing home sales rebounded to rise 1.2% on the month to an annual rate of 5.29 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Sales for March and April were both modestly lower.
Just before those figures, at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT) Markit will report its preliminary U.S. purchasing managers’ indexes (PMIs) for June.
The June manufacturing PMI is expected to have edged down slightly to 50.4 for the month.
The services PMI is forecast to have ticked up to 51.
2. Oil Rig Data Due
Oil prices have faced pushing and pulling from a number of factors this week, from trade headlines to Federal Reserve dovishness to a drawdown in U.S. oil inventories.
Today, good old-fashioned geopolitical tensions pushed oil prices up after a U.S. drone was shot down by an Iranian missile. A U.S. official told Reuters that the drone was downed in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. Crude Oil WTI Futures jumped 5.3% to $56.83 a barrel. Brent Oil Futures rose 4.3% to $64.45.
But traders will still be looking at the last weekly piece of data tomorrow with the U.S. Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count report at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT). Last week's report showed a decline of one oil rig to 788 rigs operating in the U.S., down 1 from the week before and down 75 or 8.7% from a year earlier. 
3. More Fed?
If you didn’t get enough of the Federal Reserve this week, there’s more to come in terms of Fed chatter tomorrow. 
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester will be participating in the final discussion of the Cleveland Fed’s Policy Summit 2019 at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT).
She’ll be joined by Fed board member Lael Brainard in the discussion on the intersections between community development and the economy.
Wednesday's Fed announcement convinced the market that a rate cut will come in July, with a 100% chance of a quarter-point easing priced in, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool."

101,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 05:22PM ET</span>",Martin Shkreli settles all litigation with his former company Retrophin,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur serving a seven-year prison term for fraud, has settled all outstanding disputes with Retrophin Inc, the biopharmaceutical company he founded in 2011 and which ousted him three years later.
A Retrophin spokeswoman said on Thursday that the accord covers Shkreli's $30 million lawsuit last month accusing three former colleagues, including his successor as chief executive, of engineering his ouster and to enrich themselves from his work.
The settlement also covers claims Retrophin first raised in August 2015, in a $65 million lawsuit accusing Shkreli of repeatedly breaching his duty of loyalty to the San Diego-based company. That case moved to arbitration last year.
CNBC earlier reported the settlement.
""Retrophin and Martin Shkreli have reached a settlement resolving all outstanding disputes between them,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We are pleased with this outcome.""
Edward Kang, a lawyer for Shkreli's former colleagues, said in an email that the case against them was ""resolved amicably.""
The former Retrophin colleagues included Stephen Aselage, who succeeded Shkreli as chief executive; Gary Lyons, the company's chairman; and Margaret Valeur-Jensen, who became general counsel after Shkreli left.
Shkreli voluntarily dismissed that case on June 18, according to a court filing.
Known as ""Pharma Bro,"" Shkreli, 36, is perhaps best known for raising the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by more than 5,000% while serving as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, now known as Phoenixus AG.
His prison sentence resulted from his August 2017 conviction by a federal jury in Brooklyn, New York for defrauding investors in hedge funds he once ran, and conspiring to manipulate Retrophin's stock price.

The federal appeals court in Manhattan is scheduled to hear Shkreli's appeal of that conviction on June 28.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","Retailers J.C.Penney, Macy's oppose proposed tariffs on apparel, footwear","(Reuters) - Department store operators J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc have opposed U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to include apparel and footwear among the Chinese goods targeted for tariffs.
The companies warned that U.S. consumers would have to pay more as they would not be able to quickly shift sourcing from China for items listed in separate letters dated June 17 and posted online to the U.S Trade Representative.
The retailer listed 26 items, ranging from women's pullovers to Christmas ornaments, and stressed that women would be hurt disproportionately by the proposed tariffs. It said that
13 items on their priority list were apparels for women and girls.
""For goodness sakes, a tax on Christmas ornaments? One wouldn't think the Administration would seek to emulate the Grinch, who left little Cindy-Lou Who with walls devoid of ornaments and 'nothing but hooks and some wire,'"" J.C. Penney said in the letter https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USTR-2019-0004-2525. 
Penney's rival Macy's, which listed 63 priority items, said the tariffs on all types of baby garments could hurt new parents. 
""It is hard enough for new parents to make ends meet while changing diapers and surviving on a few hours of sleep. Is it really a good idea to impose new taxes on baby clothes?"" it said in the letter https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USTR-2019-0004-2268.
The USTR had on Monday kicked off seven days of testimony from U.S. retailers, manufacturers and other businesses about Trump's plan to hit another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods with tariffs.

The hearings will end on June 25 and the tariffs will not come into effect until after July 2, when a seven-day final rebuttal comment period ends.

PSA will initially produce an annual 100,000 cars in 2020 increasing to 200,000 by 2023, Morocco's Industry Minister Moulay Hafid Elalamy said at an official inauguration ceremony.
PSA's investment has encouraged the setting up of plants by 27 car part suppliers in Kenitra including Citic Dicastal, world leading aluminum wheels manufacturer.
Automotive sector sales accounted for 27.1% of Morocco’s exports at 27.7 billion dirhams in the first four months of 2019, up 0.3% compared to the same period last year. The North African country is also home to production plants of French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA).

The new plant is expected to boost Morocco’s exports as it struggles to curb a trade deficit that widened by 5% to 67.2 billion dirhams ($7 billion) in the first four months of 2019 compared with the same period last year.

104,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 04:14PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Carnival Sinks on Profit Warning Amid U.S. Ban on Cruises to Cuba,"Investing.com – Carnival (NYSE:CCL) sank Thursday after the cruise company cut its profit outlook as the U.S. ban on cruises to Cuba and higher costs weighed on performance.
Carnival said the policy change from the Trump administration will dent earnings by between $0.04 and $0.06 this year while trip cancellations for its Carnival Vista ocean liner will cost $0.08 to $0.10 a share, sending shares more than 9% lower before recovering to a 7.6% loss for the day.
Carnival said it now expects full-year adjusted per-share earnings between $4.25 and $4.35, down from its previous guidance in March of $4.35 to $4.55 and short of Capital IQ's consensus of $4.50.
The cruise company reported earlier in the day that Carnival had canceled the Vista's July 6, 13 and 20 cruises.
""The Carnival Vista has been experiencing an issue affecting its maximum cruising speed,"" Carnival said, according to media reports. ""Unfortunately, we will be unable to operate the above voyages, as it is necessary to remove the ship from service to complete the required repairs.""
The warning on profit overshadowed better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter $0.66 a share on revenue of $4.84 billion, prompting Wall Street to turn bearish on shares of the cruise company.
William Blair downgraded Carnival to Market Perform from Outperform on expectations for weaker revenue yields, or revenue per available lower-berth day compared to rivals.
The bank expects the cruise company’s net revenue yields to come in flat, compared to estimates of mid single-digit growth for Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line.
The stock is down about 1% for the year.
Carnival has been subject to bad publicity this year. Earlier this month, the Miami-based cruise giant, which was fined $40 million for illegally dumping oil contaminated waste and covering up its dirty deeds in 2017, was handed a $20 million penalty for violating its environmental probation terms."

Oil surged amid rising tensions with Iran.
The S&P 500 opened at an all-time high, spurred by speculation the Federal Reserve will cut rates soon enough to avert an economic slump. The benchmark retreated after President Donald Trump hinted at possible retaliation for Iran shooting down a U.S. drone, only to rebound and close above the previous high set on April 30. Energy shares led the gain as crude surged more than 5%. The Cboe Volatility Index rose above 15.
The geopolitical tensions briefly overshadowed fresh impetus for risk assets from the Fed, Bank of Japan and Bank of England, all of which signaled a readiness to support growth. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield dropped below 2% for the first time since November 2016, while the greenback sank the most since January. Gold surged toward $1,400 an ounce.
“In the big scheme of things, it’s a concern because it creates uncertainty,” said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. “From a longer-term perspective, we’d think that any issues would get resolved diplomatically.”
Traders are now pricing in a virtual certainty the U.S. central bank will cut rates by July, Fed fund futures show. Seven of 17 Fed officials now think it will be appropriate to lower the benchmark overnight rate by a half-percentage point by the end of the year, according to updated projections published Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited “uncertainties” in the outlook that have increased the case for a rate reduction as officials seek to prolong the near-record American economic expansion.
“The Fed did a great job walking what had to be a pretty fine line between giving the markets what they were wanting, the removal of ‘patience,’ the knowledge that the Fed does stand ready to cut rates, if needed,” Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters.

106,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 03:44PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Deutsche Bank braced for continued Fed restrictions on U.S. business - sources,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) executives expect U.S. regulators to continue to impose restrictions on its Wall Street investment bank even if it passes an annual health check, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Executives hope improvements the bank has made to its risk management and capital planning processes since failing last year's test will enable it to achieve a conditional pass this year, the sources said.
The sources said their optimism is based on conversations with Fed officials over several months. However, the Fed has yet to give a final decision and the bank's fourth failure in five years is still possible, they said.
A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said: ""We cannot confirm any of the information as the results are not known to us. We respect the process, and we will respect the Federal Reserve's decision, when made.""
The Federal Reserve implemented annual tests of lenders after the 2008 financial crisis to check whether they have sufficient capital to weather a major economic downturn. 
Even if the bank passes the stress tests, executives expect the Fed to continue to bar it from making payments to its German parent without the Fed's approval, the sources said. They also anticipate Deutsche will be told to continue improving the systems it uses to monitor its business and risks, the sources said. 
The tests this week and next come amid uncertainty over the bank's U.S. operations. Deutsche plans cutbacks to appease investors unhappy about its stock market underperformance. It also faces investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice into possible money-laundering lapses. The bank has said it is cooperating with investigators. 
Failing the tests would further damage confidence among clients and investors at a time when Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is battling to turn around Germany's biggest lender, whose shares hit a record low this month. 
Deutsche flunked the second part of the tests last year. The Fed cited ""material weaknesses"" in its data capabilities and capital planning process. The bank said in April it had ""invested heavily to ensure that the bank meets regulators' demands and has made significant progress.""
Fed officials recognize the bank has made improvements to its processes but believe more work needs to be done to bring them up to the required standard, the sources said.
This year's tests are likely to be the last for Deutsche's U.S. business under current Americas head, Tom Patrick, the sources said. Patrick is expected to leave in the coming months as the bank's U.S. restructuring progresses, they said. Patrick declined to comment, bank officials said.
Deutsche plans to dramatically reduce the size of its loss-making U.S. equities business as part of an overhaul of its investment bank. However, it plans to retain a substantial U.S. operation to service German corporate clients. 
A key task for Patrick's successor, who will need to be approved by the Fed, will be to rebuild confidence among regulators and ensure it can pass future stress tests unconditionally, the sources said.
The Fed is scheduled to announce on Friday the results of the first part of the tests, which measures banks' capital levels against a severe recession. Deutsche is expected to pass that section comfortably, as it did last year, the sources said.
The second part of the tests, which focuses on banks' capital planning and risk management processes, is due to be announced June 27. It is this part that bank officials hope they will conditionally pass this year, the sources said.

107,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 03:00PM ET</span>",Trump Says New Nafta Ends Competition With Canada and Mexico,"(Bloomberg) -- The new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will allow the countries to compete as a region against the European Union and China, President Donald Trump said.
Trump struck a collaborative tone during a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday, as the U.S. president hailed a deal with two countries whose trade practices he’s regularly criticized in the past. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, is great for farmers, manufacturers and workers, he said.
“This brings us into a position where we’re not competing with each other, we’re competing against the world,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday at the start of his meeting with Trudeau. “We’re competing with the European Union, we’re competing with China, it gives us a bigger dialog, it gives us a much bigger platform. It’s really good for all three.”
Trump, Trudeau and former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto signed the USMCA deal late last year after grueling talks in which Trump regularly said Canada and Mexico were taking advantage of the U.S. He often threatened to abandon the pact USMCA will replace, the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mexico has ratified the new deal, leaving the U.S. and Canada to do the same. Democrats are seeking some changes, but Trump said be believed it would eventually pass Congress.
“Let’s see what happens, but I really believe that Nancy Pelosi and the House will approve it, I think the Senate will approve it rapidly,” he said, referring to Pelosi, the House speaker. He said that he thought politics was holding up a vote.
“The day after the election, it would win with tremendous support but we have an election coming up,” he said. “But I think Nancy Pelosi’s going to do the right thing.”
The Trump administration is urging Congress to approve the trade deal before lawmakers leave for their monthlong August recess. But House Democrats have identified four areas they want to address before the USMCA is put to a vote: labor, the environment, pharmaceuticals and an enforcement mechanism for the overall deal.
House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, the Massachusetts Democrat leading the negotiation, expressed optimism that his colleagues could come to an agreement with the Trump administration, but he warned against rushing.
Canada’s House of Commons adjourned for its summer break on Thursday, as Trudeau was in Washington to meet with Trump, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trudeau has said he could recall lawmakers this summer to pass the deal as needed, and reiterated his position that he’d move as quickly as the U.S. does.
“We’re moving forward on the ratification process aligned with you,” Trudeau told Trump Thursday."
108,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>",Sparkly unicorn ice cream: Kroger’s bid to win grocery wars,"By Emma Thomasson and Richa Naidu
BERLIN/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co has room to improve on sales and is looking to its Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream and other store-brand products to boost growth, Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on Thursday.
Multicolored, sparkly ice cream is an unlikely battleground in U.S. grocery stores. But  Kroger Co  believes trendy house-brand items like Unicorn Swirl will help it win market share from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Aldi and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""We know we can do better when it comes to identical sales results,"" McMullen told analysts after Kroger posted quarterly same-store sales below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 2.5%. 
The grocer's store-brand business was one of its most powerful tools, McMullen said. 
Kroger's own brand sales for the quarter rose 3.3%. Unicorn ice cream, pork belly bites and artesian jerky were among 219 new store brand items that boosted sales by $225 million.
By churning out new house-brand items, Kroger hopes to tap into broad sales growth for private labels. The push comes as grocers compete fiercely on price and race to expand online ordering and delivery, an area where the biggest U.S. grocery chain has lagged.
Kroger added 1,022 ""own brand"" items in 2018, and each supermarket on average stocks more than 15,000 private-label products such as pet food, clothes, furniture, meal kits and office supplies. Kroger's 16 house brands account for more than 30% of unit sales, the company said in March.
""We don't see this slowing down at all,"" McMullen had told Reuters in a separate interview in May.
Cincinnati-based Kroger has long made store brands that compete with name brands from Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co, Nestle and others. But it started focusing more on its own brands in 2012 and flagged them as key to reviving sales growth when introducing its “Restock Kroger” plan two years ago.
Graphic on store brand growth: https://tmsnrt.rs/31Ff7UN
Kroger's Simple Truth line hit $2.3 billion in annual sales to become the biggest U.S. natural and organic brand, the grocer said in March. Sales of its Kroger range and premium Private Selection food line are also growing, with the total own brand portfolio expanding 45% since 2011. 
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) kicked off the unicorn food craze in 2017, sparking a social media frenzy with its pink and blue Unicorn Frappuccino. Breakfast cereal and cake followed, and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) launched a cherry-flavored Unicorn Magic ice cream last year. 
Kroger debuted its cake batter-flavored Unicorn Swirl in March, and saw more than 2.5 million likes and shares on social media for the product on National Unicorn Day on April 9. 
""Kroger has been very clever about expanding into rapidly growing categories,"" said Neil Saunders, who heads retail consultancy GlobalData, highlighting brands like Simple Truth and Home Chef meal kits.
Simple Truth has likewise benefited from a social media boost. Kayla Schneider, 28, a vegan receptionist and beauty advisor from Fenton, Michigan, has 11,000 Twitter followers and earlier this year tweeted when Simple Truth vegan ice cream went on sale.
“I have a lot of followers who also share my type of diet and I like sharing new finds/yummy products so they can try them out as well,” Schneider said in a Twitter direct message.
Almost half of Kroger's private-label grocery lines, including bakery and dairy items, are produced in its 37 plants, giving it an advantage when it comes to creating and testing out items.
Kroger makes more in-house than other U.S. retailers, with Walmart outsourcing all store-brand production until very recently, when it opened a dairy in Indiana, retail consultant Roger Davidson said.
""They (Kroger) are very serious about private label and in my opinion better than any consumer goods company in the U.S.,"" said Davidson, who used to oversee food procurement at Walmart. ""Big CPG companies are really struggling,"" he said, referring to consumer packaged goods makers. 
Kroger has been looking for ways to claw back market share from Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, and German discount chain Aldi. It also has to grapple with Amazon's fast-growing private-label sales, both online and in Whole Foods. 
MARGIN PRESSURES
Soaring commodities and freight costs have pressured margins at companies like Procter & Gamble Co and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) PLC in recent years, making it harder for them to compete.
Meanwhile, Kroger's private-label margin is typically 600 to 800 basis points higher than that of big consumer brands, McMullen said on Thursday.
Private-label products on average are about 20% less expensive than branded goods, according to data from market research firm IRI. 
At a Kroger-owned Mariano's in Chicago, 24 bottles of own-brand water cost $2.50 versus $4.99 for Nestle's Pure Life, for instance. The world’s No.1 consumer company said in April there was no point in Pure Life trying to outcompete private-label bottled water. 
Own-brand products made up 14.9% of U.S. store sales in 2018, up half a percentage point, with frozen, pet and baby products growing fastest and millennials buying most, according to IRI.
That compares with an international average of 39.4%. The share is highest in Britain at 52.5%, in part due to discounters like Aldi. [nL8N1Z712I]
Aldi is expanding rapidly in the United States and seeks to become the No.3 U.S. grocery chain with 2,500 stores by 2022. It sells products that are almost entirely house brand. 
KETO, PALEO, FLEXITARIAN 
Kroger has a 400-person team developing its brands. The company poached Gil Phipps in 2012 from Texas-based retailer H-E-B, which has sought to emulate British store brand leaders like Sainsbury's since the 1990s.
But Walmart has also been adding private labels, while already squeezing Kroger on price and outperforming on e-commerce and automation.
In March, Walmart launched its Hello Bello line of plant-based baby products with actor couple Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. A month later, it introduced Unicorn Sparkle ice cream selling for $2.24 for 48 ounces, compared to $2.50 for Kroger's Unicorn Swirl. 
As part of the ""Restock Kroger"" drive, the company is also investing in store revamps and delivery, although a joint venture with British online grocer Ocado (LON:OCDO) is taking time to ramp up. 

""I worry whether Kroger is really keeping the end consumer in mind. They have so many irons in the fire,"" said consultant Davidson.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 02:23PM ET</span>",Airbus demands chance to bid for IAG's surprise Boeing 737 MAX order,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus called on Thursday for a chance to compete for a blockbuster plane order by British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), which stunned industry executives at this week's Paris Airshow by ordering 200 of Boeing's grounded 737 MAX.
Airbus announced a new version of its best-selling A321 with close to 240 orders and commitments in Paris, only to see its grip on IAG's European short-haul networks damaged by the Boeing (NYSE:BA) deal which analysts said shores up the embattled 737 MAX.
Boeing's top-selling aircraft has been taken out of service worldwide since an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crashed in March, five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX plunged into the sea off Indonesia. A total of 346 people died in the two disasters.
Tuesday's blockbuster order, worth more than $24 billion at list prices, was partly seen as an effort to preserve competition between planemakers, damaged by the three-month-old grounding crisis. But it jolted Airbus which was caught unawares after signing a smaller order for A321XLRs with IAG.
Wrapping up the world's largest air show on Thursday, Airbus publicly voiced its frustration over the deal and urged IAG to run a competition for the planes, which would be deployed at Vueling, Iberia, Aer Lingus, Level and part of BA.
""We would like a chance to compete for that business,"" Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told reporters, adding that IAG had not issued a formal tender for the narrow-body order.
IAG was not immediately available for comment, but said earlier in the week that it did not comment on negotiations.
Boeing declined comment.
FRAYED TRUCE 
The shock announcement of a tentative order for 200 737 MAX jets from IAG stunned the industry and frayed an unusual PR truce between the world's largest planemakers after Airbus had publicly supported Boeing over the grounding.
Commercial rivalry remains fierce, with Airbus launching its A321XLR - a longer-range version of its A321 - to try to reduce the space left for Boeing as it draws up designs for a new 220-270-seater in the so-called middle of the jet market.
Airbus reported 383 orders and commitments including 239 for the A321XLR. Boeing's firm and tentative orders came to 247. Both are suffering from slower in demand after a long upswing.
Shares in both companies rose less than 1 percent.
Airbus announced a last-minute order for 13 of the XLR jets from U.S. budget carrier JetBlue Airways, which is expanding into the cut-throat transatlantic market, joining a varied list of backers including American Airlines.
Airbus hopes to derail Boeing's plans for a mid-market jet in a gap between traditional narrow-body and wide-body jets by dominating the lower end, where its A321 outsells Boeing.
But it is more vulnerable at the top end where its A330neo wide-body jet is up against tough competition from the newer Boeing 787. Airbus grabbed key orders from Philippines carrier Cebu Air and Virgin Atlantic, while Korean Air took 20 787s.
Yet the biggest issue hovering over the show was the grounding of the MAX, which secures supplier profits for the next decade, while on the defense side of the show a Franco-German pairing and Turkey each unveiled new fighter designs.
The IAG deal marked a psychological turning point for the five-decade-old 737 series though Boeing avoided wading into the traditional ding-dong with Airbus over who won the show, as it strikes a more somber tone than usual following the crashes.
Boeing did, however, say it was in talks with other airlines for sales of its 737 MAX after the IAG deal. 
Senior Vice-President Ihssane Mounir dismissed the A321XLR as suitable for only a ""sliver"" of the market that Boeing hopes to win with its proposed all-new mid-market plane.
The two sides also traded blows over competition for wide-body jets, with each scoring key wins in Asia.
Boeing had opened the show on a subdued note with apologies over lives lost in the MAX crashes. It suffered a further setback when  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) disclosed a delay of months in supplying engines for the new 777X wide-body aircraft.

Mounir said he still expected the world's largest twin-engined plane to fly this year and to be delivered in 2020.

Key Developments:
What Merkel’s Allies Want (7 p.m.)
Even though Christian Democrat leaders are coming to terms with possibly having to ditch their formal candidate to lead the EU Commission, they are not willing to waive their party’s claim to the bloc’s most powerful job, said an EU diplomat from a country with a center-right government. This means that if they concede that Manfred Weber doesn’t get the job, they will also demand that another candidate from their own political family does, the diplomat said, asking not to be identified discussing the private deliberations.
World Bank chief Kristalina Georgieva is someone who commands respect, the person said. The diplomat downplayed Michel Barnier’s chances, citing the Brexit negotiator’s rival campaign against Weber, which has annoyed his Christian Democratic party.
France Hopes for Progress on Top Candidates (6:30 p.m.)
France wants to at least narrow the list of possible candidates, even if leader’s probably won’t complete the process, a French official said. French President Emmanuel Macron went into meetings on Thursday with leaders striking a more conciliatory pose, in contrast to the last summit when he pointedly omitted Weber from a shortlist of candidates.
The French official said there are around a dozen people in Europe who have the experience and skills for the top jobs. That includes Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite, Bulgaria’s Kristalina Georgieva and Croatia’s Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic, who are “options” that are “credible.”
Macron won’t close himself off by backing any one option, or by trying to block any name or nationality, the official added.
EU Lawmakers Dig In Over Potential Candidates (4:35 p.m.)
The European Parliament will only back a president of the European Commission chosen from the official pool of candidates, the assembly’s president Antonio Tajani told reporters in Brussels. If lawmakers insist on this stance, that would limit the universe of potential contenders and kill the bids of outsiders, such as Barnier.
Tajani said that German conservative Manfred Weber has the rightful claim to lead the commission, as his center-right party got the most votes in last month’s EU elections. Tajani, however, didn’t exclude the other two lead candidates from consideration -- liberal Margrethe Vestager and center-left Frans Timmermans.
Tusk Is More Cautious Than Optimistic (3:47 p.m.)
The European Council president tweeted his wariness after the start of the summit.
Conte Wants Commission Head Who Mirrors Him (3:35 p.m.)
Italy is on a collision course with Brussels over its failure to rein in debt, but that doesn’t stop Premier Giuseppe Conte from having his say on the jobs front.
“Our ideal candidate for the commission presidency is the one who starts to re-discuss European rules,” the premier told reporters before the summit. Conte is seeking to adjust the bloc’s budget limits to boost growth and jobs.
Barnier Bids for EU Commission President (3:35 p.m.)
Barnier called Boyko Borissov Wednesday to tell him that he’d be a great candidate for the EU Commission, the Bulgarian premier revealed. Borissov told Barnier that EU’s center-right parties already have a candidate, and that is Weber. Borissov’s comments are the first official confirmation that Barnier is running a parallel campaign against the candidate of his own party, and may put the EU’s Brexit chief in a difficult position. Borissov also said that Weber is “plan A,” thus leaving open the possibility of other candidates being backed.
Merkel Says Must Pick EU Chief Backed by Parliament (1:55 p.m.)
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she backs the so-called Spitzenkandidat principle, whereby parties backed top candidates ahead of the EU Parliament election to take over running the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm. That’s a sign that she’s not ready yet to abandon Manfred Weber, the German conservative she’s been backing so far.
“We need a joint solution, so it would be unacceptable to me for the European Council to make a recommendation that in the end isn’t supported be the European Parliament,” Merkel told reporters in Brussels on her way into the meeting. “It may well be that there will be no result today. But that’s not a big worry in my view because, as I said after the European election, the goal should be to find a solution by the time the European Parliament convenes so that we can get straight to work. So we’ll still have a few days time.”
Finnish PM Backs His Fellow Countrymen for ECB Job (1:50 p.m.)
Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne lauded the two “fantastic” Finnish candidates to head the ECB, Erkki Liikanen and Olli Rehn, insisting the job would be part of the package of posts discussed at the summit.
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Brussels, Rinne said the summit would first focus on dividing up the positions before actual candidates are discussed. Reaching agreement on the package will be difficult, but possible, he said, noting he personally viewed Frans Timmermans as a “very good” head for the European Commission. The Social Democratic group has a common stance, he said.
Croat President Seen as Compromise Solution (1:50 p.m.)
The possibility of Croatia’s president -- EPP-affiliated ex-diplomat named Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic -- emerging as a compromise candidate for European Commission president is as much a possibility as any other scenario, according to an EU official. She would tick a lot of boxes: commission chief for EPP; gender, eastern European. Remember that the only country that Merkel visited during the European Parliament election campaign was Croatia.
For Italy, It’s Anyone But Weidmann at ECB (12:55 p.m.)
Italy’s populist government is eager to stop Weidmann from getting the top ECB job. Rome wants an ECB president who will follow Mario Draghi’s lead on quantitative easing among other policies, and is wary of what it sees as a hawkish successor such as Weidmann, according to a person familiar with the confidential discussions.
Rome is ready to consider French or Spanish candidates for the post, and doesn’t have a preference between French hopefuls Banque de France Governor Francois Villeroy De Galhau or ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, said the person, who declined to be identified discussing strategy.
Leaders Must Opt for Change, Vestager Says (12:10 p.m)
Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust chief, says she’s not confident that she will get the the presidency of the European Commission, but adds that she hopes that heads of state will hear the calls from voters for something new. Asked about her own chances ahead of a meeting of her liberal parties group, she told reporters that she will probably be sleeping by the time EU leaders make a decision.

(Reuters) - A rally on Wall Street lost strength on Thursday after the S&P 500 index touched a record high, powered by the Federal Reserve's signals that it could cut interest rates as early as July to combat growing risks to global and domestic growth.
The U.S. central bank left rates unchanged at the end of its two-day June policy meeting on Wednesday, but pledged to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain economic health.
Wall Street's main indexes have gained in recent weeks on expectations of a rate cut and hopes of a revival of trade talks between the United States and China at the Group of 20 meeting next week in Japan.
The benchmark S&P 500 index, which has risen about 7% so far in June, hit an intraday record high of 2,956.20 on Thursday.
""It was always going to be difficult for the Fed to live up to high market expectations. While the bar was set high, policymakers appear to have cleared it with ease while also leaving themselves with plenty of outs,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA in London. 
""It's clear that the G20 meeting next week will either give them (the Fed) that out or make the decision to cut quite straightforward."" 
A more-than-expected dovish Fed led to U.S. treasury bond yields tumbling, with the benchmark 10-year yields dropping below 2% for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years. [US/]

Stocks pared some gains after President Donald Trump's comment ""You'll find out"" when asked how the United States will respond to Iran.
At 12:56 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 120.53 points, or 0.45%, at 26,624.53 and the S&P 500 was up 12.90 points, or 0.44%, at 2,939.36. 
The Nasdaq Composite was up 28.58 points, or 0.36%, at 8,015.91.
The technology sector rose 0.89%, boosting the S&P 500 by the most, with  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) leading the charge. 
Oracle's shares jumped 7.37% after the business software maker forecast current-quarter profit above estimates.
Cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp slid 9.41%, the most among S&P companies, after cutting its profit forecast for the year on the Trump administration's sudden ban on cruises to Cuba and weakening demand in Europe over political uncertainty.
Rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd dropped more than 3% each.
Buoying sentiment was data which showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to underlying labor market strength despite a sharp slowdown in job growth in May.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has directed members of his Cabinet to review the administration’s expanded use of waivers exempting small refineries from the nation’s biofuel policy, after hearing from farmers angry about the issue during his recent Midwest tour, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
Trump's move underscores the rising political importance of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than decade-old law which requires refineries to blend corn-based ethanol into their gasoline to help farmers, but which also provides waivers to small refining facilities that can prove compliance would cause them financial harm. 
Since Trump took office, the Environmental Protection Agency has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging another key constituency - corn growers - who claim the move threatens demand for one of their staple products.
Trump heard from disgruntled farmers and their political backers on the issue earlier this month when he visited the Midwest to tout his administration's decision to lift a ban on summer sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline called E15. Farmers welcomed that move but warned Trump it was negated by the surge in small refinery exemptions. 
The sources said Trump, upon returning from his trip, asked the heads of the EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to find solutions to address the farmers’ concerns. They said the EPA is now considering limiting use of the waivers or forcing larger refiners to make up for the exempted gallons - or a combination of both.
""I think Trump realized he may have a political problem and told (EPA Administrator Andrew) Wheeler to fix it,” said one of the sources, a refining industry lobbyist who was briefed on the matter and asked not to be named.
The EPA, in a statement on Thursday, said the ""EPA will continue to work with the White House, USDA, members of Congress and other stakeholders to ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard's continued stability.""
The USDA and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Any move to alter the small refinery waiver program would face resistance from the oil industry, already stung by the administration’s expansion of E15 sales. 
They view the government support for biofuels as a competitive threat to petroleum, and argue that the waiver program is now being run as Congress intended.
""The president has made promises to refiners, too. He promised to keep refineries competitive and he made promises to keep regulatory costs down, and we hope he keeps those promises,"" said, Derrick Morgan, senior vice president of the refining trade group American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.
Trump's expansion of the waiver program has become an unlikely talking point for several Democrats https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-klobuchar/democratic-presidential-hopeful-klobuchar-proposes-revamping-epa-ethanol-rules-idUSKCN1SY1KE vying to defeat him in the 2020 presidential election, including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, who believe it can help turn farmers already stung by the trade wars against him.
The EPA granted 35 exemptions for 2017, up from seven in the last year of the Obama administration, according to agency data. That included waivers for refineries owned by profitable majors like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), as well as one owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn. 
The exemptions represent more than 2 billion gallons of potentially lost demand for ethanol, the biofuel industry says. However, the extent of the actual demand destruction, if any, is a matter of intense debate.

The EPA has delayed action on the 39 pending applications for the 2018 calendar year.

Earlier this month, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told shareholders that Tesla was on track to hit its volume production goal for the year and had ""a decent shot at a record quarter on every level"".
Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino believes although the second quarter has been witnessing a better environment for demand for Tesla's cars, he doesn't think it is sustainable. 
""While there is potential upside surprise from a faster ramp or pull forward of Model Y ahead of schedule, there is likely cannibalization of current Model X and Model 3 product demand with a crossover variant,"" Tamberrino wrote in a note.
Analysts have questioned if there is global demand for the hundreds of thousands of Model 3 sedans and other vehicles Tesla aims to produce, after deliveries fell 31% in the first quarter. 
""We believe that is the largest question for investors to underwrite at this point — what are sustainable demand levels for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 — and how does that change with the introduction of Model Y production,"" Tamberrino said.
The brokerage maintained his ""sell"" rating on the stock and cut its target by $42 to $158, 34% below the median target, saying the Street is ""still modeling too optimistic sustainable volumes for Tesla"". 
Tesla stock has seen more session wins in June than losses, a rare for the company which has lost 33% in value so far this year. However, led by Musk's near-term delivery promises, shares have bounced back lately. June so far has been the best month since October for Tesla stock. 
Tamberrino expects the downward spiral for shares to resume as it becomes more clear that sustainable demand for Tesla's products are below expectations.
Shares of the company were marginally down at $226.10 in early trading. 

Twelve of 31 brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or higher, 7 ""hold"" and 12 ""sell"" or lower, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: HSBC gets top adviser role in Qatar for first time since Gulf row - sources,"By Davide Barbuscia and Eric Knecht
DUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - HSBC has been hired by a state-controlled port operator in Qatar, QTerminals, to coordinate a $500 million loan, sources familiar with the matter said, securing its first mandate as top adviser for a deal in Qatar since a regional rift between Doha and its neighbors erupted.
The London-listed bank -- along with other lenders -- was caught up in Qatar's dispute with its neighbors Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which in 2017 cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar accusing it of financing terrorism, a charge Doha denies.
Along with other banks, it side-stepped high-profile Qatar deals in the aftermath of the diplomatic crisis and prioritized business in Saudi Arabia, where it has a strong presence, as the kingdom promised a slate of deals as part of its efforts to open and transform the economy in an era of lower oil prices.
As a result of that, HSBC has not arranged any bond deals out of Qatar since the crisis began in 2017, according to Refinitiv data, after having been at the top of bond league tables.
Though it has participated in Qatari loan transactions over the past two years, it never won lead roles, and its ranking in the local bank debt market has fallen.
But after missing out on profitable mandates, like Doha's $12 billion sovereign bond issuance, the lender has been seeking to regain its foothold in Qatar, sources familiar with the matter said.
QTerminals did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
HSBC, which declined to comment, has been appointed as sole coordinator for a $500 million five-year bank facility for the company, in charge of developing and operating Qatar's Hamad Port, and it has recently approached other lenders for the transaction, said the sources.
LEAD ROLE
The bank has led almost every sovereign bond issue in the Gulf over the past few years, as governments in the region increased their dependence on debt to refill budget deficits caused by a drop in energy prices.
In its latest bond this year, a jumbo $12 billion debt sale, Qatar hired almost the same group of banks that arranged its bond issue last year, in what a source at the time said was a demonstration of the country's commitment to its existing partners.
Those banks included  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), and four banks with Qatari investment:  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Qatar National Bank. None of these banks has arranged Saudi Arabia's recent bond issues.
Over the past few years HSBC has consolidated its presence in Saudi Arabia, as the kingdom opened up to foreign investors as part of economic reforms pushed forward by its new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.

It was one of the banks appointed to lead state-owned giant Aramco's debut international bond this year, and had been previously mandated as an adviser for the company's initial public offering, which is now expected to take place between 2020 and early 2021.

The Atlanta-based airline acquired a 4.3% stake in Hanjin-Kal Corp., Korean Air’s largest shareholder, and expects to boost its holding to 10% over time, subject to regulatory approval. The cost of the investment, announced Thursday, wasn’t disclosed.
The deal comes about 13 months after the two carriers began a trans-Pacific venture that allows them to coordinate flights to 80 destinations in Asia and 290 in the U.S. Hanjin-Kal owns about 30% of Korean Air, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The agreement is part of Delta’s strategy to expand outside the mature U.S. market by taking minority stakes in other carriers, particularly in emerging markets. Delta already owns shares in China Eastern Airlines Corp., Grupo Aeromexico SAB and Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA.

130,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Bond Market's Marching Orders to Fed: Don't Dawdle on Rate Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- It looks like the U.S. Treasury market has goaded the Federal Reserve into shifting gears on interest rates, to consider the first reduction in more than a decade. Now, the world’s biggest bond market has further marching orders for Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues: Don’t dawdle on those cuts.
The Fed on Wednesday scrapped its use of “patient” in describing its approach to policy changes, roughly three months after bond markets began clamoring for lower borrowing costs. Eight of 17 Fed officials forecast a cut by the end of the year as the Federal Open Market Committee took note of greater economic uncertainties.
In the aftermath, traders have pushed markets to levels suggesting a quick Fed response, quite possibly at the next FOMC meeting in July. Derivatives markets are pricing in more than 25 basis points of easing at the gathering. As yields on two-year Treasuries sank to a more than 18-month low of 1.7% on Thursday, the spread between those securities and 10-year notes widened toward the steepest levels this year. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index sank to the lowest in almost three months.
And so it appears jawboning about being ready to cut rates won’t be enough. Only actual Fed easing will quell the $16 trillion Treasury market.
“The market is pricing this in and just asking for more now,” said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at NatWest Markets. “If half the FOMC members thought it was necessary for a cut, then why didn’t they just go today and own the narrative. The Fed will have to end up following the markets.”
The rate implied for the July 31 Fed decision has dropped to about 2.03%. That suggests more than 30 basis points of rate cuts by then. The January 2020 fed funds futures contract suggests about 75 basis points of easing by the end of 2019.
In another sign traders may be pricing in rate cuts, the three-month dollar Libor rate fell on Thursday by the most since 2009.
Fed officials were starkly divided on the path for policy. Eight predicted a rate reduction in 2019, another eight saw no change and one forecast a hike, according to updated quarterly forecasts. The FOMC vote to keep the rate benchmark steady at 2.25% to 2.50% on Wednesday was not unanimous either, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard seeking a quarter-point rate cut. His vote marked the first dissent of Powell’s 16-month tenure as chairman.
Not everyone is convinced that the Fed will actually announce a reduction next month. News could break between now and then on the trade-war front, for instance. Or maybe something else will emerge from the Group-of-20 meeting later this month that helps improve the global economic growth outlook.
But for now, the market is making its preference clear.
Some eurodollar options traders are already moving toward the possibility that the Fed will cut by 50 basis points next month. NatWest’s economics team is a believer in the quick-cut thesis. They’ve been predicting two 2019 rate reductions, one in September and another in November, but just brought that closer to the present, now forecasting cuts in July and September.

The UFO union, which represents cabin crew, threatened a prolonged walkout if Lufthansa did not accept its demands that include higher wages for staff.
At a news conference, a UFO board member said its members would vote on the walkout plans at Eurowings, which also includes the Germanwings airline. 
The threat comes after Lufthansa issued a profit warning on Sunday, with lower prices and higher fuel costs compounding the effect of losses at Eurowings. The news sent its shares plummeting.
Lufthansa's stock, which has lost more than half its value over the last 18 months, slightly dipped again on UFO's announcement and traded 0.4% lower at 1034 GMT, underperforming Germany's blue chip index, which was up 0.94%. 
Eurowings said it was bound by Lufthansa's decision to halt all talks with the union and did not comment on wage demands. 
Lufthansa ended talks with UFO last week, saying that ongoing legal issues within the union meant Lufthansa had no official counterpart at the union - a statement UFO contests. 
A Lufthansa spokeswoman said no strikes could take place among employees at its core brand as no wage agreements had expired and UFO had not formulated specific demands. 

UFO said it was still working on the demands it plans to put to Lufthansa's core brand.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The United States' plans to cap H1-B work visas, used by Indian IT firms to send employees there, would imply a ""further crunch"" for businesses to access skilled workforce, industry lobby group Nasscom said on Thursday.
The United States told India it is considering caps on H-1B visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to New Delhi, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing three sources with knowledge of the matter.
The warning comes as trade tensions between the United States and India have resulted in tit-for-tat tariff actions in recent weeks. From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some U.S. goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.
The $150 billion Indian IT sector uses the work visas to fly engineers and developers to service clients, including software giants such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) in the U.S., their biggest market.
If Washington made it more difficult to hire advanced tech workers, it would only weaken the U.S. companies that depend on them to help fill their skill gaps and put jobs at risk, Nasscom said in an emailed statement.
However, the lobby group, which counts Wipro Ltd Chairman Rishad Premji and Infosys Ltd Chief Operating Officer U.B. Pravin Rao among its governing members, said it awaited clarity from official sources on the matter.
""The American companies themselves need Indian talent, so if there is a cap on these visas, this will impact U.S. companies also and hurt their business interests,"" said Sudheer Guntupalli, an analyst with Ambit Capital in Mumbai.
""Clearly this seems to be a retaliatory measure from the U.S. government.""
Shares of sector heavyweights Infosys fell as much as 2.13% on Thursday, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) lost 2.12% and Wipro fell over 3% in early trade, following the report, before recouping losses later in the day.
Infosys and Wipro did not comment on the matter, while TCS did not immediately respond to requests for their views on the report.

The Atlanta-based airline acquired a 4.3% stake in Hanjin-Kal Corp., Korean Air’s largest shareholder, and expects to boost its holding to 10% over time, subject to regulatory approval. The cost of the investment, announced Thursday, wasn’t disclosed.
The deal comes about 13 months after the two carriers began a trans-Pacific venture that allows them to coordinate flights to 80 destinations in Asia and 290 in the U.S. Hanjin-Kal owns about 30% of Korean Air, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The agreement is part of Delta’s strategy to expand outside the mature U.S. market by taking minority stakes in other carriers, particularly in emerging markets. Delta already owns shares in China Eastern Airlines Corp., Grupo Aeromexico SAB and Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA.
“This is already one of our fastest-integrating and most successful partnerships, and experience tells us this investment will further strengthen our relationship,” Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in a statement.
The Korean Air partnership is contributing to Delta’s first growth in the Asia Pacific region since 2012, the U.S. carrier said. The airlines also cooperate in air cargo.

139,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Bond Market's Marching Orders to Fed: Don't Dawdle on Rate Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- It looks like the U.S. Treasury market has goaded the Federal Reserve into shifting gears on interest rates, to consider the first reduction in more than a decade. Now, the world’s biggest bond market has further marching orders for Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues: Don’t dawdle on those cuts.
The Fed on Wednesday scrapped its use of “patient” in describing its approach to policy changes, roughly three months after bond markets began clamoring for lower borrowing costs. Eight of 17 Fed officials forecast a cut by the end of the year as the Federal Open Market Committee took note of greater economic uncertainties.
In the aftermath, traders have pushed markets to levels suggesting a quick Fed response, quite possibly at the next FOMC meeting in July. Derivatives markets are pricing in more than 25 basis points of easing at the gathering. As yields on two-year Treasuries sank to a more than 18-month low of 1.7% on Thursday, the spread between those securities and 10-year notes widened toward the steepest levels this year. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index sank to the lowest in almost three months.
And so it appears jawboning about being ready to cut rates won’t be enough. Only actual Fed easing will quell the $16 trillion Treasury market.
“The market is pricing this in and just asking for more now,” said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at NatWest Markets. “If half the FOMC members thought it was necessary for a cut, then why didn’t they just go today and own the narrative. The Fed will have to end up following the markets.”
The rate implied for the July 31 Fed decision has dropped to about 2.03%. That suggests more than 30 basis points of rate cuts by then. The January 2020 fed funds futures contract suggests about 75 basis points of easing by the end of 2019.
In another sign traders may be pricing in rate cuts, the three-month dollar Libor rate fell on Thursday by the most since 2009.
Fed officials were starkly divided on the path for policy. Eight predicted a rate reduction in 2019, another eight saw no change and one forecast a hike, according to updated quarterly forecasts. The FOMC vote to keep the rate benchmark steady at 2.25% to 2.50% on Wednesday was not unanimous either, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard seeking a quarter-point rate cut. His vote marked the first dissent of Powell’s 16-month tenure as chairman.
Not everyone is convinced that the Fed will actually announce a reduction next month. News could break between now and then on the trade-war front, for instance. Or maybe something else will emerge from the Group-of-20 meeting later this month that helps improve the global economic growth outlook.
But for now, the market is making its preference clear.
Some eurodollar options traders are already moving toward the possibility that the Fed will cut by 50 basis points next month. NatWest’s economics team is a believer in the quick-cut thesis. They’ve been predicting two 2019 rate reductions, one in September and another in November, but just brought that closer to the present, now forecasting cuts in July and September.

The UFO union, which represents cabin crew, threatened a prolonged walkout if Lufthansa did not accept its demands that include higher wages for staff.
At a news conference, a UFO board member said its members would vote on the walkout plans at Eurowings, which also includes the Germanwings airline. 
The threat comes after Lufthansa issued a profit warning on Sunday, with lower prices and higher fuel costs compounding the effect of losses at Eurowings. The news sent its shares plummeting.
Lufthansa's stock, which has lost more than half its value over the last 18 months, slightly dipped again on UFO's announcement and traded 0.4% lower at 1034 GMT, underperforming Germany's blue chip index, which was up 0.94%. 
Eurowings said it was bound by Lufthansa's decision to halt all talks with the union and did not comment on wage demands. 
Lufthansa ended talks with UFO last week, saying that ongoing legal issues within the union meant Lufthansa had no official counterpart at the union - a statement UFO contests. 
A Lufthansa spokeswoman said no strikes could take place among employees at its core brand as no wage agreements had expired and UFO had not formulated specific demands. 

UFO said it was still working on the demands it plans to put to Lufthansa's core brand.

The inquiry, first reported in the New York Times, follows a report by that newspaper last month about bank employees in its U.S. compliance division who had flagged suspicious financial transactions to their superiors who then opted not to escalate them to government authorities. 
The transactions were notable because they were linked to companies controlled by U.S. President Donald Trump and his son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, according to the report.
Trump rejected the report last month, saying he had little need for banks because he had so much cash on hand and denying that the money came from Russia.
The resulting FBI investigation is viewed as routine following the report about the bank whistleblower, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to talk about an ongoing investigation.
A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment on the Times report, but said: ""We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations."" 
The FBI, the White House, the Trump Organization, and Kushner Companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours. 
The NYT reported that Kushner Companies said any allegations regarding its relationship with Deutsche and money laundering were false, while a Trump Organization spokeswoman said she was unaware of Deutsche flagging any transactions. 
Deutsche Bank has struggled to bounce back after the 2008 financial crisis and has been plagued by failed regulatory stress tests, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals and most recently a failed merger.
The lender, Germany's largest, has been making progress working its way through a raft of litigation over past years, but it has recently made headlines about lapses in safeguards meant to identify money laundering. 
In 2017, regulators fined Deutsche Bank nearly $700 million for weak controls that allowed money laundering from Russia. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation is still ongoing.
Shares in Deutsche, which hit a record low earlier this month, were 0.9% lower on Thursday and the biggest loser on the DAX index of blue-chip companies.
The New York Times report, published on Wednesday, cited seven people it said were familiar with the inquiry. 
Earlier this month, a group of U.S. Senate Democrats urged the Federal Reserve to investigate Deutsche Bank's relationship with Trump and Kushner.

Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump's real estate business. A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank.

(Reuters) - More money is flowing into safer assets such as money markets and bonds in Asia, data shows, as investors worry over slowing global growth, trade frictions and easier monetary policies.
Data from Refinitiv Lipper showed investors bought $30 billion of Asian money market funds and $10 billion of the region's bond funds in the past two months. However, they sold $3 billion of equity funds.
Their investments in money market funds in the first five months of this year stood at $34.7 billion, the highest in four years, the data showed.
Higher investment flows into such safer assets point to growing caution as the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war takes its toll on the region's growth, even as some of Asia's central banks adopt more expansionary policies this year.

""We have seen a lot of investors in a wait-and-see mode pushing into cash and short-term deposits, while they wait to see what happens with the trade war talks right now,"" said Paul Sandhu, Head of Multi-Assets Quant Solutions at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in Hong Kong.
China and the United States said this week they were reviving talks ahead of a meeting next week between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, raising expectations of a new phase in negotiations. Talks had broken down in May after Washington raised some tariffs and proposed new ones covering nearly all of the remaining Chinese imports into the United States.
""If these tariffs stay in place for 4-6 months, the resulting sharp tightening of financial conditions and shock to corporate confidence will push the global economy towards recession,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note.
A fund manager survey by BofA Merrill Lynch conducted this month showed global funds' average cash balance soared to 5.6% from 4.6% for each of the last 3 months, marking the biggest jump in cash since the U.S. debt ceiling crisis in 2011.
""We hold more cash than we have in a while, even though the growth assets we do own are predicated on working our way through,"" said Michael Kelly, Global Head of Multi-Asset for PineBridge.
Kelly said he had liquidated some of his holdings in China-A shares and Indian equities this year, but still has exposure in the two markets.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) has fallen more than 5% since May, however, it is still up about 7% so far this year.
Meanwhile, most Asian central banks are likely to cut their policy rates this year to boost their economies, and the hopes are drawing investors to regional bonds.
Indonesia's central bank held its policy interest rate unchanged on Thursday, but cut the reserve requirement for banks and said it was now appeared a ""matter of timing and magnitude"" before it made its first cut in rates since September 2017.
Policymakers in the Philippines also kept rates steady but said there was room to ease.
(Graphic: Foreign flows into Asian bonds - https://tmsnrt.rs/2X5473s)
Recent data from regional banks and bond market associations in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and India showed foreigners bought a net $4.61 billion of regional bonds in May, while they sold $6.4 billion in equities.
BNP Paribas's Sandhu said he prefers switching to high yielding dollar emerging market bonds from equities this year.
""I think that Asian bonds, especially hard currency denominated bonds, have good yield. They have further attraction, as it takes some of the currency risks out of play,"" he said.

In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2%, led by gains in China.
The dollar fell and benchmark U.S. and euro zone government bonds fell after the Fed's move. The dollar was on course for its biggest two-day drop against a basket of other currencies in 14 months and dropped 0.5% to a half-year low against the Japanese yen.
The Fed's rate signal came before meetings at major central banks in Asia and Europe that were expected to flag similar moves. The European Central Bank and the Australian central bank had earlier signaled this week more policy stimulus was needed. 
""It becomes a race to the bottom for global rates markets, a race to the bottom for FX,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of rates at Mizuho. 
The Bank of Japan left rates unchanged on Thursday but stressed that global risks were rising, suggesting it was leaning towards boosting monetary support.
But Norway's central bank raised rates, as expected, sending the Norwegian crown up 1.6% against the dollar and 1% against the euro.
The Bank of England was due to announce its policy decision at 1100 GMT. It looked set to stick to its message that it was likely to raise rates.
Elsewhere, oil prices jumped 3% after Iran shot down a U.S. drone that its Revolutionary Guards said was flying over southern Iran, raising fears that a military confrontation could erupt between Tehran and Washington.
TRADE TALKS 
Geopolitical risks elsewhere persisted, although hopes grew for progress in U.S.-China trade talks. The world's two biggest economies have imposed increasingly severe tariffs on each other's imports. 
Chinese and U.S. officials will hold trade talks following instructions from their leaders, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday, adding that Beijing hoped Washington would create the necessary conditions for dialogue. 
Christophe Barraud, chief economist at Market Securities in Paris, said stock markets had so far mostly dodged fallout from the trade war. He warned they could suffer if economic indicators worsen in the second half of the year.
""Equities are mainly benefiting from the easy money policy, without too much damage on the economic front,"" he said. ""That may change in H2 ... metrics will likely weaken through the world because of the impact of ongoing tariffs.""
BOND YIELDS DROP 
The Fed's dovish tone caused the 10-year U.S. Treasury's yield to fall as low as 1.974%, its lowest since November 2016. It reached 2.8% in January.
Government bonds elsewhere also fell, some to near record lows. Germany's 10-year government bond yield, a benchmark for sovereign debt in the euro zone, was down 3 basis points at -0.316%, testing this week's record low of -0.327%.
Japanese 10-year bond yields fell to a three-year low of minus 0.160%, a drop of 2 basis points. The comparable Australian yield fell to a record low below 1.30%.
Brent crude futures were up $1.39, or 2.25%, at $63.28 a barrel around 0815 GMT on the tensions in the Middle East and signs of improving demand in the United States.

The supervisory board of Rocket Internet has discussed the project, Manager Magazin said. It said the most likely scenario was for Rocket Internet to buy back shares using cash on hand of 3.6 billion euros ($4.07 billion) in the company's treasury.
Holding on to his shares would see Samwer increase his stake to at least 75% from 44% currently.
A spokeswoman for Rocket Internet declined to comment on the report.
It was uncertain whether United Internet and investment company Baillie Gifford, which hold 9% and 7%, respectively, were willing to sell their stakes, Manager Magazin added.
Before Thursday's share price surge, the company had a market value of 3.7 billion euros. The shares had lost more than 20% since July last year, when they reached a three-year high.
Within months of the initial market listing in late 2014, the company's market value had ballooned to 9 billion euros.
Part of the rationale behind Samwer's plans is his preference to use Rocket as a vehicle to make stealth invests in ventures without having to comply with the disclosure obligations of a listed group, the magazine said.
After a shaky start in 2014, the group has successfully listed a raft of firms including Delivery Hero, HelloFresh and Home24.

(Reuters) - Signs that Brussels will hold off on disciplinary action over Italy's budget helped European stocks hit six-week highs on Thursday, as the latest signals of potential new monetary stimulus from the world's big central banks boosted sentiment. 
Milan's main index rallied 0.74% and its banking index gained 0.36% after officials said the European Commission was unlikely to recommend further steps next week in disciplinary procedures over the country's rising debt. 
That was a small gesture in a process that investors worry may worsen Italy's already delicate economic and fiscal prospects, but was enough to outpace a roughly half percent rise in the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
Traders said the dominant factor, however, was the Federal Reserve's signals late on Wednesday that a cut in interest rates as soon as July may be on the way, following up on a surprisingly strong speech from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi earlier this week that more action was possible.
Euro zone and German bond yields tumbled in response, pointing to more respite for European public and private sector borrowers, although interest rate sensitive banking stocks underperformed.
""Falling bonds yields are signaling that the monetary policy for the time being is going to be slightly more accommodative and may even be more accommodative going forward,"" said Florian Hense, European economist at Berenberg Bank in London.
""As we've seen inflation surprising on the downside this year, the Fed and the ECB can support expansion by cutting rates or at least signaling that it could be happening and investors like it if the message is slightly more dovish than they expected."" 
JUNE RECOVERY
Expectations of policy easing by the two central banks has helped drive a near 5% gain for the STOXX 600 this month, helping the main index recoup almost all of a steep sell-off that made May the worst month in more than two years.
Signs that the United States and China will return to the negotiating table over trade also bolstered sentiment, with tariff-sensitive auto and technology stocks gaining 1.1% and 1.4% respectively.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) rose 1.6% after its chief executive Thierry Bollore said cutting its stake in alliance partner Nissan was not on the agenda.
London's FTSE 100 was a laggard as sterling gained against a broadly weaker dollar following the Fed's message, with a Bank of England policy statement at 1100 GMT expected to continue to point in the opposite direction on rates.
Germany's DAX hit its highest level since May 3, helped by software company SAP advancing 1.5% after arch-rival Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) forecast current-quarter profit above estimates.
German food delivery company Delivery Hero jumped 11.5%, the most among the benchmark index, after raising its full year revenue outlook by 200 million euros. 

One high-profile faller was  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), which slipped 0.5 after a report U.S. federal authorities are investigating whether the German lender complied with laws meant to stop money laundering and other crimes.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: T-Mobile prepares for Boost auction if Dish Network talks stall - sources,"By Angela Moon and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc is preparing an alternative plan if a deal to sell wireless assets to Dish Network Corp falls through, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
Investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) , which is advising T-Mobile, the third largest U.S. wireless carrier, on selling prepaid brand Boost Mobile as part of the company’s concession to gain regulatory approval to buy Sprint Corp, is expected to send out books to prospective buyers in two weeks, one source familiar with the matter said.
While satellite television provider Dish Network remains the front-runner to acquire the Boost assets, Goldman has told prospective buyers as late as Tuesday that it is preparing for an upcoming auction of Boost. 
Another source characterized the process being run by Goldman as moving slowly. Among the details holding up an auction is that Goldman is not yet clear what exactly is up for sale from the merger, one source said. 
T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including to sell Boost, to gain regulatory approval for the $26.5 billion merger with Sprint, but still needs the green light from the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust chief, though his staff have recommended the agency block the deal.
A source close to the discussions said T-Mobile was hopeful it would reach an agreement with the Justice Department by early next week.
The Boost assets have stirred up interest from a variety of parties, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cable companies Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) ,  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Altice USA Inc, according to sources. 
T-Mobile and Sprint are still negotiating possible additional concessions with the Department of Justice, and Goldman Sachs is waiting for the details of the agreement before working on the terms that will be sent out to bidders, one source said.
Two potential bidders told Reuters on the condition of anonymity that they are still in the dark about critical information related to the Boost sale, such as how the Boost wireless deal with T-Mobile will be structured, or financial details about the Boost customers, which the bidders will use to determine the prepaid brand’s valuation.
Dish is also speaking with other parties on potential partnerships with Boost, sources said. 
T-Mobile has agreed to negotiate a contract with Boost’s buyer that will allow the spun-off company to run on the combined T-Mobile and Sprint network, according to a regulatory filing that outlined the merger concessions. But the carriers are currently debating whether to provide the buyer an infrastructure-based mobile virtual network operator deal, which would allow the buyer more control over the wireless plans, including control of the user’s SIM card, one source said.
That could help convince the Department of Justice to approve the merger, which has held discussions on how to preserve competition in the wireless industry.
Cable provider Altice is one of the few so-called MVNO partners to have this type of wireless agreement, which it currently has with Sprint. An infrastructure-based MVNO is generally seen as more favorable than a standard deal that allows wireless providers that do not own and operate their own network to piggyback off of one of the four major wireless carriers for wholesale prices.
Other concessions being discussed include whether T-Mobile and Sprint will divest wireless spectrum, or the airwaves that carry data, and the possibility of giving up more retail customers or retail shops from either T-Mobile or Sprint’s prepaid brands, according to one source familiar with the matter.

155,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>",U.S. CEOs to Meet China Premier This Week as Trade Woes Brew,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of chief executive officers of American corporations are set to meet with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang this week as the simmering trade war ensnares companies from both countries.
At least five CEOs of U.S. firms are attending a meeting in Beijing, people familiar with the matter said. Those include heads of chemical giant Dow Inc.,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS)., drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON)., said the people, asking not to be identified as the meeting isn’t public.
The event takes place just as the geopolitical tensions between the two powers enter a new phase. Since trade talks broke off in May, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered additional tariffs on Chinese goods and blocked local champion Huawei Technologies Co., threatening to widen the ban to Chinese video-surveillance companies. Meanwhile, Beijing has clamped down on American corporations from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. to FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). and said it will create a blacklist of foreign firms that damage their Chinese counterparts.
The CEOs will be in the Chinese capital at a key moment, a week before Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping are set to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Japan. Trump said Tuesday that he had a “very good” phone conversation with Xi, and will hold an “extended meeting” with him in Osaka, triggering a rally in financial markets.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Wednesday he’ll speak with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier Liu He, this week to prepare for the meeting between the two countries’ presidents.
Company Risk
The company chieftains’ visit was scheduled ahead of time and isn’t necessarily a response to the tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, the people said. Representatives from as many as 15 non-Chinese companies will be meeting with Chinese Premier Li this week, they said.
China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t respond to a request for more details.
Becoming collateral damage in a geopolitical dispute is a perennial risk for foreign companies in China. South Korean firms learned that in 2017, after their government agreed to deploy the U.S. Thaad missile-defense system -- intended to safeguard against attacks by North Korea -- over Chinese objections.
Korea, Canada
Brands from Hyundai Motor Co. to Amorepacific Corp. saw sales plunge amid boycotts, K-pop performances were canceled and retail conglomerate Lotte Shopping Co. was forced to largely wind down its Chinese business after allowing one of its golf courses to be used for a Thaad battery.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) Brace for China’s Wrath After Huawei Ban
Canada has been at odds with China since December, when the North American country’s police arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, in response to a U.S. extradition request. China subsequently detained two Canadians on spying allegations, prompting firms including Royal Bank of Canada to ask employees to avoid traveling there.
Some U.S. companies have started to explore alternatives to China. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google is moving some production of Nest thermostats and server hardware out of China, avoiding punitive U.S. tariffs and an increasingly hostile government in Beijing, people familiar with the matter said this month. Others, including Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) Corp. and several solar-panel makers moved some of their manufacturing to Mexico.

LE BOURGET, France (Reuters) - Airbus sealed deals with big buyers for its latest passenger jet at the Paris Airshow on Wednesday, battling back a day after a surprise order by British Airways' owner for rival Boeing's grounded 737 MAX jet.
Indigo Partners, the private equity firm of veteran low-cost airline investor Bill Franke, and American Airlines each signed up for 50 of Airbus's new long-range A321neo jet, although some orders were converted from deals on other models.
Airbus, which has not given a list price for the A321XLR, launched the new plane on Monday, aiming to carve out new routes for airlines with smaller planes and steal a march on Boeing's plans for a potential all new jet for the middle of the market. 
The deals are a big vote of confidence in the European planemaker, a day after major customer British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) signed a letter of intent to buy 200 of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jets, a model that has been grounded since March after two deadly crashes.
Asked about the IAG deal, Franke, who struck the largest-ever plane deal by number of aircraft with Airbus in 2017, called the A321neo the most efficient single-aisle jet.
Franke's Indigo Partners signed a memorandum of understanding to buy 32 of A321XLR aircraft and to convert 18 existing A320 family jet orders to the larger model.
The jets will be allocated to Hungary's Wizz Air, U.S. carrier Frontier Airlines and Chile's JetSMART, in which Indigo Partners owns stakes. Industry experts estimate the deal for the 32 aircraft could be valued at around $4.5 billion, based on a slight premium to the A321neo's list price of $129.5 million, although most airlines get significant discounts.
American Airlines, the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, said 30 of its A321XLR order were conversions of existing A321neo orders to the new version. 
""It costs a little bit more for these aircraft ... (but they offer)... greater utility for us in the long run,"" American Airlines President Robert Isom said on a podcast, highlighting opportunities for new routes, higher efficiency and less complexity among its fleet.
Airbus also said it had reached a preliminary deal to sell 11 A321neos to Taiwan's China Airlines, snatching the renewal of the airline's medium-haul fleet from Boeing.
The deal signals intensified competition in Asia where Boeing this week predicted 40 percent of jets would be delivered over the next 20 years.
Airlines are rarely persuaded to switch to rival suppliers because of the costs of training and parts, but this week's Paris Airshow has witnessed two such announcements as sold-out planemakers mount incursions to continue their growth.
In a further competitive twist, Boeing said on Monday it would take over the supply of spare parts for the remaining Airbus A320 fleet at IAG's British Airways.
'COMMUNICATIONS COUP'
Boeing's surprise deal with IAG on Tuesday enlivened a previously subdued air show, where the talk had been of the possible end of the aerospace cycle, given slowing economies and geopolitical tensions around the world - as well as Boeing's 737 MAX crisis and a long-running corruption scandal at Airbus. 
It was not immediately clear how many of the 200 aircraft eyed by IAG would wind up as firm orders and how many would be options, nor how it would affect Airbus's presence at IAG, which placed an order for 14 A321XLR hours before the announcement.
""It's a great coup, but for now it's a communications coup as it's a letter of intent. We will see what kind of deal lies behind it,"" a European industry source said.
Even so, Boeing was expected to try to capitalise quickly on the move and seek further support for the embattled MAX as it offers airlines other big packages at attractive prices.
Australia's Qantas Airways said on Wednesday it would order 10 Airbus A321XLR jets and convert a further 26 from existing orders already on the planemaker's books.
Airbus is also in talks with leasing company GECAS and U.S. airline JetBlue about potential A321XLR deals, sources familiar with the matter have said.
Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer said there was some softness in the market but did not see an increase in cancellations. He told investors he expected to win more orders for the smaller A220, formerly known as CSeries. 
Both Airbus and Boeing are cushioned by thousands of orders for the single-aisle jets. 

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury predicted a pickup in orders after a slow start to 2019. He voiced concerns about trade tensions and the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit.

NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) Corp's chief executive said another round of tariffs on Chinese goods could badly hurt his railroad and the U.S. economy, but he feels U.S. President Donald Trump is listening to his concerns.
CEO Lance Fritz listed trade as one of the reasons the company has taken a more negative tone in its growth outlook. The trade wars, along with slowing industrials and devastating floods in the U.S. Midwest, have weighed on the railroad's prospects in recent months.
He said there is no doubt that the threat of 25% tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports caused him significant concern. He met Trump on Friday.
""I was heard, understood and that's better access than we've had in a long time,"" Fritz said. 
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's rail network covers 32,000 route miles (51,000 km) in the Western two-thirds of the country and includes the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, which handles the most China ocean cargo in the United States. 
""It's hard to say how quickly (the threatened tariffs) would show up in my top line, but that would be a pretty significant risk to us,"" Fritz said at a meeting with Reuters editors and reporters on Wednesday.
Fritz's comments underscore the risk that Trump's trade war with China poses for the U.S. economy. After talks stalled, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to sit down at the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan later this month. 
Union Pacific expects 2019 volume growth in the low single-digit percentages. Volume fell 2% in the first quarter and 4% in the second quarter. Floods in the Midwest hampered Union Pacific's business in the first half of the year, along with concerns about the trade spat with China. 
Fritz would not say how much of Union Pacific's business originates and terminates in China, but said Asia accounts for an important portion of its revenue. 
U.S. exports to China tumbled 30% in the first quarter, while U.S. imports from China fell 9%, according to International Monetary Fund trade data analyzed by trade credit insurance firm Atradius.
That has hit close to home for Union Pacific, which said in April that agricultural shipments from its home state and around the Midwest tumbled since China slapped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. The railroad's agriculture products revenue fell 3% to almost $1.1 billion in the first quarter, hurt by a 7% drop in grain carloads due to reduced exports to China.
The pressure increased on June 1, when Washington hiked tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% and Beijing retaliated by boosting tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods to 25% from 5%.

The trans-Pacific standoff comes as the railroad, one of the nation's largest, has been grappling with a softening in the truck market that makes highway shipments more competitive with rail.

Dell, HP and Microsoft, which together account for 52% of the notebooks and detachable tablets sold in the United States, said the proposed tariffs would increase the cost of laptops in the country.
The move would hurt consumers and the industry, and would not address the Chinese trade practices that the Trump administration's office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) seeks to remedy, the four companies said in a joint statement posted online.
Implementing the proposed tariffs would increase U.S. prices for laptops and tablets by at least 19%, or around $120 for the average retail price of a laptop, the companies said, citing a recent study by the Consumer Technology Association.
""A price increase of that magnitude may even put laptop devices entirely out of reach for our most cost-conscious consumers,"" the companies said, noting that the price hikes would occur during peak holiday and back-to-school seasons.
In a separate statement, Microsoft, along with video game makers Nintendo of America Inc and Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC said the tariffs on video game consoles could stifle innovation, hurt consumers and put thousands of jobs at risk.
The USTR kicked off seven days of testimony from U.S. retailers, manufacturers and other businesses about Trump's plan to hit another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods with tariffs.

The hearings will end on June 25 and the tariffs will not come into effect until after July 2, when a seven-day final rebuttal comment period ends.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shareholder activists on Wednesday urged Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc to break itself up before regulators force the world's biggest internet ad seller to split into different pieces.
SumOfUs, a U.S.-based group that aims to curb the growing power of corporations, presented the proposal at Alphabet's annual shareholder meeting at an auditorium at the company's offices in Sunnyvale, California. 
Sonamtso, a campaigns director for Students for a Free Tibet who goes by one name, said at the meeting on behalf of SumOfUs that Alphabet is too big to manage.
It should sell off some assets now ""rather than waiting for antitrust regulators to set a path"" and potentially deriving less shareholder value, Sonamtso said. 
But the proposal and 13 other shareholder measures opposed by the company were voted down on Wednesday, according to its preliminary tally. Alphabet's top two executives, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, hold 51.3 percent of shareholder votes.
Nevertheless, it shows a growing focus on the prospect of antitrust action against Alphabet and other big technology firms such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as they face a political and public backlash over privacy issues and the power they now wield over the world's information.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been a frequent critic of Google, claiming without evidence that its search engine unfairly produces results unfavorable to him. He has suggested that U.S. regulators should follow Europe's lead and look closely at tech companies' monopolies, but has not suggested any specific remedy. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are gearing up to investigate whether Google, Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook misuse their massive market power, sources told Reuters earlier this month.
The 14 proposals on Alphabet's ballot were the most on any U.S. public company's ballot in a decade, according to research firm ISS Analytics, reflecting the breadth of issues facing the tech giant. 
Four Alphabet employees at the meeting separately urged company leaders to address other issues, including offering equitable pay and benefits to all employees and contractors, increasing workforce diversity and doing more to tackle climate change.
Alphabet said in shareholder materials its existing policies address the proposed measures and declined to comment further. 
Activists said they were optimistic that sustained pressure could prompt change. 
""We started as a voice in the wilderness on some of these issues, but conversations have come more to the fore,"" SumOfUs campaign manager Sondhya Gupta said. 

Alphabet shares were down 0.4 percent at $1100.65.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three key U.S. House of Representatives Democrats on Wednesday asked Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) to disclose any communications between the White House and federal agencies on the Trump administration's proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026.
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone and two subcommittee chairs asked Marathon in a letter for all documents it exchanged between the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and White House, and to disclose if the oil company was involved in the controversial rule's development.
The proposal's preferred option, announced in August 2018 but not finalized, would boost U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels a day by the 2030s.
Marathon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The letter, also signed by Representatives Paul Tonko and Jan Schakowsky, said the oil industry ""stands to profit significantly from the proposed rollback."" It also seeks details of Marathon's social media efforts related to the proposed regulation.
Pallone said Wednesday ""the oil industry is the only winner"" from the revised rules.
In April, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler denied the rules were written at the behest of oil industry lobbyists. ""This has nothing to do with the oil industry. We're not doing this for the oil industry. I'm not doing this for the oil industry,"" Wheeler told Reuters.
The Trump administration said in August that the freeze would save automakers more than $300 billion in regulatory costs and reduce the projected cost of a new vehicle by $1,850.
Deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief Heidi King said at a congressional hearing that the agencies are still reviewing more than 650,000 comments and that the agency plans to finalize the rule ""soon.""
The Democrats also seek records from the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group and other groups.

167,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 05:06PM ET</span>",Stocks - Fed Promise to Protect Economic Growth Cheers Wall Street,"Investing.com - Wall Street applauded -- but only politely -- for the Federal Reserve's vow Wednesday to move rates lower if economic uncertainties persist.
An actual rate cut might have set off a big rally, with the S&P potentially hitting a new high. But a rate cut is coming for sure in July, according to fed funds futures tracked by Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
As a result, the S&P 500 moved up 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.42% and the Dow Jones industrials rose 0.15%.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting body, held its key federal funds rate at 2.25% to 2.5%. The projection is for the levels to be cut to 2% to 2.25% in July and lower later on, possibly to 1.5% to 1.75%.
In a new conference after the Fed statement's release, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is concerned about a number of factors affecting the domestic and global economies, including slowing manufacturing growth, trade tensions, especially between the United States and China, and inflation that's too low.
Trade disputes and tariff threats have roiled markets in recent weeks. President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet in Tokyo later this month.
So, the Fed will do what it can to keep the economic expansion going. But while eight FOMC members see rates falling later this year, there wasn't much support to move rates immediately, Powell said. The one exception was James Bullard of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, who voted for a rate cut today.
The signal that a rate cut was coming helped push stocks higher after the markets flatlined for the morning and early afternoon,
Utilities, healthcare and real estate stocks were the top performing S&P 500 sectors, with energy, financial and materials stocks the laggards.
UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) were the Dow leaders. Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) were the laggards.
Among tech stocks, leaders included Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both hit new highs. So, too, did eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS). Adobe and Cadence led the Nasdaq 100 index.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was up slightly, but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was down.
Interest rates were lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 2.029%, its lowest level since Nov. 8, 2016.
WTI oil futures dropped back slightly to $53.97 a barrel after Tuesday's 4.2% gain. Brent Oil Futures were off 32 cents to $61.82. Gold futures, copper futures and silver futures were off slightly. Copper, one of the best indicators of economic confidence, is flat on the year, but down 8% in the second quarter, finishing at $2.6805 on Comex.
Winners and Losers Among S&P Stocks: 
Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day.
Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), natural-gas producer EQT (NYSE:EQT) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers."
168,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - The FOMC took a lot of uncertainty out of the stock market today, not only keeping rates steady but telegraphing its intention enough for a rate cut to be fully priced in for next month. Fed funds futures now indicate a 100% chance that rates will be a quarter-point lower in July, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor tool with at least another rate cut after that.
In addition, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed he intends to serve out his full four-year term, critical tweets from President Donald Trump notwithstanding. Now, what to focus on? Apart from any comments on trade from either Washington or Beijing, investors will be looking for rate decisions across the pond. And let’s not forget about actual stocks in the stock market with some earnings on tap.
Her are the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Initial Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Activity Expected to Fall 
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 15 . Economists forecast that initial jobless claims to decline to 220,000 from 222,000 previously.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) will release its measure of manufacturing activity in the region. The Philly Fed index is expected to fall to a reading of 10.6, from 16.6 last month, as manufacturing activity has been under pressure from the ongoing U.S.-China trade fight.
2. Bank of England to Pour Cold Water on Rate Hikes
The Bank of England is widely expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, as Brexit uncertainty continues to dominate the economic agenda, leaving the central bank with little room to maneuver.
Against the backdrop of the likely appointment of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, analysts are baking in a bigger chance the U.K. will leave the European Union without a deal. This threat could force the Bank of England to kick the rate-hike can further down road, despite calls for hawkish policy action from some members of the bank amid an uptick in wage growth and low unemployment.
""We no longer see a Bank Rate hike in August or indeed this year as likely, as no-deal could become a bigger risk quickly, with the dovish wind blowing through global monetary policy,"" Citigroup said.
3. Kroger's Earnings on Tap
Grocery chain Kroger is set to report quarterly results on Thursday before U.S. markets open. Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) is expected to report fiscal first-quarter earnings of $0.71 a share on revenue of $37.27 billion, with same-store-sales seen growing 1.7% As well as earnings, margins are expected to be closely watched amid rising competition and higher costs.
Kroger has been ramping up investments in its stores and digital business to better compete with Amazon. Kroger shares are down 14% this year and were battered after a surprisingly disappointing fiscal-fourth-quarter report in March."

Statistics Canada found Ottawa collected a combined C$55 million in revenue via federal excise and goods and services taxes. Provincial tax revenues were estimated at a combined C$132 million.
The figures were below projections, said Robyn Gibbard, an economist for the Conference Board of Canada think tank, ""thanks in part to the bumpy rollout of legalization last fall.""
""However, we think that as the kinks are worked out, governments can expect strong growth in revenues from cannabis sales going forward,"" he said in a statement.
Earlier this year, several Canadian provinces, including Ontario and British Columbia, cut their cannabis-revenue forecasts because of a slow start caused by supply shortages and higher prices compared with the black market.
In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, retail cannabis stores only opened at the beginning of April. 
Government tax revenues from cannabis sales ""may rise further in the second half of the year, as additional cannabis retail outlets are scheduled to open,"" Statistics Canada said.
Under Canada's legalization framework, the federal government receives 25% of the excise tax revenue, with the remaining amount going to the province where any given sale occurs.
Statistics Canada noted on Wednesday that general goods and services taxes on cannabis ranged between 5% and 15%, depending on the region. Excise taxes on cannabis are set at C$1 per gram or 10% of the pre-tax transaction, the agency said.

Apple's request was a result of the extended Sino-U.S. trade dispute, but a trade resolution will not lead to a change in the company's decision, Nikkei said, citing multiple sources.
The iPhone maker has decided the risks of depending heavily on manufacturing in China are too great and even rising, it said. 
Earlier this month, credit rating agency Fitch said it views Apple, Dell Technologies Inc and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) as potential blacklist candidates if China blacklists U.S. companies in retaliation for restrictions on Huawei. 
Key iPhone assemblers Foxconn, Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp, major MacBook maker Quanta Computer Inc, iPad maker Compal Electronics Inc, and AirPods makers Inventec Corp, Luxshare-ICT and Goertek have been asked to evaluate options outside of China, Nikkei reported.
The countries being considered include Mexico, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. India and Vietnam are among the favorites for smartphones, Nikkei said, citing sources who did not want to be identified as the discussions are private.
Last week, Foxconn said it had enough capacity outside China to meet Apple's demand in the American market if the company needed to adjust its production lines, as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap further $300 billion tariffs on Chinese goods. 
Analysts at Wedbush Securities said in a best case scenario Apple would be able to move 5%-7% of its iPhone production likely to India in the next 12 to 18 months. 
Given the complexity and logistics involved, brokerage said, it would take at least 2-3 years to move 15% of iPhone production from China to other regions.
""We believe this is all a poker game and Apple will not diversify production out of China overnight and certainly a long-term US/China trade deal is key for Cook & Co to sleep well at night,"" Wedbush analysts said. 
China is a key market for Apple as well as a major production center for its devices. The company got nearly 18% of its total revenue from Greater China in the quarter ended March.
Earlier in June, Trump met with Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook to discuss trade and other hot-button issues facing the tech company as Trump deliberates whether to make good on his threat to hike tariffs on imports from China.
A group of more than 30 people from Apple's capital expense studies team have been negotiating production plans with suppliers and governments over monetary incentives that could be offered to lure Apple manufacturing, the report said.
A deadline has not been set for the suppliers to finalize their business proposals, Nikkei said, adding that it would take at least 18 months to begin production after choosing a location.

Apple and Foxconn did not respond to requests for comment.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Beef-crazy Brazil, with its all-you-can-eat steak houses, world-leading meatpackers and more cattle than people, is not the first place you might look for plant-based alternatives to meat.
But companies from JBS SA, the largest beef producer in the world, to BRF SA, the No.1 chicken exporter, are looking to tap a wave of interest from environmentally conscious eaters seeking vegetable substitutes.
Spurred on by competition from fast-growing pioneers such as Beyond Meat Inc and venture capital-backed Impossible Foods, the Brazilians are joining a crowded field of innovators, with several new products for sale or under development. 
Such ""plant-based meats"" generally use a processed mix of protein from soybeans or peas, for example, blended with mushrooms or vegetables such as beets to approach a texture, appearance and taste similar to animal products. 
Of course, no one expects Brazilians to give up meat overnight. The average Brazilian eats about 42 kg (93 lbs) of meat per year, second only to the 53 kg devoured by their Argentine neighbors, according to agribusiness consultancy Athenagro.
Brazil's cattle population has grown to around 215 million, while the country has about 210 million residents, according to official statistics agency IBGE.
Yet about 30 million people in the country call themselves vegetarian, according to a poll by the Brazilian Vegetarian Society (SVB). 
Of those, 7 million are self-declared vegans, foregoing animal products altogether such as cheese, milk and eggs as well.
Consumers ranging from the strictest meat avoiders to the growing ranks of ""flextarians,"" who are looking to reduce but not eliminate meat from their diets, are finding a flood of new options in the supermarket, from vegetable sausages and hotdogs to pea-based ""chicken breast filets"".
Seara, the poultry and pork unit of JBS, is launching a plant-based hamburger, eyeing 13% of the market in three years.
""It is not a defensive move, we are only looking at opportunities,"" its marketing director José Cirilo said. 
Seara and other newcomers are taking on some established local vegetarian producers, including Superbom, a food processor linked to the country's Adventist Church, which itself reports a surge of new demand.
""Our client base today is much bigger outside of the church,"" said marketing director David Oliveira, estimating that demand for meat substitutes in Brazil is growing 30% annually.
Poultry giant BRF is also eyeing a return to the vegetarian market after discontinuing a line of non-meat products in 2010.

""It is a market that it is here to stay,"" said Fabio Baganara, BRF's R&D director, who said new innovations have allowed plant-based products to better approach the qualities of animal meat.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 approached a record high on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled potential interest cuts later this year, reassuring investors worried that the U.S.-China trade war could stall economic growth. 
Saying it ""will act as appropriate to sustain"" economic expansion, the central bank signaled rate cuts of as much as half a percentage point over the remainder of 2019.
In its statement following a two-day policy meeting, the Fed held rates steady, as expected, but dropped a previous promise to be ""patient"" in adjusting rates. 
That elevated the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial average to less than 1% from their record high closes set in late April. 
""We think the Fed delivered. It did no harm. It walked right up to a cut without doing it today. It'll likely be coming in July absent some big trade news or other news,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Bank in Columbus, Ohio.
Buoyed by growing confidence the Fed will cut rates, and by hopes of an end to the U.S.-China trade war, U.S. stocks have climbed in recent weeks. The S&P 500 has gained 6% in June.
""At the end of the day what they (the Fed) want to do is give a nod to the market. Expectations had gotten so dovish that they need to give a nod to that, but at the same time not make any commitment and be forced to cut rates later on if conditions perhaps changed,"" said Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco in New York.
The financial sector fell 0.2%, with bank stocks dipping 0.2%. Lower interest rates tend to hurt banks' profits.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.15% to end at 26,504.27 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.30% to 2,926.44.
The Nasdaq Composite added 0.42% to 7,987.32. 
Contributing more than any other stock to advances on the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc surged 5.2% after the Photoshop software provider beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and revenue.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 0.5% as its ambitious plan to launch a digital currency faced a backlash from regulators and politicians in the United States and abroad.
The healthcare sector rose 1%, helped by gains in UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc. 
Allergan jumped 6.2% after the drugmaker said its constipation drug, jointly developed with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc, improved symptoms in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 59 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.5 billion shares, compared to the 6.8 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 03:15PM ET</span>",U.S. trade representative says he can resolve Democrats' concerns on North America pact quickly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. trade negotiator said on Wednesday he is ready to work with lawmakers ""sooner rather than later"" to address concerns over a new North American pact, even as a leading Democrat outlined roadblocks to the deal's approval.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he believes Democratic lawmakers' core concerns on enforcement of labor and environmental provisions in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) can be sorted out quickly. His comments came just hours after Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said she still has many concerns over USMCA.
Opposition in Congress could prove a major hurdle for the pact, which the Trump administration hopes to claim as its first major trade deal victory ahead of the 2020 presidential election cycle. 
President Donald Trump has said bad trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have cost millions of American jobs and promised repeatedly on the campaign trail to overhaul them.
""In terms of coming to agreement with members, I could sit down in a half a day and work out the labor provision and the environmental provision,"" Lighthizer said at a hearing of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee. 
Democratic House speaker Pelosi said earlier on Wednesday that she sees several impediments to congressional approval of USMCA, including enforcement tools, labor and environmental protections and provisions on pharmaceuticals.
The deal cannot simply be ""NAFTA with sugar on top,"" Pelosi told reporters. 
""There are good provisions in the bill, but if you don't have enforcement, you just have provisions in a bill,” Pelosi said. She said Democrats have a potential proposal for enforcement and added pharmaceuticals are a ""big issue"". 
USMCA, which replaces NAFTA, was signed by the countries' leaders in late 2018 but has yet to be ratified. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet with Trump to discuss the deal's ratification.
Wednesday was Lighthizer's second appearance this week at a congressional hearing to address lawmakers' concerns over Trump administration trade policy, including a trade war with China.
Lighthizer reaffirmed on Wednesday that he did not believe the agreement needed to be reopened to address Democrats' concerns.

U.S. stocks traded close to record highs and Treasuries rallied, while the dollar weakened by the most since March after the Federal Reserve struck a dovish tone in its latest policy statement.
The S&P 500 pushed within striking distance of an all-time high before paring gains. The two-year note yield slipped to as low as 1.77% after the central bank kept rates steady and signaled a readiness to cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. Moves were somewhat muted after markets had been pricing in such a turn for the past few weeks. Crude oil fluctuated.
“We’re definitely hearing a decidedly more dovish Fed,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial. “While you could point the finger at pressure from the White House, it’s key to remember that the Fed’s focus has always been on two things and two things only: Jobs and inflation.”
Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues dropped a reference in their statement to being “patient” on borrowing costs and forecast a larger miss of their 2% inflation target this year. Policy makers kept their key rate in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
As many of the world’s biggest central banks signal a shift to easier policy, traders are weighing that against trade war fears and signs of cooling global growth. U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he had a “very good” phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two leaders will hold an “extended meeting” at the G-20 summit on June 28-29 in Osaka.
“Members of the Fed handed the markets what they were looking for by now predicting rate cuts,” said Bryce Doty, senior vice president at Sit Investment Associates. “I can’t help feeling that many will see that a precedent has been set: Higher trade tariffs bring rate cuts.”

179,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>","Lloyd's to meet with insurers AIG, Chubb to boost U.S. business: CEO","By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London Ltd is meeting with major U.S. insurers about driving more business through its global insurance market, Chief Executive Officer John Neal said on Wednesday.
The 330-year-old insurance market, which launched its most recent modernization effort in May, will meet with American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) on Thursday, and later with Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd about potential opportunities for selling more of their insurance products through Lloyd's, Neal told Reuters.
Neal, who took charge of Lloyd's in late 2018, is trying to drag Lloyd's into the 21st century, following combined losses of $3.9 billion over the last two years. Lloyd's insures everything from hurricane damage to soccer stars' legs, but high levels of insured losses from natural catastrophes triggered the two years of poor results.
While Lloyd's outlined plans last month to set up electronic platforms as soon as next year, its intricate structure involving 99 underwriting syndicate members and hundreds of brokers makes change difficult.
Neal said his strategy includes shifting Lloyd's geographic focus, including concentrating on developed markets with strong growth potential such as the United States. The United States and Canada accounted for 51% of Lloyd's business last year.
Lloyd's kicked off its U.S. strategy during a dinner on Tuesday for top insurance and brokerage executives in New York's new World Trade Center building, a site that following the destruction of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was rebuilt partly with $8 billion in claims payments from the Lloyd's marketplace, its chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, said.
""We are talking to all of the big insurers here...to say, How do you feel about the marketplace and what opportunities can we help you realize in the Lloyd's marketplace?"" Neal said, adding that both AIG and Chubb are interested in the conversation.
Lloyd's has already been talking to AIG, including CEO Brian Duperreault and Peter Zaffino, CEO of AIG's General Insurance business, about the possibility of selling more products through the marketplace, Neal said.
AIG acquired Bermuda reinsurer Validus in 2018, partly because of its Talbot unit, a Lloyd's of London syndicate, Duperreault said at the time.
""Our impression from any conversations with (Duperreault) and Zaffino is that they'd love to grow their business at Lloyd's,"" Neal said.
Neal said his London-based colleagues were surprised when he proposed the United States as a priority because they believed emerging economies had more growth potential.
He sees growth potential in several U.S. areas, including specialty insurance, which covers unique risks such as damage to a company's reputation, or liability for a merger deal that goes sour. ""Professional lines"" insurance, which includes liability coverage for corporate directors and officers, is another possible growth area, Neal said.
The global commercial, corporate, specialty insurance and reinsurance business is worth $750 billion, and half of those premiums are in the United States, Neal said.

""So literally, one dollar in two of everything that would interest Lloyd's underwriters is here,"" he said.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>","Canada opens probe into 250,000 GM pickups, SUVs over brake performance","(Reuters) - Transport Canada, the auto safety regulator, has opened a probe into braking issues in nearly 250,000 General Motors (NYSE:GM) full-size pickups and SUVs after U.S. officials launched a similar probe last year, the agency said on its website.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in November into 2.73 million U.S. 2014-2016 model year SUVs and pickups after receiving 487 reports of hard brake pedal effort accompanied by extended stopping distance that were attributed to deterioration of the engine-driven brake assist vacuum pump.
Transport Canada's probe covers 249,700 2015 through 2017 model year vehicles including the Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon as well as 2014-2017 Chevrolet Silverado LD and GMC Sierra LD vehicles.
The U.S. agency said it had reports of nine incidents of vehicles incurring damage as a result of colliding with another vehicle or fixed object at low speeds and reports of two injuries. NHTSA said if the pump fails to operate, the amount of brake power assist can be significantly reduced, extending vehicle stopping distance.

The NHTSA sent GM an information request in a Feb. 7 letter. A GM spokesman said he had no update on the investigation.

181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 02:50PM ET</span>",‘As Close as They Could Come to Cutting’: Wall Street Reacts to the FOMC,"(Bloomberg) -- While the Federal Reserve held rates steady Wednesday, investors said evidence is building for a reduction later in the year. The deletion of the pledge by policy makers to stay “patient” before economic data and estimates from eight of 17 members that the Fed funds rate would fall in 2019 supported risk assets including stocks.
Here’s what investors and strategists had to say:
Ellen Hazen, senior vice president and portfolio manager for F.L. Putnam
“Reading the tea leaves, both they and the market are setting up for cuts to happen within the next few meetings. I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw it next meeting and they’re laying the groundwork in both the speeches and the language of the statement today.”
Mike DePalma, managing director at MacKay Shields:
“They pretty much did what the market was expecting. They removed the word ‘patient’ from the statement, which is what everyone thought they would do. That would be the way to signal dovishness. And Powell seems to have repeated everything he said in his speech two weeks ago. So frankly, I don’t think there’s any surprises here at all. If there is a surprise, it’s that there’s some differences of opinion on the Fed -- so they didn’t all vote the same way but eight of them thought rates would be lower by the end of the year. So that’s a lot.”
Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance:
“It looks like the Fed gave the market what it wanted by removing the word patient from the statement. It also showed with the dots that they are leaning very dovishly and July is absolutely on the table as the market was predicting.”
Michael Gapen,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc economist:
“This is about as close as they could come to cutting today and in fact the fate of the members are forecasting it by at least year end. It’s walking it right up to the point and the markets will now expect action in July. Yes, the outcome of the G-20 meeting matters.”
Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital LLC:
“The market had a slightly dovish reaction, liking the fact that ‘patient’ was removed, ‘act as appropriate’ was inserted. Eight officials support a cut by the end of the year, and nine by 2020, and importantly the long term neutral rate comes down 30 bps, and Bullard dissents to say ‘cut it now.’ The Fed also capitulated and lowered its PCE inflation forecasts. However, this does not change the overall picture too much.”"

Gold has posted four straight weekly gains, partly on bets that the Fed will lower interest rates amid signs that escalating trade disputes are affecting the U.S. economy. Low rates are a boon to precious metals, which don’t offer yields.
“Even though the Fed didn’t cut rates, the market expectation for a dovish environment and a likely rate cut in July are positive for gold,” Maxwell Gold, the New York-based director of investment strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said by email. “As concerns around slowing global growth and trade put further pressure on monetary policy globally gold may see further support.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should create a new body to promote a positive ""vision"" for banking and cut taxes on the industry after failing to support the sector adequately ahead of Brexit, banking trade body UK Finance's chair said on Wednesday.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 but so far has not secured an exit deal.
To avoid disruption, London-based banks have moved some staff and activities to new hubs in the European Union to maintain customer links, raising questions about the capital's future clout in global finance.
The government dropped its support for the finance industry's proposal for mutual recognition post-Brexit to focus instead on a more generous form of future market access to the EU than normally given to non-EU countries.
""I do not think it’s unfair to say that since the financial crisis and particularly during the Brexit negotiations, our sector and services generally have seen nothing like the level of strategic support and attention from government that has been granted to goods and to technology,"" Bob Wigley told the UK Finance's summer reception.
Wigley said the government should create a new, formal body made up of regulators, government officials and the Bank of England governor to set out a positive national vision for the role of the finance industry.
The aggregate rate of tax paid by banks in New York and Frankfurt is much lower than in London, he said.
""This cannot be sustainable post Brexit without an even larger outflux of international banks than Brexit itself may deliver,"" Wigley said.
UK Finance members like RBS (LON:RBS) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) had to be bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis that ushered in years of belt-tightening for millions of Britons.
As a result, the industry is considered still too unpopular for politicians to be seen supporting it even though finance is Britain's biggest economic sector, generating an annual trade surplus of about 70 billion pounds.
""With the loss of passporting on Brexit, we will need to find ways of making the UK internationally attractive if we are to retain and attract international banks here,"" Wigley said.
Banks were not pitching for a return to pre-financial crisis light regulation, though better coordination among regulators was needed, he said.
""Right now, we are seeing a multitude of new regulatory interventions being delivered by multiple regulators with at best insufficient coordination and at worst conflict,"" Wigley said.
""So the first thing this body needs to do is ensure that regulatory initiatives are formulated and implemented with what we call effective air-traffic control – prioritisation and orderly implementation.""
He called for a review of rules to ease the burden on mid-tier and smaller banks, saying poor promotion of competition in the sector meant there is only one mid-tier bank with assets over 50 billion pounds.
He singled out a letter from the Bank of England last week telling 20 small ""challenger"" banks they needed better controls as they could underestimate the impact of a downturn on their loan books.
It ""illustrates an embedded anti-growth, anti-competition bias within the system"" that a new body should correct, Wigley said.
In a week when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it was looking to launch its own crypto currency to expand into payments, Wigley said that ""Big Tech"" firms moving into banking services should be regulated in a similar way to banks.

""Regulation 2.0 needs to be developed to deal with their business models,"" Wigley said.

Jabil Circuit (NYSE:JBL) said postmarket Tuesday it generated fiscal third-quarter earnings of to $0.57 in Q3, in line with guidance, but revenues of $6.14 billion topped expectations for $6.01 billion, sending its share price more than 10% higher on the day.
The revenue beat was led by new contract wins in its electronic manufacturing services segment and comes at a time when semiconductor companies continue to face headwinds on multiple fronts, including a slowdown in global smartphone markets.
Jabil offers design, manufacturing, supply chain and product management services for a wide array of industries.
CFRA, an independent research firm, raised its target on Jabil to $34 from $31 on expectations that free cash flows in 2020 could be propped up by lower interest expense and improved working capital.
Looking ahead, however, Jabil warned of continued weakness in semi-capital equipment, automotive and telecom services. The last group counts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a major customer, and Apple contributing nearly 28% to overall company sales.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Jim Suva wrote in a note that he is encouraged by the company's efforts, but added that disappointing Apple results or guidance could pressure Jabil.
The company guided fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.96, compared with estimates from Investing.com of $0.86 for EPS on revenue of $6.42 billion."

194,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 01:55PM ET</span>","Britain's bankers call for more support, tax cuts after Brexit","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should create a new body to promote a positive ""vision"" for banking and cut taxes on the industry after failing to support the sector adequately ahead of Brexit, banking trade body UK Finance's chair said on Wednesday.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 but so far has not secured an exit deal.
To avoid disruption, London-based banks have moved some staff and activities to new hubs in the European Union to maintain customer links, raising questions about the capital's future clout in global finance.
The government dropped its support for the finance industry's proposal for mutual recognition post-Brexit to focus instead on a more generous form of future market access to the EU than normally given to non-EU countries.
""I do not think it’s unfair to say that since the financial crisis and particularly during the Brexit negotiations, our sector and services generally have seen nothing like the level of strategic support and attention from government that has been granted to goods and to technology,"" Bob Wigley told the UK Finance's summer reception.
Wigley said the government should create a new, formal body made up of regulators, government officials and the Bank of England governor to set out a positive national vision for the role of the finance industry.
The aggregate rate of tax paid by banks in New York and Frankfurt is much lower than in London, he said.
""This cannot be sustainable post Brexit without an even larger outflux of international banks than Brexit itself may deliver,"" Wigley said.
UK Finance members like RBS (LON:RBS) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) had to be bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis that ushered in years of belt-tightening for millions of Britons.
As a result, the industry is considered still too unpopular for politicians to be seen supporting it even though finance is Britain's biggest economic sector, generating an annual trade surplus of about 70 billion pounds.
""With the loss of passporting on Brexit, we will need to find ways of making the UK internationally attractive if we are to retain and attract international banks here,"" Wigley said.
Banks were not pitching for a return to pre-financial crisis light regulation, though better coordination among regulators was needed, he said.
""Right now, we are seeing a multitude of new regulatory interventions being delivered by multiple regulators with at best insufficient coordination and at worst conflict,"" Wigley said.
""So the first thing this body needs to do is ensure that regulatory initiatives are formulated and implemented with what we call effective air-traffic control – prioritisation and orderly implementation.""
He called for a review of rules to ease the burden on mid-tier and smaller banks, saying poor promotion of competition in the sector meant there is only one mid-tier bank with assets over 50 billion pounds.
He singled out a letter from the Bank of England last week telling 20 small ""challenger"" banks they needed better controls as they could underestimate the impact of a downturn on their loan books.
It ""illustrates an embedded anti-growth, anti-competition bias within the system"" that a new body should correct, Wigley said.
In a week when Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it was looking to launch its own crypto currency to expand into payments, Wigley said that ""Big Tech"" firms moving into banking services should be regulated in a similar way to banks.

""Regulation 2.0 needs to be developed to deal with their business models,"" Wigley said.

195,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>","Stockbeat - Jabil Jumps on Earnings Joy, but Warns Outlook to Remain Jaded","Investing.com -  Jabil Circuit  soared Wednesday as its fiscal third-quarter revenue beat estimates and drew praise from Wall Street, though the chipmaker warned growth in the sector would continue to stutter.
Jabil Circuit (NYSE:JBL) said postmarket Tuesday it generated fiscal third-quarter earnings of to $0.57 in Q3, in line with guidance, but revenues of $6.14 billion topped expectations for $6.01 billion, sending its share price more than 10% higher on the day.
The revenue beat was led by new contract wins in its electronic manufacturing services segment and comes at a time when semiconductor companies continue to face headwinds on multiple fronts, including a slowdown in global smartphone markets.
Jabil offers design, manufacturing, supply chain and product management services for a wide array of industries.
CFRA, an independent research firm, raised its target on Jabil to $34 from $31 on expectations that free cash flows in 2020 could be propped up by lower interest expense and improved working capital.
Looking ahead, however, Jabil warned of continued weakness in semi-capital equipment, automotive and telecom services. The last group counts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a major customer, and Apple contributing nearly 28% to overall company sales.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Jim Suva wrote in a note that he is encouraged by the company's efforts, but added that disappointing Apple results or guidance could pressure Jabil.
The company guided fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.96, compared with estimates from Investing.com of $0.86 for EPS on revenue of $6.42 billion."
196,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Short Seller That Targeted Noble Group Takes Aim at Another Trading House,"(Bloomberg) -- Iceberg Research, the short seller that targeted commodities trader Noble Group Ltd., has another trading house in its sights: Trafigura Group Ltd.
Trafigura is overstating the value of debt securities related to its 49.5% stake in Porto Sudeste, an iron ore export terminal in Brazil, Iceberg, headed by Arnaud Vagner, said Wednesday in a report on its website. Iceberg estimates those securities may be worth only a 10th of the $490 million carrying value that Trafigura attributes to them.
“We found that Trafigura ignores economic reality to aggressively overvalue hundreds of millions in debt securities issued by an associate,” Iceberg said, adding that it holds a short position in Trafigura’s debt.
A spokeswoman for Trafigura in Geneva declined to immediately comment. Trafigura is the world’s second-biggest independent oil and metals trader, but also owns infrastructure and mining assets.
The report increases scrutiny on Trafigura’s accounting. While the company is closely held, it’s long been followed by hedge funds and other investors looking to profit from fluctuations in its bonds. The publication is the first time Iceberg has targeted a commodities trader since a series of reports, starting in 2015, alleging aggressive accounting at Hong Kong’s Noble Group.
Trafigura’s $400 million of senior bonds due in 2023 were indicated 2 cents on the dollar lower at about 93 cents on Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Valuation Change
Iceberg said that in 2015 Trafigura switched from a mark-to-market valuation of the Porto Sudeste securities to relying on its own calculation to determine their value -- a Level 3 valuation in accounting jargon. After adopting that accounting methodology, Trafigura booked revaluation gains on the securities in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019, Iceberg said.
The revaluation gains boosted Trafigura’s profit, while ignoring a decline in the market value of the securities and the financial uncertainty highlighted by Porto Sudeste’s auditor, Ernst & Young, Iceberg said.
“It seems Trafigura thinks they are smarter than the market when valuing securities,” Iceberg said.
Vagner, a former Noble credit analyst, published the reports on Noble anonymously. The allegations started a downward spiral for what was once Asia’s largest commodities trader, forcing billions of dollars in asset writedowns, and an eventual court-supervised debt restructuring in 2018.
Noble always denied Iceberg’s allegations and sued Vagner in Hong Kong, alleging he and a Seychelles-registered company conspired to damage the commodities trader by anonymously spreading false and misleading information. Vagner denies the allegations in the ongoing suit. He revealed himself to be behind the Iceberg reports for the first time last year.
Trafigura and Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, bought a controlling stake in the company developing Porto Sudeste in 2014 for about $400 million from a venture of former billionaire Eike Batista.
The port has struggled to attract users and remains underutilized. Brazil’s iron ore sector is dominated by Vale SA, which has its own export facilities. Trafigura said the port handled 9.5 million tons of ore in 2018, well below its capacity of 50 million tons.
Profit Rebound
Trafigura said this month that its adjusted debt rose to $7.6 billion at the end of March, from $6 billion six months earlier. Total debt climbed to $32.7 billion, the highest among the major independent commodities traders.
Fiscal first-half profit jumped by 92%, after oil-trading earnings rebounded sharply. That came after Trafigura’s profit declined for four straight years amid dismal metals markets and a shift in oil markets, which made it tougher to make money storing crude to sell later at higher prices.
Trafigura has more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) of bonds outstanding, but hasn’t requested a rating from major Western agencies. It was awarded a AAA rating by China Chengxin International Rating and China Lianhe Credit Rating for its maiden yuan bond sale last year.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 01:27PM ET</span>","'Sully' Sullenberger blasts U.S. aircraft certification process, says 737 MAX pilots need new simulator training","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who in 2009 landed a US Airways flight safely on the Hudson River in New York, told a congressional panel on Wednesday that pilots of the now-grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX should get new simulator training before the plane returns to service.
Sullenberger, who has blasted  Boeing Co  and the Federal Aviation Administration for their roles in the two 737 MAX crashes since October that killed 346 people, also said the U.S. system of certifying new aircraft is not working.
""Our current system of aircraft design and certification has failed us,"" he said.
His testimony came during a hearing meant to give lawmakers looking into Boeing and the 737 MAX crashes a better understanding of views on the steps needed to prevent similar crashes, particularly given the rising use of automation on airplanes.
Boeing said in May it had completed an update to software, known as MCAS, which would stop erroneous data from triggering an anti-stall system that automatically turned down the noses of the two planes that crashed, despite pilot efforts to stop it.
Sullenberger told the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that ""it is clear that the original version of MCAS was fatally flawed and should never have been approved.""
Allied Pilots Association President Daniel Carey told the committee that getting all pilots in simulators before the 737 MAX returns to service poses logistical issues, with 4,200 737 MAX pilots at American Airlines and 9,000 737 MAX pilots at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). 
Boeing has said that simulator training is not necessary, and is recommending a mandatory computer-based course that explains MCAS and could be completed at a pilot’s home in about an hour, according to pilot unions. 
Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said in May he had not decided on whether or not to require simulator training, but some foreign governments have also expressed support for additional simulator training.
Carey said pilots could get computer- and video-based training before the plane returns to service and then all could get into simulators within 10 months.
Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio criticized Boeing for failing to disclose details about the MCAS system to pilots. ""The pilots didn't know it existed,"" DeFazio said.
DeFazio said Wednesday he plans a future hearing with Boeing. Boeing did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
Two people briefed on the matter said Boeing is set to conduct a certification flight as early as next week before it formally submits its software upgrade and training proposal.
Sharon Pinkerton, a vice president at Airlines for America, an industry trade group that represents American and Southwest, said airlines are relying on the FAA and the independent flight standard board for guidance.
""We are confident that working with those independent experts, involving our pilots unions, they will come to the right decision about what kind of training is needed and we will provide that training,"" Pinkerton told the panel.
Federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Transportation Department's inspector general, congressional panels and a number of independent committees are reviewing the 737 MAX's certification. Some in Congress have criticized the long-standing FAA practice of designating some certification tasks to Boeing or other aircraft manufacturers.
In a commentary in March on CBS MarketWatch, Sullenberger said ""there is too cozy a relationship between the industry and the regulators"" for proper oversight to be assured.
Major U.S. airlines have canceled flights into early September because of the grounding of the 737 MAX.

Sullenberger managed to glide his Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River after hitting a flock of geese shortly after takeoff, saving all 155 on board, in what became known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson.""

The UAW's legislative director, Josh Nassar, will tell two subcommittees of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee that the union, which represents workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, shares automakers' concerns the proposal ""could lead to protracted litigation and uncertainty in the industry that will limit growth.""
Deputy National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator (NHTSA) Heidi King told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday that existing fuel efficiency standards have hiked the cost of new vehicles and may ""discourage consumers from replacing their older car with a newer car that is safer, cleaner and more fuel efficient.""
King said NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Administration are reviewing more than 650,000 comments but said the agencies plan issue a final rule ""soon.""
King and Bill Wehrum, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, will testify on Thursday at the House hearing. Mary Nichols, who heads the California Air Resources Board, will also testify on Thursday.
The Trump administration's ""preferred alternative"" would increase U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels a day by the 2030s but reduce automakers’ regulatory costs by more than $300 billion, the agencies said.
Earlier this month, 17 major automakers including GM, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp, urged the White House to resume talks with California aimed at avoiding a lengthy legal battle over the standards. Automakers backed a compromise, warning that the lack of a deal could lead to ""an extended period of litigation and instability.""
The car companies urged a compromise ""midway"" between the Obama era standards that require annual decreases of about 5% in emissions and the Trump administration’s proposal.
Nassar will say that the UAW urged California, the White House and others ""to develop balanced regulations that are good for the environment, American workers, U.S. manufacturing, and the economy.""

205,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",U.S. fund Apollo presents rescue plan for Italy's Carige: sources,"MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. private equity fund Apollo Global Management has presented a draft rescue plan for Italy's troubled bank Carige, three sources close to the matter said.
Meanwhile, Italian banks are considering whether they could step in to plug Carige's entire capital shortfall, the head of a deposit guarantee fund made up of all of the country's banks said on Wednesday. 
Carige, which was placed under special administration by the European Central Bank in January, has a capital shortfall of 630 million euros ($706 million). 
Carige's temporary administrators have been trying to find a buyer for months but their efforts were thrown into disarray last month when BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) pulled out of a proposed rescue plan. That plan included the conversion into equity of a 320 million euro bond held by the FITD deposit guarantee fund. 
Two of the sources said on Wednesday Apollo, which already owns Carige's insurance units, had presented its offer through Italian broker Equita, which is acting as its adviser. 
Salvatore Maccarone, who heads the FITD fund, said it had received an offer by an unnamed party, but it was still at such an early stage that the fund could not assess it.
Apollo was not immediately available for comment.
Italian newspaper Il Messaggero said on Wednesday the offer by Apollo called for a capital increase of 450-500 million euros, of which the U.S. fund would cover around 120-130 million euros. 
The banks would plug the bulk of the remainder through the 320 million euros bond conversion, which would give them a controlling stake in Carige. According to the paper, Apollo wants an option to buy the banks' stake in Carige for 1 euro.
Such a plan might be difficult to swallow for both Italy's government and the country's banks.
Maccarone said on Wednesday the banks were considering whether to plug Carige's entire capital shortfall themselves, without Apollo's intervention.
Back in 2016, the U.S. fund had offered to buy a controlling stake in Carige in a 550-million euros cash call, but the bank's top shareholder - the Malacalza family of steel entrepreneurs - rejected the bid saying it did not reflect Carige's market value.

The Malacalzas have a 27.6 percent stake in Carige. Vittorio Malacalza was quoted as saying at the weekend that Apollo's renewed interest for the bank was not based on an industrial project.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 11:00AM ET</span>",Renault CEO Bollore has no plans to reduce Nissan stake,"By Munsif Vengattil
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Cutting its stake in alliance partner Nissan is not on Renault's agenda, the French carmaker's chief executive Thierry Bollore said on Wednesday after a global vehicle launch in New Delhi.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) are looking for ways to resuscitate a failed merger plan and secure Nissan's approval, Reuters reported this month. 
As part of the fallout of the collapse of talks, Nissan is poised to urge Renault to significantly cut its 43.4% stake in the Japanese carmaker, two people told Reuters.
""This is not at all our agenda,"" Bollore told reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday when asked if Renault would reduce its stake in Nissan to get a deal with FCA.
""For us it is so important that we continuously improve our alliance. Not only for now, but also for the future and this is the mindset which we are in, and these are the discussions we have with our partners,"" Bollore said after the global launch of Renault's Triber multi-purpose vehicle.
Bollore said the alliance partners planned to meet in early July and while he declined to disclose the agenda, he added that it would be ""massive"". 
The 20-year-old partnership between Nissan and Renault has been strained since the alliance's former chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested for suspected financial misconduct in November. Ghosn denies any wrongdoing.
The alliance was plunged further into crisis this month as Renault's demand for a greater say in Nissan's governance drew rare public censure by the Japanese automaker. 
Nissan is due to hold a shareholder meeting to vote on its overhauled governance structure on June 25. Bollore said Renault would participate, but the talks were private.
Renault and FCA were in $35 billion merger talks until the Italian-American carmaker withdrew after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked a vote by its board and demanded more time to win Nissan's backing.

Bollore said there is no offer from FCA on the table and declined to comment on the role of the French government.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank seeks to shed risky assets as part of overhaul: sources,"By Tom Sims and Hans Seidenstuecker
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is aiming to cut up to a quarter of its riskiest assets in the next few years, people familiar with the matter said, shedding more light on how the German lender is trying to overhaul its business and revive profitability.
The plan provides more detail on a restructuring expected since Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" to turn the bank around after it botched an attempted merger with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The bank's shares, which have hit record lows in June, have perked up on expectations that a major overhaul is underway.
Deutsche is expected to talk to top investors within days to elaborate on its plans, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The group will unveil the strategy in July, other people say.
The bank has struggled to bounce back after the 2008 financial crisis and has been plagued by failed regulatory stress tests, multi-billion dollar fines and management upheavals and most recently a failed merger.
Deutsche's biggest business by revenues is its investment bank, which holds swathes of high-risk assets such as complex derivatives. Cutting back on risky assets would in theory allow Deutsche to hold less capital and use this money for other purposes to try to boost profit.
Under the plan, Deutsche will reduce its so-called risk-weighted assets by between 20% and 25% over the next three-to-five years, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Risk weighting is where a bank assigns a risk of losses to an asset, such as a derivative or loan. That, in turn, determines how much capital it needs to cover such a loss.
The bank held 347 billion euros ($388.61 billion) in such assets at the end of the first quarter, according to Deutsche's quarterly results. A 25% reduction would bring assets to about 260 billion euros. 
Deutsche Bank declined to comment but said it was working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. ""We will update all stakeholders if and when required,"" the bank said.
Other changes include shrinking or shutting equity and rates trading businesses outside of Europe. Deutsche is also planning to create a ""bad bank"" for non-core assets, which can be a way to reduce risky assets over time. In an internal bad bank, risk weighted assets remain on the bank's balance sheet until they are wound down.
One of the big open questions is how many jobs Deutsche will cut. The bank has already pledged to reduce headcount to under 90,000, from the current 91,463. 
Analysts and some investors would like to see a staff reduction of more than 10% for the overhaul to be credible. 
Deutsche management is also in flux. Pressure to step down has been building on Garth Ritchie, head of the investment bank, and Sylvie Matherat, chief regulatory officer, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The bank has declined to comment on the possible shake-up.
The revamp will delay further some of the bank's goals. Deutsche is widely expected to miss its key profitability target - a return on tangible equity of 4% - in 2019.
Swiss banks UBS and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) have already restructured by paring down their investment banks and are today on stronger footing, providing hope for Deutsche Bank, analysts say.
But competition is heating up on Deutsche's home turf.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) earlier this year opened its new European Union headquarters in Frankfurt next door to Deutsche's head office.

The bank aims to take on Deutsche's core clientele - big German corporations - by offering them services in far flung countries, Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters told reporters on Tuesday.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 10:39AM ET</span>",Explainer: Can European steel forge a strategy to withstand U.S. tariffs?,"By Barbara Lewis and Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) - Steelmakers in Europe have been hit by falling demand and rising supply as auto-sector consumption has fallen and U.S. steel tariffs have disrupted shipments.
Britain's second biggest steel producer British Steel, which collapsed in May, is a high-profile casualty.
Days later, the world's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal cut European production for a second time in a month.
Industry leaders meet on June 26 in Brussels to assess what next.
The following addresses some of the questions.
WHY IS EUROPEAN STEEL IN CRISIS?
Higher raw material prices have squeezed steelmakers' profit margins. A Vale dam collapse in Brazil in January led to reduced iron ore output, needed for steelmaking, fuelling a doubling of iron ore prices over the last 12 months, while coking coal is about 10% more expensive.
At the same time, steel rebar prices on the London Metal Exchange have shed more than a fifth and steel company shares in May sank to their lowest since 2016. EU steel output is also down, slipping by 4% in April. 
Meanwhile, Washington's 25% import tariffs have effectively closed the U.S. market, pushing steel shipments to Europe. Despite EU safeguard measures designed to prevent excess shipments from abroad, imports accounted for 10% of the EU market in 2018, double the share the year before.
(Graphic: European Steelmakers Squeezed - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ImCN8B)
WHO'S DOING WELL, BADLY?
The collapse of British Steel is an extreme example of the impact of the European steel crisis. 
The company's liquidation in May followed the combination of higher input costs and a miscalculation on the EU carbon market.
Analysts say the uncertainty surrounding Britain's departure from the European Union aggravated the misfortunes of British Steel, which relied on the EU for 70% of its sales. European rivals are better placed to supply for instance Germany's car manufacturers. 
The Official Receiver has said it is working with ""interested parties to explore how to preserve the company as a going concern"". A mid-June deadline for firm bids has been extended until at least the end of the month.
Moody's ratings agency lowered its outlook on the European steel industry in May to negative from stable citing poor demand, high imports and falling steel prices.
Analysts say, however, ArcelorMittal has a strong balance sheet and its global reach means it is well-placed to benefit from any wider recovery in steel demand and any strengthening of EU measures to counter imports.
Austria's Voestalpine is insulated from the steel cycle by its high-end product portfolio sold on long-term contracts. 
WHAT CAN EUROPE DO?
The European Commission, the EU executive, is reviewing its safeguard measures designed to counter the U.S. tariffs.
Quotas are set at the average level of imports in 2015-2017 plus 5%, with further 5% hikes envisaged on July 1 and a year later. Beyond these quotas, 25% tariffs apply.
The industry says tougher steps are needed. It says the U.S. tariffs have pushed more steel into Europe, especially from Turkey, which has overtaken China as the EU's biggest foreign steel supplier.
ArcelorMittal in an emailed statement said market conditions were ""incredibly challenging"".
""The unfortunate reality is the EU safeguard measures have not proved effective in countering a re-direction of trade flows as a result of the Section 232 tariffs introduced in the U.S., and urgently need strengthening,"" a company spokesman said.
(Graphic: EU Steel Imports FromTurkey Overtake China's - https://tmsnrt.rs/2InxUw0)
STRATEGIC INDUSTRY?
The British government has so far stopped short of a clear industrial strategy.
The European Commission has said steel is a strategic industry, but some industry representatives question whether the Commission is doing enough.

Its decision in June to block Thyssenkrupp's and Tata Steel's plan to form a landmark joint venture, has deprived the sector of the consolidation many analysts say is essential to survival. The Commission was concerned the deal would have pushed up prices and reduced competition.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>","Explainer: Who pays Trump's tariffs, China or U.S. customers and companies?","(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump says China pays the tariffs he has imposed on $250 billion of Chinese exports to the United States.
But that is not how tariffs work. China's government and companies in China do not pay tariffs directly. Tariffs are a tax on imports. They are paid by U.S.-registered firms to U.S. customs for the goods they import into the United States.
Importers often pass the costs of tariffs on to customers - manufacturers and consumers in the United States - by raising their prices.
U.S. business executives and economists say U.S. consumers foot much of the bill through rising prices.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has acknowledged that ""both sides will suffer on this,"" contradicting the president.
The tariff bill is set to rise further. Trump this month directed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to launch the process of imposing tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of goods from China. That includes products ranging from cellphones to baby pacifiers.
That would mean almost all imports from China would be subject to a 25 percent import tax.
U.S. COMPANIES SEE RISING CONSUMER PRICES
A growing number of U.S. companies has warned about the negative impact of the tariffs on U.S. consumers.
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and 172 other footwear companies have urged Trump to remove footwear from a list of imports facing a proposed extra 25% tariff, warning the move could cost consumers an additional $7 billion a year.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest retailer, and department store chain Macy's Inc have warned that prices for shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on goods from China.
WHAT THE 'TARIFF MAN' SAYS
Trump, who has called himself the ""Tariff Man,"" has often repeated that China pays for U.S. tariffs on its goods.
""We have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury — billions — from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in,"" he said on Jan. 24.
On May 5, he tweeted: ""For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA.""
As well as imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump has also imposed a tax on global steel and aluminum imports and shipments of washing machines and solar panels.
HOW TARIFFS REALLY WORK
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects the tax on imports. The agency typically requires importers to pay duties within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs. 
Through May 1, Washington has assessed $23.7 billion in tariffs since early 2018, according to data from the CBP.
Total tariff revenue - including levies that pre-dated Trump - shot up by 89% in the first half of the current fiscal year starting Oct. 1, to a total of $34.7 billion, according to U.S. Treasury data.
Every item imported into the United States legally has a customs code. Importers are expected to check the tariffs and other taxes and duties due on the goods they bring in, calculate what they owe, and pay it.
U.S. Customs reviews payments and sends importers a fresh bill if it detects underpayment.
Importers also have to post payment guarantees, or import bonds, with customs. The costs of these bonds have risen with tariffs, an additional burden on U.S.-based firms importing goods from China. 
DO CHINESE SUPPLIERS BEAR THE COSTS OF U.S. TARIFFS?
Chinese suppliers do shoulder some of the cost of U.S. tariffs in indirect ways. Exporters sometimes, for instance, are forced to offer U.S. importers a discount to help defray the costs of higher U.S. duties. Chinese companies might also lose business if U.S. importers find another tariff-free source of the same goods outside China.
And outside of tariffs, the Trump administration's decision to add China's Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, to a trade blacklist, has hit that company hard.
But U.S.-based importers are managing the higher tax burden in a number of ways that hurt U.S. companies and customers more than China. 
Such strategies include accepting lower profit margins; cutting costs - including wages and jobs for U.S. workers; deferring any potential wage hikes, as well as passing on tariff costs through higher prices for U.S. consumers or companies.
Most importers use a mix of such tactics to spread the higher costs among suppliers and consumers or buyers.
HIGHER PRICES FOR TRACTORS, WASHING MACHINES
Higher duties on imports of metals and Chinese products, for example, increased Caterpillar's production costs by more than $100 million last year. In response, the heavy-duty equipment maker increased prices for its products.
Tractor manufacturer Deere & Co estimates a $100 million increase in its raw materials costs this year because of Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. Deere has cut costs and increased prices to protect its profits.
A Congressional Research Service report in February found that the tariffs boosted washing machine prices by as much as 12%, compared to January 2018, before tariffs took effect.
Steel and aluminum tariffs increased the price of steel products by nearly 9% last year, pushing up costs for steel users by $5.6 billion, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
U.S. companies and consumers paid $3 billion a month in additional taxes because of tariffs on Chinese goods and on aluminum and steel from around the globe, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University. Companies shouldered an additional $1.4 billion in costs related to lost efficiency in 2018, the study found.
WHAT DO COMPANIES IN CHINA PAY?
China has retaliated against U.S. tariffs by imposing its own tariffs on imports from the United States.
Most importers in China are Chinese. So in the same way the U.S. government collects import taxes on Chinese goods from U.S. importers, the Chinese government takes in taxes on U.S. goods from Chinese importers. 
As with tariffs in the United States, Chinese firms can seek to pass on the costs to U.S. exporters. Some U.S. interests have lost business, such as U.S. soy farmers.

Chinese buyers have cut billions of dollars of soybean purchases from the United States because China's tariffs have made U.S. supplies more expensive than beans from competitors such as Brazil.

The partnership Harley outlined on Wednesday is aimed both at taking a bigger chunk of China's huge bike and moped market, while also fitting in with a plan to cut costs and source half of all sales outside the United States by 2027.
The new bike would have an engine displacement of 338 cubic centimeters, one of the smallest in the company's 116-year old history, and would be sold in China from the end of 2020.
Harley's existing range of motorcycles are generally far larger and come with high price tags and engine capacities of more than 601 cubic centimeters. 
That has made the company a niche seller in Asia's big markets, where lightweight bikes and scooters dominate, and left it struggling to win over consumers globally to replace a traditional U.S. customer base which is aging.
Harley declined to reveal a price range for the new motorbike, but Qianjiang said it would be ""affordable"" and Harley said it would be introduced elsewhere in Asia after the initial launch in China.
""The international motorcycle market is huge, but Harley-Davidson has not been able to penetrate it with large/expensive bikes,"" said Craig Kennison, an analyst with brokerage Baird.
""Our recent dealer survey work reinforces the need for Harley-Davidson to add more first-time riders. For many, affordability is an issue.""
Harley's sales in China grew 27 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, and the company has already boosted investment at its Thailand plant to serve that market and avoid additional import duty.
Harley said it had picked Qianjiang, owned by Chinese Volvo brand operator Geely, based on its experience developing upscale smaller motorcycles, supply base and knowledge of emerging markets.
The company said in 2018 that it planned to launch lightweight motorcycles in Asia and electric bikes globally. It expects to launch its first electric motorcycle without the traditional clutch and gear-shift controls later this year.

As part of a plan it calls ""More Roads to Harley-Davidson"", the company expects to spend $675 million-$825 million over the next four years, cutting costs and generating $5.9 billion-$6.4 billion in revenue in 2022.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Explainer: U.S. dependence on China's rare earth: Trade war vulnerability,"(Reuters) - Rare earth elements are used in a wide range of consumer products, from iPhones to electric car motors, as well as military jet engines, satellites and lasers.
Rising tensions between the United States and China have sparked concerns that Beijing could use its dominant position as a supplier of rare earths for leverage in the trade war between the two global economic powers.
China supplied 80% of the rare earths imported by the United States from 2014 to 2017.
China is home to at least 85% of the world's capacity to process rare earth ores into material manufacturers can use, according to research firm Adamas Intelligence.
It would take years to build enough processing plants to match China's processing capacity of 220,000 tonnes- which is five times the combined capacity of the rest of the world.
Alternative processing plants would struggle to compete with China's low costs in the future, should trade tensions abate.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS USED IN?
Rare earths are used in rechargeable batteries for electric and hybrid cars, advanced ceramics, computers, DVD players, wind turbines, catalysts in cars and oil refineries, monitors, televisions, lighting, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and glass polishing.
Several rare earth elements, such as neodymium and dysprosium, are critical to the motors used in electric vehicles. 
Some rare earth minerals are essential in military equipment such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, missile defense systems, satellites, as well as in lasers.
Since 2010, the government and private industry have built up stockpiles of rare earths and components that use them, according to Eugene Gholz, a former senior Pentagon supply chain expert, who teaches at the University of Notre Dame.
Some manufacturers have also scaled back their use of such elements, or substituted them for other metals, he said.
WHICH COMPANIES ARE MOST DEPENDENT ON CHINESE SUPPLIES?
Companies such as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc all make sophisticated missiles that use rare earths metals in their guidance systems, and sensors. Lockheed and BAE declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) uses rare earth elements in speakers, cameras and to make phones vibrate.
The United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS AND WHERE DO THEY OCCUR?
Rare earth metals are a group of 17 elements - lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium - that appear in low concentrations in the ground.
Although they are more abundant than their name implies, they are costly to process. 
(Graphic: Rare earth production - https://tmsnrt.rs/2I4ixHG)
Importers made limited efforts to reduce rare earth consumption and dependence on China after a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan in 2010. Japan accused China of halting rare earth supplies for political reasons, sparking recognition worldwide of the risks of dependence on one supplier. China denied it had halted supplies.
California's Mountain Pass mine is the only operating U.S. rare earths facility. But MP Materials, owner of Mountain Pass, ships the roughly 50,000 tonnes of rare earth concentrate it extracts each year from California to China for processing. China has imposed a tariff of 25% on those imports during the trade war.
Australia's Lynas Corporation Ltd in May said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Texas-based Blue  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN) to build a rare earth processing facility in the United States.
Rare earths are also mined in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia and Vietnam. 
HOW ARE RARE EARTHS AFFECTED BY U.S. TARIFFS?
So far, the U.S. government has exempted rare earths from tariffs on Chinese goods.
OPTIONS TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CHINESE IMPORTS
U.S. senators introduced legislation in May to encourage development of domestic supplies.
As yet, recycling is not a significant source of rare earth minerals.
Congress is also eyeing federal funding to develop ways to extract rare earths from coal ash, a byproduct of coal-fired power plants, but it could take a decade to make the process viable for wider industrial use, said Eric Williams (NYSE:WMB), a professor of sustainability at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
HOW HAVE RARE EARTHS PRICES REACTED TO THE RISING TENSIONS?
Having held largely steady for the past several months, the export prices of an array of rare earth elements have rallied strongly since Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to a rare earth processing firm in southern China on May 20. 
The price of neodymium metal - used in magnets and speakers - increased 26.5% since May 20. Dysprosium metal (used in lasers), erbium oxide and gadolinium oxide (used in medical imaging and fuel cells) are up around 10%.

Markets now see the chance of a rate cut in July at over 80%, amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which have slowed global growth and put downward pressure on inflation. This week alone has witnessed a sharp and unexpected drop in a key gauge of German economic sentiment, and a surprisingly sharp drop in Japanese exports in May - both economies being collateral damage of the U.S.-China spat.
""Expectations remain elevated over a rate cut in July and investors will be closely scrutinizing the statement for confirmation of a cut next month,"" said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at ForexTime Limited in London.
""Should the Fed sound less dovish than expected or completely omit any hints about taking action next month, it could send equity markets sliding.""

220,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",Danske Bank Analyst Calls Are Followed by a Sudden Selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- As  Danske Bank  A/S (CSE:DANSKE) started calling analysts this week to give them an overview of the trends and market developments that affected second-quarter results, its stock price started falling.
The calls, which are routinely done by companies to ensure market expectations don’t stray too far from reality, left one analyst with the impression that the bank’s net interest income may be under pressure. A second analyst said there were also signs of weakness at Danske’s wealth unit. Both declined to be identified by name because the conversations were private.
By the end of Tuesday, Danske was the worst performing financial stock in Europe with its share price down more than 4%. The stock fell about 2% on Wednesday.
Claus Jensen, head of investors relations at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, said by phone on Wednesday that he was contacted by market participants who were wondering what was going on. “I got calls from analysts who were asking, ‘What you have communicated because there are rumors in the market,’ and I also got a calls from a couple of investors who were alarmed by market rumors, and were making reference to these calls.”
Danske is struggling to rebuild its image after last year admitting it was at the center of a $230 billion Estonian money-laundering scandal. It has lost more than half its market value since the beginning of 2018 as investors weigh the risk of fines against the bank’s financial performance.
Danske began its analyst calls on Tuesday, ahead of a silent period before the bank reports second-quarter earnings on July 18. One of the analysts to have received a call from Danske said the tone of the conversation had been downbeat.
According to estimates compiled by Bloomberg, Danske’s pretax profit in the second quarter is set to rise about 5% from a year earlier, led by an 11% increase in revenue.
“We stick to a prepared script where we only comment on seasonality, one-offs, trends and indexes. The calls are always attended by at least two IR officers,” Jensen said. He said any details specific to the bank that were provided to analysts would already have been made public.
“It’s very unfortunate that analysts’ own interpretations are being perceived as though Danske Bank is effectively guiding on the second quarter, which is not the case,” Jensen said. “Unfortunately, I can see that things get mixed up, from what happened yesterday.”
Subjects discussed with analysts included the development in interest rates, which affect net interest income, as well as increases in inter-bank rates in Sweden and Norway, and their impact on wholesale funding, Jensen said. He also said that the calls touched on the performances of indexes and what that might mean for assets under management.
Volatile markets mean executives have an incentive to lower expectations before they publish quarterly results, but the calls don’t typically result in large share movements. Investor relations departments are prohibited from revealing any new information to a limited group of people.
The July report will be the first for Chris Vogelzang, Danske’s new chief executive officer. The former ABN Amro banker started work this month, replacing interim CEO Jesper Nielsen who held the position since Thomas Borgen was ousted last year in the wake of the scandal.
Vogelzang has made regaining the trust of customers and investors his primary goal. Jensen, the head of IR, said Danske has for years arranged calls with individual analysts as a service, and that the banks adheres rigidly to a standard procedure and a pre-set presentation, to avoid triggering market reactions.

Persson, a Social Democrat, served as prime minister for a decade until 2006. He has since then served as board member in several companies, including bank Alandsbanken. He was voted in at an extraordinary general meeting.
Swedbank, Sweden's oldest retail bank, parted ways with its chief executive and chairman earlier this year after being drawn into a money laundering scandal at  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), and is being investigated in the United States, Sweden and the Baltics.

The most recent allegations, reported by Swedish state TV in March, said that Swedbank processed gross transactions of up to 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) a year from high-risk, mostly Russian non-resident clients, through Estonia from 2010 to 2016.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 04:51AM ET</span>",Central banks' dovish cooing keeps world stocks lulled near two-week highs,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks held near two-week highs on Wednesday as investors bet on a worldwide wave of central bank stimulus, with expectations building that the United States and the euro zone may deliver interest rate cuts as early as July.
Markets have been fired up by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's Tuesday volte-face on policy easing. In one of the biggest policy reversals of his eight-year tenure, Draghi flagged more policy easing if inflation failed to pick up.
However, German and U.S. bond yields which hit record lows and two-year lows respectively after the speech, inched higher to trade just off those levels. European shares too slipped off six-week highs, and Wall Street futures indicated a slightly weaker open.
Some of the trepidation is down to the U.S. Federal Reserve's ongoing meeting, with a decision due at 1800 GMT. It is widely expected to follow the lead of the European Central Bank and open the door to future rate cuts.
""It should be really clear to absolutely everyone that this is a monetary policy turning point... Those rate cut expectations have now shifted much closer,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of currency and emerging markets research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""Of course the other question is: What is the Fed doing? If the Fed takes the fundamental risk of political pressure seriously, they cannot do anything today,"" he said, noting that President Donald Trump's strident calls for lower interest rates posed a dilemma for the Fed.
But market sentiment has been buoyed also by news that Trump will meet China's Xi Jinping at the G20 summit this month, even though many doubt the two men can reach a breakthrough on ending their trade dispute.
MSCI's global equity index rose 0.4%, adding to Tuesday's 1% gain, as Asian shares excluding Japan followed the lead of their European and U.S. counterparts to jump almost 2% - their biggest one-day rally since January.
Tokyo and Shanghai too climbed almost 2% while Australia's main bourse hit an 11-year high.
All eyes are now on the Fed, with Chairman Jerome Powell holding a news conference after the announcement.
Futures are almost fully priced for a quarter-point easing in July and imply more than 60 basis points of cuts by Christmas.
As for Europe, markets have almost fully priced a cut in September, though some analysts, such as those at Germany's Commerzbank, now say rates will be cut in July, rather than in the last quarter of the year as they had predicted earlier.
ECB sources told Reuters Draghi had flagged his measures so strongly that other board members would be unable to disagree with him at their July 25 meeting.
Yet all the clamor for easing creates risks policymakers will disappoint. 
""Market expectations for a dovish shift are nearly universal, the only question seems to be the degree,"" Blake Gwinn, head of front-end rates at NatWest Markets, said, referring to the Fed.
""Markets will be looking for validation of this pricing,"" he added. ""We think this represents a fairly high bar for the Fed to deliver a dovish surprise.""
SUB-ZERO YIELDS
BofA Merrill Lynch's latest fund manager survey spoke volumes about the sea change in sentiment. It showed investors were dumping stocks and had upped bond allocations to nearly eight-year highs. They also had crowded into safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds and cash.
The prospect of more policy easing and worries for the growth outlook kept German yields close to the minus 0.33% record low hit on Tuesday, while Japanese yields sank to the lowest since August 2016 at -0.145%.
Yields on the U.S. 10-year note reached the lowest since September 2017 at 2.016%, a world away from the 3.25% top touched in November last year.
The fallout in currencies has been significantly less, mostly because it is hard for one to gain when all the major central banks are under pressure to ease.
The euro did pull back after Draghi's comments, but at $1.118 it touched only a two-week low.
The dollar eased slightly on the yen to 108.3, but was flat versus a basket of currencies. The yuan touched three-week highs versus the dollar on the trade news.

In commodities, the rate-cut buzz kept gold near 14-month highs at $1,345.16 per ounce. Brent crude futures too rose 0.5%, thanks to the stimulus bets and hopes of a thaw in Sino-U.S. ties.

223,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 04:48AM ET</span>",StockBeat: IAG's Rescue Act for the 737 MAX Goes Down Badly,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) has ridden to the rescue of Boeing (NYSE:BA) – but the market doesn’t like it.
Shares in the parent group of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling are at the bottom of both the U.K. Spanish benchmark indexes after early trading on Wednesday, after it signed a letter of intent to buy 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, including the 737-8 model involved in two fatal crashes over the last year.
The vote of confidence in Boeing’s erstwhile cash-cow, which has been grounded worldwide since March, had triggered a sharp relief rally in Boeing stock late on Tuesday, sending it up over 5% to its highest in over a month.
But at 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), IAG’s shares were down 4.5% in London and 4.6% in Madrid, while the U.K. FTSE was down 0.3% and the Ibex 35 was down 0.5%. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.5 points, or 0.4% at 383.68, consolidating after the heady rally triggered on Tuesday by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.
The size of the deal, and Boeing’s obvious need for some good publicity to revive moribund sales, both suggest that IAG will get the planes at a steep discount to Boeing’s list price, although the company’s brief press statement gives nothing away on that score.
But if the company is getting such a good deal, why is the stock down? The risk of putting money down for a plane that’s not allowed to fly seems small, given that the delivery schedule is between 2023 and 2027. That surely gives Boeing more than enough time to satisfy even the most safety-conscious regulator and airline. (It’s worth noting that the order is also split between the 737-8 and the 737-10 model, which has had no notable safety issues.)
Moreover, all that has been signed is a letter of intent that is, as the statement says “subject to formal agreement.” It is not clear that IAG has actually committed any money at all at this stage, or would ever need to if some of the doom scenarios feared for the 737 MAX materialize.
Of more concern is perhaps the radical shift away from Airbus, its favored supplier in recent years, especially for short-haul operations, with all the operational risks that that entails.
But the sheer scale of the order is arguably perhaps the biggest reason for the stock’s decline. The upper limit would represent over one-third of IAG’s existing fleet. While some planes would obviously replace retiring ones, the order appears to prepare the way for yet another capacity expansion in a European market which already awash in planes. HSBC analysts issued a note earlier Wednesday saying that more airlines were likely to follow Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and issue profit warnings as a result of falling demand, which depressed prices across the sector in early trading.
The order has one other intriguing angle. In increasing his options, IAG CEO Willie Walsh has made clear he won’t ever need to buy rival Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) to satisfy his growth ambitions. That removes another prop for the battered discounter’s share price, which hit an eight-year low last week. Walsh has recently played down any suggestion of reviving his interest in taking over Norwegian, but the fact remains that, indirectly, the order has increased the chance that IAG can buy up its young fleet at a distressed price in the future - at which point he may feel able to let his own Boeing order lapse quietly.

(Reuters) - European stock markets fell back marginally on Wednesday after posting their best performance in five months a day earlier thanks to a policy speech from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that flagged a potential return to bond-buying and lower interest rates.
Draghi's speech in Portugal sank the euro and drove major euro zone bond yields back below zero, slashing effective market borrowing costs, giving a boost to companies worried by sagging growth and driving the pan-European STOXX 600 index almost 2% higher. 
It dipped 0.2% early compared to Tuesday's close by 0755 GMT, although interest rate sensitive banking stocks outperformed with a 0.60% rise.
That all followed some minimal gains overnight in Asia after news that China and the United States are rekindling trade talks ahead of a meeting next week between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan.
""Keep in mind that Tuesday's gains were phenomenal and now traders are going to be sitting on their hands and waiting to see what the Federal Reserve does,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in UK.
""Overall the market mood has been lifted so we're seeing a banks push higher as well.""
Concern over impact of the protracted trade war between Washington and Beijing on growth drove European shares about 6% lower in May, their worst performance in more than two years.
Since then, expectations of policy easing by the ECB and U.S. Federal Reserve has helped the STOXX 600 recoup most of those losses and helped drive a 4% gain this month. The Fed concludes its June meeting after European markets close.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Most investors in SoftBank Group Corp's $100 billion Vision Fund want to join the group's forthcoming second fund, and discussions with those investors will begin soon, SoftBank founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Wednesday.
The comment came at the Japanese group's first annual general meeting since it listed telecommunications firm SoftBank Corp in December, in a move widely considered as completing its transformation into a tech-focused investor.
Reflecting that shift, Son said he wants to be the conductor in an artificial intelligence-driven technological revolution.
""The conductor doesn't play anything but actually he plays everything,"" he told investors on Wednesday.
With the first Vision Fund having spent much of its capital in its two years of life, Son in May said a second fund would launch ""soon"" even if SoftBank was initially the only investor.
Investors in the first fund include the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, U.S. tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Taiwanese electronic device assembler Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd.
The Vision Fund has pumped money into late-stage startups worldwide such as U.S. ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and shared office space firm, The We Company.
It has become SoftBank Group's biggest driver of profit growth, with much of its investment gains unrealized and driven by upward valuations of its portfolio companies. To extend the investment spree, the group needs more funds.
At the meeting on Wednesday, Son said the fund's headcount would eventually reach 1,000 from 400, and the fund's head, Rajeev Misra, said the number of portfolio firms would rise to 100-150 in a year or two from around 80 at present.
Internet firms now dominate rankings of the world's largest companies but have transformed just two industries, advertising and retail, which make up only a small part of the economy, Son said.
While SoftBank has invested in those industries in less mature markets - in, for example, South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang and Indonesian peer Tokopedia - its tech bets have been focused on startups looking to disrupt other industries like insurance, healthcare and transport.
Portfolio companies Uber and Didi Chuxing, for instance, control 90% of the ride-hailing industry globally.
Outside the meeting venue in Tokyo, Japan's taxi lobby protested Son's support for ride-hailing, though the industry remains strictly regulated domestically.
Inside, the atmosphere was more cordial. One shareholder asked Son to take care of his health, another expressed concern over the number of injuries at the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks baseball team, and a father said he had taken his son to SoftBank's headquarters in the hope of glimpsing the founder.
Son harkened back to the founders of major corporations like Panasonic Corp, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Sony Corp (T:6758), which he said blustered with big promises and vitalized Japan's economy.

That attitude is now lacking in ""withdrawn"" Japan, Son said.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 01:39AM ET</span>",Wall Street takes on long-term care payouts as insurers balk at costs,"By David French
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some U.S. insurers are turning to Wall Street's financial wizards for relief from the liabilities of their long-term care (LTC) policies, posing a challenge for regulators worried about how new industry players will tackle the risks involved.
These policies help support the provision of care to those unable to handle everyday tasks, such as bathing and cooking, by funding assisted living or nursing home arrangements. Many have become financially toxic for insurers, because of soaring healthcare costs and rising lifespans.
A few investment firms are willing to take on these LTC contracts, betting they can invest the premiums from the policies to generate strong enough returns to cover the payouts, and even turn a tidy profit.
While these transactions promise financial relief to insurers, they are not without risk. The LTC liabilities can be big enough to weigh on even conglomerates such as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. If the premiums from the assumed LTC contracts are invested poorly, there may be insufficient money to cover the payouts, industry experts say.
""Some of those deals include nontraditional actors, which we question with regard to their expertise associated with the management of these liabilities, as well as the very aggressive reserving and cash-flow assumptions,"" said Anthony Beato, a director at credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings.
Those at the forefront of state insurance regulation paint a picture of the industry's watchdogs attempting to walk a fine line between the need to alleviate financial pressure on insurers and policing risky deals.
""There is a trend toward encouragement to make sure there is a functioning private LTC insurance market to cope with the baby boomers' needs,"" Fred Andersen, chief life actuary at Minnesota's Department of Commerce, said of the general regulatory attitude toward these deals.
At stake is the viability of the LTC policies on which elderly and disabled people rely. Without private insurance, they would be forced to pay for their own care or rely on already-stretched state and federal programs such as Medicaid.
Around 12 million people in the United States will need such assistance by the end of this decade, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This figure is set to skyrocket as the number of retirees increases; Americans over 65 years old are projected to more than double to 98 million by 2060.
The LTC market has already shrunk because of the financial strain facing insurers. Fewer than 70,000 new LTC policies were written in the United States in 2017, down from 372,000 in 2004, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The average annual LTC policy premium rose to $2,772 in 2015 from $1,677 in 2000, based on NAIC data.

POLICIES CHANGE HANDS
Two major LTC transactions took place in the last 12 months, and insurance executives and dealmakers say they expect more to happen this year.
Continental General Insurance Company (CGIC), a subsidiary of hedge fund veteran Philip Falcone's HC2 Holdings Inc, completed the purchase of health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) Inc's $2.4 billion LTC business last August.
It was the second such deal for CGIC, which also acquired the LTC business of American Financial Group Inc in 2015.
In September, Wilton Re, which is owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, reinsured the LTC policies of CNO Financial Group Inc. This meant that CNO continued to administer the policies, but Wilton Re took over the investment of the premiums and guaranteed the payouts.
Humana and CNO had to pay the financial firms $203 million and $825 million, respectively, to get the LTC portfolios off their books.
Analysts say such one-off charges are better for insurers than allowing LTC policies to drain their finances. Fitch said in a report last October that many U.S. insurers with LTC portfolios would need to allocate at least 10% more cash to reserves covering these policies in 2019.
Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) and  Unum Group  (NYSE:UNM) were among the insurance firms that announced in 2018 they needed to commit extra cash to fund future LTC liabilities. One insurer, Penn Treaty, collapsed in 2017 under the weight of its LTC obligations.
General Electric, which said last year it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge and set aside a further $15 billion in reserves to help cover its LTC liabilities, is also looking for a buyer for its LTC portfolio, Reuters has reported.
RISKY BETS
CNO's first attempt to seek relief from its LTC portfolio soured in 2016 following a reinsurance deal with Beechwood Re, which was founded by two Wall Street veterans.
Beechwood subsequently collapsed after investing some of the policy premiums in Platinum Partners, a hedge fund that folded due to its risky bets and whose top executives were indicted in a U.S. federal fraud probe in December 2016.
As a result, CNO was forced to reabsorb the $550 million LTC portfolio and take a $53 million after-tax charge.
U.S. state regulators tasked with averting such failed deals are generally more focused on the reserves the investment firms set aside, rather than how they invest the premiums from the LTC policies, said Ann Frohman, founder of Frohman Law Office and a former head of Nebraska's Department of Insurance.
""In addition to current requirements, one area of improvement would be having all states require the stress-testing of investment assumptions on LTC portfolios against financial crisis-type economic conditions,"" Frohman said.
Some firms taking on the LTC portfolios also invest in junk-rated corporate credit, which is more susceptible to losses during an economic downturn, according to Fitch's Beato.
Wilton Re declined to comment on how it invests LTC policy premiums, while a CGIC spokesman said it focuses on generating higher yields from investment-grade assets.
Even if some insurers do not place risky investment bets, regulators say they also have to watch out for firms seeking to avoid paying out some claims to boost their profitability.

""That is always a concern,"" said Pennsylvania's insurance commissioner, Jessica Altman.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's smaller banks and brokers are turning to stock exchanges to borrow short-term cash this week to escape the typical end of June pressure in money markets and more recent worries over credit risks in the sector.
The volume of repurchase agreements on the Shanghai stock exchange, in which banks and other financial firms borrow money from each other using bonds as collateral, surged as borrowers sought an alternative to the over-the-counter interbank money market.
Traders said the lower borrowing costs on the exchange and the less stringent requirements for collateral drove smaller players to the exchange.
""Cost of borrowing on the exchange is lower,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai.
The interbank markets were affected not just by shortages of cash but also concerns over the quality of the pledged collateral.
Traders said collateral requirements had tightened in the interbank market in the wake of regulators taking over the troubled and credit-laden Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang Bank.
Borrowers could still pledge their corporate bonds on the exchange for repos but lenders in the interbank markets had turned picky.
""It is not just the quarter-end liquidity issue in the interbank market, it's more of a structural conflict. If it is resolved, the cash conditions would be very loose,"" said a Shanghai-based bond fund manager.
Exchange data showed volumes of 14-day repos traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange leapt to an all-time high of 208.9 billion yuan ($30.3 billion) on Monday. That compares with a total of 345.7 billion yuan in all of May, but a fraction however of interbank repo volumes.
Traders said demand for 14-day repos was particularly high early this week as non-banking financial institutions rushed to secure funds to tide over the end-June crunch, a period of half-year regulatory requirements.
The cost of 14-day repo funds on the exchange spiked to 3.4% on Monday from average levels around 2.7% in the previous two weeks.
Interbank rates for banks were close at 3.5% on Monday, but traders said the cost was as high as 8% in the over-the-counter broader interbank market that includes non-bank participants. The rate hit 15% at one point last week.
The interbank 14-day rate for all participants hit 6% on Wednesday morning, compared with 3.4% on the exchange.
""Many banks now require non-bank financial institutions to use government bonds or negotiable certificates of deposits NCDs) issued by state-owned companies as collateral, and not all the AAA-rated corporate bonds are accepted,"" said a second trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai.
China's securities watchdog has urged large non-bank financial institutions to lend in the interbank market to smaller non-bank firms to help ease any cash shortfalls. The central bank has also injected more cash into the banking system while regulators have repeatedly downplayed the risks at small financial institutions.
Analysts at OCBC Bank said smaller banks and non-bank financial institutions were struggling though, and unable to access funding even though the interbank bank repo market was stable.
A third trader at a Chinese bank in Guangdong province said most banks would sail smoothly through the end of the first-half but some non-bank financial institutions would feel the pain.
""There's no way for those who hold 'rotten' notes to survive the quarter-end this time,"" the trader said, referring to institutions who hold lower-rated debt.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Toyota snub dents Saudi Arabia's manufacturing drive,"By Marwa Rashad and Stephen Kalin
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia began courting Toyota two years ago to build a large car plant as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's grand plan to wean the kingdom off oil revenues and create jobs for young Saudis.
But the Japanese carmaker has rebuffed Riyadh's overtures following talks that dragged on without tangible results because high labor costs, a small domestic market and a lack of local supplies gave Toyota pause for thought, four sources said.
Securing a deal with a major automaker by 2020 for a car plant is a key target in the Gulf state's national industrial strategy, part of a broader agenda to diversify the economy of the world's largest oil exporter.
Failure to do so would be a setback for Prince Mohammed, coming after the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco was shelved and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi tarnished the kingdom's image.
""Nobody would say 'No, full stop' ... but they politely conveyed they're not interested,"" said an industry source familiar with the Toyota talks.
Toyota said it could not comment on the current internal discussions and communication with the Saudi government. 
Saudi Arabia's ministry of energy, industry and mineral resources and the government media office did not respond to requests for comment.
As part of measures designed to create 1.6 million manufacturing and logistics jobs by 2030, Prince Mohammed wants to localize half the production of imported vehicles and weapons - which are expected to account for up to $100 billion in spending by Saudi government entities and consumers by 2030.
Under the deal Toyota signed in March 2017, the Japanese company agreed to conduct a feasibility study for an industrial project to make vehicles and car parts in the kingdom.
Two sources familiar with the matter said Toyota concluded after the study and negotiations that Saudi Arabia would need to provide huge subsidies for the project to be viable.
""They found that production costs will be similar to other countries only if there is a 50% government incentive. But even then, they aren't sure it will be profitable,"" said one source with knowledge of the negotiations.
(GRAPHIC: Saudi Arabia GDP breakdown - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WDjAZb ) 
TOUGH SELL
When it comes to establishing manufacturing, Riyadh hopes to replicate its 1980s push into petrochemicals - the cornerstone of an industrial drive that turned Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) into the world's fourth biggest petrochemicals firm. 
Hundreds of thousands of Saudis work in petrochemicals, one of the biggest contributors to the economy outside oil. But it took decades to build up the industry, even with huge government funding and cheap raw materials.
Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, is spearheading the drive to localize military spending. It aims to generate $10 billion in revenue over the next five years and hopes to generate 30% of revenues from export markets by 2030.
For cars, the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) wants half the roughly 400,000 vehicles bought each year in Saudi Arabia to be made there by 2030, one source said. 
But Toyota, which has a 30 percent market share, only proposed a small plant producing up to 10,000 vehicles using imported goods and the Saudis wanted a bigger factory, the industry source and the source familiar with the talks said.
A strategy document posted on NIDLP's website acknowledged that Saudi Arabia had a major competitive disadvantage and state incentives would be needed to create ""substantial commercial justifications"" to attract carmakers. 
It did not provide specifics about the disadvantages, nor the size and kind of state incentives required.
At NIDLP's launch in January, the state approved 45 billion riyals ($12 billion) of incentives to develop an auto sector, including duty rebates, human resources subsidies and tax holidays, but it wasn't enough, the industry source said.
NIDLP did not respond to requests for comment.
Asked if it would consider the project if the economic conditions changed, Toyota said: ""We do not comment on assumptions about the current and future situations.""
(GRAPHIC: Economy by sector in 2018 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2IUeZbs) 
JOBS PUSH 
The NIDLP is aiming to create 27,000 jobs in the automotive sector by 2030 by attracting so-called original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 
One obstacle, though, is the absence of a local supply chain for car parts, three automotive industry executives said.
Riyadh would need to build integrated economic districts producing components such as windows, batteries and wheels to lower costs, a senior executive at a Western auto firm said.
""If I have to open a manufacturing process in Saudi and then import every single component from abroad, I do not have any economical plus,"" he said. ""The problem is not really setting up a plant, but having the entire value chain.""
The local market is also relatively small. Demand for cars in Saudi Arabia has fallen by some 50% over three years to about 450,000 cars in 2018, as a drop in oil prices and departure of expatriates hit consumption, said Subhash Joshi, director of mobility practice at research firm Frost & Sullivan.
""Saudi Arabia and (Gulf) countries have been persistently disappointing in terms of sales in recent years, so it's not as if OEMs would be entering a booming market,"" said Justin Cox, director of global production at LMC Automotive.
Cox said countries such as Egypt and Turkey had more advantages for carmakers.
Toyota has a 1.2 billion euro plant with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles in Turkey, which is in a customs union with Europe. A plant Nissan set up in Egypt in 2005 with a $200 million investment will produce 28,000 cars this year. 
Cars imported into the GCC customs union which includes Saudi Arabia only attract a 5% tariff, offering little protection against cheap imports for countries trying to get domestic car production off the ground.
CARMAKERS WARY
Turkey and Egypt also provide experienced, cheap manpower while Riyadh has been reducing the number of foreign laborers to create jobs for Saudis, who prefer higher-paying public jobs. Some 10 million foreigners have been doing the strenuous, lower-paid jobs largely shunned by the 20 million nationals.
Khalid al-Salem, who oversees the development of industrial cities, said the authorities were working on incentives to lure Saudis to industrial jobs instead of retail, where entry requirements are easier and pay is higher. He did not elaborate.
It's not the first time Saudi Arabia has attempted to lure automakers.
In 2012, Jaguar Land Rover signed a deal to explore producing 50,000 Land Rovers a year in the kingdom at a cost of 4.5 billion riyals ($1.2 billion), but it never moved forward. 
The industry source said the British luxury brand, owned by India's Tata Motors, got a better offer from a European country.
""We continually review our global manufacturing footprint. At this time, our focus remains on our manufacturing presence in the UK, China, Brazil and mainland Europe,"" Jaguar Land Rover said in an emailed response when asked about the Saudi project. 
Two of the sources said Riyadh has also approached Nissan Motor Co in recent years.
They said the Japanese firm considered contract manufacturing through a 75% Saudi-owned venture - without the Nissan brand - but the arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year meant it was off the table for now.
Nissan declined to comment. 
MINING AND PHARMACEUTICALS
While Saudi Arabia is struggling to lure carmakers, it does have a truck assembly industry. But analysts say assembling vehicles imported in kit form requires less investment and doesn't create as many jobs as building cars from scratch.
Economists say, however, that Saudi Arabia does have the potential to build competitive industries and create jobs in the mining and pharmaceutical sectors.
The state is looking to triple mining's contribution to gross domestic product by 2030 by focusing on untapped reserves of bauxite, phosphate, gold, copper and uranium.
Saudi authorities estimate the country holds 500 million tonnes of phosphate ore, about 7% of global proven reserves and a new mining law to boost foreign investment is being drafted. 
Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said investment in mining infrastructure would likely have the most direct impact on developing new manufacturing industries.
Pharmaceuticals is another strategic sector for NIDLP. About 25 local manufacturing plants produce 30% of prescription drugs consumed now and the government wants to double the sector's contribution to non-oil gross domestic product to 1.97% by 2020.
Suhasini Molkuvan, program manager at Frost & Sullivan, said the target was almost close to reality though a lack of investment in research and development and intellectual property left local firms dependent on multinationals.
""Diversity is easier said than done,"" said a senior Riyadh banker. ""It might be achievable in 15 to 20 years if they continue to make the push.""

232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>","With Trust Broken, Mexico’s Elite Asks What to Do About Trump","(Bloomberg) -- Mexico City’s Zocalo has been the focus of national protests and celebrations since the Spanish conquest. The mood on the capital’s central square now is one of anger at the U.S. under Donald Trump.
After Trump forced a renegotiation of the Nafta trade agreement, only to threaten tariffs unless Mexico did more to clamp down on migration across its borders, a temporary deal was struck that defused the immediate crisis. But it left Mexicans furious, and starting to question their decades-old dependence on the U.S. market.
As U.S. president, Trump “should serve as an example, but he does just the opposite,” said Jose Luis Solorzano, a 58-year-old street cleaner who works on the Zocalo. He cited social and economic impacts of Trump’s policy, with many Mexicans finding it harder to visit family in the U.S. “This is hurting us, and the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico,” he said.
Mexico is just one target of Trump’s combative foreign policy, with the threat of tariffs to press American interests used as a cudgel against traditional allies and foes alike. Mexicans initially brushed off Trump’s message as political rhetoric. But with the 2020 presidential election ensuring that Trump’s gaze will again look beyond the border, Mexico’s government is rethinking the nature of its U.S. relations.
U.S. badgering is a particular dilemma for Mexico, experiencing its second major crisis with its northern neighbor since Trump threatened to end free trade in 2017. Mexico has pledged to clamp down on immigrants to avoid tariffs and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador insists he wants to remain friends with Trump. But that stance risks being out of tune with many ordinary Mexicans who form Lopez Obrador’s political base, and it does little to assuage feelings approaching panic among some in the business community.
Mexico already had the worst perception of Trump among those surveyed by Pew Research Center in October; only 6% said he’s a capable leader. And the percentage of Mexicans who think relations with the U.S. are poor quadrupled in the past four years. Giant Mexican flags are a feature in many public squares in a country where nationalism runs deep and where anti-American sentiment only faded in recent decades. Not for long.
While it’s too soon to say whether the latest Trump salvo will prompt real policy shifts, it’s triggered a nationalistic resurgence throughout Mexico
“Latent anti-Americanism that was dormant over the past 30 years has a great possibility of resurfacing,” said Andres Rozental, a deputy foreign minister under Mexican President Carlos Salinas, who negotiated Nafta with the U.S. and Canada. “Everything that was built over the past 30 years is being destroyed by the U.S. president because he’s taking political advantage of this strategy to accuse Mexico of the evils taking place in the U.S.”
The question in Mexico as elsewhere is what the government is prepared to do about it. The answer increasingly suggests that Trump’s approach is causing not just short-term anger, but risks long-term damage to U.S. relations worldwide. One example: Germany, France and the U.K. back a special purpose vehicle meant to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran, while the European Union is pursuing efforts to bolster the euro and reduce dependence on the dollar.
In Mexico’s case, it exported some $28 billion in farm products to the U.S. last year, mainly beer, avocado, tomatoes, tequila and berries. It imported $19 billion in U.S. agricultural produce, including corn, soy and beef.
At an exclusive business club in Mexico City last week, where Lopez Obrador hailed the temporary deal as breaking the impasse with Trump, privately the talk was of diversification to ensure Mexico’s economic future. Some even questioned whether Mexico and the U.S. are allies at all.
“What’s become very clear to the Mexican business sector is we need to turn our eyes to other markets and not depend so disproportionately on trade with the U.S.,” said Jose Manuel Lopez Campos, president of Mexico’s services and tourism chamber. He referred to Mexico channeling the vast majority of its exports to the North American market over past decades as “a public policy mistake.”
Mexico has been trying to boost its relationship with China—Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard plans to visit after the Group of 20 summit in Japan this month. Lopez Campos said it’s part of a general push into Asia, though the U.S. has taken note. Alfonso Romo, the president’s chief of staff, said he was asked in April by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross not to allow China to invest in strategic projects in Mexico.
Bosco de la Vega, president of the National Agricultural Council, said that Mexico will sign free-trade agreements with Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador shortly, while the agricultural sector is pushing for a deal with South Korea. Mexico and China have recently approved a banana trade protocol and sorghum is next.
While it’s too soon to say whether the latest Trump salvo will prompt real policy shifts, it’s triggered a nationalistic resurgence throughout Mexico
Mexico’s high concentration of exports to the U.S. “has become a weakness and we are seeking a strategy of diversification,” he said in an interview. Not much was done after Trump’s first threats in 2017, but now “we’re being disciplined about it. It’s our strategy. We’re serious about this.” Deputy Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said Tuesday that finding trade partners other than the U.S. will help diversify risk.
Despite fair warning about Trump’s intentions as far back as 2015, Mexico remains as reliant as ever on the U.S. Recent efforts to diversify haven’t reduced exports from the 80% mark where it’s been for the past century, said Rozental, the former deputy foreign minister.
While it’s too soon to say whether the latest Trump salvo will prompt real policy shifts, it’s triggered a nationalistic resurgence throughout Mexico. The country has a sense of itself as a haven for dissidents, including refugees from Spain under dictator General Franco, that puts it at odds with Trump’s stance, even if polls suggest Mexican attitudes to migration are hardening.
Opinion surveys suggest voters want Lopez Obrador to stand up to Trump, and even diplomats like Rozental say that Mexico should have called Trump’s bluff on tariffs. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, the speaker of the lower house from the president’s own party, slammed the negotiation of a deal he said places Mexico in a “semi-colonial” position.
Back on the Zocalo, Uriel Lopez Onofre, a 24-year-old masters student, stood in the shadow of the giant Mexican flag that dominates the square to shelter from the midday sun and “contemplate his country.” He said that Lopez Obrador was smart not to confront Trump over migrants from Central America, but he “could use a bit more push-back.” The Mexican president seems to be saying “hit me but I won’t hit you back.”

233,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 11:10PM ET</span>","Qantas adds 10 Airbus jets to order, will take 36 A321XLRs","By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd said on Wednesday it would order 10 Airbus SE A321XLR jets, taking its total A320neo family order to 109 jets.
As part of the deal, 36 of the jets will be the new long-range A321XLR model, the airline said.
The A321XLR jets, to be delivered from mid-2024, have a 4,700 nautical mile range that will allow Qantas or its low-cost arm Jetstar to perform longer-range flights in narrowbody jets.
""It can fly routes like Cairns-Tokyo or Melbourne-Singapore, which existing narrow-bodies can't, and that changes the economics of lots of potential routes into Asia to make them not just physically possible but financially attractive,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
Jetstar operates an A320 narrowbody fleet, but Qantas uses the rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737. Joyce said the A321XLR had plenty of potential uses across both airlines and it would decide closer to the date on where they would be deployed and if they would be used for growth or to replace older jets.
Jetstar is due to receive 18 A321LR jets from 2020 to 2022 and plans to deploy them on domestic and international routes.
The additional 10 jets are valued at more than $1 billion at Airbus list prices, although airlines typically receive substantial discounts. 
Qantas said it retained flexibility around the timing and structure of the deliveries depending on market conditions.
Qantas is expected to decide next year on a replacement for its 75 737 jets, which comprise the backbone of its domestic fleet, Joyce said in February. 

Contenders include the A320neo family, the 737 MAX and Boeing's proposed new mid-sized airplane.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 09:47PM ET</span>",PG&E settles California fire claims with local governments for $1 billion,"By Jim Christie
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PG&E Corp will pay $1 billion as part of its bankruptcy reorganization to more than a dozen local governments in California struck by wildfires in recent years, the company and lawyers for the governments said on Tuesday.
Payments to the local governments will settle claims from lawsuits put on hold by PG&E's bankruptcy and are separate from the thousands of individual claims stemming from wildfires that the company expects will be filed against it during the bankruptcy period.
PG&E will not be able to make settlement payments until it receives court approval for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan.
San Francisco-headquartered PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection in January anticipating $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment.
The local governments said in a filing in March that their claims could top more than $2.5 billion for fire-related damage to roads, bridges, sidewalks, road signs and signals, public landscaping and water systems. 
The governments include the city of Paradise, which was leveled by November's Camp Fire in California deadliest and most destructive wildfire of modern times.
Paradise settled for $270 million, John Fiske, a lawyer for the governments from Baron & Budd, told Reuters.
A Paradise park district and Butte and Yuba Counties also settled claims stemming from the Camp Fire, for a combined $312 million.
The city of Santa Rosa and Sonoma and Napa Counties, which were hard hit by blazes in 2017, are among the localities that settled.
Other governments that settled 2017 fire claims include the cities of Sonoma and Napa as well as Lake, Mendocino, Nevada and Yuba Counties and some special districts.
The governments that settled the 2017 fire claims will receive a total of $415 million. How the money will be allocated has not been decided yet, Fiske said.
A water district in Calaveras County settled claims arising from a 2015 fire. It will receive $3 million.
""This is an important first step toward an orderly, fair and expeditious resolution of wildfire claims and a demonstration of our willingness to work collaboratively with stakeholders to achieve mutually acceptable resolutions,"" PG&E said in a statement provided to Reuters.

""We hope to continue making progress with other stakeholders,"" PG&E added.

237,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 08:30PM ET</span>","Demoting Powell, China's Rainbow Economy, `No One Died': Eco Day","(Bloomberg) -- Welcome to Wednesday, Asia. Here’s the latest news and analysis from Bloomberg Economics to help get your day started:"
238,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 08:00PM ET</span>",PG&E Reaches $1 Billion Wildfire Settlement With Agencies,"(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp., the California utility giant that went bankrupt five months ago amid crippling wildfire liabilities, has reached a $1 billion settlement with local government agencies that were harmed by blazes its equipment ignited.
The deal between PG&E and 14 public entities includes a settlement for the town of Paradise, which was destroyed in November’s Camp Fire -- the deadliest in California history. The agreement doesn’t affect any of the suits filed by individual homeowners and businesses against the San Francisco company, owner of California’s largest utility, and it must be approved by the judge overseeing the firm’s bankruptcy case.
Shares of the company rose as much as 5.5% before paring most of those gains in after-markets trading.
The settlement is one step forward for PG&E, which is working through the largest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history. The company has been juggling the interests of wildfire victims, activist investors and state lawmakers and regulators as it tries to come up with a restructuring plan.
“What we hope is that PG&E can come out of bankruptcy as soon as possible so these funds can be paid,” said John Fiske, an attorney with the Baron & Budd law firm representing the public agencies.
PG&E described the settlement in an emailed statement as “an important first step toward an orderly, fair and expeditious resolution of wildfire claims and a demonstration of our willingness to work collaboratively with stakeholders to achieve mutually acceptable resolution.”
The settlement covers the 2015 Butte Fire, the devastating 2017 Wine Country fires and last year’s Camp Fire, which killed 85 people. More than half of the total settlement amount -- $582 million -- would pay for Camp Fire damages, with Paradise receiving $270 million and its parks and recreation district getting $47.5 million. Butte County would receive $252 million, while Yuba County would get $12.5 million.
Criminal Case
Butte County’s district attorney has been considering criminal charges against the company over the fire, which state investigators blamed on a PG&E power line. The settlement announced Tuesday would have no effect on any criminal case, Fiske said.
Nine counties and cities would, together, receive $415 million related to fires that tore across Northern California’s wine country in October of 2017. And the Calaveras County Water District would get $3 million to cover damage from the 2015 Butte Fire, which was started by a tree leaning into a power line.
Also on Tuesday, California regulators asked for comment on proposals designed to improve PG&E’s safety culture. Among the proposals: splitting the company’s gas and electric operations into separate utilities or selling its gas assets outright; a periodic review of PG&E’s certificate to operate; eliminating PG&E’s holding company structure; and linking the company’s profits to safety performance.
“This is a company that is in Chapter 11 related to their perceived safety performance,” said Paul Patterson, an utility analyst at Glenrock Associates. “One has to wonder if any of these proposals would provide any meaningful additional incentive.”

240,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>",Trump's Trade War With China Could Squeeze U.S. Colleges Next,"(Bloomberg) -- Kirk Brennan, director of undergraduate admission at the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California, was on a bus in Baotou earlier this month, part of a multi-school recruiting trip in Inner Mongolia, when he heard the news: The Chinese Education Ministry had issued a warning to students studying in the U.S. to be vigilant about restrictions on academic visas.
It’s hard to overstate the importance of international students in general -- and Chinese students in particular -- to U.S. colleges and universities. Second only to New York University in its international student population, USC draws about 12% of its 47,000 students from China. Its 1,000 Chinese undergraduates alone could bring in more than $50 million in annual tuition revenue.
But the increasingly fraught relationship over trade between the U.S. and China threatens that pipeline. Orientations for incoming USC first-years in Beijing and Shanghai went off without a hitch last week, Brennan said, and as of now, the school has yet to confront “these kinds of road blocks.’’
Over the last decade, U.S. colleges and universities have turned to students from abroad to make up for rising costs and shrinking funding. And no country has been more eager to import American higher education than China: More than 360,000 Chinese students studied at such schools in the 2017-18 school year, making up one-third of the overall international student body.
“Every major institution builds international students into their financial model,” said Brad Farnsworth, vice president for global engagement at the American Council on Education, a higher education trade group. “Universities -- and their communities -- realize significant economic benefits.”
The Trump administration, though, has restricted access to student visas on concern that its biggest rival is exporting what it considers to be a growing threat to the American government, industry and the economy more broadly: spies. The suspicion is feeding a crackdown on students and even cancer and other researchers at leading institutions, which has led to worries that America is descending into a new Cold War-like Red Scare.
More than 80% of colleges and universities surveyed by the Institute of International Education said delays and denials have had a negative impact on their ability to enroll international students. Enrollment was flat from the 2016-17 academic year to 2017-18, while the Chinese student population increased 3.6%, the smallest gain in a decade.
Schools elsewhere have been eager to absorb the overflow. International student enrollment increased 20% in 2017 in Canada, which has eagerly promoted policies like expedited visa processing, post-study work visas and a path to citizenship.
“Politicians and university leaders alike have seized on the opportunity to brand the country as a proudly multicultural, welcoming destination,” according to a May report by the NAFSA: Association of International Educators. In 2018, Australia, which has similar post-study visa rules, saw international enrollment rise 15%.
Potential Losses
“If we’re left flat-footed, we may not be able to regain those losses,” said Rachel Banks, the group’s director of public policy.
Even with the political tensions and visa troubles, Chinese student enrollment won’t drop to zero overnight. But the stakes vary by school.
NYU, USC, Northeastern and Columbia universities enroll the most international students among private schools. Arizona State, the University of Illinois, UCLA and Purdue lead among public schools, according to the IIE.
“A good practice generally is to have a diverse source of students from many different countries,’’ Farnsworth said. “The reality is the global market doesn’t work that way. The most who have the financial means and motivation are coming from just a handful of countries.’’
Illinois, in particular, is already under pressure from several economic trends. State funding has dropped. The state’s high school-age population is shrinking, reducing the pool of undergraduates.
More than a decade ago, the school began actively recruiting students from abroad, said Kevin Pitts, vice provost for undergraduate education at the flagship campus in Urbana-Champaign. Chinese students are the biggest cohort, making up almost 12% of the school’s 49,000 students and concentrated in business and engineering degrees.
The University of Illinois’ international students overall generated about $475 million in economic impact and supported more than 7,300 jobs, according to data from NAFSA. Tuition paid by them also helps fund need-based and merit aid for in-state students.
“It’s absolutely true that the revenue helps us,’’ Pitts said in an interview. “It’s helping us be better servants of the students in the state.’’
If the number of undergraduates from China is curtailed, the school would turn its attention to potential out-of-state students, who also pay higher tuition than state residents. Prices are locked in for its current crop of students, so any tuition increase would take effect for those entering in 2020, Pitts said.
Insurance Policy
This isn’t the first time Illinois has considered its reliance on Chinese students. The colleges of engineering and business purchased an insurance policy to cover losses if international enrollment dropped precipitously. Chinese students comprise about 20% of graduate students at those schools.
If an unforeseen international event, including a trade war, causes an 18.5% decline in enrollment or greater, the insurance kicks in to cover the lost revenue. With graduate tuition at about $40,000 a year, a 20% drop in masters students would portend a $4 million shortfall, said Jeffrey Brown, dean of the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois.
“Recent events have made it clear why we were going down this path to begin with,’’ said Brown.

241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","Trump, Xi Stoke Trade Optimism With Plan to Resume Talks at G-20","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and China said their presidents will meet in Japan next week to relaunch trade talks after a monthlong stalemate, triggering a rally in financial markets.
President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he had a “very good” phone conversation with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The two leaders will hold an “extended meeting” at the G-20 summit on June 28-29 in Osaka and “our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting,” Trump said on Twitter. The U.S. president had repeatedly threatened more tariffs if Xi spurned the opportunity to talk.
“The meeting might very well go well,” Trump told reporters as he departed the White House to officially launch his re-election campaign in Orlando. China wants to make a deal, he added.
“That is working out pretty much as I anticipated,” he said.
Xi said he’s willing to meet with Trump and exchange views, the state-run China Central Television reported. The two nations’ economic and trade teams should keep in contact on how to solve differences, according to the statement. The dispute covers areas ranging from tariffs to Chinese intellectual-property protections.
U.S. stocks extended gains on the news, while Treasuries retreated. The S&P 500 rose about 1% in New York.
Talks with Beijing broke off last month after the U.S. accused China’s leaders of reneging on provisions of a tentative trade agreement and Beijing said the U.S. raised its demands. Trump raised tariffs on about $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25%, and said he would expand the tariffs to cover another $325 billion in goods -- essentially everything the country exports to the U.S. -- unless Chinese leaders reversed course.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told senators at a hearing in Washington on Tuesday that the Trump administration will stay tough.
“Our economic relationship with China has been unbalanced and grossly unfair to American farmers, ranchers and businesses for decades,” Lighthizer said in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee. On top of existing tariffs, the administration is prepared to do more “if certain issues cannot be resolved satisfactorily,” he added.
But while expectations have been raised for a breakthrough during the leaders’ face-to-face meeting, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the weekend downplayed the prospect of a major deal in the near term.
“I think the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks,” possibly with new ground rules and a schedule, Ross said in an interview Sunday with the Wall Street Journal.
Paying Tariffs
Trump has said that China must return to concessions it made in earlier rounds of talks. The U.S. president has repeated his claim that Chinese exporters pay the tariffs, disputing the consensus of economists that the costs are largely borne by U.S. importers and consumers.
“They subsidize their industry, so our people are not paying,” Trump said Friday in an interview with Fox News. “There’s this big thing about tariffs, ‘Oh, our people pay.’ It’s a lot of nonsense. You know what happens, really? Companies move back.”
Trump’s announcement of the call came shortly after a tweet in which he again accused China and other countries of manipulating their currencies, “making it unfairly easier for them to compete with the USA.”
China made moves to strengthen its currency earlier this month. During Trump’s presidency the U.S. Treasury Department has repeatedly refrained from officially accusing China of manipulating the yuan.

242,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",UBS Can Ride Out the 'Pig' Controversy,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Expect “Pig-gate” to blow over. UBS Group AG’s ultra-rich Chinese clients are unlikely to desert the Swiss bank for local rivals, whatever the level of outrage over language used by its chief economist in a research report last week.
The bank's potential loss of Chinese share-sale mandates isn’t a critical blow: UBS ranks a distant 11th in underwriting Hong Kong IPOs in 2019. (The bank fell behind after a one-year ban by the Securities and Futures Commission over deficiencies in its work on three companies that ran into trouble after listing.) Nor is the loss of bond mandates, such as its exclusion from a sale by state-owned China Railway Construction Corp.
Wealth management is different. UBS is vying for a share of a Chinese private-banking market that was worth a record $24 trillion in 2018, according to Boston Consulting Group. The furor among local brokerages over UBS’s use of “Chinese pig” in a report on pork supply and inflation comes just as the Swiss firm and other foreign banks are muscling in on their turf. Switzerland’s  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, Japan’s Nomura Holdings Inc., and Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are among firms that have received approval to expand or are working toward taking majority stakes in China ventures.
On top of that, Chinese regulators have cracked down on high-risk wealth management products sold by local banks and brokerage firms. That’s leveled the playing field for overseas competitors, which say their stricter compliance guidelines wouldn’t allow them to offer such investments.
Still, it’s outside China where UBS has most to protect. Like all foreign banks, it’s a minnow in the mainland market. By contrast, there’s a treasure trove of Chinese money being managed offshore in cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore and New York, according to a survey by consulting firm Capgemini SE last year. Boston Consulting reckons that market is worth $1 trillion. And here, UBS is hard to beat.
At the end of last year, the Zurich-based bank had $152 billion more in assets under management in Asia outside mainland China than Credit Suisse, its nearest rival. Chinese players don’t rank in the top 10 for bankers to well-heeled individuals in the region, according to data from Asian Private Banker.
UBS took in an unprecedented $16 billion in net new money in the first quarter, driving its Asia-Pacific assets to $405 billion. Credit Suisse collected the equivalent of $4.4 billion. UBS was also the region’s top equities trading house in the region last year, ahead of Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, according to data from London-based analytics firm Coalition Development Ltd. It’s been Asia’s No. 1 equities house since 2010. That’s key for high-net-worth individuals looking for ideas to trade on.
Money tends to flow to where it earns the most, other things being equal. Also, many clients have bought derivatives from UBS, which can’t be unwound at short notice without heavy penalties. UBS can console itself with the thought that other foreign banks have been able to ride out similar difficulties in Asia. Time is on its side.

Reuters had reported last week that Nissan was considering having Renault executives as members of nomination, audit and compensation committees, after the French firm expressed discontent with Nissan's envisioned governance reform.
Nissan is proposing an additional board committee possibly named ""strategy committee"", the Nikkei said.
The 20-year-old partnership was plunged into a crisis earlier this month, as the French automaker's demand for a greater say in Nissan's new governance system drew rare public censure by the Japanese firm.
On June 25, Nissan will be holding a shareholder meeting, which would see the company adopt an overhauled governance structure.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Vivendi could be excluded from voting at Mediaset's new Dutch TV group: document,"MILAN (Reuters) - Mediaset hostile shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) could be excluded from voting at shareholder meetings of a new Amsterdam-based TV company the Italian broadcaster is setting up, according to a bylaw of the new holding.
Mediaset earlier this month unveiled a corporate overhaul that includes putting the group and its separately-listed Spanish unit under a new Dutch holding company as part of a pan-European growth strategy.
The broadcaster, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will have around 35% of the holding MediaforEurope (MFE) and just above 50% of voting rights.
Vivendi, Mediaset's second-biggest shareholder, is set to have around 23 percent of MFE once the deal is signed off. However, most of that stake will be held in a trust reflecting the current set-up at Mediaset.
Vivendi could potentially scupper the corporate overhaul if it exercises its right of withdrawal for its whole stake as Mediaset has set a ceiling of 180 million euros on the cash outlay for the option, well below the Vivendi stake. 
The French media giant is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with Mediaset stemming from a failed 2016 pay-TV deal.
After Mediaset's pay-TV sale to the French group fell through, Vivendi built a stake of 29 percent in Mediaset but was later forced by Italian regulators to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns.
Vivendi is also the top shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
On top of that Vivendi and the trust have both been excluded from voting at Mediaset's shareholder meetings, because the broadcaster considers the stake illegitimate. A legal case is ongoing in court. 
A document posted on Mediaset's website late on Tuesday said that state of affairs would also be applicable to the Dutch holding until the legal dispute is resolved. 
The bylaws, which will be voted on at an MFE shareholder meeting called early in September to approve the deal, will need signing off by the new MFE board.

247,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Surges on Hopes for China Trade Deal and Lower Rates,"Investing.com - Stocks took off on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced he plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a bid to resolve their trade dispute.
In addition, pressure to move U.S. interest rates lower increased after the head of the European Central Bank said he was prepared to cut interest rates to support the euro zone economy.
The rally brought the S&P 500 to within 1.3% of a new high in a rally pushed by big tech stocks and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The S&P 500 rose 1%. The Dow added 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.4%. The Dow is within 1.8% of an all-time high. The Nasdaq is 2.7% below its high reached in April. The Nasdaq 100 index, which was up 1.5% on Tuesday, is still 2.8% below its 52-week high.
The rally was started by ECB President Mario Draghi's declaration the bank was prepared to restart its economic stimulus program if the outlook for inflation does not improve.
It took off later when Trump said he planned an extensive meeting with Xi at the G-20 meeting this month in Tokyo. The U.S. and China have been locked in a bitter trade dispute for more than a year that has included tariff increases and roiled economies worldwide and pushed oil prices lower.
The two announcements helped U.S. interest rates move lower, even as Trump accused Draghi of currency manipulation. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.06% on Tuesday, down more than a fifth this year alone and the lowest level since Nov. 8, 2016.
The Federal Reserve is meeting Tuesday and will announce a rate decision Wednesday afternoon. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests a 73% chance the central bank will leave its key Federal Funds rate at 2.25% to 2.5% and more than an 80% chance rates will be cut in July.
Boeing was the fifth-best S&P 500 performer as well as the top Dow stock. Boeing jumped 5.4% and contributed nearly 37% of the Dow's 353-point gain following an order for its troubled 737 Max jet at the Paris Air Show.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 2.4%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 1.7%, contributed 29.8% of the Nasdaq 100's gain of 109 points on the day.
The ally was the biggest for the S&P 500 and the Dow since June 4 and the biggest for the Nasdaq since June 7. The S&P 500 is up 16.4% this year. The Dow is up 13.5% and the Nasdaq is up 19.9%.

Building permits were higher. The U.S. housing is expected to be strong this year, thanks to lower mortgage rates, but most demand is coming from first-time buyers struggling with affordability issues.

(Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp, the world's No. 2 gold miner, believes its proposed offer to take full control of its African unit is ""more than fair"" and will engage with Acacia Mining Plc's board and minority shareholders to win them over, Chief Executive Mark Bristow told Reuters on Tuesday.
Acacia agreed on Tuesday to extend to July 9 the deadline for Toronto-based Barrick to make a firm offer to acquire the 36.1% of the company it does not already own. 
Barrick's May 21 share-for-share proposal valued Acacia at $787 million, a near 9% discount to its pre-offer closing price, drawing protests from Acacia's minority shareholders.
Following a 17% gain in Barrick shares driven by a gold price rally, the value had increased to $887.8 million as of Monday, a 6.8% premium. On Tuesday, Barrick shares closed up 1.3% at C$19.26 in Toronto.
""We’ve looked at the assets, the mine plans, and we felt our offer was more than fair based on our due diligence,"" Bristow said in an interview. ""There's still significant operational risk in these assets.""
Acacia shares have risen 12% since the original proposal, and closed broadly in line with the offer value on Tuesday.
Some Acacia minority shareholders remain unconvinced. 
""No one has ever won a takeover by approaching a company, offering a discount ... at the same time going against their own internal valuation, and then subsequently producing a bunch of new assumptions that make no logical sense for anyone, except the bidder,"" said a top-10 Acacia shareholder, who requested anonymity.
Barrick valued Acacia's assets at $1.3 billion in its 2018 annual report but said on Tuesday it had concluded, based on its review, that certain of Acacia's assumptions were not supportable. 
Barrick has expressed willingness to Acacia's minority shareholders to discuss the offer, and expects to engage with them in the coming weeks, Bristow said. 
""I’ve never been one that draws a line in the sand without proper engagement, and we’re committing again to engagement,"" Bristow said. ""But no one's come up with an alternative.""
Barrick's proposal followed two years of wrangling over a $190 billion Tanzanian tax bill, with Acacia shut out of talks with the Tanzanian government and Barrick negotiating on its behalf.
A proposed settlement included a $300 million payment to the Tanzanian government and a 50-50 split of the mines' economic benefits.

In the absence of a final deal with Tanzania, Acacia is expecting to go ahead with an international arbitration hearing in July, with an outcome expected by the end of this year.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>",U.S. agency to vote on auctioning key unused parts of 2.5 GHz band for 5G,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission will vote in July on whether to auction a key band of largely unused 2.5 GHz spectrum to help advance next-generation 5G wireless networks and scrap requirements that it be used for education, the agency said on Tuesday.
The FCC in May 2018 voted to consider releasing additional key 2.5 GHz mid-band spectrum reserved in the 1960s for what is now known as the Educational Broadband Service.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement the proposal would give existing users more flexibility in how they use the spectrum. ""Valuable mid-band spectrum available for new mobile services will allow for more efficient and effective use of these airwaves and will advance U.S. leadership in 5G,"" he added.
Pai said last year the FCC was seeking to ensure that existing users would retain spectrum, give some entities a chance to obtain new licenses ""and then auctioning off the remaining white spaces."" Reuters reported the auction plans earlier on Tuesday.
Sprint Corp uses leased spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band in its existing 4G network and 5G network that it is being rolled out. That spectrum is a key part of Sprint and T-Mobile US Inc's proposed $26 billion tie-up and 5G plan, and is not directly affected by the auction, FCC officials said.
The U.S. Education Department in a June 7 letter told the FCC it should maintain an ""educational use requirement"" for that spectrum and suggested setting aside revenue from license sales to help students who lack the internet access required to do their homework.
The FCC proposal would remove that educational requirement, officials told reporters on a conference call. It did not provide an auction timetable but said the proposal would establish a ""competitive bidding window."" Several FCC auctions are planned this year, the agency added.
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr last year noted that the 2.5 GHz band is unused in about half the country, and more than 90% of the licenses held by educational institutions are leased to other entities.
Carr said those arrangements show ""many educational institutions have contracted with those providers so that each can focus on what it does best: the former can educate
students, and the latter can build wireless networks.""

The FCC also plans to vote next month on revising its children's television programming rules, it said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyer Michael Avenatti, an outspoken critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, is scheduled to go to trial on Nov. 12 in federal court in Manhattan on charges of extorting  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE).
U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe scheduled the trial at a hearing on Tuesday, according to a court record. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
""I look forward to a New York jury hearing all of the relevant evidence relating to Nike,"" the California lawyer wrote in an email. ""I have complete confidence in the truth and am confident that I will be exonerated at the end of the trial.""
Avenatti, 48, was arrested in New York in March on charges of trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored. Nike has denied wrongdoing. [nL2N2340S7]
He has been separately charged in two other cases.
In one, also in New York, prosecutors claim that Avenatti defrauded porn star Stormy Daniels, the client who propelled him to fame. They say he diverted two $148,750 installment payments from Daniels' $800,000 book advance to himself by forging her signature in a letter to her literary agent and directing that the money be sent to his bank account.
In the other case, prosecutors in Los Angeles claim that Avenatti stole millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses and lied to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances.
Avenatti, who remains free on bail, has pleaded not guilty in both other cases. Trial dates have not yet been scheduled.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 by Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump in 2006. The president has denied having sex with her.
Avenatti began representing Daniels in litigation involving the hush money deal in 2018. He became a fixture on cable news channels as an outspoken critic of Trump, and briefly toyed with running for president in 2020.
Daniels fired Avenatti earlier this year.

Cohen is about six weeks into a three-year prison term after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations related to the hush money payment to Daniels and other financial crimes.

254,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - It’s clear that tomorrow is all about the Fed, with expectations that the FOMC won’t blink under pressure from President Donald Trump just yet, but will send all the right signals that a cut is coming.
One thing that may warrant more discussion is just how much it could cut. A standard quarter-point cut is still the prediction but there is a case to made that the FOMC could cut by 50 basis points when it does move.
The is now a 17.9% chance that rates will be a half-point lower after the July meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor. A larger-than-usual easing could give the Fed breathing room for a few more meetings (or the whole year) and also keep Trump tweets to a minimum.
Here's the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. It's Fed Day!
The Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day meeting on Wednesday, with many expecting the central bank to stand pat on rates, but tee up a rate cut for as soon as July. About 80% of traders expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold in the 2.25% to 2.50% range on Wednesday. More than 85% expect a rate cut in July.
Calls for a rate cut have grown louder as the Fed's 2% inflation goal has proved elusive. As well as stuttering inflation, escalating U.S-China trade tensions, which have kept global growth on the backfoot, have also bolstered the chorus for a cut.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's presser will also be parsed for clues about the central bank's future monetary policy intentions.
Powell and his colleagues have made it clear that they will cut rates preemptively - ahead of a recession - to shore up confidence and offset some of the headwinds tied to an increase in tariffs, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
2. Crude Oil to Stage Another Surprise Build?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report is due Wednesday, with analysts keen to see whether domestic crude stockpiles will stage an unexpected build for the third-straight week.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 1.08 million barrels for the week ended June 14.
Crude oil futures rose 3.8% to settle at $52.90 a barrel after President Donald Trump said he and China's President Xi Jinping will have ""an extended meeting"" at next week's G-20 summit.
Signs of easing U.S.-China trade tensions ""would be positive of course for global growth and then commodities demand and oil demand in particular,"" Julius Baer said.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels, which showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 0.812 million barrels last week.
3. Oracle Earnings on Tap
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is set to release its earnings after U.S. markets close on Wednesday.
The tech company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share on revenue of $10.95 billion in the fourth quarter, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Ahead of its earnings report, Oracle has seen its shares flirt with all-time highs. But while that may indicate investor optimism, cloud computing growth will likely draw the bulk of attention as the company has been ramping up investments in cloud computing to make up for its late entry to the rapidly growing segment.
In its previous quarter, Oracle topped third-quarter profit and revenue expectations, thanks largely to growth in its cloud services and licence support unit.
Oracle, up about 17% year to date, closed just shy of its all-time high of $55.33 on Tuesday."
255,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Vivendi could be excluded from voting at Mediaset's new Dutch TV group: document,"MILAN (Reuters) - Mediaset hostile shareholder  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) could be excluded from voting at shareholder meetings of a new Amsterdam-based TV company the Italian broadcaster is setting up, according to a bylaw of the new holding.
Mediaset earlier this month unveiled a corporate overhaul that includes putting the group and its separately-listed Spanish unit under a new Dutch holding company as part of a pan-European growth strategy.
The broadcaster, controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will have around 35% of the holding MediaforEurope (MFE) and just above 50% of voting rights.
Vivendi, Mediaset's second-biggest shareholder, is set to have around 23 percent of MFE once the deal is signed off. However, most of that stake will be held in a trust reflecting the current set-up at Mediaset.
Vivendi could potentially scupper the corporate overhaul if it exercises its right of withdrawal for its whole stake as Mediaset has set a ceiling of 180 million euros on the cash outlay for the option, well below the Vivendi stake. 
The French media giant is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with Mediaset stemming from a failed 2016 pay-TV deal.
After Mediaset's pay-TV sale to the French group fell through, Vivendi built a stake of 29 percent in Mediaset but was later forced by Italian regulators to transfer most of its voting rights into a trust because of antitrust concerns.
Vivendi is also the top shareholder in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT).
On top of that Vivendi and the trust have both been excluded from voting at Mediaset's shareholder meetings, because the broadcaster considers the stake illegitimate. A legal case is ongoing in court. 
A document posted on Mediaset's website late on Tuesday said that state of affairs would also be applicable to the Dutch holding until the legal dispute is resolved. 
The bylaws, which will be voted on at an MFE shareholder meeting called early in September to approve the deal, will need signing off by the new MFE board.

256,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 05:02PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Surges on Hopes for China Trade Deal and Lower Rates,"Investing.com - Stocks took off on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced he plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a bid to resolve their trade dispute.
In addition, pressure to move U.S. interest rates lower increased after the head of the European Central Bank said he was prepared to cut interest rates to support the euro zone economy.
The rally brought the S&P 500 to within 1.3% of a new high in a rally pushed by big tech stocks and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The S&P 500 rose 1%. The Dow added 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.4%. The Dow is within 1.8% of an all-time high. The Nasdaq is 2.7% below its high reached in April. The Nasdaq 100 index, which was up 1.5% on Tuesday, is still 2.8% below its 52-week high.
The rally was started by ECB President Mario Draghi's declaration the bank was prepared to restart its economic stimulus program if the outlook for inflation does not improve.
It took off later when Trump said he planned an extensive meeting with Xi at the G-20 meeting this month in Tokyo. The U.S. and China have been locked in a bitter trade dispute for more than a year that has included tariff increases and roiled economies worldwide and pushed oil prices lower.
The two announcements helped U.S. interest rates move lower, even as Trump accused Draghi of currency manipulation. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.06% on Tuesday, down more than a fifth this year alone and the lowest level since Nov. 8, 2016.
The Federal Reserve is meeting Tuesday and will announce a rate decision Wednesday afternoon. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests a 73% chance the central bank will leave its key Federal Funds rate at 2.25% to 2.5% and more than an 80% chance rates will be cut in July.
Boeing was the fifth-best S&P 500 performer as well as the top Dow stock. Boeing jumped 5.4% and contributed nearly 37% of the Dow's 353-point gain following an order for its troubled 737 Max jet at the Paris Air Show.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 2.4%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up 1.7%, contributed 29.8% of the Nasdaq 100's gain of 109 points on the day.
The ally was the biggest for the S&P 500 and the Dow since June 4 and the biggest for the Nasdaq since June 7. The S&P 500 is up 16.4% this year. The Dow is up 13.5% and the Nasdaq is up 19.9%.

263,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - It’s clear that tomorrow is all about the Fed, with expectations that the FOMC won’t blink under pressure from President Donald Trump just yet, but will send all the right signals that a cut is coming.
One thing that may warrant more discussion is just how much it could cut. A standard quarter-point cut is still the prediction but there is a case to made that the FOMC could cut by 50 basis points when it does move.
The is now a 17.9% chance that rates will be a half-point lower after the July meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor. A larger-than-usual easing could give the Fed breathing room for a few more meetings (or the whole year) and also keep Trump tweets to a minimum.
Here's the top three things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. It's Fed Day!
The Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day meeting on Wednesday, with many expecting the central bank to stand pat on rates, but tee up a rate cut for as soon as July. About 80% of traders expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold in the 2.25% to 2.50% range on Wednesday. More than 85% expect a rate cut in July.
Calls for a rate cut have grown louder as the Fed's 2% inflation goal has proved elusive. As well as stuttering inflation, escalating U.S-China trade tensions, which have kept global growth on the backfoot, have also bolstered the chorus for a cut.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's presser will also be parsed for clues about the central bank's future monetary policy intentions.
Powell and his colleagues have made it clear that they will cut rates preemptively - ahead of a recession - to shore up confidence and offset some of the headwinds tied to an increase in tariffs, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
2. Crude Oil to Stage Another Surprise Build?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report is due Wednesday, with analysts keen to see whether domestic crude stockpiles will stage an unexpected build for the third-straight week.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 1.08 million barrels for the week ended June 14.
Crude oil futures rose 3.8% to settle at $52.90 a barrel after President Donald Trump said he and China's President Xi Jinping will have ""an extended meeting"" at next week's G-20 summit.
Signs of easing U.S.-China trade tensions ""would be positive of course for global growth and then commodities demand and oil demand in particular,"" Julius Baer said.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data, which often serves as an early indication of weekly petroleum levels, which showed weekly crude stockpiles rose by 0.812 million barrels last week.
3. Oracle Earnings on Tap
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is set to release its earnings after U.S. markets close on Wednesday.
The tech company is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share on revenue of $10.95 billion in the fourth quarter, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
Ahead of its earnings report, Oracle has seen its shares flirt with all-time highs. But while that may indicate investor optimism, cloud computing growth will likely draw the bulk of attention as the company has been ramping up investments in cloud computing to make up for its late entry to the rapidly growing segment.
In its previous quarter, Oracle topped third-quarter profit and revenue expectations, thanks largely to growth in its cloud services and licence support unit.
Oracle, up about 17% year to date, closed just shy of its all-time high of $55.33 on Tuesday."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus' defense division is looking for new partners to expand its presence in the growing U.S. space market, and could potentially build components for a lunar program there, Airbus Defense and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke told Reuters.
Airbus is ramping up production of more than 640 refrigerator-sized satellites for start-up telecoms services provider OneWeb at a facility in Florida, that Hoke said would already give it some leverage in the U.S. market.
The company could also produce components in the United States for its European Support Module, a critical part of NASA's Orion spacecraft, if that is modified as a module to access the moon, Hoke told Reuters at the Paris Airshow.
""We're also looking for new partners, with whom we could expand our footprint in the U.S.,"" he said. ""We have some very good products and systems so it's worthwhile to look at what we can do beyond what we do currently in Europe.""
Airbus's defense and space division has long hoped to expand operations in the U.S. market, but lost out to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on a lucrative U.S. Air Force refueling plane contract in 2011.
The company, which builds satellites and works with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) to build rocket launchers, now hopes the projected ""new space"" economy, which experts say could be worth $1 trillion a year, could give it another shot at a bigger U.S. role.
Hoke faulted European leaders for failing to articulate a clear, unified vision for its ambitions in the space business, and said they were essentially ceding leadership to the United States and billionaire private investors, such as Elon Musk.
""This is more than just a billionaire’s race to Mars. It is about having sovereign access to space, having access to resources in the long term, and of course, unfortunately, it is also a question of defense.""
Failing to take action and jump start new research and development program would leave Europe ""in the second and third row position,"" he said, noting that it would also cause a brain drain of top talent.
Rick Ambrose, head of U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin's space division, the lead contractor on the Orion spacecraft, told Reuters his company was in preliminary discussions with Airbus about possibly the adapting the European Support Module to bring humans to the moon and back to an orbiting lunar station.
Ambrose said no decisions had been made, but it was ""a logical conclusion"" that some of the items developed by Airbus for the Orion spacecraft could be used to achieve U.S. President Donald Trump's goal of putting humans back on the Moon by 2024.

""Getting to the moon by 2024 means .... we're going to have to reuse everything we can reuse,"" he said at the air show.

265,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>",EU Jobs Minefield Might Just Offer Path to Scourge of Google,"(Bloomberg) -- As European leaders prepare for another round of horse-trading in Brussels this week, one candidate is emerging from the sidelines that could fit the bill to become the bloc’s top executive.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s antitrust chief, is increasingly seen as a viable option to lead the European Commission, not only generating the least opposition among the 28 member states, but also ticking off many of the right boxes, according to government officials in several European capitals. Deciding on the next president of the commission would fill a key piece of the puzzle for the bloc’s top jobs, which also include pending appointments for a successor of Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and Donald Tusk as chair of the meetings of EU leaders.
Known for her tough stance against big business, the Danish career politician may get French President Emmanuel Macron’s tacit backing, and would address demands for gender and geographical mix in top positions, according to some of the officials. Angela Merkel, who nominally still backs Manfred Weber as her candidate, also wouldn’t oppose Vestager, they said.
Last month’s European Parliament elections ""voted for change,"" Vestager told a Free University of Brussels audience on Tuesday. ""Maybe we should try something new, try: woman,"" she said since ""it’s long overdue for a woman to hold"" the commission president job.
By contrast, Weber faces considerable resistance in Paris and has put forward a lackluster bid. Even some members of the EPP, the European group of center-right parties he represents, see Weber as a poor fit lacking experience, while two officials in European capitals cited his lack of command of the French language as a drawback.
Lead Candidates
The other big name formally in the race with the backing of the center-left is Frans Timmermans. The Dutchman, who’s currently principal vice president of the commission, has upset many Eastern European countries by going after Poland and Hungary over their democratic standards, and would most likely not get the necessary support from conservatives in the European Parliament, which can veto any nomination from the bloc’s leaders.
""Vestager looks the easiest consensus candidate to me,"" said Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics in Washington D.C. ""By virtue of being the first female commission president, Vestager would give an important signal of ‘change at the top of the EU,’ imbuing it with renewed political legitimacy.""
To be sure, there’s still a laundry list of obstacles for Vestager. Part of the German government is still unhappy over her role in shooting down the planned merger between the rail units of  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA. Merkel, part of whose party sees Vestager as a disguised Macron candidate, would want something in exchange for giving up on Weber, perhaps the placement of a German to head the ECB.
Beyond Berlin, Europe’s Christian Democrats are also wary of handing the EU’s top executive post to a liberal candidate, instead of one of their own members, after their group won the European elections, according to one leader of an EPP member-party.
Then there’s Italy’s fractious populist government, dominated by Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini who is on a collision course with the Commission over the country’s debt mountain. Rome has yet to decide which candidate to back for the EU jobs.
In his meeting with EU Parliament leaders on Tuesday evening in Brussels, Tusk said it would be very difficult for national leaders to reach an agreement at their June 20-21 gathering on a nominee for Commission president, according to an official familiar with the exchange.
At the same time, Tusk held out hope for a deal among the government heads by the time the new EU Parliament starts business on July 2, the official said on the condition of anonymity because the meeting on the sixth floor of the assembly’s main building in the Belgian capital was behind closed doors.
Tusk also signaled that the pool from which national leaders can propose a new commission chief extends beyond the official candidates put forward by Europe’s main political parties, while he indicated that choosing from among them could facilitate an endorsement of the pick by the EU Parliament, the person said.
Narrowing the field to official candidates would potentially boost Vestager’s chances and kill those of the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier or World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva, the names of whom have also been floated. Unlike the three main candidates, Georgieva and Barnier didn’t campaign for the job, and parachuting them in a top post could make a mockery of a process backed by many European lawmakers and Merkel herself.
Backlash
Vestager is one of the most visible EU commissioners thanks to her crackdown on big-tech behemoths and on corporate tax evasion, at a time when establishment politicians face a popular backlash over inequality. She fined Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) 1.49 billion euros the day before she started campaigning as one of the Liberal party’s candidates.
U.S. President Donald Trump too weighed in with a few remarks on her high-profile cases.
And yet she ran a fairly low-profile campaign for the EU job and at one point this month had to field a question as to whether she was still in the race.
Today, her prospects look different.
""She could be acceptable to the EU Parliament and to the heads of state,"" said Carsten Brzeski, ING chief economist. ""Of all the candidates she stands the best chances for the top commission post.""

266,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 03:23PM ET</span>",Investor Litt says Hudson's Bay worth double chairman's C$1.74 billion bid,"(Reuters) - Activist shareholder Jonathan Litt lambasted a C$1.74 billion bid to take Canadian retailer Hudson's Bay Co private as ""woefully inadequate"" on Tuesday, saying the chairman-led shareholder group looking to push through a deal could double the offer.
The shareholder group, which collectively owns 57% stake in the struggling retailer, made an offer last week to buy the company for C$9.45 per share, with plans to fund the deal using some of the proceeds from asset sales.
Litt, however, said if the buyout group used all the proceeds from asset sales, rather than a part of it, it could raise the offer to C$18 per share.
He also asked the special committee of independent directors, tasked with evaluating the latest offer, to hire an independent investment bank to evaluate the value of Hudson's Bay's real estate and retail banners.
Litt's Land and Buildings and other shareholders have long criticized Hudson's Bay for not doing enough to capitalize on the value of its properties.
Hudson's Bay real estate was worth as much as $6.4 billion or $35.24 per share, the company said in 2017. 
However, that figure included the Lord & Taylor flagship store, which the company sold to WeWork and partner Rhône Capital for $850 million in October 2017, and a Vancouver property owned by the company's RioCan joint venture, since sold for $675 million. 
Shares of the company, which owns the Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor retail chains, have risen nearly 61% to C$10.25 since Baker's proposal. 
The department store operator has been shuttering underperforming shops to cut costs and stay competitive among discount brands and e-commerce behemoths such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and is the latest retailer to consider going private. 
Last year, members of Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) Inc's founding family offered $8.4 billion for the company, but abandoned the bid once Nordstrom's special board committee rejected it.
Litt also said he believes it was highly unlikely that a majority of the shareholders outside the buyout group will approve the transaction. 
Hudson's Bay and the buyout group were not immediately available for comment.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 03:23PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo parent is dismissed from lawsuit by Philadelphia, Baltimore","NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co was dismissed as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore, which accused large banks of conspiring to inflate interest rates for variable-rate demand obligations (VRDO), a type of tax-exempt bond.
The dismissal came after Wells Fargo represented that it did not remarket, provide letters of credit for, or manage money market funds that invested in the bonds, according to a Tuesday filing in federal court in Manhattan.
Other Wells Fargo entities remain defendants.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) were previously dismissed from the case, though affiliates of those banks remain defendants, according to court records.
The remaining defendants include Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), and Royal Bank of Canada, the records showed.
Philadelphia, which said it issued more than $1.6 billion of VRDOs, and Baltimore, which said it issued $261 million, stated that the collusion enabled banks to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees they did not earn.
The cities said this reduced critical funding for hospitals, power and water supplies, schools, transportation and other municipal services. Their proposed class action covers the period from February 2008 to June 2016.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 02:47PM ET</span>",Boost for Boeing as BA owner backs grounded jet with 200-plane order,"By Tim Hepher and Eric M. Johnson
LE BOURGET, France (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) won a major vote of confidence at the Paris Airshow on Tuesday as British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) signed a letter of intent to buy 200 of its 737 MAX jets that have been grounded since March after two deadly crashes. 
News of the deal, worth more than $24 billion at list prices, sent shockwaves round the world's largest air show which had struggled to find its rhythm amid the 737 MAX crisis and concerns about an economic slowdown.
Airbus, the current supplier of IAG's British Airways and Vueling brands, was stunned by the announcement which came months after it lost a major BA wide-body aircraft order to its U.S. rival. Industry sources said the European company had not been offered a chance to bid.
""We have every confidence in Boeing and expect that the aircraft will make a successful return to service in the coming months,"" IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said of the 737 MAX, announcing the first deal for the plane since its grounding.
Boeing's top-selling aircraft has been taken out of service worldwide since an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crashed in March, five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX plunged into the sea off Indonesia. A total of 346 people died in the two disasters.
Boeing is working on a fix to anti-stall software at the center of investigations into the crashes and hopes to get approval from regulators to get the jet back flying by the end of the year.
Walsh, a former 737 pilot, said he would have ""no hesitation"" in boarding the plane and voiced confidence in the changes Boeing has made, having seen them first-hand on a 737 MAX simulator. 
""I believe the aircraft is safe,"" he said.
Boeing shares rose more than 4%.
IAG said it planned for the mix of 737-8 and 737-10 aircraft to be delivered between 2023 and 2027.
""Obviously it's a breakthrough for Boeing to be able to say that a major airline has shifted to Boeing and an endorsement of the future of this aircraft,"" said Goodbody brokerage analyst Mark Simpson.
Boeing has acknowledged it will take time to restore trust after a widely criticized response to the crashes and insiders say the company has assumed that the job of rebuilding confidence must, for now, be led by airlines and regulators.
HEAVY DISCOUNT
""We can't thank you enough for the confidence you placed in the Boeing family,"" Boeing's head of commercial airplanes Kevin McAllister told Walsh at a signing ceremony.
But the deal, covering a period at least four years away when some airlines are already hesitating to commit due to economic risks, will have come at what one experienced aircraft negotiator described as a ""spectacular"" price discount.
Aircraft typically sell at about half the official catalog price, but discounts on the deal will be steeper, he said.
""Boeing gets an endorsement at exactly the right moment and this completely shifts the narrative; IAG gets to lock in very good pricing,"" aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia said.
But while the deal rescued Boeing's fortunes inside the air show, safety experts stressed it remains unclear how and when regulators will allow the plane to fly. Walsh stressed it was up to up to the U.S. and global regulators to review the fix.
Airbus meanwhile snagged a crucial $6 billion order for 36 planes from Philippines budget airline Cebu Air, including 10 of the new long-range A321XLR model launched on Monday, and a deal to sell a further 30 A320neo aircraft to Saudi Arabian Airlines, worth $3.3 billion at list prices.
The dealmaking could help to soothe investor nerves that a decade-long boom in demand for commercial aircraft is coming to an abrupt end, but volume remains lower than previous years.
With airlines struggling to contend with overcapacity, slowing economies and geopolitical tensions, some analysts warn Airbus and Boeing could face a growing number of cancellations or deferrals from their bulging order books.
But the planemakers remain confident of continued strong demand for more fuel-efficient jets as emissions regulations tighten and air travel continues to rise. Boeing on Monday increased its 20-year industry demand forecast. 
""Although investors have started to ask questions about the state of the upcycle, the aerospace industry remains very confident in the current state of the market,"" analysts at Vertical Research Partners said in a note.

American Airlines and leasing giant GECAS are among airlines in talks to buy Airbus's new A321XLR, which is aimed at helping airlines add routes with smaller planes and at stealing a march on Boeing proposals for a mid-market jet.

271,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank Weighs Senior Shakeup as CEO Purges Top Ranks,"(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is planning sweeping changes to his top management, considering replacing finance chief James von Moltke and investment banking head Garth Ritchie, as he purges executives who rose under his predecessor.
The bank is expected to decide on the future of several management members within weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Sewing may take over control of the investment bank from Ritchie on an interim basis while the bank searches for a permanent successor, one person said. Karin Dohm, head of regulatory affairs, is the frontrunner to replace compliance chief Sylvie Matherat, they said, asking not to be named disclosing internal deliberations.
Since taking over a year ago, Sewing has moved to replace leaders who rose under predecessor John Cryan with mostly German trusted lieutenants. A former  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). treasurer who joined in 2017, von Moltke has seen his tenure at times marred by poor communication. Ritchie and Matherat, the subject of longstanding criticism, received the lowest shareholder backing of all top management recently. Ritchie oversees the troubled securities unit while Matherat struggled to end a long series of misconduct and control failures.
Deutsche Bank, Dohm and Ritchie declined to comment. Matherat didn’t answer an email and von Moltke declined to comment through a spokesman.
Shares of the lender rose 3.4% at 5:14 p.m. in Frankfurt, paring losses this year to 9.3%.
Cold Water
Sewing has already replaced the head of the transaction bank, the chief operating officer and the head of anti-money laundering at Deutsche Bank. In October, he named Asoka Woehrmann to succeed Nicolas Moreau as head of the asset management business.
Like Ritchie, Moreau and Matherat, von Moltke joined the top ranks of the bank under Cryan. He hit a rough patch in March 2018 when, less than a week after the bank sounded a bullish tone in its annual report, he poured cold water on the outlook for the securities unit, rattling investors. He also described Deutsche Bank’s situation as a “vicious circle of declining revenues, sticky expenses, lowered ratings and rising funding costs.”
It’s not clear who would replace von Moltke. Alexander von zur Muehlen, another long-term veteran of the bank and Sewing confidant, has been advising the CEO on strategy for the past year. He’s a former group treasurer and also worked at the investment bank.
Ritchie and Matherat have long been the subject of speculation. Sewing didn’t mention either of them when he highlighted recent turnaround successes in his speech at the annual general meeting, a sign that they may have fallen out of favor.
Sewing has vowed to make tough cutbacks to the securities unit, saying that he’s “rigorously focusing” on profitable businesses. That was a departure from previous comments by Chairman Paul Achleitner, seen as a backer of a big investment bank, who has said that he doesn’t see a need for a radical shift in the unit.
Achleitner, who has come under increasing criticism for his oversight, acknowledged at the bank’s annual general meeting last month that he had made some mistakes. At the tense meeting where several investors urged the chairman to step down early, Achleitner assured Sewing of his full backing for measures to revive the lender.
Legacy Scandals
Ritchie has been with Deutsche Bank for more than two decades, rising through the ranks in the investment bank before taking it over in a shakeup in late 2015. Multiple cutbacks to the business under his watch have failed to restore sufficient profitability and growth, while past misconduct at the unit continues to haunt it.
In the latest setback for the South African, he was among dozens of current and former Deutsche Bank executives to become a target in a widening German probe of a tax scam involving dividend payments, according to people familiar with the matter.
Matherat, a former deputy director general at the Bank of France, joined Deutsche Bank in 2014 and became a management board member the following year. But the string of legacy scandals that has plagued the bank for the better part of the decade continued unabated under her watch, culminating in video footage of a massive police raid on Deutsche Bank’s Frankfurt headquarters late last year.
If Dohm replaces Matherat, she probably won’t join the management board, the people said.
Sewing has been working on a fresh turnaround plan to restore investor confidence after breaking off merger talks with  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). He’s zeroing in on another round of deep trading cuts that may result in the shuttering of U.S. equities trading, as well as the creation of a non-core unit to wind down as much as 50 billion euros ($56 billion) in unwanted assets, a person familiar with the matter has said.
Here’s a list of recent replacements made or said to be planned (*indicates the decision hasn’t been made):

Dish could announce a deal as soon as this week for assets including wireless spectrum and Sprint's Boost Mobile brand, the Bloomberg report said, adding that it hasn't been finalized and talks could still fall through.
The U.S. Justice Department had wanted Sprint and T-Mobile to sell off additional assets including some wireless spectrum to create a new wireless competitor before agreeing to approve their $26.5 billion merger. A DOJ decision on the merger is expected this week.
Last week, Reuters reported that private equity group Apollo Global Management was in talks with Dish to finance a bid for the assets.
Dish has stockpiled wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, and is facing a deadline next year to build a network that fulfils the license requirements or risk losing the license.
The company, controlled by founder Charlie Ergen, met with the Federal Communications Commission on June 11 to discuss the impact of the merger on its plans to enter the wireless market, according to a regulatory filing.
The DOJ declined to comment, while Sprint had no immediate comment. Dish and T-Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Shares of Sprint were up 2.4% and T-Mobile 1%, while those of Dish were up marginally.

Odebrecht, which was laid low by a corruption investigation that has rippled across Latin America, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, kicking off one of Latin America's largest, in-court debt restructurings.
Sao Paulo bankruptcy court Judge João de Oliveira Rodrigues named restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal as the court administrator for Odebrecht and gave the company 60 days to present a restructuring plan for approval by creditors.
Rodrigues said in his decision that creditors are not allowed to sell shares in three subsidiaries, which are pledged as collateral. Odebrecht had requested the measure on Monday, arguing that its stakes in petrochemical company Braskem SA, offshore drilling firm Ocyan SA and ethanol unit Atvos are essential for the group's restructuring.
Braskem shares rose nearly 4% in Tuesday trading.
Among Odebrecht's largest creditors are six banks and an investment fund, totaling 33 billion reais in debts owed to Banco Bradesco SA, Itau Unibanco Holding SA and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA and to state-controlled banks Banco do Brasil SA, Caixa Economica Federal and BNDES. 
Odebrecht said 14.5 billion reais of its bank debts are linked to shares as collateral, so are not subject to the in-court restructuring.
State-controlled banks are the most exposed to Odebrecht, as they lent the most without collateral. Development bank BNDES is the group's largest individual creditor, with 7 billion reais in unsecured debts, plus 3 billion reais in debts with collateral.

Wedbush on Monday initiated coverage on Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) with an outperform rating and $33 price target and claimed the company's platform is ""unique to any other media platform as advertising actually improves the consumer experience.""
Pinterest rallied to a session high of $29.79 but pared some gains to trade at $28.70, up 3.12% at 1:42 PM ET. Pinterest shares are up 51% since going public at $19 a share on April 17.
Pinterest's ""fundamentally different"" platform makes it stand out from rivals as ""Pinterest users, or 'Pinners,' often come to the site for discovery and idea generation and are often in various stages of the commercial intent funnel,"" Wedbush analysts Ygal Arounian and Amir Chaudhri said.
Despite stiff competition for advertising dollars from the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which together account for about 65% of all global digital ad dollars spent, Pinterest is on track to top $1 billion in revenue this year, the analysts said.
Wedbush estimates revenue will rise 43% this year to $1.1 billion and 37% to $1.5 billion in 2020.
Pinterest, similar to some of its recent IPO peers, remains a loss-making entity, but Wedbush sees the social media company ""roughly break-even"" next year and generating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $260 million in 2021.
""Many key initiatives like its self-serve ad platform, international localization, shopping and its catalogs product aren't expected to have meaningful impact until 2020,"" Arounian and Chaudhri said."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's AB Volvo is joining forces with Nvidia Corp to develop artificial intelligence used in self-driving trucks, in a boost for the U.S. chipmaker that was dropped by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc last year. 
The agreement announced on Tuesday by Nvidia and Volvo, the world's second-biggest truckmaker after  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), is a long-term partnership spanning several years. Work will begin immediately in Santa Clara, California, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Volvo, which last year demonstrated its first cabin-less autonomous truck, Vera, said the partnership would develop a flexible, scalable self-driving system, which is planned to be used first in pilot schemes before commercial deployment.
""The resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,"" Volvo said in a statement.
Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, has been aggressively expanding into the automotive sphere, where trucks - with their regular routes that are easier to automate than cars navigating traffic - may lead the way in self-driving.
Nvidia dominates the fast-growing AI chip market alongside  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
Tesla, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Daimler and several startups are racing each other towards autonomy, using closed-area pilots such as warehouse-to-warehouse delivery or mining-site operations to speed up testing and commercialization.
Volvo's first commercial autonomous technology will move into real operation from pilot mode in winter this year.
Seven Volvo FH16 trucks will transport limestone for Norway's Broennoey Kalk AS from a mine to a nearby port, Volvo Trucks' autonomous solutions director, Sasko Cuklev said, on Tuesday.
""This coming winter, Volvo Trucks' autonomous mining solution will be in operation and we will get paid per transported tonne,"" Cuklev said at the company's annual general meeting in Gothenburg.
He said the seven trucks, together with a site management system, truck services and support, workshop set-up and insurance would be wrapped together to make Volvo's first commercial autonomous transport package. 
Volvo Chief Technology Officer Lars Stenqvist said he preferred not to set a firm date for when a self-driving Volvo truck using Nvidia technology would travel a public highway. Deployment will start in areas that are not open to the public and ""gradually grow into more complex situations,"" he told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. ""We are humble as to the challenges we have."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said last month that Nvidia-backed startup TuSimple had secured 12 customers that were generating revenue. TuSimple last month said it had begun testing for the U.S. Postal Service.
PILOT PROJECT
Nvidia, which has previously announced technology partnerships with automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp , said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo. 
""The latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told reporters on a conference call.
Huang emphasized that for Nvidia the partnership with Volvo goes beyond supplying chips, and includes work on developing software, on-board computers and sensor systems for autonomous commercial vehicles. ""The technology inside the vehicle is much more significant than we would apply"" to a consumer-owned car, he said.
Volvo said last week its Vera self-driving truck would begin transporting goods from a logistics center to a port terminal in Gothenburg in collaboration with logistics firm DFDS, in a first step towards operations on public roads. Systems designed under the partnership with Nvidia would be used to develop vehicles capable of operating on public streets, Stenqvist said.
Nvidia's so-called Drive Constellation chips often power the machine learning used to refine self-driving car software algorithms inside data centers, and the company has also been working to build its Drive chips into cars. 
Automotive chips accounted for $641 million of Nvidia's $11.7 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year.
Tesla was previously a major customer for Nvidia's automotive chips but last year CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car pioneer was developing its own chip.

AB Volvo's and Nvidia's collaboration will be built on Nvidia's full software package for sensor processing, perception, map localisation and path planning.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 01:28PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. seen open to mechanism to end aircraft subsidy spat - sources,"By Tim Hepher and Andrea Shalal
PARIS (Reuters) - The United States is expected to be open to negotiations on an ""enforceable mechanism"" that could allow European planemaker Airbus to receive government funding on commercial terms and ease the risk of tit-for-tat sanctions, two U.S. sources said.
Such a deal would also include moves by the United States to address tax incentives provided by Washington state to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and make them compliant with trade rulings, as part of a possible new framework for aircraft industry funding, they said.
The comments are among the first indications of a possible path to a deal to end a 15-year-old transatlantic trade dispute over mutual claims of illegal subsidies, which have brought the United States and European Union to the brink of a tariff war.
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that the world's two largest planemakers received billions of dollars of harmful subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world's largest ever corporate trade dispute, consuming thousands of pages.
The United States has threatened to impose billions of dollars of tariffs against goods from the European Union, while the EU has warned of counter-tariffs in a parallel case running about 9 months behind the timetable for U.S. sanctions.
The WTO is expected to rule on the U.S. sanctions request over the summer, though the date could slip to September.
""It may be possible to create a mechanism for legal government funding, but which must be commercial and enforceable,"" one of the U.S. sources said, adding such a step could only be taken if the EU demonstrated a ""serious"" commitment to tackling the dispute.
At the same time, the United States would be very likely to insist on some remedy for what it believes are billions of dollars of harmful subsidies received by Airbus in the past.
""If you have a new set of rules, but they are not enforced, what have you actually achieved?,"" the source said.
Western officials who have tried to explore a compromise in the past believe any new funding agreement must set an example for China, whose own rapid aerospace growth with state backing is viewed as a worrying threat by the two Western giants.
Any resolution to the dispute that has been weighing on Airbus and Boeing for over a decade must be decided by governments rather than the companies, and depends on a positive signal from the European side, the sources said.
""It is now a matter for governments,"" the other source said.

Boeing declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Airbus said earlier the company had repeatedly called for discussions to end the marathon dispute.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 01:13PM ET</span>",Bayer asks trial judge to reverse $2 billion Roundup jury verdict,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has asked a California judge to overrule a $2 billion verdict by jurors who found the company's glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer responsible for a couple's cancer, arguing the jury decision was not supported by evidence.
The German drugmaker and chemicals company in court filings on Monday in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland blamed the massive verdict on ""inflammatory, fabricated and irrelevant evidence"" from the couples' lawyers.
""The resulting trial focused not on ascertaining the truth regarding the state of the science, causation, and compliance with legal duties, but instead on vilifying  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in the abstract,"" the company, which bought Monsanto last year for $63 billion, said in motions filed with the court.
Bayer faces Roundup cancer lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs across the United States. It denies the allegations, saying the weed killer and its active ingredient glyphosate is safe for human use.
The verdict and two prior jury decisions against Bayer have triggered steep declines in Bayer shares, leaving it with a market valuation of $56 billion.
Bayer asked Superior Court Judge Winifred Smith, who presided over the roughly seven-week long trial, to reverse the jury decision and enter judgment in Bayer's favor, or order a new trial.
The Oakland jury on May 13 awarded more than $2 billion to Alva and Alberta Pilliod, finding their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to have been caused by using Roundup to kill weeds on their property between 1975 and 2011.
The jury awarded $18 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to Alva Pilliod, and $37 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to his wife.
Bayer in its court filings called the punitive damages excessive and unconstitutional, and asked Smith to toss or significantly reduce the award. The large punitive damages award is likely to be reduced due to U.S. Supreme Court rulings that limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9:1.
Michael Miller, a lawyer for the Pilliods, in a statement on Tuesday said the verdict would be sustained.
""Monsanto is arguing the same worn out arguments it unsuccessfully used in the first trial,"" Miller said.  
In that trial, a California jury in 2018 awarded $289 million to a California groundskeeper, finding Monsanto's glyphosate-based weed killers caused his cancer. That award was later reduced to $78 million and being appealed.

In March, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $80 million to another California man after finding Roundup caused his cancer. The company said it would appeal that decision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday invited the public to comment on whether it should expand its private offering framework, a move to consider boosting the number of investors in private companies, the agency said.
The agency's request for feedback comes after SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the agency would address his concern with the large amount of capital raised in the private versus public markets, and the way it bars some investors from participating.
""We are taking a critical look at our exemptions from registration to ensure that our multifaceted private offering framework works for investors and entrepreneurs alike, no matter where they are located in the United States,” said Clayton.
He added that the goal is to expand investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate protections.
The agency said it welcomes responses from startups, entrepreneurs and investors. 
Democrat-appointed Commissioner Rob Jackson said that he hesitantly voted in favor to open the rule to comment because of the potential for fraud to less-savvy investors.

""The questions in this release involve a fundamental tradeoff: the costs families suffer when investors are victims of fraud versus the benefits of broader access to capital,"" Jackson said.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 12:50PM ET</span>",Rolls-Royce boss laments Brexit distraction at Paris Airshow,"By Alistair Smout
PARIS (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) chief executive Warren East said on Tuesday that uncertainties over Brexit remain an unwelcome distraction for the aerospace industry three years after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
A delay to Britain's EU departure and the possibility of it leaving without a deal in October has kept Brexit center stage at the Paris Airshow, where East said it had dominated a meeting with heads of aerospace companies and a European commissioner.
""It's nuts that at a meeting like we had this morning, when we were meant to be talking about new technologies, dealing with global competition, that instead we spend half the time talking about Brexit. It's hugely disruptive,"" East told Reuters.
Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but has failed to do so, with Prime Minister Theresa May resigning after repeatedly failing to pass a Brexit deal. Some leading candidates to replace May suggest the deal can be reopened, although the EU insists it is not open for renegotiation.
Brexit has been delayed until October 31 from March 29, and East said Rolls-Royce had spent money on contingency plans for a March departure that it will not get back.
The prospect of a ""no-deal"" Brexit is a headache for the global aerospace industry, which relies heavily on integrated supply chains and parts distribution centers.
East said that he was prepared for the possibility, but was unlikely to make specific plans for the October deadline in the same way as he had done for March.

Eviation Aircraft said the plane - called Alice - was a radical rethinking of the cost, experience and environmental impact of regional travel.
The impact of air travel on the environment has become a key focus of climate campaigners and airlines have long been looking at ways to address emissions and their costs through new designs and cleaner technologies.
""Operating at a fraction of the costs of conventional jetliners, our Alice will redefine how people travel regionally and usher in a new era of flying that is quieter, cleaner and cost effective,"" Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay said. 
The company said it would be aimed at high traffic commutes such as Paris to Toulouse, Norway’s Oslo to Trondheim and America’s San Jose to San Diego.
It said its first commercial customer would be Cape Air, one of the largest independent regional airlines in the United States, serving 35 cities there and in the Caribbean. Cape Air has a ""double-digit"" purchase option for Alice, a statement said.
""We see tremendous opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of our operations,"" Cape Air founder and CEO Dan Wolf said in a statement released from the airshow, which has been dominated by deals for industry heavyweights Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.

Following test flights this year and certification in 2021, Eviation said it planned to begin shipping the aircraft for commercial use in 2022.

The e-commerce giant bought social network Bebo for under $25 million via its streaming platform Twitch, TechCrunch reported.
Twitch plans to work with Bebo to build out esports, specifically TwitchRivals, according to TechCrunch.
A relatively small company, Bebo helped build up the esports market by organizing and running tournaments for streamers, making it more popular and profitable via player fees and advertising.
Esports is a growing sector, with nearly 400 million users in 2018, according to eMarketer. It is projected to be worth between $1.6 billion and $3 billion by 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The global video and electronic games market will generate $152.1 billion in 2019, up 9.6% over last year as gaming morphs into content and communication, according to a report by gaming analytics firm Newzoo on Tuesday.
It is ""the complete convergence of different forms of digital entertainment all coming together,"" Peter Warman, chief executive of the Netherlands-based firm, told Reuters in a phone interview.
As games become seemingly ubiquitous, they are turning into tools for connectivity, allowing players to chat with friends and meet new people. Fortnite publisher Epic Games Inc, in particular, believes in gaming as a communication platform, Warman said.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is launching its own games through its Facebook, WhatsApp Inc and Messenger apps, as is Tencent Holding Ltd's WeChat in China.
On June 5, Words With Friends developer Zynga Inc launched a new battle royale game exclusively on the new gaming platform of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), home of messaging app Snapchat.
This year, the United States will overtake China for the largest gaming market by revenues - $36.9 billion versus $36.5 billion - due to growth in console games and the influence of Fortnite in America and the echo of a previous governmental freeze on new games in China.
""I believe it's a temporary glitch,"" said Warman of the Chinese market, because there are so many games in the pipeline awaiting approval.
Japanese companies are also making a comeback, in part because of nostalgia for retro games.
A revamp of Final Fantasy VII, originally released in 1997 by Japan's Square (NYSE:SQ) Enix Holdings Co Ltd, is expected to be released next year, for example.
Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) and Bandai Namco Holdings Inc, developer of the classic Pac-Man games, are ranked 9th and 10th on Newzoo's list of top public gaming companies by revenue.
""It's taken a long time but they're back,"" Warman said, after some Japanese developers were slow to embrace mobile gaming and shift business models from paid games to free-to-play.
Mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets, versus PC and console games, remains the largest platform, producing $68.5 billion, or 45% of the global market, the report said. 
Newzoo surveyed more than 62,500 invite-only respondents from February to March across 30 markets, among other data sources. It is the firm's 9th such annual report.

The report excludes revenue from esports, or formalized professional video game competitions. Newzoo reported in February that global esports revenue would hit $1.1 billion this year.

BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) plans to convert its $2 billion Highbridge multi-strategy fund into a credit-focused fund as the bull market shows signs of slowing and clients want to invest elsewhere, a company spokesman said on Tuesday.
The Highbridge fund, which is available to institutional and wealthy private investors, is part of JP Morgan's $150 billion global alternatives business, which offers real estate, private equity, credit, infrastructure and hedge fund portfolios.
As part of the change, one of the four lead portfolio managers, Arjun Menon, will be leaving the company.
""As markets and clients evolve, we continue to innovate and examine our alternatives offering to ensure we deliver the solutions clients want and need today and into the future,"" company spokesman Darin Oduyoye said, explaining the move.
Three of the four key portfolio managers, Mark Vanacore and Jon Segal and Jason Hempel, who have been leading the multi-strategy credit business for the last decade, will stay with the fund.
Investors will be allowed to shift their capital to the new fund or pull some or all of it out at a time the fund was delivering gains to investors. Exact returns for 2019 could not be learned.
JPMorgan first bought a piece of Highbridge, co-founded by Glenn Dubin, in 2004 and purchased the rest five years later. In 2015 the lender agreed to sell the majority of Highbridge's $22 billion private equity business to senior executives.
Vanacore, who joined Highbridge at its founding in 1992, was named the chief investment officer for Highbridge Capital Management in 2012, a position he holds in addition to being a portfolio manager. 
Menon, who had concentrated on investing in Asian stocks, plans to launch his own fund in the future.

As investors speculate that the bull market, which has pushed ahead for a decade, will inevitably slow in the months ahead, many investors are looking for alternatives and are showing signs of preferring more niche oriented strategies, fund managers and analysts have said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A state-backed cyber-attack could secretly corrupt the records of British financial institutions over a period of months, posing a risk that banks would probably struggle to guard against on their own, a senior Bank of England policymaker said.
Banks have focused mainly on stopping service outages, but the falsification of transaction records and other data was an even bigger danger, Anil Kashyap told lawmakers on Tuesday.
""If you wanted to do maximum damage, that is what you would probably do if you were a state actor,"" he told a parliament committee.
Britain's security services have warned about the risk of cyber-attacks by Russia and other countries, and the BoE has urged banks to boost their preparedness to avoid disruption to one of the world's largest financial centers.
But British financial institutions might not be able to guard against this type of attack on their own, Kashyap said.
""If you think it is a state actor, I don't know if you think any particular firm can defend itself,"" he added.
Attacks on bank records would be especially damaging as it would not be easy to identify which records were accurate and which had been corrupted.
""You have this difficult situation where you have to restore the system, where you could be restoring a corrupt system,"" Kashyap said.
Financial institutions also risked focusing too much on dangers that would damage their individual reputations, rather than threats to the system as a whole, such as overreliance on a handful of providers of cloud computing services.
""I don't really care if bank 'x' is offline for a week, even if it's disastrous for their share price, if the services that they provide, that are critical, can be delivered in some other way,"" Kashyap said. ""What is tricky is it could be the case that the (bank) board's incentives of what to worry about are misaligned with the general incentives.""
He also said the BoE would keep a close eye if major technology firms begin to rapidly gain market share in financial services.
Earlier on Tuesday, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it was launching a digital currency and payment service for its users.

Kashyap, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, was speaking to parliament's Treasury Committee which was examining his reappointment to the BoE's Financial Policy Committee, which monitors risks to the banking system.

Citing an unnamed person close to the matter, Bloomberg said Sewing could remove James von Moltke as CFO.
Separately, Germany business monthly Manager Magazin reported that Sewing was also discussing the possibility of replacing Garth Ritchie as head of investment banking to make the planned restructuring of the division a top priority. 
Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Shares in Deutsche Bank rose 2.7 percent on the news and traded 3.5% higher at 1411 GMT.
In May, Sewing promised shareholders ""tough cutbacks"" at its underperforming investment bank, a major source of revenue for Germany's largest lender, which has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Sewing is expected to announce changes in July, according to sources. The bank reports second-quarter earnings on July 24.
On Monday, a source close to the matter said Deutsche Bank is planning to overhaul its trading operations by creating a so-called bad bank to hold tens of billions of euros of non-core assets.

Deutsche Bank also plans to dramatically reduce the size of its U.S. equities business, leaving only a skeleton operation in place to service corporate and high-net-worth clients, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Kellogg, like other packaged food companies, has struggled with surging expenses owing to higher transportation and raw material costs, while consumers have shifted to trendier more health-focused upstart brands.
The company's shares lost around 10% of their value last year and are down by more than a third from peaks hit in mid-2016.

(Reuters) - British money manager Neil Woodford faced further pressure on Tuesday after retail platform Fidelity International stopped its customers from making new investments in one of his smaller funds.
Woodford, one of Britain's best-known fund managers, suspended the 3.7 billion pound ($4.6 billion) LF Woodford Equity Income fund on June 3 due to a rise in redemption requests, leaving investors unsure about when they will get their money back. 
This has put Woodford's business under scrutiny by regulators and politicians, and led to outflows from the Income Focus fund, his other open-ended investment fund.
Fidelity's decision to curb new investments in the Income Focus fund is the latest setback for Woodford, after British wealth manager St James's Place ended a 3.5 billion pound investment mandate with Woodford Investment Management.
Meanwhile, investment platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) removed the Equity Fund, which has come under fire for investing in unlisted and illiquid stocks, from its 'Wealth 50' list and cut its exposure to the Income Focus fund. 
Fidelity said in an emailed statement that its move was ""in the best interest of our platform clients unless and until uncertainties are resolved,"" adding it was not restricting withdrawals from the fund.
It said that the restrictions were temporary and a ""precautionary measure"".
The Income Focus fund ""doesn't have any exposure to illiquid or unquoted securities"", a Woodford spokesman said in an email, adding that it contains ""a combination of large, mid and small-sized companies"". 
The Income Focus fund's assets under management (AUM) have dropped 32% since the Equity Income fund suspension, to 325 million pounds, Morningstar data shows. Redemptions and market movements can contribute to a drop in AUM.
The suspension of Woodford's fund could become a ""very big problem"" if it caused investors to doubt the integrity of the financial system, Bank of England policymaker Anil Kashyap said on Tuesday.
And PIMFA, the trade association for investment managers and financial advisers, said it represented ""an erosion of trust"", while retail investor lobbyist Gina Miller called for an independent review into the regulator.

Woodford's only listed fund, the Woodford Patient Capital Trust, hit record lows on Tuesday, down more than 30% since the Equity Income fund suspension. It recovered ground to 55 pence by 1220 GMT, down 0.2%.

That has left investors unclear as to when they will get their money back.
""As evidenced by the Woodford saga, it is a disgrace that the FCA has not changed rules allowing companies 'seeking' a listing within the next 12 months or companies listed on exchanges, even if rarely traded, to be somehow treated as if they were listed,"" Miller's firm SCM Direct said.
The UK government should ""launch an independent root and branch review of the FCA"", it said in a statement, adding that it wanted ""to end the dismal treatment of UK retail fund investors"".
Miller said the FCA should ban funds from which investors can redeem daily or weekly from investing any further money into unlisted or illiquid stocks or directly-held properties.
More than 18 billion pounds in assets under management in property funds were suspended for several weeks shortly after the Brexit referendum in 2016 as investors rushed for the exits.
The FCA declined to comment. The UK finance ministry did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Miller also said whistleblowers should be financially rewarded, and that UK mutual funds should have ""truly independent boards"".

308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Here's What BofAML Says May Happen If Trade War Is Here to Stay,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors need to think big and long-term on ramifications of a potentially protracted U.S.-China trade war, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
That recommendation comes as analysts are extending expectations for how long it will take the U.S. and China to patch up a trade deal. The Trump White House has turned to tariffs as a policy tool, members of Congress from both parties are indicating support for a tough stance and China has signaled it has “tremendous room“ to act to shore up its economy on its own.
“The risk of the two countries moving apart inexorably has risen,” analysts including head of China equity strategy David Cui wrote in a research note dated June 17. They see tighter controls on China’s capital account, difficulty raising external funding and threats to Hong Kong’s role as a finance hub among possible implications of a more drawn-out conflict.
Hong Kong’s importance as a global financial center to fund Chinese companies and Taiwan’s role as a technology provider “may come under increasing pressure,” BofAML’s note said, particularly if the U.S. and Hong Kong Policy Act is revoked and the city’s financial market is no longer seen as part of the global financial system. The firm predicted that would be negative for Chinese equities broadly and particularly for the tech sector.
Given the possibility of “financial decoupling” between the U.S. and China, the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s new trading venue for high-tech companies may become more important for those that can’t seek a Nasdaq listing, BofAML said, though for large companies it may lack the depth of U.S. markets. “If they are pressed to list locally, it could be a negative for them,” the note said.
The bank expects China’s capital account controls to be tightened and its financial market “to turn more inward.” That may benefit the housing market as more domestic savings remain in China, while the local market may become less vulnerable to foreign capital flight, the note said.
Overseas direct investment may also come under scrutiny from governments, BofAML’s analysts added.
“Private companies with global ambitions may suffer the most,” the note said."
309,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 07:31AM ET</span>","'Super Mario' shock: euro slides, yields hit new lows","By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro took a beating and German bond yields hit a fresh record low on Tuesday in reaction to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's comments indicating a possibility of new rate cuts or asset purchases.
Draghi said the ECB would need to ease policy again, if inflation did not head back to its targets, and that there was still ""considerable headroom"" to do so. Inflation in the euro zone slowed to 1.2% in May, the lowest in more than a year.
German government bond yields, the benchmark for Europe, fell to -0.30% for the first time ever and the euro slumped to a two-week low versus the dollar, while European stocks shook off early weaknesses to trade 0.9% higher.
""From the market reaction, we are increasingly learning that when a central bank's senior leaders vindicate expectations, market shifts extend. The same thing happened when the Fed confirmed its dovish shift earlier this year,"" said Themos Fiotakis, head of FX and rates strategy at UBS.
(Graphic: Draghi sends Bund yield to new record low - https://tmsnrt.rs/2XXH7Rc)
Draghi, nicknamed ""Super Mario"", looks set to end his eight-year term this year without having ever executed a rate rise.
The ECB's signals came a day ahead of a widely anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision, where expectations were running high that Draghi's counterpart Jerome Powell would probably lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year.
""In just a few months, the market has turned from being guided by the Fed to actively guiding the Fed,"" interest rate strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) wrote.
The U.S. central bank is likely to leave borrowing costs unchanged, but markets are almost fully pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut for July. 
The meeting will also provide the most direct insight yet into how deeply policymakers have been influenced by the U.S.-China trade war. [FED/DIARY]
Rate cut hopes, fueled by Draghi's dovish speech, led the U.S. treasury yield to the lowest since September 2017.
Uncertainty over the trade war has sent investors storming toward U.S. Treasuries, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch's fund manager survey showed. Treasuries were the ""most crowded"" trade for the first time in its survey. 
(Graphic: U.S. interest rates - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Iogak7) 
The impact of U.S. restrictions on exports to China is already resonating in Europe with German silicon wafer maker Siltronic warning that the spat would hit its sales and profitability.
The warning knocked European technology stocks, but a sharp reversal in the euro and rate cut signals offset the weakness driving the pan-European STOXX index 0.9% higher as of 1031 GMT.
In another blow to the German economy, which is expected to grow by just 0.5% in 2019, a survey by ZEW institute showed the mood among German investors deteriorated sharply in June due to recent weak economic data and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.6%, while Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.7%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.15%, boosted by Europe.
""Markets have been very tentative over the last few sessions, trading largely sideways...Oil dropping and gold rising is also an ominous sign,"" said John Woolfitt at Atlantic Markets.
Crude oil slipped a further 0.8% on Tuesday on global growth worries, although losses were capped by tensions in the Middle East after last week's tanker attacks. [O/R]
Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced on Monday the deployment of about 1,000 more troops to the Middle East for what he said were defensive purposes, citing concerns about a threat from Iran.
The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major peers, is holding tight at two week highs.
The Australian dollar fell to a fresh five-month low of $0.6830 after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's June meeting showed policymakers thought it might have to ease again to push down unemployment and revive wages and inflation.
The central bank cut rates to a record low of 1.25% earlier this month to support the slowing economy.
Meanwhile, sterling steadied after hitting 5-1/2 month lows as traders waited for news on the contest for the leadership of the ruling Conservative party.
""The fact that Boris Johnson will most likely become the new prime minister hangs like a sword of Damocles over the trend of the pound. With this in mind, investors are currently rather reluctant to place too much trust in the currency,"" said Marc-André Fongern, a strategist at MAF Global Forex in Frankfurt.

In the developing world, stocks were set to snap a four-day losing run on Tuesday, while emerging markets currencies edged firmer against the dollar as cautious optimism crept into markets ahead of the Fed meeting.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted that rate cuts or further asset purchases would be warranted unless inflation in the eurozone picks up, something that seems unlikely in the face of a largely synchronous global economic slowdown caused by the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Draghi's comments come as the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day policy meeting.
While no rate cut is expected from the Fed this week, traders have increased their expectations that it will cut rates this year to support an economy that appears to be slowing down increasingly sharply.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Treasuries 'most crowded' as investors flee risk: BAML survey,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors said U.S. Treasuries were the ""most crowded"" trade for the first time in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's (BAML) fund manager survey, reflecting the market's lurch toward safe-haven assets as money managers recalibrate the interest rate outlook.
Allocations to bonds jumped by 12 percentage points to the highest since September 2011 as dovish signals from central banks and rock-bottom inflation expectations triggered a U-turn in rate forecasts, the monthly survey showed on Tuesday.
The percentage of investors expecting higher short-dated interest rates fell to its lowest level since 2008, the survey of 230 panelists with $645 billion in combined assets under management found.
Money managers meanwhile dumped risk: they haven't been this bearish on stocks since early 2009 when the world was in the throes of a global financial crisis.
Funds' allocation to global equities dropped by 32 percentage points from May to a net 21% underweight, the lowest allocation to stocks since March 2009 and the second-biggest one-month drop on record. 
""The tactical ‘pain trade’ is higher yields and higher stocks, particularly if the Fed cuts rates on Wednesday,"" said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist. 
As investors fled risky assets, they pumped up their portfolios' cash buffers, driving the average to 5.6% from 4.6% - the biggest jump since the 2011 debt ceiling crisis. 
SLOWING GROWTH, LOW INFLATION 
Investors were overwhelmingly gloomy about growth and inflation. The survey's measure of growth expectations collapsed by a record 46 percentage points to a net 50% of respondents expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months. 
A record number said the global economy is late-cycle, and just 9% expect higher global inflation in the next year - the most bearish inflation outlook since August 2012.
Asset managers see the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting rates if growth slows and markets fall further, and likewise expect U.S. President Donald Trump to act in the event of a further slide, for fear of it hurting his re-election chances.
The federal funds rate is currently set in a range of 2.25% to 2.50%.

Respondents saw the Fed likely cutting rates if the S&P 500 falls to 2,430 points, and U.S. President Donald Trump cutting a comprehensive trade deal should the index tumble to 2,350 points. The S&P 500 closed at 2,889.67 points on Monday.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",London's Heathrow airport publishes third runway masterplan,"LONDON (Reuters) - London Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe, published its masterplan plan for expansion on Tuesday, including building a controversial third runway and new terminal facilities, at the start of a 12-week statutory consultation.
Emma Gilthorpe, Heathrow's Executive Director for Expansion, said: ""This consultation is an opportunity for people to have their say on our preferred masterplan, so it's really important that as many people as possible take part.""
Britain has spent decades arguing about building more air capacity in the densely-populated southeast of England.
The government won a vote a year ago to proceed with Heathrow expansion, including building the first full-length new runway in the London area for 70 years.
But the plan is opposed by local politicians, environmental campaigners and the London mayor, who say increasing the number of flights at the hub from 473,000 in 2016 to a capacity of 740,000 will worsen air quality and increase noise pollution. 
Lawmaker Boris Johnson, the front-runner to become the next Conservative leader and prime minister, told voters in his west London constituency four years ago that he ""would lie down with you in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway"".
However, his opposition has softened, and he told a meeting of his fellow lawmakers this month that the expansion plan had been approved by parliament.
The plan published by Heathrow, which is owned by Ferrovial, Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corporation among others, shows growth in stages from the opening of the third runway in about 2026 to the end of the masterplan in about 2050.
It includes plans to mitigate the environmental impact of the expansion, including an ultra-low emissions zone, a vehicle access charge and a proposed 6.5-hour ban on scheduled night flights. Rivers will be diverted and a tunnel built to take vehicles on the busy M25 motorway under the new runway.

The consultation runs from Tuesday until Sept. 13, Heathrow said.

(Reuters) - Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co said on Tuesday it has teamed up with  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) to develop and produce engines for hypersonic weapons that can travel 4,000 miles per hour.
The Pentagon plans to spend billions of dollars on developing hypersonic weapons in the coming years as Russia and China work on similar capabilities.
Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour.
Northrop's scramjet engine technology uses the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds.
Several weapons makers are competing against the Raytheon and Northrop team to develop the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC program. The program aims to produce a cruise missile for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Air Force. 
Thomas Bussing, Raytheon's advanced missile systems vice president, told Reuters in an interview, ""we will be flying in the near-term with that weapon.""
The weapons, which can be used offensively or defensively, can be launched from either the air or ground, Bussing said. 
Under the agreement, Raytheon and Northrop said they will continue to collaborate on air-breathing hypersonic missiles.
""We've achieved 50% weight reduction"" during the development of the propulsion system, said Pat Nolan, the vice president of missile products at Northrop Grumman. At one point the Northrop engine consisted of more than 100 components, but there will be fewer than 10 in the finished product, Nolan added.

China, Russia and the United States have focused research and development on two classes of these weapons: hypersonic glide vehicles and cruise missiles that fly at hypersonic speeds, according to U.S. and other Western weapons analysts and military officials. Both types could carry conventional or nuclear payloads.

315,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 04:52AM ET</span>",StockBeat: There's More to U.K. Stocks Than Brexit,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- The Brexit endgame may be casting ever-longer shadows over U.K. assets, but it's not cloaking them entirely in darkness
With the U.K. seemingly on the verge of choosing a new prime minister committed to leaving the EU without transitional arrangements to ensure smooth trade on Oct. 31, sterling is wilting. However, U.K. stocks - already 'under-owned' by international institutional investors, seem to be less affected.
The pound hit a new low against the euro for the year of 1.1149 earlier Tuesday, an achievement made all the more remarkable by growing speculation that the European Central Bank will take its interest rates still deeper into negative territory before the summer is out. By contrast, not even hawkish talk by policy-makers of a labor market running hot seems to be able to give credibility to the Bank of England’s tightening bias.
The U.K. stock market is the second-worst performing of all major European bourses this year, lagging only Spain's IBEX. The FTSE All-Share Index is up only 9.3%, while the Euro Stoxx 50, which tracks only Eurozone stocks, is up 12.8% (both the U.K. and European markets are drifting Tuesday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting that starts later in the day).
And yet, the stand-out performances among individual stocks appear to have little to do with the drawn-out European drama. Two of the best three performers in the index are clothes retailer  Next  (LON:NXT) - a fairly pure play on U.K. consumer spending that has shown clear signs of weakness as Brexit-related uncertainties slowed the economy – and  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE), which may well lose large chunks of some of its core businesses in the event of a “Hard” Brexit. Of those, Next's biggest challenge has been the transition to an omnichannel retailer, while LSE has profited from escaping a merger with Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) that would have brought endless political and regulatory distractions.
At the other end of the spectrum, utility  Centrica  (LON:CNA) can hardly blame its 35% drop this year on Brexit, and sub-prime lender  Provident Financial  (LON:PFG) is down 25% largely to a failed merger deal and some rigorous attention from the regulator.
Nor is Brexit the only risk out there: utilities are spooked by the prospect of a hard-left Labor government coming to power if Conservative support blows up at the next election, while the natural resource groups that have sustained the FTSE 100 for most of the last three years are now under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war, which is hammering commodity markets.
It’s also possible to argue that the problems of tour operator Tui (LON:TUIT) and International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) – two of this year’s other big losers - are due to bigger problems such as excess capacity (although you can argue that Brexit uncertainties have contributed to weak European demand for short-haul flights in particular).
The moral seems to be that even if the B-word requires a higher risk premium for the market in general, there is still plenty of scope for differentiated performance within the world’s least loved asset class."

(Reuters) - European stock markets recovered from early falls on Tuesday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi promised more monetary stimulus if the economy does not improve, offsetting another warning on slowing sales from the chip sector. 
Speaking at the ECB's annual conference in Portugal, Draghi pointed the way to cuts in interest rates or new asset purchases if inflation does not return to target, weakening the euro, lowering European bond yields and pulling stock markets higher.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was 0.1% higher by 0817 GMT, having fallen around a third of a percentage point at opening. The interest rate sensitive banking sector tumbled 0.6%.
The newsflow from European corporates continues to point to a euro zone economy struggling to get back off the ground after a decade of monetary efforts to reboot growth. 
German chipmaker Siltronic tumbled 10.3% after it warned U.S. restrictions on exports to China would hurt business, saying Q2 sales would be ""significantly below"" the first quarter and were likely to decline further.
The profit warning came hot on the heels of U.S. chipmaker Broadcom's shock statement last Thursday that trade issues would knock $2 billion off 2019 sales and Frankfurt's trade sensitive DAX remained deep in negative territory, down 0.7%.
""The series of warnings in the chip business is further proof that the trade war is a key risk in the background,"" said Simona Gambarini, a markets economist at Capital Economics.
Another German chipmaker Infineon Technologies and STMicroelectronics, dropped 4.8% and 2.9% respectively, pulling the technology sector 1.1% lower. 
Infineon's move came after it launched a 1.5 billion euro capital increase. 
Concern over the protracted trade war between the United States and China drove European stocks 6% lower in May, their worst performance in more than two years, and spurred bets that central banks worldwide would turn more accommodative.
The rising hopes of moves by both the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve has helped the STOXX 600 gain 2% so far this month.
The U.S. central bank is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at a two-day policy meeting starting Tuesday, but its many traders expect its statement to open the way to rate cut next month.

In M&A news, Tieto rose 4.7% after the Finnish technology firm agreed to pay 13.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.51 billion) for Norwegian competitor Evry. Evry's shares surged 16.9%.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 03:50AM ET</span>","Italy's Creval aims to spin off bad loans, triple net profit by 2021","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Creval said on Tuesday it would spin off its bad debts into a separate unit and reduce its exposure to domestic government bonds under a new plan seeking to triple net profit in the next three years.
The bank expects to roughly halve its gross soured loan burden to below 6.5% of total lending in 2023 from 11.4% in March, by selling a further 800 million euros ($899 million) in problem loans following disposals of around 4 billion euros since 2016.
Following in the footsteps of bigger rival UniCredit, Creval said it would spin off 1.9 billion euros in bad debts into a dedicated unit and halve its portfolio of securities, more than two thirds of which are domestic government bonds, during the five-year plan period.
Under new CEO Luigi Lovaglio, Creval said cost cuts and additional revenues would allow it to reach a net profit of 93 million euros in 2021, compared with 32 million euros last year.
Lovaglio, who made his name in the banking industry as the head of UniCredit's former Polish unit Bank Pekao, was appointed at the end of February as part of a boardroom shake-up.
Crippled like many Italian lenders by a deep recession that turned sour almost a fifth of all banking loans, Creval raised 700 million euros in capital last year - or nearly eight times its then market value - to be able to write down bad loans and sell them off. 
Shareholders bought new shares at 10 euro cents each, almost double the current price of 5.8 cents. At 0702 GMT shares in Creval were up 2.8 percent.
Under the new plan, the lender aims to return to paying a dividend on 2020 earnings with a pay-out ratio of more than 50%.
The bank, based in the Alpine Valtelline area north of Milan, said it would keep its core capital above 14% of assets both in 2021 and 2023, compared with 14% at the end of March.

319,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>","Bond Investors Dust Off Crisis Playbook, Fire Up Best QE Trades","(Bloomberg) -- Bond investors are preparing for another wave of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank by returning to some of their favorite post-crisis trades.
First up: buy the debt of nations such as France that have greater scope for purchases by the ECB. Next, bet on a drop in longer-maturity yields relative to near-term rates. Then go for the region’s higher-returning bonds, like Spain.
While fund managers are not expecting any immediate move by the ECB, many are factoring in action to stimulate the region’s flagging economy this year. The global trade conflict and record-low inflation expectations have turned money markets to price in rate cuts by 2020. Since the ECB has kept deposit rates negative, policy makers might be more inclined to re-visit QE first.
“I would expect further rate cuts, QE, a further extension of forward guidance,” said Russell Silberston, a fund manager at Investec Asset Management, which oversees $133.7 billion. “At the broadest level we like anything that benefits from lower for longer, so yield curve flatteners for example.”
ECB President Mario Draghi said at the bank’s last policy meeting that there is “considerable headroom on QE.” Other officials have since reinforced the message. Bank of Finland Governor Olli Rehn, a candidate to replace Draghi this year, tweeted the ECB has “gotta do what’s gotta do, as needed.”
In the last round of QE following the financial crisis, the ECB hoovered up 2.6 trillion euros of debt from 2015 to the time they called it quits at the end of 2018. That insulated markets from risk and led to winning bets for funds buying German, French and Italian debt, which were among the biggest beneficiaries of the program and saw yields fall to historic lows.
The debt of nations with more longer-term securities that the ECB could still buy -- such as France -- are now outperforming in the latest rally. That’s because, with the ECB only taking bonds yielding more than its minus 0.4% deposit rate, those have become scarcer. It is also pushing long-dated yields down faster.
Flattening Curves
The flattening of yield curves “has much further to run” as the restart of QE was barely factored into markets before the ECB’s last meeting, according to Citigroup’s Jamie Searle in a note entitled “Flatteners, flatteners, flatteners”. He favors trades targeting a fall in Spain’s 30-year yields relative to 10-year bonds.
Investors have been piling into bonds since then, driving yields across the continent to fresh record lows and narrowing premiums over Germany. Danske Bank A/S likes bets on these spreads tightening further as it sees the pressure mounting on the ECB, while Rabobank’s head of rates strategy Richard McGuire recommends traders buy 30-year Belgian bonds versus Germany.
Others favor Italy, which has plenty of debt for the ECB to soak up. While Italian bonds have been weighed down by political risk in the past year, they “would be the clearest long in Europe” if QE were to restart, according to NatWest Market’s Giles Gale. He recommends five-year Italian debt against Germany.
Scarcity Trades
A restart of QE is far from set in stone as the ECB may need to see more signs of an economic slowdown in the second half of the year to act. Any easing of trade tensions could scupper trades placed too soon, while a revival of inflation expectations could also curb the market speculation.
“The macro picture is not bad enough yet to prompt more easing, but there has clearly been a shift in focus towards downside risks to growth and Draghi is prepping the market for more stimulus if things do get worse,” said Joubeen Hurren, a money manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors. “Curves can still flatten.”
Restarting bond buying wouldn’t be without its hurdles either. The ECB is currently only allowed to buy 33% of the total stock of a given nation’s bond and it is already at that level in Germany, and close in the Netherlands, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). By comparison, the bank estimates it has France and Italy at around 20%.
This issue of scarcity is leading some investors to buy bunds versus interest-rate swaps, which the ECB would be unlikely to buy. This trade could also serve as a hedge against turmoil, such as a flare up in Italian political risk, with the bonds outperforming from a flight to safety. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch’s Sphia Salim favors buying 30-year German bonds against interest-rate swaps.
“We like owning shorter-dated bonds in Germany and also in European swaps,” said Grant Peterkin, a senior managing director at Manulife’s Absolute Return Rates Fund. “We still feel there is value in a world where inflation expectations continue to be muted and some form of stimulus will be needed to reflate the global economy.”

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Tuesday unveiled its most significant business reshuffle since co-founder Jack Ma announced his pending retirement, as the e-commerce firm looks to bolster its investment focus in the face of slowing growth.
Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu will oversee Alibaba's strategic investments unit, taking over that responsibility from Executive Vice-Chairman Joe Tsai who will support Wu in her expanded role, the firm said on its official WeChat account.
The change comes as Alibaba invests in new business lines such as cloud computing as a boom in its core e-commerce has peaked and revenue growth slows.
Reuters reported last month that the firm is considering raising as much as $20 billion through a listing in Hong Kong to boost funds available for investment.
""To guarantee innovation, invest in our future, Alibaba is undertaking an organizational upgrade,"" the company said in a statement signed by Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, who will become chairman when Ma retires on Sept. 10.
The changes are effective from Tuesday, Alibaba said.
Expanding Wu's remit is aimed at more tightly integrating Alibaba's investments into its overall eco-system, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified as details of the appointment are not yet public.
Tsai will remain executive vice-chairman, the person said.
Wu has been CFO since 2013. Tsai sits on the board and has served on investment committees of Alibaba Group and affiliate Ant Financial. He joined the company in 1999 and emerged as a key dealmaker, helping draw in investment from the likes of U.S. investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) .
Duncan Clark, author of ""Alibaba: The House that Jack Built,"" said Ma's pending resignation made it natural for observers to question Tsai's future at the company.
""Joe is inextricably linked to Jack,"" says Clark. ""As a right hand man of Jack Ma, Ma's imminent retirement begged the question as to whether the right hand man would follow suit.""
Tsai declined to comment. 
Alibaba's outbound investment has slowed since a flurry of deals in 2014 and 2015, and Clark added the company was increasingly targeting the domestic market.

In its Tuesday statement, Alibaba also said its supermarket division, Freshippo, will become a standalone business, while enterprise software unit DingTalk will be merged into the firm's cloud unit.

324,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",`Crazy Rich' Credit Market Divides JPMorgan to Bank of America,"(Bloomberg) -- Credit investors are fueling a dangerous risk rally built on hopes of easier monetary policy as global growth falters.
High-grade and junk indexes touched fresh records last week while measures of interest-rate risk are hovering near all-time highs.
Angst over the economic trajectory has pushed the stockpile of bonds with below-zero yields to $11.8 trillion. That’s forcing investors into riskier realms to seek out positive returns in credit, confident dovish central banks will help corporate borrowers refinance and neutralize rate risk inherent in long-dated bonds.
All of which points to a big fall if the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank disappoint ultra-dovish expectations.
“The risk of the dream turning into a nightmare is really high,” said Oystein Borsum, chief strategist at Swedbank AB. “It will have to stop. Either the economy will have to improve or risk premiums will widen. You can only have one of the two.”
Government bonds in Europe and the U.S. are flashing recession risks are nigh, as the trade conflict weighs on the industrial cycle. At the same time, spreads on high-grade credit in the euro area trade near 40 basis points below early January highs, after the best start to a year since 2012.
Valuations are “crazy rich,” according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). strategists. But they may become richer still.
Hans Mikkelsen at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). reckons the global collapse in sovereign yields is leaving investors with little choice but to boost their exposure to corporate obligations. A European trader needs to own three-to-five year continental credit or one-to-three year U.S. corporate debt in hedged terms in order to book a 50 basis point yield, he calculates.
It all helps to explain why money managers are gorging on duration and currency risks across the board. Last week Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) sold 40-year notes in the Brexit-battered pound, with the price now around 3.8% higher.
One result of this clamor for credit: Corporate bond prices have rarely been more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Modified duration in the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) global credit benchmark has jumped this month to almost 6.7 years, a sliver away from the 2017 record. This means that the average bond stands to lose 6.7 cents on the dollar if its yield rises 1%.
It all sets the stage for a pivotal Fed meeting this week with the central bank due to deliver a policy statement and prognosis of economic health. Markets have priced in multiple rate cuts as they expect monetary authorities from Europe to Japan to tackle slowing growth with a new period of easier policy.
JPMorgan acknowledges the reach for yields should stoke demand for risk assets but wall-of-worry situations, from an intensifying trade war to misguided monetary bets, threaten to push up credit premiums.
“Spreads are still towards the middle of the range from the past few years, and look positively expensive if one thinks that a recession could be on the horizon,” wrote strategists including Saul Doctor in a recent note.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>","China renames, restructures railway corporation in reform push","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China renamed and restructured its national railway corporation as part of its efforts to make the country's government-run enterprises run in a more market-oriented fashion, its state-run railway group said on Tuesday.
China State Railway Group (CR) said on its official WeChat account that it had changed its name from China Railway Corporation (CRC), and was now a state-owned enterprise with registered capital of 1.7 trillion yuan ($245.46 billion).
The company, which oversees the management of China's sprawling railway network, said it would have a corporate structure with a board of directors and the Ministry of Finance would perform investor duties at the company.
""This is a major initiative aimed at deepening the reform of the railway system, establishing a modern enterprise system, and promoting market-oriented operations,"" CR said in a statement on its website.
CRC was created after China's former railway ministry was dissolved in 2013 and has been central to Beijing's efforts to use infrastructure investment to support a slowing economy.
State-backed newspaper Shanghai Securities News reported in February that the debt of CRC reached 300 billion yuan in 2019, compared with 240 billion yuan in the previous year.
Guotai Junan analyst Gary Wong said the company had a substantial amount of assets such as older rail car maintenance facilities scattered across its numerous bureaus and the new structure could help centralize its management of such properties.
Beijing has also previously talked about attracting private investment into its state-owned enterprises, and the new CR could possibly seek to do so for parts of its business, he added.
Financial magazine Caixin reported last year that CR plans to eventually list Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Co, operator of one of the country's busiest rail lines, although it has yet to decide on a time frame.

LegacyTexas shareholders will receive 0.528 Prosperity shares, and $6.28 in cash for each share held, representing a deal value of $41.78 per share, a premium of 9.3% based on the closing price of LegacyTexas on Friday.
The deal is also expected to strengthen Houston, Texas-based Prosperity's foothold in North Texas cities as well as in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
As of March 31, 2019, LegacyTexas held assets worth more than $9 billion, total loans of $8.1 billion and total deposits of $7.1 billion, while Prosperity held $22.35 billion in assets and $17.2 billion in deposits.
Dealmaking in the banking sector has been rising ever since U.S. President Donald Trump lowered corporate taxes and eased financial regulations on regional banks.
M&A activity in the sector had languished after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, as stricter rules were imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets and regulators barred banks with compliance issues from expanding.
But a cut in corporate taxes in December 2017 and easing of stringent capital requirements in the following year have freed up capital, reviving dealmaking in the banking sector.
Earlier this year, U.S. regional lender BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT) bought rival SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) for about $28 billion in stock, marking the first big bank merger since the 2007-2009 crisis.
With more financial easing on the horizon, Wall Street analysts have said they remain optimistic about more consolidation in the banking sector, especially between super-regional banks.
The deal between Prosperity and LegacyTexas is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Kevin Hanigan, chief executive of LegacyTexas, will join Prosperity as its chief operating officer, the companies said.
Prosperity's financial adviser in the deal was Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, while J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as financial adviser for LegacyTexas.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 07:44PM ET</span>",Brazil's Odebrecht files for bankruptcy protection after years of graft probes,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA filed on Monday for bankruptcy protection, aiming to restructure 51 billion reais ($13 billion) of debt in what would be one of Latin America's largest-ever in-court debt restructurings.
The bankruptcy filing comes after years of struggles for Odebrecht, the biggest of the Brazilian engineering groups caught in a sweeping political corruption investigation that has rippled across Latin America.
In the filing, the company asks the judge to bar the group's seven largest creditors - six banks and an investment fund - from taking possession or selling shares in the group's crown jewel, its controlling stake in petrochemical company Braskem SA.
Shares in Braskem are pledged as collateral to the creditors. But Odebrecht says the Braskem stake is essential to its restructuring, as the petrochemical company was responsible for nearly 80% of the conglomerate's revenues in 2018. 
Odebrecht said the bankruptcy protection was the best way to conclude its debt restructuring as creditors have sought to seize assets pledged as collateral for unpaid loans.
The debt restructuring relates to the parent company Odebrecht SA and a network of holding companies.
The group's main operating businesses are excluded, including Braskem, construction unit OEC, oil company Ocyan, shipbuilder Enseada, Odebrecht Transport and homebuilder Incorporadora OR. Sugar and ethanol subsidiary Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, which already filed for a separate bankruptcy protection, is also excluded.
Odebrecht said its total debt reaches 98.5 billion reais, including intercompany loans and debt that is not subjected to in-court restructuring.
FALL FROM GRACE
Odebrecht expanded from its construction roots into one of Brazil's biggest conglomerates but began its fall from grace in 2014, when it became a principal target of the country's largest-ever corruption probe.
Former chief executive Marcelo Odebrecht, grandson of the founder, was arrested in 2015 and later sentenced to 19 years in jail for corruption. He has been under house arrest since 2017, barred from having any say in the company's running.
In 2016, Odebrecht agreed to the world's largest-ever corruption leniency fine with prosecutors in Brazil, the United States, and Switzerland, paying at least $3.5 billion. The scandal over bribes for public works contracts spread to other countries where Odebrecht did business, including Peru, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia.
Since then, the group has been selling assets to raise cash as borrowing costs climbed. It sold Brazilian sanitation company Odebrecht Ambiental to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management for $800 million and Peruvian hydroelectric plant Chaglla to China Three Gorges Corporation for $1.4 billion.
Still, some of the group's businesses have been forced to restructure debts as their revenues dwindled.
Odebrecht's construction unit OEC is in talks to restructure $3 billion of debt with bondholders. The company proposed a 70% haircut, which was rejected by its creditors.
After a failed attempt to negotiate an out-of-court solution with its creditors, ethanol unit Atvos filed for bankruptcy protection in May. 
Odebrecht had been negotiating a sale of Braskem to  LyondellBasell Industries  NV (NYSE:LYB) for a year and a half, but talks ended with no deal earlier this month.
The conglomerate's largest creditors are Brazilian state-owned lenders Banco do Brasil SA, Caixa Economica Federal and BNDES, as well as private-sector lenders Banco Bradesco SA, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA and an investment fund, totaling 33 billion reais in debt.
The group is being advised by financial restructuring firm RK Partners and law firm E. Munhoz Advogados.

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of leading banks will for the first time include efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions in their decision making when providing shipping company loans, executives said on Tuesday. 
International shipping accounts for 2.2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization (IMO), has a long-term goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050.
Working with non-profit organisations the Global Maritime Forum, the Rocky Mountain Institute and London University's UCL Energy Institute, 11 banks have established a framework to measure the carbon intensity of shipping finance portfolios.
The banks involved in the ""Poseidon Principles"" initiative, which will set a common baseline to assess whether lending portfolios are in line or behind the adopted climate goals set by the IMO, represent around a fifth or $100 billion of the total global shipping finance portfolio. 
The results will be published annually in individual sustainability reports and the data will be obtained by banks from borrowers under existing loan agreements. 
Although the IMO agreed stricter energy efficiency targets last month for certain types of ships, environmental campaigners are calling for tougher goals. 
""We are helping the shipping industry emerge into the 21st century in a responsible way,"" Michael Parker, global head of shipping at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), told Reuters.
'HUGE ROLE'
Those involved so far are Citigroup,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), DNB, ABN Amro, Amsterdam Trade Bank,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) CIB, Danish Ship Finance, Danske Bank, DVB, ING and Nordea. 
""Banks have a huge role to play here because there is about $450 billion of senior debt that the world's shipping banks and Chinese lessors grant to the sector and about 70,000 commercial vessels,"" Paul Taylor, global head of shipping & offshore with Societe Generale CIB, said.
Banks will in the longer term be more selective about which ships they include in their lending portfolios, bankers said.
""Will there be companies that will find it difficult to get finance as they have less efficient ships, yes, it will be a consequence of it - but it's not going to be used to look for those companies and somehow find a way of getting them out,"" Citigroup's Parker said.
Oivind Haraldsen, Danske Bank's global head of shipping, said more institutions would join the efforts to cut the carbon footprint of the sector. 

""All of us have to push - we as banks probably have more power than we are aware,"" he said.

331,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",Asia Equities Are on a Wobbling Foundation as Earnings Outlook Dims,"(Bloomberg) -- The pillars of Asia’s stock markets are shaking: Sentiment is fragile, valuations are not all that cheap and earnings forecasts continue to decline.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s estimated 12-month forward earnings per share dropped to a 19-month low at the end of May. Analysts covering these companies have cut profit estimates by 5.4% this year. Compare that with their counterparts in the U.S., who revised their forecasts for S&P 500 Index stocks up by 2.5%, according to Bloomberg data.
The power struggle between the U.S. and China has weighed on trade and companies’ business activities since last year. With U.S. President Donald Trump threatening more tariffs on China and other countries, worries have arisen about corporate profit sustainability and even potential for a recession.
Trade tensions appear to be exacerbating the downward move in Asia’s earnings cycle, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at the firm, said in an interview that the earnings downgrade phase in Asia is still underway, especially in the semiconductor sector, though he expects profit growth for Asia companies to be “marginally positive” in 2019. Semiconductors have been hard-hit amid the trade tensions due to turmoil in the region’s supply chain.
UBS Global Wealth Management cut its Asian 2019 earnings growth prediction to 5% from a previous 6.4%. Hartmut Issel, the firm’s head of APAC equities, wrote in an email that if the negotiations between China and the U.S. break down completely, “we forecast roughly flat or even negative earnings growth in 2019.”
Asia equities started the year strongly before the trade-inspired plunge in May, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is still up more than 5%. The gauge gained a second week last week as the Federal Reserve’s dovish comments pushed up expectations for an interest rate cut in the U.S.
Strategists at Nomura say Asian countries’ monetary easing and policy support may prevent profit growth from falling off a cliff. An earnings recession could be avoided if central banks and government could have ample support, according to a May 24 note written by Chetan Seth.
And of course, the ultimate obstacle is the trade spats. If the G-20 meeting could serve as an opportunity for leaders of both side to step back and return to the negotiation table with mutual respect, sentiment will improve, CMC Markets Singapore’s strategist Margaret Yang said in an email.
But for now, earnings in Asia look set to struggle.
“It’s a downtrend,” SocGen’s Benzimra said. “Maybe a little bit of stabilization, but nothing really exciting” like re-acceleration or signals to re-enter emerging markets.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - This year's holiday season could be tighter for many Americans if the U.S. government imposes tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese imports - because that will include tech products, game consoles, toys, cribs, ornaments and Santa hats.
The tariffs would add 25% to the import cost of these and many other consumer items just as retail outlets throughout the world's largest economy begin to gear up for the peak end-of-year shopping season.
Consumers have been largely shielded until now from the direct impact of the trade war between China and the United States as the administration of President Donald Trump has focused previous rounds of tariffs on imports sold to manufacturers rather consumers.
But Trump is escalating the trade war and preparing to extend tariffs to nearly all Chinese imports after talks for a deal broke down in May. The U.S. government is pushing for wide-ranging economic and trade reforms from Beijing.
Trump said he would decide whether to trigger the next round of tariffs after talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Japan later this month.
In preparation for the new round, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office (USTR) on Monday began seven days of hearings for testimony from retailers, manufacturers and others impacted. Thousands of business filed comments to the USTR ahead of the hearings.
Toys, phones and televisions are all on the tariff list and represent some of the most valuable categories of products that Americans buy from China, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The new tariffs would hit cellphones whose import bill from China totaled $43 billion in 2018 - more than 80% of total cellphone imports.
They would also cover a broad set of toys, including scooters and doll carriages, whose imports totaled $11.9 billion last year. China supplied about 85% of America's total imports of those toys.
Further pain for parents could come in the form of proposed levies on more than $5 billion worth of video game consoles. Chinese imports amounted to 98% of total U.S. imports of those consoles last year. 
And U.S. imports from China of targeted Christmas products - including ornaments, nativity scenes and Christmas tree lights - totaled at least $2.3 billion last year.
An executive from a family-owned, Christmas goods supplier in upstate New York said the company has looked ""long and far"" to find another supplier for many typical holiday products. 
""However, trying to find other countries to manufacture everything else, from Santa hats, to stockings, to glass ornaments, has been a struggle and we have been unable to do so,"" Nathan Gordon of Gordon Companies Inc in Cheektowaga said in public comments posted on June 12.
HE'S MAKING A LIST
Some products previously spared by the Trump administration to avoid hitting consumers' pockets are now on the list. That includes an array of safety and play equipment for children - including high chairs, play pens, and swings.
The proposed tariffs would hit at least $800 million of these goods.
Smart watches, smart speakers and Bluetooth audio are also included. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that 2018 imports in this category from China were up to $17.9 billion.
Retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), and more than 600 other companies urged Trump in a letter last week to resolve the trade dispute with China, saying tariffs hurt American businesses and consumers.
Worry over potential cost increases for Americans from tariffs has raised concern about inflation, though across the economy, prices rises remain below the U.S. Federal Reserve target of 2%.

Trump has said that China pays the tariffs, but U.S. importers actually foot the bill and either pass them on to consumers or suppliers.

The decision nullified an earlier ruling that suspended an arrest warrant against Lozoya issued last month. ""The suspension that had been granted is null and void,"" the document said.
Mexican authorities say the case centers on bribes paid in connection with the purchase by Pemex of a fertilizer plant under the previous government. Reuters could not reach Lozoya for comment. He has always denied wrongdoing and defended the fertilizer factory purchase as a wise investment.
""I know perfectly well that he committed no crime,"" one of Lozoya's lawyers, Javier Coello, told local radio on Monday, vowing to fight the charges at trial.

The government's move against Lozoya is one of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's boldest steps, since taking office in December, to fulfill a campaign promise to stamp out corruption.

336,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 05:00PM ET</span>",Expect a Market Brawl If Fed Doesn't Show It's Ready to Act,"(Bloomberg) -- Rates traders should prepare for turbulence around this week’s Federal Reserve decision: Markets aren’t giving up on rate cuts without a fight.
Avoiding a volatile session Wednesday could require some fancy policy-making footwork. There’s a widespread desire for proof the Fed is ready to act, but too much change could raise alarm. Central bankers can adjust their message in a variety of ways, but none of them are likely to produce significantly higher yields, according to investors including Loomis Sayles & Co.’s Elaine Stokes.
The market’s doves have the Fed cornered. If it sticks to its May pledge to be “patient” as it judges future rate moves and keeps the door open to a hike next year, riskier assets like stocks will probably slide and yields will sink further as traders rush to havens.
“The market riots on that,” said Stokes, a fixed-income portfolio manager.
Instead, the Fed is expected to take another dovish turn, just as it’s done all year as weak inflation, deteriorating growth and U.S. trade policy uncertainty sent Treasury yields tumbling. But the Fed hasn’t caught up with rate-cut expectations and probably won’t now, with positioning as aggressive as ever. Anxiety over the Group-of-20 meeting this month has mired the yield on two-year notes around 1.87% -- down from almost 3% in November -- and spurred bets that the Fed policy rate will drop 65 basis points by year-end.
Here’s what to look for in the Fed’s statements and press conference Wednesday and some potential scenarios for reactions in the $16 trillion Treasuries market.
Delicate Balance
Investors are anticipating some combination of the following to demonstrate the Fed’s readiness to cut:
The right balance of these could nudge yields a bit higher, as traders exit some rate-cut hedges. Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC’s head of Treasury trading, Paul Murphy, expects weakening in the two-year note and related futures contracts. But if the Fed convinces investors it’s ready to cut rates, wagers for a move in the third quarter won’t go away.
“The market could have a little bit of a relief sell-off and little bit of a repricing, but that would be somewhat innocuous,” Murphy said.
Don’t expect much action further out the curve, either. T. Rowe Price fixed-income portfolio manager Chris Brown said if markets are comfortable with the Fed’s messaging -- and even if the G-20 summit stirs optimism on the trade front -- the 10-year yield probably can’t get much higher before buyers step in. The past month’s rallies have carved out a range for the 10-year between 2% and 2.40%, he said.
Release the Doves
It would be tough for the Fed to surpass the market’s expectations, but a rate cut might. As of Monday, pricing reflected only a 16% chance of a 25-basis point reduction at this week’s meeting.
Rewarding these bets would not clear them out, however, according to Loomis’s Stokes. By over-delivering, policy makers would only raise the suspicion that they’re responding to a bigger, undisclosed threat. Futures contracts beyond this year would gain on the prospect of more easing to come, if traders reason that “this doesn’t feel like insurance, this feels like a Fed cycle,” she said.
“If there are expectations that this is the beginning of a more drawn-out easing cycle, the impact on the curve is the most important to look at,” with a more pronounced steepening the most likely outcome, said Amherst Pierpont’s Murphy.
‘Double Jeopardy’
If the Fed doesn’t bend closer to the market’s vision, T. Rowe’s Brown expects a tantrum in three stages. Higher yields is the first and the most fleeting.
“If the Fed comes off as hawkish I think you’ll see a knee-jerk selloff at the front end,” Brown said. That would quickly give way to a bullish move as a meltdown in risk assets drives buying in long-dated Treasuries, in a second wave of curve flattening. The delayed reaction is for the curve to re-steepen, he said, as investors move back into short-dated Treasuries on the conviction that the Fed will have to take emergency action later.
To Murphy of Amherst Pierpont, this is the “double-jeopardy” scenario whereby stock-market volatility exacerbates the recent tightening in financial conditions due to trade policy uncertainty. “Then the market’s really going to force them to do something later in the year,” he said.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Insurance costs rocket for U.S. IPOs as twitchy investors take to courts,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Companies going public in the United States face insurance costs that have increased as much as 200% in the last three years to cover their executives against lawsuits alleging they misled investors.
A rise in securities class-action cases involving initial public offerings is spurring IPO insurers to double and triple prices for directors and officers coverage, or ""D&O"" coverage, insurers and brokers told Reuters.
A $5 million policy that cost $200,000 in 2016 can now easily cost $500,000 to $600,000, said Paul Schiavone, head of North American Financial Lines for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Corporate & Specialty, an Allianz SE unit. 
""You want to be part of the market, but there are also lots of risks in IPOs,"" said Schiavone. ""If things don't go well in a year, you have the investors saying, 'I want my money back.'""
The tightening insurance market follows a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows some securities lawsuits to proceed in state court in addition to federal court.
""Since then, the market has gotten absolutely more challenging,"" said Jennifer Sharkey, President of the Northeast Management Liability Practice for insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.
Investors who used to wait months to see how a new stock would perform now waste little time to see if promises made in offering documents come to fruition - and are swift to accuse the executives of misleading investors if they do not.
""You have a lot more aggressive lawyers and investors out there who are looking where the cash is,"" said Jeff Lubitz, who heads Securities Class Action Services for Institutional Shareholder Services. ""And now, it looks like they will have multiple choices on how to jump on this."" 
The changes come amid a spate of mega-IPOs, including recent offerings by ride-sharing rivals Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). There were 205 IPOs in 2018, up 14% from 2017, according to accounting and consulting firm EY.
Many larger companies have ample funds to pay the premiums, but smaller companies that need the insurance in order to attract reputable board members may feel the strain, insurance brokers said.
There have been 25 lawsuits related to IPOs so far this year, against 19 companies. Six companies that launched IPOs face suits in both state and federal court, including Lyft, BrightView Holdings Inc, and US Xpress Enterprises. 
Shareholders slapped Lyft with a lawsuit about three weeks after its stock began trading on March 28 and quickly tanked more than 20%. The suit alleges that Lyft misled investors by overstating its market share. A Lyft spokeswoman declined to comment. 
As the pace quickens and litigation picks up in two court systems, insurers are on the line to pay tens of millions of dollars in defense costs and substantial settlements.
IPO-related settlements have totaled $929 million since 2017, including a $250 million settlement by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd in April, after an earlier $75 million state court settlement. Last year, LendingClub Corp settled a suit for $125 million, according to ISS.
About 25 insurers sell D&O coverage to companies going public, including American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd, AXA XL, Beazley PLC, and Allianz SE. The insurers, collectively, can offer about $150 million coverage, according to broker Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc.

Insurers are chopping coverage limits and requiring IPO clients to pick up more costs before a policy kicks in. And they are requiring companies to pay a percentage of the eventual loss, said Rachel Turk, D&O team leader for Beazley.

Sweden's oldest bank has gone through a turbulent period since being linked to money laundering at Danske Bank, which has said its Estonia branch was used to move 200 billion euros of suspicious funds between 2007 and 2015. 
Swedbank - whose CEO and chairman both departed amid the turmoil - admitted in late April to failings in combating money laundering and announced an internal probe was under way to review its current and historic customer relationships through its Baltic units.
""Today's decision is a consequence of the ongoing internal investigation,"" Swedbank's head of Baltic Banking, Charlotte Elsnitz, said in a statement.
""We are fully committed to the Estonian market and to all our employees, customers and other stakeholders. Estonia is one of four home markets of Swedbank.""
Swedbank said it was cooperating fully with authorities in Sweden, the United States and the Baltic countries in their investigations.

Swedbank said Olavi Lepp, currently chief risk officer, had been named acting CEO of Swedbank Estonia replacing Robert Kitt, while Anna Kouts, currently head of treasury, would become acting CFO replacing Vaiko Tammevali.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 03:32PM ET</span>",FAA moves to support growth of civil supersonic air industry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it is moving to rewrite testing rules to allow for the eventual return of civil supersonic air travel.
At an event in Paris on Monday, Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said the agency is working to ""enable the return of civil supersonic travel, while ensuring the environmental impacts are understood and properly addressed.""
Later this week, the FAA will issue a proposed rule for ""special flight authorization for supersonic aircraft,"" Elwell said. This is the first step toward revising the FAA's 45-year-old rules governing supersonic transport.
U.S. startups Aerion, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are working to reintroduce supersonic passenger travel for the first time since the Anglo-French Concorde retired in 2003.
The rule ""modifies and clarifies existing regulatory procedures for a more efficient way to obtain FAA approval to test supersonic aircraft.""
The rule ""will provide a streamlined, clear line of sight on how to gain approval to conduct flight testing. This is a necessary, key step for further research and development in an emerging segment – and ultimately bring their aircraft to market,"" Elwell added in remarks provided by the FAA.
According to a draft of the FAA proposal reviewed by Reuters, the agency said the proposed updates ""are intended to support the growth of the civil supersonic industry"" and will ""provide increased clarity and information to applications as to the requirements for special flight authorizations to test supersonic aircraft.""
In February, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said it had made a significant investment in supersonic business jet developer Aerion, as the world’s biggest planemaker looks to tap into rising demand for high-end aircraft that can reduce travel time.
Boeing will provide engineering, manufacturing and flight testing services for Aerion’s $120 million supersonic business jet, which is slated for its first flight in 2023.
Congress last year approved legislation directing the FAA to issue proposed rules setting noise standards for landing and takeoff, and noise test requirements for civil supersonic aircraft by March 2020, and modernizing the application process by December 2019.
Next generation supersonic jets, while quieter and more fuel efficient than the Concorde, have difficulty meeting existing noise levels and carbon emissions standards for conventional planes due to engine constraints and higher fuel burn.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 03:32PM ET</span>",Sotheby's snapped up by French tycoon Drahi for $3.7 billion,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS/BOSTON (Reuters) - Franco-Israeli cable magnate Patrick Drahi made a surprise move into the art world by snapping up Sotheby's in a deal worth $3.7 billion, marking the art auction house's return to private ownership after 31 years.
The acquisition allows Drahi to join French billionaire Francois Pinault - who owns Sotheby's main rival Christie's - at the top of the art world and New York society.
Drahi joins an exclusive club of French billionaires active in the global art market, which also includes LVMH's boss Bernard Arnault through his Louis Vuitton foundation.
Drahi's expansion in the United States also has echoes of former  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) boss Jean-Marie Messier, who turned a struggling French water company into a global media giant with stakes in established U.S. institutions.
The deal also marks a new chapter for the 275-year-old auction house that became a destination for a new generation of wealth created on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and around the world. 
In many ways, being public put Sotheby's at a competitive disadvantage to its main U.S. rival Christie's, which was already private, art experts said. 
""Now the company can become more flexible and nimble as a privately-held enterprise and it will be interesting to see the changes that will be made,"" said Abigail Asher, a partner at international art consultants Guggenheim, Asher.
Founded in London in 1744 before expanding overseas in the 20th century, Sotheby's had the distinction of being the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Famous items sold by Sotheby's include the collections of the late Duchess of Windsor, the personal collection of artist Andy Warhol and Edvard Munch's painting ""The Scream"".
Sotheby's said BidFair USA, an acquisition vehicle set up by Drahi, had offered $57 in cash per share to buy it out. The offer represented a premium of 61% to Sotheby's closing price on Friday, and gives it a market capitalization of $2.6 billion. 
LOEB WELCOMES DEAL
The art world has been a favorite in recent times for investors looking to make extra returns in a world of ultra-low interest rates, with the prices of many expensive works of art having steadily increased.
A report published by Swiss bank UBS and Art Basel in March said that the global art market had enjoyed another uptick in 2018.
Drahi - who is better known for engineering debt-fueled acquisitions in the cable and telecom business through the Altice group he controls - said he would be funding the takeover through financing arranged by French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and by equity provided by his own funds. 
Drahi has also been selling non-core assets in recent years to ease concerns over the debt levels of his businesses.
The businessman said he would not be selling shares in his Altice Europe business, but would be cashing in a small stake in his Altice USA division. Shares in Altice USA fell around 2% on Monday.
Born in Morocco, Drahi, 55, was trained at the selective Polytechnique school in Paris, and holds dual French and Israeli citizenship. 
Despite controlling influential French media outlets such as leftist bible Liberation and the country's most-watched news channel BFM TV, Drahi has shied away from elite gatherings of France’s establishment and spends much of his time between Switzerland, the United States and Israel.
""This investment will further demonstrate the anchoring of my family in the United States, a country where we have been very welcomed since the successful acquisitions of Suddenlink in 2015, Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) in 2016 and just recently Cheddar,"" Drahi said in a statement, referring to the two U.S. cable companies and an online news network respectively.
He said he had full confidence in Sotheby's management and did not expect any change to the company's strategy.
About five years ago, Sotheby's ended a long-running fight with activist investor Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point, by asking Loeb and two associates to join Sotheby's board, and Loeb was instrumental in hiring Smith as CEO.
Loeb, a prominent art collector, on Monday praised the sale.
The price ""affirms the value we saw when we first invested in Sotheby’s, and rewards long-term investors like Third Point who believed in its potential,"" Loeb told Reuters.

BNP Paribas and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised Drahi, while LionTree Advisors worked on behalf of Sotheby's.

(Reuters) - Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board on Monday defended a new agreement with creditors, saying it will result in an affordable and sustainable debt level and allow the U.S. commonwealth to exit bankruptcy next year.
The board has come under fire by Puerto Rico's government and some creditors over pension cuts or its disparate treatment of bondholders.
On Sunday, the Financial Oversight and Management Board announced a deal that establishes terms for restructuring more than $18 billion of Puerto Rico's general obligation (GO) and Public Buildings Authority (PBA) debt. A group of investment firms that signed on to the agreement, which calls for recoveries of about 64% for GO bonds and 73% for PBA debt, own about $3 billion of what the board calls ""vintage"" bonds that are not being challenged in court.
The deal, along with an agreement last week with a retirees committee over pensions that the Puerto Rico government opposes, will be part of a core government debt-adjustment plan the oversight board said it expects to file in U.S. District Court within 30 days. Puerto Rico entered a bankruptcy-like process in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
""We've reached a significant milestone for Puerto Rico. The end of bankruptcy's in sight,"" Natalie Jaresko, the board's executive director, told reporters on Monday.
She said the deal would reduce $35 billion of liabilities to $12 billion and lower the island's maximum annual payments on debt, including already restructured sales tax-backed bonds, by 64 percent to $1.5 billion.
Other creditors are pushing back on the agreement.
Assured Guaranty, which insures some GO bonds, said on Monday that only about 10 percent of bondholders back the deal, which it contended involves an ""unprecedented and meritless attempt to invalidate certain lawfully issued general obligation bonds, acceptance of erroneous and misleading financial projections in the oversight board’s legally flawed fiscal plan, and artificial separation of similarly situated creditors into classes that would receive unequal treatment."" 
The board has taken steps in court to void certain bonds issued by the government and its agencies and also filed claims to recoup more than $1 billion in debt service payments from investors. 
Jaresko said those bondholders can avoid litigation and accept recoveries of 45% for GO bonds issued in 2012 and 35% for 2014 bonds, noting that if the bonds are ultimately invalidated by the court they would receive nothing. If the court rules the bonds did not violate a debt limit in Puerto Rico's constitution, recoveries would match those in the agreement, she added.
Puerto Rico's government opposes the deal mainly because it includes a reduction in pension payments to certain retirees. The government's fiscal agency warned on Sunday that without legislative and executive support and action, the upcoming debt adjustment plan could not be implemented. 
Jaresko said the upcoming debt-adjustment plan is aimed at sustaining pensions, which are currently funded on a pay-go basis, and that it was unclear if the plan requires legislation.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 03:00PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank plans to pare U.S. equities business to skeleton operation: sources,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) plans to dramatically reduce the size of its U.S. equities business, leaving only a skeleton operation in place to service corporate and high-net-worth clients, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is battling to convince investors he can turn around Germany's biggest lender, whose shares hit a record low this month. He told investors at the annual meeting last month that Deutsche was prepared to make ""tough cutbacks"" at its investment bank.
Members of Deutsche's supervisory board discussed those plans on a call last week and agreed that large-scale cuts were necessary in the bank's U.S. equities and rates trading businesses, the sources said.
A complete retreat from U.S. equities was discussed, but the preferred option among board members was to keep a presence in the market and continue developing the bank's electronic trading capabilities, the sources said. 
It is not yet clear how many of the bank's 9,275 U.S. staff will be affected and the sources said no final decisions have been made. The plans are expected to be unveiled when the bank reports first-half results next month.
In an emailed statement, a Deutsche spokesperson said the bank ""is working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability.""
In March, Deutsche announced plans for a new platform enabling it to trade U.S. stocks directly with clients, instead of matching buyers and sellers for a fee. That platform is scheduled to go live in the third quarter. Automating more of the business will enable the bank to cut costs and improve profit margins, the sources said.
Although some investors believe a complete retreat from the United States is necessary, both Sewing and Chairman Paul Achleitner believe the bank must retain a large U.S. footprint to service corporate and institutional clients, the sources said.
The bank is keen to maintain substantial debt capital markets and credit trading business in the United States, having identified them as businesses with growth potential, the sources said. It will also retain a sizeable M&A advisory business. 
Sewing is looking to shift the German lender away from investment banking to focus on more stable forms of revenue, such as transaction banking.
The U.S. equities business has been a drain on profitability for several years, prompting some shareholders to call for its closure. JP Morgan's banking analysts estimate it loses between 200 million and 300 million euros ($337 million) each year. 
The bank had previously denied reports it planned a further U.S. restructuring, saying in a memo to staff in April that it was ""firmly committed"" to its U.S. franchise.
However, the collapse of merger talks with German rival  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in May led senior management to develop a ""Plan B"" for turning around the business and U.S. cuts were high on the agenda, the sources said. 
After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street, even as European rivals like  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) made big cuts. Encumbered by litigation and regulatory investigations, the business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",Chile's Chuquicamata copper mine operations halved amid strike: Codelco,"By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Codelco said on Monday that its Chuquicamata copper mine, one of the world´s largest, had maintained output at 50% of capacity as it faced its fourth full day of a union strike.
More than 3,000 unionized workers at the world's top copper producer's sprawling Chuquicamata copper mine walked off the job last week after failing to reach a labor deal earlier this week with Codelco.
Chile's state-run miner said it has scrambled to put to work some 1,400 miners, most of whom pertain to unions which earlier struck contract deals with the company and had opted not joined the strike.
""For now we are maintaining [production] at 50%, but we are working towards 60%,"" Codelco told Reuters.
Union representatives challenged that statement, saying Codelco was exaggerating its ability to produce amid the strike. 
Liliana Ugarte, president of Union 2, one of three striking unions, said that Codelco had yet to approach the unions to reinitiate talks.
""On the contrary, Codelco is making things worse...by making statements that only serve to infuriate workers,"" Ugarte said.
The mine produced 320,744 tonnes of copper in 2018. 
Codelco, which last month reported an 18% year-on-year drop in its first-quarter copper output, is seeking to transform the century-old deposit at Chuquicamata into an underground mine as part of a 10-year, $39 billion overhaul of Codelco's key operations.
The overhaul has meant job cuts in some areas of the mine, making relations tense with workers.

Copper production at Chile's top mines dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2019, Chilean copper commission Cochilco said in May, amid a perfect storm of operational issues, heavy rains and falling ore grades at the largest deposits.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 02:21PM ET</span>","New blow to Boeing from engine delay, Airbus long-range rival takes off","By Laurence Frost and Eric M. Johnson
PARIS, France (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) suffered a fresh setback at the opening of the Paris Airshow on Monday as the U.S. planemaker's engine supplier revealed a delay affecting its all-new 777X jet, while Airbus targeted the middle of the market with a rival plane.
GE Aviation said it had found unexpected wear in a component for the GE9X engine it is making for Boeing's 777X, the world's largest twin-engined jet, forcing a delay of several months while it redesigns and tests the part.
The aerospace industry's biggest annual event, which alternates with Britain's Farnborough Airshow, is traditionally a slugging match between Airbus and Boeing in the $150 billion a year commercial aircraft market. 
But this year Boeing is still grappling with the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft in March after two deadly crashes, while European arch-rival Airbus is dealing with the fallout from a long-running corruption scandal.
Airbus used the show to launch a long-range version of its A321neo jet, aiming to carve out new routes for airlines with smaller planes and steal a march on Boeing's owns plans for another potential all-new jet, the NMA.
""We can fly from north-eastern Asia into south Asia, from the Middle East to Bali or from Japan deep into Australia, and so on,"" Airbus chief salesman Christian Scherer said.
""It is therefore the lowest-risk investment for airlines on these kinds of routes.""
Leasing company Air Lease Corp became the first customer of the new aircraft - the A321XLR - lining up for 27 as part of a deal for 100 Airbus planes. 
Sources familiar with the matter said Airbus was trying to assemble close to 200 orders or conversions to the new model as it chases deals with carriers including American Airlines, JetBlue, Cebu Air and Frontier Airlines owner Indigo Partners. 
Despite a flurry of delegates dashing in golf carts between parked jetliners, missiles and spy planes, this year's gathering appeared relatively subdued, with a profit warning from Lufthansa adding to trade tensions and slowing economies.
French President Emmanuel Macron watched as France and Germany unveiled a sleek, dagger-shaped mockup of a new fighter plane the two close European allies plan to develop.
Analysts expect anything from 400 to 800 commercial aircraft orders and commitments at the show, compared with 959 at Farnborough last year, though it can be hard to identify truly new business against firmed-up commitments and switched models. 
Boeing commercial airplanes boss Kevin McAllister said it was premature to predict any delays to the 777X program. The planemaker is targeting a maiden flight this year and entry into service the next.
Gulf airline Emirates has said it expects the first plane in June 2020. Flight tests often take more than a year.

SIZE VS COMFORT
The Airbus A321XLR will be the longest-range narrow-body jetliner and arrives as airlines look to maximize the flexibility of more fuel-efficient, single-aisle aircraft. 
Its range of up to 4,700 nautical miles - about 15% more than the previous A321LR - will leapfrog the out-of-production Boeing 757 and nudges it into the long-jump category occupied by more costly wide-body jets.
The A321XLR also eats into a range category targeted by the possible NMA mid-market, twin-aisle jet under review by Boeing.
""It does provide a very effective airplane for many of the same routes as the NMA, and it does so many years earlier,"" Air Lease CEO John Plueger said of the new Airbus jet. 
But there is a debate over whether passengers will enjoy flying longer distances in medium-haul planes. 
Airbus did not give a price for the A321XLR. The current A321neo has a list price of $129.5 million. 
Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg on Sunday said the A321XLR would only ""scratch an edge"" of the market segment targeted by the NMA. But Air Lease founder Steven Udvar-Hazy, a doyen of the leasing industry, said the NMA project remained ""a little bit in cold storage"" as long as the MAX grounding lasted.
He added that Boeing expected to announce orders for wide-body jets at the Paris show but its main focus at the event was safety, with executives taking turns to apologize for the MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people. 
""This is the most trying of times,"" Boeing's McAllister told a press briefing.
""But without a doubt this is a pivotal moment for all of us. It's a time to capture learnings. It's a time to be introspective. And it's a time for us to make sure accidents like this never happen again.""

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) climbed 0.8% after TF International Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo said the tech giant will launch three different iPhone models in 2020, with 6.7-inch, 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch screen sizes. Two of the three models, the 5.4-inch 6.7-inch, will support 5G.
The upcoming launch of the 5G iPhone has longed been touted as an important upgrade cycle as the tech giant's most recent slate of smartphones did little spark the sort of fanfare and record sales that have become commonplace.
""We estimate that 5G iPhone will account for around 60% of total new 2H20 iPhone shipments (vs. consensus’s 20%),"" Kuo said.
For the near term the demise in iPhone demand continues to weigh on Apple in the wake of a messy U.S.-China trade war that has piled the pressure on consumers, particular those in China, a key market for the iPhone maker.
JPMorgan trimmed its iPhone shipment estimates for calendar Q2-Q4 to to $139.5 million total, down 4%, though tempered fears by insisting that it still sees shipment growth for the current year.
Credit Suisse, meanwhile, said the decline in the pace of iPhone shipments “has significantly improved” in the June quarter, though at 4% down year on year, are still behind the 4% growth in the overall China smartphone market.
Apple’s shares are likely “to remain range-bound near-term, given the significant uncertainty created by U.S.-China trade tensions,” Credit Suisse added."

355,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 12:51PM ET</span>",Pfizer makes $10.6 billion cancer bet in cash deal for Array Biopharma,"By Michael Erman and Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) on Monday said it would buy Array Biopharma Inc for $10.64 billion in cash, a deal it hopes will help make it a leader in colon cancer and build up its pipeline of oncology drugs.
The largest U.S. drugmaker agreed to pay a hefty premium of 62% for Array, which sells the combination treatment Braftovi and Mektovi for melanoma. But those drugs appear poised to become part of a promising triple combination for advanced colorectal cancer.
Pfizer executives said the company began actively pursuing Array last month after it released positive clinical data showing that Braftovi and Mektovi in combination with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's Erbitux helped reduce the risk of death from colorectal cancer by 48% compared to the standard of care in patients with a gene mutation known as BRAF V600E.
The data ""is really a landmark publication in one of the most dismal tumors,"" Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten said in a phone interview.
""There will be ample opportunities to do combinations and build a whole science platform around colorectal cancer,"" said Dolsten, adding that he believes the Array drugs could eventually tackle colon cancer earlier in the disease process.
That is a type of cancer where the class of immunotherapies that include Merck and Co's blockbuster Keytruda have not been as compelling as Array's results, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.
Braftovi and Mektovi, launched last July for the deadliest form of skin cancer at a price of $22,000 per month, had sales of around $72 million over their first nine months. The company also has revenue from royalty and licensing deals.
Pfizer is paying $48 per share for Array, which rose 55% to $45.95 in midday trading. Pfizer's shares fell 0.4 percent to $42.59.

Oncology has become one of the most profitable areas for drug companies as breakthroughs in treatments have improved survival rates and costs for the drugs have surged.
Array is Pfizer's first major purchase under new Chief Executive Albert Bourla, who took on the role in January. It is also its biggest acquisition since a $14 billion purchase of Medivation in 2016 gave it the prostate cancer drug Xtandi, forecast by analysts to top $1 billion in sales next year.
Bourla and his predecessor Ian Read have been saying for more than a year that the company would eschew transformative deals because of the strength of its pipeline. But in April, Pfizer said it would consider bolt-on deals worth a few billion dollars to complement its pipeline.
Read had previously failed to close megadeals to acquire rivals AstraZeneca and later Allergan (NYSE:AGN).
Pfizer's growth has slowed in recent years and Bourla has been touting the company's ""15 in 5"" plan to launch 15 experimental treatments, each with at least $1 billion annual sales potential, over a five-year period. The company been investing in cancer drugs and gene therapies.
Pfizer said it expects to complete the deal in the second half of 2019.
The transaction is expected to add to earnings beginning 2022, and will reduce adjusted earnings per share by between 4 and 5 cents this year and in 2020, Pfizer said.
Pfizer said it expects to finance the majority of the deal, which has an enterprise value of about $11.4 billion, with debt and the remaining with existing cash.

Pfizer was advised by Guggenheim Securities and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on the deal. Array's advisor was Centerview Partners.

""We continue to anticipate a challenging year for Mexico's economy and forecast growth will slow to 1.2% in 2019 from 2.0% in 2018,"" Moody's Associate Managing Director Alejandro Olivo said in a statement.
The warning to the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador from the agency follows a downgrade in Mexico's sovereign credit rating by Fitch earlier this month as well as a lowering of the outlook by Moody's the same day.
Moody's saw risks that tax revenues may undershoot the government's estimates, which could mean spending cuts are needed to meet Lopez Obrador's target of posting a primary budget surplus of 1 percent of gross domestic product this year.
The agency forecast Pemex would need additional financial assistance from the government to fund its planned capital investment and resulting negative free cash flow. 
""Pemex will need even more government support if it is to achieve ambitious production growth targets and could also need help for its large debt maturities,"" Moody's said. ""This uncertainty has only added to the market's concerns regarding policy predictability and sapped investor confidence in Pemex.""
Pemex has financial debts of $106 billion.
The agency noted there was still appetite to invest in Mexican infrastructure, but said Lopez Obrador's decision in October to cancel a partly-built $13 billion new Mexico City airport had ""undermined market and investor confidence.""

Despite slowing growth, Moody's said it expected Mexican banks to maintain strong financial fundamentals.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 11:46AM ET</span>",Airbus faces cabin comfort dilemma as it launches A321XLR jet,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has broken records by launching the longest-range narrow-body jetliner at the Paris Airshow, but planemakers are having to rethink their mantra on comfort as they squeeze ever more miles out of jets designed for shorter trips.
Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) have been promoting new carbon-fiber long-haul aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner and A350, which offer roomier cabins and help passengers avoid jet lag by providing a cabin pressure closer to that felt on the ground. 
But they have also been adding more range and capacity to older and narrower models such as the A320neo family and the 737 MAX as airlines demand more flexibility with the advantages of highly efficient single-aisle planes, supporting low fares.
Airbus pushed that further on Monday by adding a longer stride to the A321neo with its new A321XLR, whose range of 4,700 nautical miles leapfrogs the out-of-production Boeing 757 and nudges it into the long-jump category enjoyed by wide-body jets.
It also eats into a range category targeted by a possible new mid-market twin-aisle jet, the NMA, under review by Boeing.
But there is a debate over whether passengers will enjoy flying longer distances in medium-haul planes, or at what price.
Airline bosses on the long-haul low-cost panel at the Paris Air Forum on Friday differed over whether extended-range narrow-body jets or wider twin-aisles were best suited for their growing industry.
In particular, the rise of the single-aisle long-distance jet involves revisiting years of industry marketing about the benefit of escaping jet lag and fatigue on long trips.
Aircraft cabins are pumped to a higher pressure than the ultra-thin outside air at cruising altitude. But the pressure is still lower than at sea level due to structural limitations.
That's not a problem for shorter trips but travel experts say the higher altitude setting on older planes can contribute to jet lag on long flights, worsening the effect of time zones.
WELL BEING
Although Airbus stresses the 1980s-designed A320 fuselage is wider than the competing 737 MAX and therefore has roomier seats, it also has a lower cabin pressure than modern long-haul alternatives like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or Airbus A350.
On those airplanes the cabin is pressurized at a level equivalent to 6,000 feet compared with 8,000 feet for the A320 and most other metal-built jets of all sizes. 
For the Airbus A330neo wide-body jet the cabin altitude is above 7,000 feet but still below 8,000 feet.
""XLR cabin pressure could be an issue,"" said an airline executive who has studied the plane, asking not to be named.
The company itself set out the disadvantages of flying with a high cabin altitude on long journeys when it launched the business-jet version of the A320neo family in 2015.
""A lower cabin altitude makes most sense on long flights, especially toward their end, when an aircraft is able to reach its highest cruising altitude,"" Airbus said then on its website.
For the business jet version, Airbus was able to lower the cabin altitude below 6,400 feet. But it could only do so by reducing the maximum number of trips, which matters relatively little to luxury operators but is less attractive to airlines.
That said, cabin pressure is one of many factors influencing the feel of a cabin and is rarely marketed separately.
""Everyone is pushing the 'well being' trend ... but an A321XLR will arguably be more comfortable than a 9-abreast Boeing 787,"" passenger experience expert John Walton said, referring to denser seat configurations used by some airlines.
Airbus declined to comment.
Placing the first order for the XLR, leasing magnate Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease Corp, said: ""We are working on a number of improvements in the cabin to accommodate long-haul operations"". 
The A321XLR is expected to be able to fly around eight hours in most cases, linking U.S. eastern cities deep into Europe.
The head of International Airlines Group's low-cost long-haul carrier Level, Vincent Hodder, told the Paris Air Forum the XLR could be configured to fly as long as 10 hours. Level and others are studying it, he said.

Airbus is chasing potential customers including American Airlines and JetBlue for the XLR and aims to grab up to 200 orders. It is expected to announce a deal with U.S. airline investor Indigo Partners later this week.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 09:55AM ET</span>","After Woodford fund suspension, focus turns to its stewards","By Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The suspension of Neil Woodford's flagship fund has put the focus on a little known firm tasked with ensuring his investors were being looked after properly. 
While Woodford, one of Britain's highest profile money managers, picked the companies in which the LF Woodford Equity Income Fund invested, the fund's governance was overseen by a company with a much lower profile -- Link Fund Solutions.
Link acts as Woodford's Authorised Corporate Director (ACD) and is the fund's legal owner. In the prospectus for the suspended fund, Link lists a group of six directors led by its Chief Executive, Christopher Addenbrooke. 
ACDs are meant to ensure fund managers stick to their investment mandates and follow the rules. They usually attract little scrutiny, but Woodford's fall from grace has raised questions about whether they are fit for purpose.
One key question is whether ACDs -- hired by the investment manager -- challenge fund managers' decisions robustly enough. 
""The ACD's role is very much behind the scenes from most retail investors' perspective, but is nonetheless crucial - they play a major part in ensuring that the fund complies with the FCA's rules,"" said Richard Small, a financial services partner at Addleshaw Goddard.
Britain's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said it was looking into the circumstances surrounding Woodford's fund suspension and the listing of some of its assets on an exchange in offshore dependency Guernsey - a move Link would have needed to approve.
""I would expect that the FCA will take a hard look at Link's role in this affair,"" Small said.
""They will be asking themselves whether this is another case of firms taking an overly technical tick-box approach to regulation without proper regard for the spirit and intention of the rules.""
LIQUIDITY QUESTION
Link, which works with almost 7,000 clients, suspended the 3.7 billion pound ($4.7 billion) fund two weeks ago as it struggled to meet redemption requests, in part because of its large holdings in private companies.
Under particular scrutiny are stakes in four firms listed on The International Stock Exchange (TISE) in Guernsey, which helped Woodford meet rules capping the proportion of unlisted holdings in his portfolio at 10%.
   The listing of BenevolentAI, Ombu, Industrial Heat and Sabina Estates helped the fund to comply with the cap. However, none of those shares have ever traded, the TISE website shows.
""The decision to reduce exposure to unquoted assets while indirectly maintaining exposure through a listed vehicle was in line with the investment objectives and strategy of the fund,"" a Link spokesman told Reuters.
But FCA chief Andrew Bailey said while the Guernsey listings were permissible under the rules, ""I don't think it is right"", suggesting it may focus on breaches of the spirit of the law.
The FCA said on June 5 it has been in discussion with Link and TISE regarding the Guernsey listings. 
The ACD must follow the FCA's 'COLL' rules for investment funds. Under them, Link had the power to designate Guernsey as being a suitable market, but only as long as it met conditions including that it was ""adequately liquid"".
The watchdog is expected to scrutinize why Link deemed Guernsey a suitable venue to ensure that assets could find a ready buyer if Woodford needed cash to meet redemption requests.
The FCA declined further comment.
Alan Hughes, partner at law firm Foot Anstey, said: ""Something may be strictly within the rules but is it in the best interests of the investors?.. the fund itself and the ACD may have a broader duty to consider."" 
REFORM CALLS
The Woodford suspension has prompted calls for a reform of the industry.
""The model is broken because of the conflict of interest,"" said Matthew Priestley, head of Investment Management Oversight at Fund Partners, itself an ACD.
A better way, he said, would be for the FCA to ringfence some of the fees it gets from the industry to pay for ACDs out of a ""blind pot"".
The Woodford suspension is the third time in recent years that Link, and its former incarnation as Capita Financial Managers (CFM), part of outsourcer Capita, has drawn regulatory attention.
In 2012 CFM was censured for breaches of principles related to diligence, management and control in the collapse of two Arch Cru funds. It paid 32 million pounds toward a 54 million pound compensation scheme for investors, without admission of liability.
The Arch Cru funds were invested in Guernsey cell companies which listed on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange. The cell companies invested in a range of unlisted assets, including hedge funds and fine wine.
One criticism of CFM was that it did not adequately monitor liquidity. Around 6,400 investors lost nearly 400 million pounds ($500 million) after the funds were wound up in 2010.

CFM was censured again in 2017 for a lack of due diligence on the Connaught Income Fund which liquidated in 2012. Investor losses were around 110 million pounds, although Capita paid up to 66 million pounds in compensation.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 09:40AM ET</span>",Boeing lifts 20-year industry demand forecast to $6.8 trillion,"By Eric M. Johnson
LE BOURGET, France (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co raised its rolling 20-year industry forecast for passenger aircraft by 3% on Monday, fueled by strong air traffic predictions, though global geopolitical and economic risks could upset the rosy outlook.
The world's largest planemaker said at the Paris Airshow it expected 44,040 new airplane deliveries over the next two decades, up from the roughly 43,000 it forecast a year ago.
That would be worth $6.8 trillion over the next two decades at list prices versus last year's $6.3 trillion prediction.
Dominating that tally is a roughly 3% increase in the forecast for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 family and the competing Boeing 737 MAX which remains grounded in the wake of two deadly crashes.
The forecast is underpinned by a prediction for average global traffic growth of 4.6 percent, down fractionally from the 4.7 percent projected last year.
The $3.8 trillion single-aisle market is driven to a large degree by strong demand in the Asia Pacific travel market, Boeing said, though the Chicago-based manufacturer is exposed to slowing economies, trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties.
Boeing now sees 32,420 deliveries in the medium-haul, single-aisle category, which is the cash cow of the world's two largest planemakers and popular with low-cost airlines, the jetmaker said.

In the wide-body segment, Boeing sees demand for 8,340 new passenger airplanes valued at more than $2.6 trillion over the next two decades, up 270 from the 8,070 it forecast last year, driven by airlines' need to refresh their fleets and growth in demand for longer-haul air travel.

371,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Budget Airline IndiGo Orders 280 Jet Engines in $20 Billion Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian budget carrier IndiGo is ordering jet engines worth $20 billion from a joint venture of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. and France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA, a sign that the biggest buyer of Airbus SE A320neo planes is moving away from a rival engine by Pratt & Whitney following a series of glitches.
The order by IndiGo, operated by  Interglobe Aviation Ltd  (NS:INGL), for 280 engines to power Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft will include service and maintenance, the airline statement said. CFM International, the GE-Safran venture, will deliver the first engine by 2020.
The order is a blow to Pratt, a division of United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX)., which has grappled with delivery delays and groundings in India after spending $10 billion to develop its fuel-efficient geared turbofan for single-aisle jets. The deal strengthens CFM’s presence in India, the world’s fastest growing aviation market last year, with the local affiliate of Singapore Airlines Ltd. and state-run Air India Ltd. already using its turbines.
A move by IndiGo, Asia’s biggest budget carrier by market value, to CFM “would be a key reputational negative” for Pratt’s geared turbofan and could hurt future sales campaigns, Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note to clients on May 30.
IndiGo, which controls almost half of the local market in India, had ordered 430 A320neo-family jets, and chose Pratt to supply turbines for the first 150 of them. The airline, founded by billionaires Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, is in talks with Airbus to place another “large” order to fuel an ambitious growth plan beyond the subcontinent, Chief Executive Officer Ronojoy Dutta said in an interview last month.

""I'd like President Trump to speak to Prime Minister Abe about fair conditions, fair trial conditions and to let me speak to my husband and also to respect this presumption of innocence until proven guilty,"" Beirut-born Carole Ghosn, who has a U.S. passport, told the BBC.
Shinzo Abe is due to host other leaders of the Group of 20 economies in the Japanese city of Osaka on June 28-29.
Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, is facing financial misconduct charges and has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing ""backstabbing"" former colleagues of conspiring to oust him as Nissan chairman.
Carole Ghosn said she had not spoken to her husband since he was re-arrested on April 4 before being released on bail three weeks later.
""They told him one of the bail conditions, the restrictions, is he isn't allowed to speak to me or talk to me, which I find inhumane,"" she said.
""All of this could have been dealt with internally within the company. This didn't need to go this far and on top of it my husband is innocent and time will prove the truth.""
In April Carole Ghosn called on the French government to do more to help her husband. Carlos Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, has denied charges against him.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors filed criminal charges against two British bankers, accusing the pair of involvement in a fraud that cost the state 440 million euros ($494.4 million), a German court said on Monday, as the country's biggest post-war fraud probe gathered pace.
The move by state prosecutors in Cologne paves the way for the first criminal trial from a years-long investigation into a scheme devised by bankers to make illegitimate double tax reclaims for share trades.
The German regional court in Bonn said that the two had been accused of involvement in fraudulent reclaims between 2006 and 2011. This statement is an important step toward launching a trial in the coming months.
The practice, known as cum-ex, typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each of whom was entitled to a tax rebate.
Last year, Germany's finance minister Olaf Scholz described the stock-trading scheme as a ""scandal"" that underscored the need for better European cooperation.
Tax authorities in Denmark say they lost $2 billion in rebates that should not have been paid, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros ($5.62 billion)by a similar method.
The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark has prompted other countries, including Austria and Belgium, to open their own investigations. They have discovered that they were also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.

LONDON (Reuters) - Share markets couldn't add to recent gains and government bond yields inched fractionally higher on Monday, as investors hunkered down for what is shaping up to be a crucial week for global monetary policy.
With expectations running high that the U.S. Federal Reserve will signal on Wednesday its first rate cut since the financial crisis, only a few asset classes were straying far.
The focus was still the dollar's surge late last week after above-forecast U.S. industrial output and retail sales data and upbeat consumer confidence soundings pushed back futures markets bets of any quick Fed chop.
The greenback held its gains as most major currencies trod water [/FRX]. Wall Street futures looked flat too, while a 10% drop in German airline Lufthansa's shares following a profit warning kept Europe's STOXX 600 subdued. (EU)
""A (U.S.) rate cut this week seems extremely premature,"" said Royal Bank of Canada Capital Market's Global Head of FX Strategy Elsa Lignos. 
""But the Fed can make some communications tweaks that at least open up the possibility for a cut in July. The question is how flexible that messaging will be.""
Traders are pricing a high probability of a July rate cut, despite there being unusually high uncertainty, particularly around trade, Lignos added. She said a G20 meeting late this month could also change the narrative again.
The main concern, though, is if tensions do continue, the trade war could tip the U.S. and other economies into recession.
European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure said in an interview that the bank's sub-zero interest rates could be cut again if needed. It could also restart the quantitative easing program it wound down at the end of last year.
It came too as long-term euro zone inflation expectations hit a new all-time low. Euro zone bond yields did inch fractionally higher as had U.S. Treasuries, though to all intents and purposes they were still in multi-year troughs. [GVD/FRX] 
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies, meanwhile, brushed a two-week high of 97.603 as the yen drifted and the euro fetched $1.1216, near the lower end of its recent trading range. [/FRX]
""The question is not whether we have instruments; we do have instruments. We can change our guidance. We can cut rates. We can restart QE,"" Coeure told the Financial Times.
""The question is which instrument, or combination of instruments, would be best suited to the circumstances.""

In emerging markets, average sovereign yields were at 6-year lows [.JGEGDCM] and a welcome drop in unemployment helped Turkey's markets brush off another sovereign downgrade from Moody's and a warning risks of a full-blown crisis were rising.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended slightly weaker overnight while Japan's Nikkei average had closed flat.
The Bank of Japan also meets this week and is widely expected to reinforce its commitment to its massive stimulus program.
There had been something of boost from Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index which finished 0.4% higher. At the weekend, the territory's leader Carrie Lam backed down over a bill that would have allowed extradition to China.
The Hang Seng had fallen for three sessions in a row, after the extradition bill triggered mass protests and some of the worst unrest seen in the territory since Britain handed it back to Chinese rule in 1997.
""Last week the issue looked as if it would become another thorny point between the United States and China. As the bill is now being postponed indefinitely, things will likely calm down, which is good for markets,"" said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.
Mainland Chinese shares traded within a tight range, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite up 0.2% and the blue-chip CSI 300 barely budging.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 06:51AM ET</span>",China urges big lenders not to shun small non-banks after Baoshang's woes: sources,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's securities watchdog has told several large non-bank financial institutions to lend in the interbank market to smaller non-bank firms to help ease any cash shortfalls, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.
The moves to head off potential instability among smaller financial institutions comes as Beijing faces pressure to boost bank lending to help cushion the economic impact from the higher tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by the United States.
China's money markets were rattled after regulators took control of Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang Bank on May 24 due to ""serious"" credit risks.
As a result, the central bank has injected cash into the banking system to reassure lenders, and regulators have repeatedly downplayed the risks at small financial institutions.
Yet some smaller non-banking institutions still suffered from a shortage of funds last week after being denied loans in the interbank market, traders said. Financing costs for smaller financial institutions have also spiked since the Baoshang takeover.
During a meeting on Sunday, Li Chao, vice chairman of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), urged large non-bank institutions not to cut off smaller non-banks as counterparties in the interbank market.
Managers from seven major securities firms and two fund companies attended the meeting in Beijing, the four sources said. 
According to the minutes, confirmed by the sources, Li also told them to increase their lending quota for short-term bonds and offer more financing tools to support small securities firms.
Regulators also eased rules that would allow select brokerages to issue debt more easily, and said China's top five lenders would provide funding support to the country's top five brokerages.
ILLIQUIDITY RISK
The minutes showed that regulators are aware that the risk of illiquidity in the bond market had spread to non-banks, and that there was a rising sense of ""distrust"" between financial institutions following Baoshang's takeover.
CSRC did not immediately respond to a fax request by Reuters seeking comment.
After the Baoshang takeover, investors are scrambling to revamp the way they evaluate negotiable certificate of deposits and other instruments once believe to be ultra-safe, traders and fund managers told Reuters.
""Previously, investors were seeking high yields, now, avoiding risk is the top priority,"" a Shanghai-based mutual fund manager said, who declined to be named. ""Under the current circumstances, if you're not sure to buy or not to buy, just avoid buying.""
Although small banks and other lenders are not by themselves seen as a systemic financial risk, the concern is that enough of them have largely funded themselves via short-term money market borrowing, posing a collective danger if one or two fail.
""CSRC is worried about further risk contagion, and want to strengthen the communication with the market,"" a senior official of a major brokerage told Reuters.
Asked about how the firm would support the smaller non-banks after CSRC came out urging support, the source said: ""As for us, we'll wait and see how strong is the support from regulators, especially the funding back-ups.""

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",Huawei Braces for Phone Sales Drop of Up to 60 Million Overseas,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
Huawei Technologies Co. is preparing for a drop in international smartphone shipments of 40 million to 60 million as the Trump administration’s blacklisting hammers one of the Chinese tech giant’s most important businesses.
China’s largest technology company is crunching internal estimates and exploring options including pulling the latest model of its marquee overseas label, the Honor 20, people familiar with the matter say. The device begins selling in parts of Europe June 21 including France and the U.K., but executives are monitoring the launch and may cut off shipments if it sells poorly as expected, they said, asking not to be identified discussing internal matters. Already, two of France’s largest carriers aren’t bothering with the Honor at all, two people familiar with the matter said.
Huawei sales and marketing managers are internally charting a drop in volumes of anywhere between 40 million to 60 million smartphones this year, the people said. That’s a big chunk of an international business that in 2018 accounted for almost half of the 206 million phones it moved. The unusually wide range underscores the uncertainty gripping Huawei, a Chinese national champion that Washington accuses of aiding Beijing in espionage -- something the company has repeatedly denied.
On Monday, billionaire Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei confirmed the company had endured about a 40% drop in smartphone shipments abroad, which a company spokesman said referred to a fall over the past month. Ren expects Washington’s sanctions to curtail its overall revenue by about $30 billion over the coming two years, wiping out the networking giant’s growth. Ren was surprised at the extent to which Washington attacked his corporation, but Huawei will maintain its research budget while refraining from layoffs or major asset sales, he added.
“We didn’t expect the damage to be this serious,” he told author-investor George Gilder and MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte during a panel discussion in Shenzhen. “We did make some preparations, like the damaged plane I talked about. We only protected the engine and fuel tanks, but failed to protect other parts.”
The U.S. in May blacklisted Huawei, choking off the American components and software it needs to run its businesses. That includes updates for the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android system that powers all its smartphones abroad. Without that software, devices like the Honor 20 wouldn’t be able to run critical apps like Google Maps and Gmail.
“Huawei will lose access to Play Store and key Google apps like YouTube and Gmail. Users will have to sideload or look for alternative app stores,” Counterpoint analyst Tom Kang wrote in a report following the ban. “The impact on emerging markets will vary. However, Europe, Japan, and Latin America will be heavily affected.”
Huawei, a smartphone vendor with volumes second only to South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., declined to comment on the estimates. Huawei spokesman Glenn Schloss said launches were “proceeding.”
Priced at 399 pounds ($500), the Honor 20 runs on the most advanced Android 9 software and is the latest in a line that’s won over budget-conscious consumers, including in the U.S. While it’s powered by the company’s own Kirin chip, meaning it doesn’t need Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. processors, the ban will hamstring consumers’ ability to update the OS or download the latest Google apps.
Longer term, Huawei is developing more of its own chips and mobile software to reduce its reliance on foreign technology. The company is delving into higher-end areas such as foldable devices. But it’s delaying the launch of the foldable Mate X to September to conduct more testing, CNBC cited a spokesperson as saying last week. Huawei has also touted a self-developed operating system as an Android alternative, but it will take time for the Chinese company to persuade developers across the globe to create separate apps tailored for the OS.
Faced with lukewarm international demand, Huawei -- which in 2018 overtook Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). to become the world’s No. 2 smartphone vendor -- is turning inward.
Huawei aims to grab as much as half of the smartphone market in China in 2019 to offset the decline overseas, the people said, citing internal discussions about year-end goals. While the domestic market is shrinking, Huawei hopes to boost shipments by investing in marketing and expanding distribution channels, one of the people said. Some executives have argued that the target was too high to achieve, the person added.
Huawei’s China smartphone market share could grow to as much as 45% versus a previous estimate of between 30%-35% thanks to “a more proactive sales strategy” after the Trump ban, TF International analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report on Wednesday.

The worldwide grounding in March of Boeing's fast-selling aircraft followed a crash in Indonesia and another in Ethiopia that triggered one of the worst crises in the company's more than 100-year history.
Boeing has been criticized for what some PR experts consider a lawyer-driven and wooden response to the three-month-old MAX crisis, though Muilenburg has said it is approaching the Paris Airshow with humility and stressing safety as its top priority.
McAllister said Boeing would apply lessons learned from the grounding of the 737 MAX but would not speculate when it would return to service, though Muilenburg told reporters on Sunday the jet would fly again commercially this year.
Executives also said engine issues were the key factor to be resolved in the development of its all-new 777X twin-aisle jet, but that the plane was performing well as it moves towards a flight test later this year. 
""The long pole in the tent remains engine issues,"" McAllister said of General Electric's GE9X engine.
GE Aviation said earlier it had found excess wear on a compression part on the GE9X engine developed for the 777X, forcing it to redesign the part.
The part will not be ready for months and no airplane will fly without the retrofitted part, GE said.
McAllister said he was ""staying very close to the situation"" but that it was premature to make any predictions on timing delays for the program. 
Boeing says it is targeted a 2020 entry to service, but Gulf airline Emirates says it expects the first plane in June that year - after flight tests expected to take 14 months.
Airlines that rushed to buy the fuel-efficient MAX are taking a hit to profits since having to cancel thousands of flights.

Meanwhile, Boeing is delaying decisions on the launch of a possible new aircraft, the mid-sized NMA, to give full attention to the 737 MAX, industry sources said.

(Reuters) - European stock markets opened flat to marginally higher on Monday as a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC-led rise in banking shares offset a fall in airlines following a profit warning from Germany's Lufthansa.
Deutsche, which has been cutting back and reorganizing for months, gained 3% after the Financial Times reported that the German lender is planning to create a ""bad bank"" that would house or sell assets valued at up to 50 billion euros.
Asia-focused  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) and HSBC also rose about 1%, tracking a rise in Asian markets after Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam climbed down on the extradition bill at the center of a week of protests in the city.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.04% by 0800 GMT, with the travel and leisure sector underperforming the other major European sectors.
Lufthansa plunged 12.3%, and was the biggest percentage faller on the STOXX 600, after the group lowered its profit outlook for the full year 2019, citing price competition from low cost rivals in Europe.
""Lufthansa signaling a weak outlook is hitting all these bigger carriers and that's definitely one negative element this morning,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG (LON:ICAG)) fell 3.2%, while budget airlines EasyJet and Ryanair Holdings slipped at least 4%.
Banking stocks rose 1% ahead of a pivotal Federal Reserve policy meeting starting Wednesday where investors on balance think an interest rate cut is unlikely while backing a shift towards one in July.
""Overall there is positivity in markets that we might see a bit more dovish Fed this week. Though we probably will not see any action from the Fed, the commentary could be more dovish,"" Beauchamp said.
A swing in money market pricing towards up to three rate cuts by the Fed this year have been at the heart of a recovery for stock markets this month after their worst falls in months in May. 
The rally has run out of steam in the past week, however, as traders trimmed those expectations from their peaks, and the strength of the dollar against the euro in recent days may offer a fillip to many European companies. 
Corporate newsflow continues to show a plethora of business problems, ranging from Brexit and nervousness among consumers to Italy's budget problems and the range of pressures on many airlines. 
UK-based Kier Group Plc tumbled 11.4% after the construction and services group said it would cut 1,200 jobs, sell non-core businesses and suspend its dividend for two years in an attempt to lower debt.

 Babcock International  Group (LON:BAB) Plc gained 4.6% after the engineering services group confirmed it had rejected a buyout offer from rival  Serco  Group (LON:SRP) in January.

388,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 04:37AM ET</span>",StockBeat: It's Lufthansa's Turn to Send Europe's Airlines Tumbling,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s airline stocks are taking another battering in early trading on Monday after German flag carrier Lufthansa issued the latest – and arguably the direst - in a string of profit warnings from the sector in recent weeks.
At 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock was down over 12%, after the company said its Eurowings subsidiary will lose money this year as a result of lingering overcapacity and fierce competition in the low-cost sector. It also said its cargo operations would be less profitable than previously thought. Even unit revenues at the core Luthansa brand, with its more insulated long-haul flights, are now expected to fall over the fiscal year by “a low single-digit percentage”. Consequently, it’s scaling down its plans to expand in that area and now sees only “marginal” capacity expansion over the coming winter season.
Adding insult to injury, the Frankfurt-based airline said it also set aside 340 million euros against a possible tax bill related to issues going back 18 years.
The news prompted another general revaluation of the sector: low-cost competitors suffered most with EasyJet (LON:EZJ) down 3.7%, Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) down 2.6% and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) down 3.6%, but Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) was also down 3.5% and International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG), parent of British Airways and Iberia, was down 2.8%.
They’re all underperforming the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600, which was effectively unchanged at 378.92 points. Germany’s Dax was down less than 0.1%, while the U.K. FTSE was up by a similarly modest amount at the start of a week overshadowed by some important central bank meetings.
Lufthansa’s tax bill added a surprise element to an otherwise predictable tale of woe: costs at Eurowings have also been stickier than assumed and the company said it would unveil further cost-cutting measures “shortly”; fuel costs have risen in line with oil prices – Lufthansa now expects its group fuel bill in the current fiscal year to be 550 million euros ($615 million) higher than previously estimated; and the European economy has weakened (the Deutsche Bundesbank earlier this month slashed its 2019 growth forecast for Germany, Lufthansa’s home market, to only 0.6%).
The economic slowdown is making Europe’s short-haul carriers pay heavily for missing a golden chance to remove excess capacity from the market in 2017 when Air Berlin collapsed. Instead, in a collective fit of overconfidence, there was an undignified fight for market share, in which Lufthansa was one of the guiltier parties, buying most of Air Berlin’s operations for a cut-price 210 million euros.
The consequences are now plain for all to see: the STOXX Europe Total Market Airlines index is now down 13% for the year, more than any other major sector index."

""I don't see any concern,"" Ulmer told reporters at the Paris Airshow when asked if the merger of two key suppliers would affect the F-35 program, which is working hard to reduce costs.
Ulmer also said Turkish firms continued to produce components for the aircraft despite a row over Ankara's plans to buy the Russian S-400 air defense system. 

He said plans by the U.S. government to start winding down Turkey's participation in the F-35 program would not affect Lockheed's production plan this year.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 04:08AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Banks face new challenges in Italian diamond scandal,"By Emilio Parodi and Maria Pia Quaglia
MILAN (Reuters) - A long-running criminal probe into diamond sales by Italian banks has uncovered what prosecutors say is further evidence of corruption by officials at UniCredit, Italy’s largest lender, and smaller rival Banco BPM.
The allegations, some previously unreported, are laid out in documents used by prosecutors when they sought a magistrate's order seizing assets from the banks and two diamond brokers. Reuters viewed the documents, which also included excerpts of wire taps and witness statements.
The allegations relate to suspected crimes and do not necessarily mean that prosecutors will charge the companies and their employees when their investigation, which has been running since 2016, is concluded.
The number of bank officials under suspicion, and the allegations they may face if they are charged, however, are widening.
In a new development, officials from UniCredit and Banco BPM are also suspected of corruption because broker Intermarket Diamond Business (IDB) invested some of its profits from the diamond sales in the banks' shares, according to evidence gathered by prosecutors.
In addition to UniCredit and Banco BPM,  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena are also under investigation.
In February, magistrates guiding the probe ordered the seizure of more than 700 million euros in assets from the two brokers and five banks.
UniCredit said in a statement to Reuters it was cooperating closely with authorities and its policy was not to comment on an ongoing investigation. It would ""continue to offer appropriate customer care services to its affected clients"".
Lawyers for Banco BPM, Banca Aletti, Intesa Sanpaolo and IDB did not respond to requests for comment. Monte dei Paschi's lawyers declined to comment. 
In a long-running scandal in a sector already tarnished by controversy, Italy's biggest banks are suspected of colluding with diamond brokers to scam their own customers -- allegedly selling them diamonds at vastly inflated prices while marketing them as sound financial investments.
All of the banks, along with a Banco BPM subsidiary, Banca Aletti, are suspected of fraud and money-laundering for using the proceeds to boost profits, according to allegations laid out in the documents used for the seizure order.
Prosecutors also allege that UniCredit and Banco BPM worked out a deal with IDB where, in return for the banks selling IDB's diamonds, the broker would channel money into their stock, boosting their share capital at a time when it was under pressure from a rising tide of bad debts.
Under Italian law it is deemed to be corruption when one party abuses its commercial position to induce the counterparty to provide it with favors -- in this case, the alleged purchase of shares. The IDB officials involved are also under investigation.
According to a criminal lawyer when asked by Reuters, under Italian law, if the banks are charged and convicted, they could be fined millions of euros, risk forfeiting the total of 161 million euros seized from them in February and could even be temporarily suspended from operating by court order.
They could also be ordered to pay compensation to victims, with sums to be decided by a civil court.
More than 100,000 people are estimated to have bought diamonds at Italian banks over the last 20 years, judicial sources say.
A GUN TO THE HEAD
Banks have been selling diamonds on behalf of brokers in Italy since the 1980s but they ramped up the business after the global financial crisis, according to prosecutors, when a deep recession left them saddled with soured loans and looking for alternative revenue sources.
Banco BPM, Italy's third-largest bank, was known as Banco Popolare in 2016 when it was looking to raise capital to fund its merger with Banca Popolare di Milano.
In a telephone conversation in early June 2016, a transcript of which was seen by Reuters, the former CEO of IDB complained that Banco Popolare was insisting he invest in the bank's shares.
""Given we decided more or less voluntarily to subscribe in a very substantial way to Banco Popolare's capital increase, they arrived with a 9-milimetre and they pointed it at my forehead and told me, 'sign here',"" Claudio Giacobazzi said in a call to his financial adviser in 2016.
Giacobazzi died last year. IDB went bankrupt in January and is in liquidation.
IDB invested more than 7 million euros in shares and share options in UniCredit in 2012, and a total of more than 950,000 euros in Banco Popolare shares in 2014 and 2016, according to the February order authorizing the seizure of the banks' assets. Reuters reviewed a copy of the order.
Banco BPM profited the most from diamond sales, netting around 85 million euros, including the Banca Aletti business, between 2012 and 2016 -- more than all the income earned by the other three banks combined, according to the order. Banco BPM also charged the biggest commissions, up to 24.5%, they show.
Milan prosecutors believe the banks teamed up with brokers to sell the stones in blister packs to bank customers, often at more than double their market value, making tens of millions of euros each in commissions. Their partners IDB and another broker Diamond Private Investment (DPI), made hundreds of millions each.
A lawyer for DPI declined to comment on what he called an ongoing preliminary investigation.
Prosecutors believe staff from UniCredit, Banco BPM and Monte dei Paschi accepted gifts including hotel stays and antiquities from brokers as sales incentives.
Italian state television channel Rai3 first reported the alleged mis-selling in late 2016.
Currently, 68 banking and brokerage officials are under investigation, as well as the banks themselves, but more individuals are expected to be investigated before the probe concludes within a few months, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Prosecutors have received lawsuits from more than 450 alleged victims, one of the sources said. 
Italy's antitrust authority fined the banks and brokers a total of 15 million euros in 2017 for selling the stones at inflated prices.
Since then, the banks have begun to compensate customers. All except Banco BPM have offered to buy back diamonds at the purchase price. Banco BPM said last month it would compensate clients for their losses but leave them with the stones. In April, it said it had received 18,400 claims for compensation.
CRAZY STUFF
Investigators allege the banks and the diamond brokers made the diamonds look like a safe investment. 
Customers who queried the price they were paying were referred to inflated diamond prices listed in Italy's main financial daily, Il Sole 24 Ore. The listings, which were assumed by clients to be official market quotes, were in fact ads placed by the brokers, prosecutors say.
A spokeswoman for the newspaper declined to comment.
One Banca Aletti brochure distributed to its clients describes diamonds as a ""good refuge"" over the medium and long term, forecasting returns of 50-80 percent above inflation.
In one phone tap in May 2017, a planning and marketing executive for parent bank Banco BPM, Pietro Gaspardo, discusses the brochure with BPM director general Maurizio Faroni.
    ""The things written inside are amazing. Amazing! Amazing!"" Gaspardo tells Faroni. ""Expected returns ... crazy stuff. There are things written there that are really madness. 
""I'm not thinking of myself now but for the bank. That stuff there will screw us up the arse totally. To make an investment and not sell it as a jewel, with expected return -- shit!""
Gaspardo's lawyer, Maurizio Miculan, said his client's comments show his innocence because he was clearly surprised at what he found in the brochure. 
Faroni's lawyer declined to comment.
When customers wanted to cash in the diamonds, they would resell the stones back via the banks to the brokers. The lenders made commissions of 12-24.5% on selling the diamonds and the brokers made commissions of 7-16% on buying them back, according to the judicial order that authorized the February asset seizures.
One of those clients was Gabriele Moggi who spent around 33,000 euros -- most of an early-retirement payoff from the Italian Air Force -- on diamonds in 2016 on the advice of his bank, a unit of Banco Popolare. He had them independently valued six months later for around 8,000 euros.
Moggi told Reuters he eventually settled with the bank in January this year for compensation of 15,000 euros, leaving him with the stones and a net 10,000 euros loss.
""I was asking for 20,000,"" said Moggi who was fed up and wanted out. ""In the end I accepted 15,000 euros because there was no other way to get out of it.""
A spokeswoman for Banco BPM said the bank couldn't comment on individual cases.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS has lost a lead role on a U.S. dollar bond deal for state-backed China Railway Construction Corp, just days after a Chinese outcry over a senior UBS economist's use of ""pig"" in connection with Chinese food price inflation.
While UBS apologized for the remark on Thursday and put the analyst on leave on Friday, the furor led Haitong International Securities, a leading Chinese brokerage, to suspend all business with the Swiss group as some Chinese bankers and analysts criticized the bank for a lack of cultural awareness.
On Monday, a spokesman at Chinese infrastructure giant CRCC confirmed it had dropped the Swiss banking giant from the deal, but did not give a reason. 
The decision was taken because of the controversy over the pig comment, according to a source at the bank, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to talk to media. 
A UBS spokesman declined to comment.
The upset stemmed from a remark by Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS's wealth management business since 2016, in a podcast on Wednesday which was then transcribed and posted on the bank's website. It has since been taken down. 
In the podcast, Donovan said that consumer prices in China had risen mainly due to sickness among pigs.
""Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China,"" Donovan said in comments some took offence at because of a perceived reference to people, not livestock.
CHINA PUSH 
The fierce outcry has taken many other western banks by surprise. In at least two Wall Street institutions bankers said their colleagues were discussing which words they should avoid following the UBS pig furor.
UBS analysts have also been asked informally by managers to be very careful about the use of words when referring to China or Chinese entities, sources with knowledge said. 
“One of our economists came to me and asked me if we should prepare a list of words that we should always avoid mentioning in China-related reports. I thought he was joking, but he was serious,"" said one senior banker.
The row comes as global investment banks are gearing up for a push into China following rule changes that now allow them to control their securities joint ventures.
UBS was the first, in November, to win approval under the rule changes. In March, JP Morgan and Japan's Nomura also got the nod.
“You can’t ignore the timing of this controversy — foreign brokerages are looking for a bigger footprint in China and the local houses are beginning to get worried about the impact of that on their market share. So they are not going to miss any excuse to go after the foreigners,"" said a banker whose employer has been approved for 51% control.

Monetary policy measures -- including cuts to benchmark lending rates, market interest rates and reserve requirement ratios -- will be necessary to support the economy, Linan Liu, greater China rates and FX strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. That will boost Chinese government and policy-bank bonds, particularly the five and 10-year maturities, she said.
“The policy response was a little bit behind” as headwinds to growth mounted in the second quarter, Liu said. In part as a result, “there are risks that economic growth will decelerate further into the second half of this year, which means fiscal stimulus as well as monetary stimulus will need to be more stimulative into the second half,” she said.
Deutsche Bank has cut its second-quarter real GDP growth forecast to 6.2% from 6.4% earlier, Liu said.
Chinese bonds are also attractive because their yield premiums over U.S. Treasuries have climbed, Liu said. The yield on 10-year Chinese government bonds was down 3 basis points at 3.24% at 1:12 p.m. Hong Kong time.

Real estate developers rebounded after Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the suspension of a proposed extradition bill that sparked days of mass protests.
New World Development Co Ltd (HK:0017) jumped 3.1% by 1:10 AM ET (05:10 GMT), Sino Land (HK:0083) climbed 2.7%, while Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd (HK:0016) gained 1.6%.
It was reported that as many as two million protesters were on the street on Sunday. It was the biggest protest since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997.
In a statement released on Sunday evening, the administration made it clear there was no timetable to re-launch the suspended bill.
Despite the softening tone from the government, hundreds of protestors continued to gather in Hong Kong on Monday morning to express dissatisfaction towards Lam’s statement, as some noted that it was “just a postponement” that left open the options of fully killing the measure.
It was reported last week that Goldin Financial Holdings decided to walk away from a land deal at the Kai Tek development area in Kowloon East and forfeit an HK$25 million deposit due to uncertainties surrounding the extradition bill.

Let’s put that in context, though. Around 51% of Huawei’s shipments in the March quarter were in China, according to my calculations based on data from Counterpoint Research.
Western Europe, where Huawei faces most of its current headwinds, accounted for just 13.7% of shipments for the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe comprised around 9% each, while Latin America was 8%.
Japan, Canada and the U.S., which may be considered nominally hostile to Huawei, together accounted for less than 1% of first-quarter shipments. The rest comes from the broader Asia-Pacific region. This is just one quarter’s data, but they largely track full-year numbers for 2018.
In my estimation, the most Huawei-skeptic markets probably account for only 25% of the company’s smartphone sales. Which is around 50% of its overseas handset shipments. I don’t think all of those regions will cut Huawei sales to zero.
Let’s remember, Huawei is preparing for a downturn of around 50% in international sales, according to the report. That doesn’t mean such a drop will happen. It’s smart for executives to game out all the possibilities, and the impact they will have. Making the world believe that it’s been badly bruised by an anti-Huawei campaign driven by the U.S. can only bolster support at home. Given that the company isn’t publicly traded, such a narrative doesn’t risk panic-selling of its shares.
Nationalism will be Huawei’s strongest weapon in the battle to cut reliance on foreign technology. I wrote recently about the Silicon Wall that’s being built between Chinese and American spheres of influence as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump kicking off a technology Cold War. Being independent of the West is Beijing’s stated goal.
To rouse the troops, instill a sense of purpose, and rally the entire country in support of its cause, it might help Huawei to be seen as a victim. That can only enhance its status as a homegrown hero.

399,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",China Traders Reassess Counterparties After Bank Seizure,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond traders in China are rethinking counterparty risks as shock waves from a government takeover of a bank ripple through the country’s financial markets.
It’s now getting harder for corporate bonds to be accepted as collateral for repo financing as lenders increasingly demand top quality bonds such as Chinese sovereign bills and policy bank notes as pledges. Traders are having second thoughts on taking even AAA rated short-term bank debt as security in the wake of last month’s seizure of Baoshang Bank Co.
That’s clogging up funding among China’s financial institutions, which have already caused borrowing costs to spike for brokerages and smaller banks. The timing couldn’t be worse with liquidity generally tight at the quarter-end, and further adds to the wide-ranging ramifications of the bank seizure. All this could mean higher defaults, according to Bloomberg Economics.
“Non-bank financial institutions are actually the biggest buyers of corporate bonds in China, and if their funding chain breaks, demand for bonds, particularly those that can hardly be pledged for borrowing, will certainly get hurt,"" said David Qu at Bloomberg Economics in Hong Kong. “Weaker companies will suffer a rising cost when selling new bonds, which may eventually lead to higher default risks.”
A trader at a Beijing-based brokerage, who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak publicly, said its counterparty just tightened the collateral for repo lending to only AAA rated negotiable certificates of deposits -- a type of short-term debt sold by banks -- whereas just a few days ago AA+ rated ones were accepted.
Another trader said most of his counterparties now require government bonds as collateral as it will be very hard for corporate bonds to be accepted as pledge for borrowing.
Regulatory Reaction
In a sign of a jittery market, two non-bank institutions quashed speculations they couldn’t raise funds. Shanghai Haitong Securities Asset Management Co. said June 12 it didn’t default on any bond repurchase agreement, neither did it face a liquidity crunch. The following day, Lianxun Securities Co. made a similar announcement saying its bond transactions were normal and it had sufficient capital.
China Foreign Exchange Trade System, which runs the nation’s interbank bond market, will conduct anonymous auctions of the bonds used as collateral in a defaulted repo transaction, according to an announcement that appeared on the CFETS website on Monday. Repo failures have been rare in the past, according to Yang Hao, fixed income analyst at Nanjing Securities Co., adding that the move provides a standard method for collateral disposal.
Authorities held a meeting on Sunday with some of the country’s leading brokerages to discuss options to address liquidity risks, telling institutions to not suspend all their repo lending businesses, according to a report from 21st Century Business Herald, citing unnamed institutional investors.
That is in response to the fact that China’s seven-day and 14-day ""overall interbank market"" pledged repurchase rates, which indicate non-bank institutions’ financing conditions, surged to 15% on Tuesday, a level deemed extremely high, according to traders. The liquidity injections from the central bank in recent weeks have largely benefited large banks, market participants say.
Tight Liquidity
In China, the funding flow goes like this: big national banks lend to smaller regional lenders, which then provide financing to non-bank peers such as brokerages and funds. They in turn use the money to invest in corporate bonds.
“Smaller banks play a key role in this chain,” said Ming Ming, chief fixed-income analyst of Citic Securities Co. Right now investors are quite ""risk averse and everyone wants to mitigate counterparty risks. If things get worse, China’s financial market liquidity could collapse,” he added.

400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2019 11:50PM ET</span>",UBS to Lose China Bond Deal After Economist's Pig Remark,"(Bloomberg) -- One of China’s biggest state-owned infrastructure companies excluded UBS Group AG from a bond deal after the bank’s global chief economist sparked a furor with his use of the phrase “Chinese pig.”
China Railway Construction Corp. decided against hiring UBS as a joint global coordinator on a dollar-bond sale, a CRCC spokesman said. The decision was prompted by last week’s pig remark, people familiar with the matter said earlier. UBS declined to comment.
CRCC is the first known corporate issuer to distance itself from UBS over a drama that has captivated financial professionals around the world and threatened to complicate the Swiss bank’s push into Asia’s largest economy. While lost fees from the deal will have a negligible impact on the bank’s bottom line, the signaling effect from a major state-owned company is potentially more concerning as UBS tries to prevent the uproar from damaging its investment-banking and wealth-management businesses.
The stakes are high for UBS, which has had a presence in China longer than most Wall Street firms and was the first foreign business to win approval for a majority shareholding in a local securities venture after the country relaxed ownership rules. Most wealth managers still serve China’s rich from offshore centers such as Hong Kong and Singapore, but the nation’s massive pool of onshore money, estimated at around $20 trillion, is a huge prize for the industry.
CRCC hired  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and ICBC International as joint global coordinators for its bond sale, people familiar with the matter said last week.
UBS economist Paul Donovan made the “Chinese pig” comment on Wednesday in an analysis of the country’s swine flu epidemic. He was attempting to explain why the outbreak shouldn’t concern investors eyeing the international inflation outlook.
“Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig,” the economist said. “It matters if you like eating pork in China. It does not really matter to the rest of the world. China does not export a lot of food. The only global relevance would be if Chinese inflation influenced politics and other policies.”
Even as many English speakers viewed the phrasing as innocuous, it set off a firestorm on Chinese social media. The comment was condemned by two Communist Party publications and by trade groups representing Chinese brokerages. Haitong International Securities Group, which competes against UBS for China-related business, said on Friday that it had suspended its activities with the bank.
Donovan apologized, saying in an interview with Bloomberg Television that he unwittingly used culturally insensitive language. UBS later placed the 47-year-old economist on leave and said it was evaluating whether more steps needed to be taken.
“We apologize unreservedly for any misunderstanding caused by these innocently intended comments,” UBS said in an emailed statement. “We have removed the audio comment from circulation. To be clear, this comment was about inflation and Chinese consumer prices rising, which was driven by higher prices for pork.”
UBS shares fell almost 1% last week, outpacing losses among European peers and extending declines over the past year to 24%.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.8% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). As many as two million were present during the protest on Sunday, according to reports. It was the biggest protest since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997.
The protest came after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam backed down on a bill that would have allowed extradition to China. Protesters noted that it was “just a postponement” that left open the possibility of bringing the measure back.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.2%, while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.3%.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he does not expect a major trade deal between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the upcoming G-20 meeting.
“I think the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks,” Ross said in an interview Sunday with the Wall Street Journal.
Ross added that the meeting might lay out “new ground rules for discussion and some sort of schedule for when detailed technical talks might resume.”
Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.5%, while South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 was down 0.2%.

Over a nine-year period, Hisco failed to accurately report the expenses, which was a breach of the standards of trust and transparency the board requires, ANZ Bank New Zealand Chairman John Key told reporters Monday in Auckland. The sums involved were less than NZ$100,000 ($64,000) and the money doesn’t need to be paid back.
“The board was concerned about how he has was characterizing certain expenses and transactions following an internal review of personal expenses,” Key said. “Specifically this related to the long-term personal use of corporate chauffeured cars, as well as charging the company for storage without proper disclosures.”
Hisco, who has led New Zealand’s largest lender since 2010, has been on extended sick leave since late May. He will receive one-year’s salary and accrued long-service leave, but forfeit rights to ANZ shares and options valued at about NZ$6.4 million. His departure comes a month after the bank was censured by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for persistent failure to comply with rules around modeling risk-capital requirements.
Key said a review of expenses across all executives at parent bank Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. revealed some anomalies which were subsequently investigated, and he became aware of the matter about three months ago.
The issue with Hisco was a “one-off” with no evidence of a systemic problem, Key said.
Hisco believed he had the authority to use the cars in New Zealand because he was an expat and from the nature of some discussions he’d had with executives in Australia, Key said.
“We accept that,” Key said. “What we don’t accept is the way they were reported in our accounts. He has an explanation for why it was reported the way it was. I don’t think it meets the standard the New Zealand board and I set, and for that reason it was a pretty simple decision on both sides that we should part company.”
While Hisco didn’t accept all of the concerns raised by the board, he accepts accountability given his leadership position and agreed the characterization of the expenses fell short of the standards required, the bank said in an earlier statement.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2019 07:45PM ET</span>",Huawei prepares for 40%-60% fall in international smartphone shipments: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is preparing for a 40% to 60% decline in international smartphone shipments, Bloomberg reported on Sunday. 
The Chinese technology company is looking at options that include pulling the latest model of its marquee overseas smartphone, the Honor 20, according to the article, which cited people familiar with the matter.
The device will begin selling in parts of Europe, including Britain and France, on June 21, the report said. Executives will be monitoring the launch and may cut off shipments if the sales are poor, it said. 
Marketing and sales managers at the tech giant are internally expecting a drop in volumes of anywhere between 40 million to 60 million smartphones this year, the report said.
In order to offset overseas decline, Huawei is aiming to grab up to half of China's smartphone market in 2019, Bloomberg said. The company did not respond to a Reuters request seeking comment. 
The U.S. government put Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment company, on a trade blacklist in May that bars U.S. suppliers from doing business with it because of what Washington says are national security concerns.
At the time, Huawei founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei said the restrictions ""may slow, but only slightly"" the company's growth.
A similar U.S. ban on China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763), almost crippled business for Huawei's smaller rival early last year before the curb was lifted.
The company's woes are feeding into trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. President Donald Trump has said U.S. complaints against Huawei could be resolved within the framework of any trade deal.
The ban has been eased slightly to allow a temporary general license that lets Huawei purchase U.S. goods.

However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) sent a shockwave through the global chipmaking industry last week when it forecast that the U.S.-China trade tensions and the Huawei ban would knock $2 billion off this year's sales.

Business investment - key for productivity and pay growth - was forecast to fall by 1.3% this year before growing by only 0.4% in 2020, the British Chambers of Commerce said.
The BCC nudged up its overall economic growth forecast for 2019 to 1.3%, reflecting a surge in stockpiling by companies before the original Brexit deadline in March.
But the employers group cut its forecast for growth in 2020 to 1.0% - down sharply from a previous estimate of 1.3% - before only a marginal pick-up to 1.2% in 2021.
BCC Director General Adam Marshall said companies were unable to press on with long-term plans because of the continued uncertainty about Brexit, which now has a deadline of Oct. 31. 
""Businesses are putting resources into contingency plans, such as stockpiling, rather than investing in ventures that would positively contribute to long-term economic growth,"" Marshall said. 
""This is simply not sustainable. Business communities expect the next prime minister to quickly find a sensible and pragmatic way forward to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit.""
Prime Minister Theresa May has stepped down as leader of the ruling Conservative Party and a contest to replace her is expected to conclude in July. With Britain's relationship with the EU still unclear, some financial firms have set up operations in other EU countries and carmakers have reduced their expansion plans in Britain.
Business investment fell throughout 2018, the longest such run since the global financial crisis, before a pickup in early 2019, official figures have shown.

Finance minister Philip Hammond says he expects a recovery in business investment once a Brexit deal is done.

Under the Connect scheme, Shanghai-listed companies can raise new funds via London's stock market while British companies can broaden their investor base by selling existing shares in Shanghai.
The project was intended to begin late last year with the December listing of Chinese brokerage Huatai, backed by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. But the listing was delayed at the last minute.
Huatai Securities Co Ltd then effectively launched Connect earlier this month with the announcement of plans to raise money on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). 
Huatai, one of China's largest brokerages, is expected to make its London market debut on June 17, becoming the first company to trade via the London-Shanghai Stock Connect project.
From Monday, London investors will have the opportunity to trade Global Depositary Receipts in Huatai.
Hammond, launching Stock Connect's first day of trading at the LSE, is expected to say: ""London is a global financial center like no other, and today's launch is a strong vote of confidence in the UK market.""
""Stock Connect is a ground-breaking initiative, which will deepen our global connectivity as we look outwards to new opportunities in Asia,"" he will say, according to extracts from his comments provided by finance ministry.

408,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2019 05:19PM ET</span>","Boeing crisis, trade tensions cast pall over air show","By Eric M. Johnson, Andrea Shalal and Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Safety concerns, trade wars and growing security tensions in the Gulf are dampening spirits at the world's largest planemakers as they arrive at this week's Paris Airshow with little to celebrate despite bulging order books.
The aerospace industry's marquee event is a chance to take the pulse of the $150-billion-a-year commercial aircraft industry, which many analysts believe is entering a slowdown due to global pressures from trade tensions to flagging economies, highlighted by a profit warning from Lufthansa late on Sunday.
Humbled by the grounding of its 737 MAX in the wake of two fatal crashes, U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) will be looking to reassure customers and suppliers about the plane's future and allay criticism of its handling of the months-long crisis.
""This is a defining moment for Boeing. It's given us pause. We are very reflective and we're going to learn,"" Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged on Sunday.
The grounding of the latest version of the world's most-sold jet over safety concerns has rattled suppliers and fazed rival Airbus, which is avoiding the traditional baiting of Boeing while remaining distracted by its own corruption probe.
Aerospace executives on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned about the impact of the crisis on public confidence in air travel and the risk of a backlash that could drive a wedge between regulators and undermine the plane certification system.
Airlines that rushed to buy the fuel-efficient MAX are taking a hit to profits since having to cancel thousands of flights following the worldwide grounding in March. 
Even the planned launch of a new longer-range version of the successful A320neo jet family from Airbus, the A321XLR, is unlikely to dispel the industry's uncertainty, analysts said.
The planemaker is hoping to launch the plane with up to 200 orders with the support of at least one major U.S. buyer such as American Airlines but faces a last-minute scramble to win deals.
""Boeing's MAX crisis isn't the most ominous dark cloud, since it can be solved, but traffic numbers are genuinely scary,"" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. 
""If March and April are a sign of things to come, we're looking at broader industry demand and capacity problems.""
""Net orders might be the lowest in years,"" Aboulafia added.
Others dismiss fears of a downturn, citing the growth of the middle class in Asia and the need for airlines to buy new planes to meet environmental targets.
""The only solution that the industry has is the newest most fuel-efficient aircraft,"" John Plueger, Chief Executive of Air Lease Corp, told Reuters. ""So that replacement cycle is going to continue.""
""We're talking to so many airlines who still want more aircraft, and there's really been no lessening of those discussions,"" he said.
GULF TENSIONS
Boeing is delaying decisions on the launch of a possible new aircraft, the mid-sized NMA, to give full attention to the 737 MAX and last-minute engine trouble on the forthcoming 777X, industry sources said. 
But it could unveil a number of deals favoring widebody jets where it has the upper hand against Airbus, including at least a dozen 787 aircraft for Korean Air Lines and some demand for 777 freighters. Airbus is meanwhile set to confirm an order for A330neo jets from Virgin Atlantic.
""We'll have some orders flow. We anticipate some widebody orders that you'll be hearing about through the week. But that's not our focus for the show,"" Muilenburg told reporters.
Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners expects roughly 800 aircraft orders at the show, but noted it can be hard to tell which are truly new, firm business or old orders, or switched models. That compares with some 959 orders and commitments at the Farnborough Airshow last year. 
Some analysts pegged the likely total closer to 400.
Although slowing, a multi-year boom in airline orders is still trickling down to suppliers such as engine makers. French-American CFM International is set to announce a record order by units for over 600 engines from India's IndiGo.
The June 17-23 show is not only about jetliner deals, but also a magnet for many of the world's arms buyers who come to preview the latest military equipment, from anti-aircraft missiles to hotly sought cyber war-fighting capabilities.
French President Emmanuel Macron will open the show by unveiling a mock-up of a proposed new fighter as France and Germany sign a deal for its development.
Industry insiders will also weigh the merits and potential fallout of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Corp's planned $121 billion tie-up with defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co.
The deal would potentially upend the aerospace sector, creating a conglomerate spanning commercial aviation and defense and putting pressure on major suppliers such as Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE).
Air show delegates are also watching a face-off between the United States and Iran in the Gulf. The United States blames Iran for attacks on two oil tankers in a vital shipping route that have raised fears of broader confrontation in the region.
In another political row with implications for arms firms attending the show, the United States has threatened to cancel Turkey's participation in the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet program over Ankara's purchase of a Russian radar system.

Watching the show attentively is China, whose own aerospace ambitions are growing at a time when U.S.-China trade tensions are rising ahead of a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this month.

The bad bank would house or sell assets valued at up to 50 billion euros ($56.06 billion)- after adjusting for risk - and comprise mainly long-dated derivatives, the FT reported, citing four people briefed on the plan.
With the creation of the bad bank, Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing is shifting the German lender away from investment banking and focusing on transaction banking and private wealth management, the newspaper said.
As part of the restructuring, the lender's equity and rates trading units outside continental Europe will be shrunk or closed entirely, the report said.
The bank is planning cuts at its U.S. equities business, including prime brokerage and equity derivatives, to win over shareholders unhappy about its performance, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in May.
""As we said at the AGM on May 23, Deutsche Bank is working on measures to accelerate its transformation so as to improve its sustainable profitability. We will update all stakeholders if and when required,"" Deutsche Bank said in an emailed statement on Sunday in response to the FT report.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2019 01:02PM ET</span>",Boeing says will take time to win back confidence,"By Eric M. Johnson
PARIS (Reuters) - The head of Boeing (NYSE:BA) said on Sunday the U.S. planemaker had made a mistake in implementing a faulty cockpit warning system on the 737 MAX and predicted it would take time to rebuild the confidence of customers in the wake of two fatal crashes.
Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said Boeing failed to communicate ""crisply"" with regulators and customers, but defended the broad engineering and design approach to nose-down control software at the center of probes into the accidents that led to the plane's worldwide grounding.
Muilenburg acknowledged the company made a mistake in failing to disclose a defective cockpit warning light on its 737 MAX to regulators and customers, and said that failure has been part of reviews by global regulators. 
Muilenburg, who has been under fire over the MAX design and Boeing's handling of the crisis, said ""we are seeing over time more and more convergence among the regulators"" on when the MAX should return to service. 
He said he expected the MAX to return to service this year and that 90% of customers had participated in simulator sessions with its upgraded MCAS software as the company works toward a certification flight with regulators soon.
Boeing says it followed long-standing engineering procedures when designing the 737 MAX. Asked how the procedures failed to capture apparent flaws in MCAS control software and sensor architecture, Muilenburg said: ""Clearly, we can make improvements, and we understand that and we will make those improvements.""
He added: ""When I make comments about the previous MCAS design and how we followed those processes, that's something we put a lot of thought and depth of analysis into. That doesn't mean that it can't be improved.""
Muilenburg's comments on the eve of the Paris Airshow highlight efforts by Boeing to strike a different tone than it did in the days after the Lion Air crash in October, when it raised questions over pilot and maintenance issues.
Muilenburg said the U.S. planemaker expected to announce some orders at the show for wider-body jets, but that its main focus at this year's industry gathering was safety. 
He forecast a $8.7 trillion marketplace for Boeing's products and services over 10 years, up from the $8.1 trillion it projected last year, and predicted the world would need 44,000 commercial jets over the next 20 years, up from the 43,000 Boeing forecast in last year's estimate.
He stuck to a previous timeline for the all-new 777X twin-aisle jet, which Boeing aims to fly later this year and deliver to airlines in 2020. 
He said a possible new jet dubbed NMA had fallen behind the MAX's return to service as a priority, but that the timeline on decisions and entry to service remained unchanged.
He took aim at European rival Airbus's planned new extended-range A321XLR, saying the aircraft would only ""scratch an edge"" of the market segment targeted by the NMA, which would replace Boeing's 757s and 767s.
Whether or not Boeing moves forward with the new mid-sized plane to serve a niche market falling between narrow- and wide-body aircraft is expected to reshape competition with Airbus, which dominates the top end of the medium-haul sector. 

Asked whether he had been interviewed or submitted evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice in the wake of the 737 crashes, Muilenburg said, ""We are fully supporting any government inquiries and providing information.""

413,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2019 07:45AM ET</span>",Chinese regulators will restructure Baoshang Bank as soon as possible,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese government's takeover of Baoshang Bank has caused some pain but prevented bigger financial and social instability, and regulators will restructure the lender as soon as possible, a newspaper affiliated to China's central bank said on Sunday. 
Chinese regulators had completed debt repayment and transfer for Baoshang bank's big institutional and interbank clients as of June 7, and will move on to verify and evaluate the lender's assets ahead of the restructuring, according to the Financial News article, published on the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) website. 
Chinese financial regulators took control of Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang Bank on May 24 due to ""serious"" credit risks, rattling domestic markets and prompting PBOC to inject cash into the banking system.
The article said that since the takeover, individual savings have been stable, and there has been no bank run, showing depositors are supportive of the takeover measures. In addition, 99.98% of Baoshang Bank's institutional creditors were fully repaid.
Although a very small portion of the lender's clients didn't get 100% guarantee of their principals, it's a lesson to those who have been aggressively buying high-yielding investment products with little risk control, according to the article. 
There has been ""a little bit of pain,"" but if regulators turn a blind eye to moral hazards, ""potential financial risks will get bigger and bigger, and morph into systemic risks,"" it said. 
Baoshang Bank is operating normally, and is witnessing less-than-expected net asset outflows, according to the article. The next step would be to carry out market-oriented restructuring to turn Baoshang Bank into a fully healthy and stable lender, it said. 
Since the takeover of Baoshang Bank, regulators have taken a series of measures to ease liquidity stress, and repeatedly said risks at small financial institutions are manageable.

On Friday, sources told Reuters that China's securities watchdog has surveyed Chinese brokerages and fund managers for signs of financing stress.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2019 06:59AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Boeing seeking to reduce scope, duration of some physical tests for new aircraft - sources","By Eric M. Johnson
PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co engineers are reducing the scope and duration of certain costly physical tests used to certify the planemaker's new aircraft, according to industry sources and regulatory officials.
But the strategy could be at risk if regulators and U.S. lawmakers probing two deadly Boeing plane crashes require even more rigorous safety tests before certifying new aircraft as passenger-worthy. 
As Boeing kicks off the year-long flight testing process on its new 777X, its engineers will cut hours off airborne testing by using computer models to simulate flight conditions, and then present the results to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the basis for certification, according to two people with direct knowledge of the strategy.
Reuters could not determine when Boeing decided to move forward with the plan to cut back on physical tests or the extent to which it planned to reduce them for the 777X.
For Boeing's proposed twin-aisle jetliner, known internally as NMA, Boeing's Test & Evaluation group is developing the technology to replace costly and labor intensive physical safety tests used for decades - such as using machines to bend the wings to extreme angles and shaking the fuselage until it cracks - with computer modeling, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, including an FAA official. 
Such work for the NMA is in the conceptual phase, though Boeing's goal is to expand ""certification by analysis"" as ""extensively as they possibly can"" to slash development costs, one of the people told Reuters. Doing so enhances a finely balanced business case for launching NMA, which would be the first aircraft fully developed in the digital age. 
Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman declined to comment on the company's testing strategy for the 777X or the NMA, but said the planemaker was ""looking holistically at our design and certification processes"" following the 737 MAX crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, which together killed 346 people.
""This includes participating in ongoing independent government reviews and establishing a new board committee to review our end-to-end design and certification processes,"" Bergman said. 
When asked whether the FAA would allow Boeing to eliminate an array of physical tests for NMA and 777X, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said the agency ""makes determinations on a case-by-case basis, relying on data and decades of experience in certifying aircraft.""
Current regulations allow planemakers to use physical testing and analysis to demonstrate compliance.
Like the MAX, the NMA and 777X - which Boeing is racing to deliver in 2020 - are centerpieces in Boeing's duel with Airbus SE and will influence how Boeing decides to manufacture and certify an eventual 737 MAX replacement. How quickly and at what cost the new planes are delivered to customers is critical to not just Boeing's bottom line, but also the U.S. Congressional budget.
In February 2018, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg touted the company's ""streamlining certifications"" effort at an industry conference, saying it was ""an item we want to keep on the leading edge.""
While Boeing declined to elaborate on what Muilenburg meant by ""streamlining,"" people familiar with the matter said it includes lobbying for more limited direct FAA oversight and expanding the use of digital analysis over costlier physical testing to show regulatory compliance. 
Like Boeing, Airbus and other manufacturing heavyweights are working to seize technological leaps in computerized engineering methods and tools that bridge the real and virtual world, and improve factory floor efficiency. Airbus declined to comment.
Five people familiar with the matter said Boeing believes that new technology and decades of testing experience have rendered some physical tests redundant for demonstrating safety.
For example, when vibrating a fuselage on an enormous platform to expose weaknesses - known as fatigue testing - the vast majority of the time the tool itself breaks instead of the airframe, according to a person with knowledge of past tests. Such work is costly and has reliably confirmed engineers' expectations, he added.
HURDLES
The strategy to streamline plane certifications faces hurdles in the coming months as the FAA and other global regulators investigate whether Boeing's processes are flawed after the MAX crashes, and as the Chicago-based planemaker seeks to reassure the flying public that its jetliners are safe.
Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the probes may trigger push-back against digital certification, even if there is no evidence it is unsafe.
""A headlong rush right now might not be best from an optics standpoint,"" Aboulafia said. 
The FAA declined to speculate on potential post-probe certification changes, but said it will ""consider any and all recommendations that might help improve the process.""
Boeing's internal review has uncovered nothing that caused it to shift its certification approach, Muilenburg and Boeing CFO Greg Smith told journalists in recent weeks.
Under current regulations, Boeing employees act as the FAA's eyes and ears and complete much of the detailed certification work.
For example, as Boeing works to certify the 777X, engineers were catching glitches using a scaled-down cockpit mockup known internally as 'airplane zero' in a Seattle-area lab as recently as February. But an FAA official with knowledge of the matter said that Boeing has not issued reports directly to external FAA officials as of early this month.
That contrasts with Boeing's original 777 development in the 1990s, when the FAA required Boeing to build a cockpit replica to conduct tests designed to weed out safety risks lurking in the 777 designs, and granular results were reported directly to the FAA for months, the official said.
Despite advances in computing power, some experts argue old-school physical tests are categorically better because they can produce unpredictable results, said one industry certification expert.

""Test has changed for the company from being a place of discovery to being mostly to validate what we thought we knew,"" said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing 737 MAX engineer.

The inquiry was aimed at sending a message that any economic entity in China should abide by the country's laws and regulations, it said in a commentary. 
""China is willing to share the opportunities in its courier market with foreign investors. Undermining Chinese clients' legitimate rights and interests, however, is not acceptable,"" Xinhua said. 
China launched an investigation into FedEx Corp on Friday over parcels delivered to the wrong address, without giving details about the deliveries in question.
The move came after Huawei Technologies Co Ltd complained that the U.S. company had diverted parcels destined for the Chinese tech giant's addresses in Asia to the United States. FedEx said the packages were ""misrouted in error"".

The investigation has fueled concerns that more U.S. companies with operations in China could be caught up in frictions between the two countries, after Washington put Huawei on a blacklist last month citing national security.

Jamaica's Senate in February passed legislation clearing the way for the government to acquire the 49 percent stake in the Petrojam refinery that PDVSA acquired in 2006, part of late leftist President Hugo Chavez's energy diplomacy efforts in the Caribbean.
The board, appointed by Guaido earlier this year in part to defend PDVSA's interests abroad, said it had also warned Jamaica's government that ""it cannot maintain any arrangements"" with the government of President Nicolas Maduro, a Chavez protege whose legitimacy as Venezuela's leader is disputed.
""We formally request the suspension of this expropriation process,"" the board said in a statement, adding that Guaido had made a similar request personally to Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness.
Neither Holness' office nor Jamaica's foreign ministry immediately responded to requests for comment. The Caribbean nation's government owns the other 51 percent of shares in the refinery.
Guaido, the leader of Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate. He has been recognized as rightful leader by dozens of countries, including Jamaica and the United States.
His representatives abroad have fought efforts by creditors of Venezuela's highly-indebted government to seize foreign assets belonging to PDVSA.
But Maduro retains control of the military and most state functions, including PDVSA's day-to-day operations within Venezuela. He calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.
The United States in January slapped sanctions on PDVSA as part of its bid to oust Maduro, which has contributed to a further drop in the OPEC nation's crude output following years of steady decline due to underinvestment and mismanagement. 

Those sanctions paved the way for Guaido's allies to take control of U.S. refiner Citgo, PDVSA's most important overseas asset.

The LEAP engine helped Boeing and European rival Airbus upgrade their most important single-aisle models, leading to the development of the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo, which is also powered by the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan.
CFM officials said ahead of the Paris Airshow that the engine maker had been able to absorb earlier delays in production during the grounding of the 737 MAX. CFM had already closed a gap in engine production for the Airbus A320neo.
While Boeing has cut output of the 737 MAX to 42 aircraft a month from 52 and deferred a planned rate of 57, Airbus continues to produce at 60 with plans to go to 63 in 2021.
Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer said on Friday there was room for higher production. Industry sources say Airbus has been studying future output of around 71 a month to meet demand.
Such a move depends chiefly on the willingness of engine makers to take the risk of stretching already tight supply chains.
""We always want to commit on things we are sure we are going to accomplish,"" CFM Chief Executive Gael Meheust told reporters.

""We would be very uncomfortable in committing to something that we are not completely sure of, and right now we are not sure that the supply chain is capable of doing more than it is doing today.""

421,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 15, 2019 04:14AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Inflation, Stocks Prices Seen Slipping
Inflation will ebb and job prospects will improve, but stock prices aren’t likely to follow, according to a recent regional Federal Reserve survey.
The New York Fed’s May survey of consumer expectations showed that consumers expect inflation to decline in the shorter and longer term.
Over the next year, prices are anticipated to rise 2.5%, down from April’s reading of 2.6%. Over three years the outlook is for inflation of 2.6%, down from 2.7% recorded the month before. Both readings are above the Fed’s inflation target of 2%.
“Median inflation uncertainty -- or the uncertainty expressed regarding future inflation outcomes -- increased at both the one-year and three-year horizon,” the New York Fed said.
Looking to the labor market, the perceived probability of finding a job among those unemployed rose to 61.5% in May from 59.3% in April. That’s the highest level since June 2013.
Those with household incomes of more than $50,000 were the most optimistic of gaining new employment.
The percentage of those who expect stock prices to be higher 12 months from now ticked down to 40.8% from 41%.
2. Gold (and Recession Talk) Back in Fashion
Gold, Gold, Gold. The yellow metal has returned to the list of fashionable investments, rounding off the week with its highest close since May last year, as Wall Street sounds the alarm on a possible Trump-spurred recession.
DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said he is ""certainly long gold"" as he predicted a 40% to 50% chance of a U.S. recession within the next six months and a 65% chance of that happening in the next 12 months, in a webcast to clients late Thursday.
The smart money backs Gundlach's bullish call on the precious metal as gold funds, typically bought during times of uncertainty, saw the largest inflow in more than two years last week, data from EPFR showed. S&P 500 funds, meanwhile, saw outflows of $10.3 billion last week.
Gundlach highlighted outgoing trade tensions as one of the reasons for his ominous outlook on the U.S. economy.
And he's not alone.
JPMorgan’s chief quant strategist Marko Kolanovic warned earlier this week that President Donald Trump’s trade battles have cost U.S. companies trillions and could trigger a slump that would likely be dubbed the ""Trump recession.""
Echoes of a looming recession grew louder as the week progressed, with Morgan Stanley joining in. The bank warned that its Business Conditions Index fell by the most on record in June to a level of 13, nearing levels not seen since the slump of 2008.
Against the backdrop of souring sentiment on growth, investors have raised bets that the Fed will swoop in to save the day. This, too, will keep gold in vogue, according to Ross Norman, chief executive at bullion dealer Sharps Pixley.
Investors are getting ahead of the curve by buying gold in expectation that the Fed will have to reverse its previous tightening policy, by extension pressuring the dollar and lifting gold, Norman added.
3. Oil Output at Record Highs and Expected to Slow Too? Ask the EIA
It's the keeper of all energy statistics in the United States and the market's final arbiter of supply-demand for U.S. oil and gas. Yet some of the Energy Information Administration's recent data and estimates have resulted in more than a few disbelieving traders and analysts .
In its monthly Short-term Energy Outlook issued June 11, the EIA forecasts in a table that 2019 domestic crude production will be at 12.32 million barrels per day, down 1% from its May estimate.
But in the preface of the same document, the agency said it expects production to continue setting new record highs in 2019 and 2020, culminating with an average of 13.5 million bpd by end of 2020.
“Either U.S. oil producers are producing a lot more oil than they say they are, or imports and exports in the reports are being miscounted,” said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago, who’s typically bullish on oil.
It hasn’t been an easy time for oil bulls, who’ve seen the lofty 40% annual gain in crude at April’s highs slashed to around 15%, partly because upward adjustments made by the EIA to its weekly dataset on oil. For the week to June 7, it estimated a record high production of 12.4 million bpd. It also cited a 2-million-barrel build at the Cushing, Okla. storage hub for U.S. crude -- considered unseasonable for this time of year.
“We still believe that we should see draws even with the increasing supply at Cushing,” Flynn said. “The only thing we have to fear is the EIA adjustments itself.”"
422,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2019 04:02AM ET</span>",Nissan considers giving Renault some seats on oversight committees - source,"By Maki Shiraki and Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is considering giving its alliance partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) some seats on planned oversight committees after the French automaker expressed discontent with the envisioned governance reform, a source said.
The two-decade-old partnership of Nissan and Renault was plunged into a crisis earlier this week, as the French automaker's demand for a greater say in Nissan's new governance system drew rare public censure by the Japanese firm.
Renault, which owns 43.4% of the Japanese firm, signaled it would block Nissan from formally adopting an overhauled governance structure at a June 25 shareholder meeting - unless Renault received representation on new Nissan committees.
Nissan is now considering having Renault executives as members of the nomination, audit and compensation committees, a person with direct knowledge said.
""Nissan will have to make concessions for our governance reform,"" this person said. ""Whether two or three seats, we still don't know how many committees we will be giving to Renault, but we are in talks with Renault to give some seats to someone recommended by Renault.""
Jean-Dominique Senard, Renault's chairman, said earlier in the week that he was confident of reaching an agreement with Nissan on the composition of the Japanese company's main board committees. He said he would support Nissan's governance reform if the Japanese firm allowed Renault's two representatives on Nissan's board to be part of its powerful committees.
Nissan had offered to let only Senard to sit on the committees but Renault is insisting its chief executive Thierry Bollore also have a role.
A second source familiar with Nissan's thinking said that there is no agreement yet on Renault's recommendations and the two companies are still negotiating.
""There is still a gap ... both sides need to make concessions. The question is whether they can narrow (the gap),"" this person said.
In a related development, the source with direct knowledge said that Nissan has recommended Yasushi Kimura, adviser to leading fuel distributor JXTG Holdings Inc, to become the chairman of Nissan's board of directors.

Kimura will have to be approved to become an external director at the shareholder meeting slated for June 25. His official appointment as chairman of the board will be decided at the board meeting after the shareholder meeting.

The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted American Airlines, the world's largest airline by passenger traffic, a temporary restraining order against the airline's two mechanics unions demanding the workers stop interfering in American's operations. 
The restraining order followed a lawsuit and preliminary injunction order that American filed against the unions three weeks ago. 
The unions have ""dramatically expanded their illegal slowdown activities and are creating an operational crisis causing significant damage to American, the traveling public and American's employees,"" the company said in its request for the restraining order.
The District Court ordered the two unions, the Transport Workers Union of America and the International Association of Machinists, to issue a notice to their workers to no longer continue activities such as refusing to work overtime, slowing their job performance or other activities that would negatively affect American's operations, according to the court filing on Friday.
American alleged in the lawsuit filed in May that the unions are directing the slowdown to strengthen their position in labor talks that began in 2015. 
The unions have complained that American is trying to outsource more maintenance jobs, a move American has indicated is necessary to cover increased wages.

The slowdown has resulted in 722 flight cancellations since the company filed the lawsuit, the airline said, adding that the number of affected passengers has increased to 11,000 per day since June 7.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (Reuters) - Workers at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's assembly plant in the state of Tennessee narrowly voted against union representation, dealing a fresh blow to the United Auto Workers' (UAW) efforts to unionize a foreign automaker's plant in the U.S. South.
The German automaker and the UAW said on Friday that workers at the Chattanooga plant voted 833 to 776 against union representation, the second time in five years they have rejected collective bargaining. 
""Our employees have spoken,"" Frank Fischer, president of Volkswagen Chattanooga, said in a statement. ""Pending certification of the results... Volkswagen will respect the decision of the majority."" 
Speaking to reporters in Chattanooga, UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg claimed that Volkswagen had engaged in ""threats"" and ""intimidation"" that had affected the outcome of the vote.
""The company kept playing a lot of games and we are not going to abandon the workers who supported a union,"" he said.
Rothenberg said it was too early to tell whether the UAW would appeal the election results, or whether the union would support another vote at the plant.
The fresh defeat comes at a pivotal time for the UAW, which has been struggling to move beyond a federal corruption probe and faces contentious contract talks this year with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
The loss also raises renewed questions about whether the UAW can gain a toehold in the U.S. South and organize workers at a foreign automaker. 
The union's membership peaked at 1.5 million in 1979 and despite gains this decade, it fell to below 400,000 last year. 
The UAW narrowly failed to organize VW's Chattanooga plant in 2014. The vote this week was closer than the one five years ago, which was 712 against to 626 for unionization.
In 2017, workers at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd plant in Canton, Mississippi, voted nearly two to one against union representation. 
Ahead of the vote, prominent Republican elected officials in Tennessee, including U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, had argued publicly against unionization at the Chattanooga plant. 
Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California-Berkeley, said without ""heavy political pressure"" from those officials, the union could possibly have won.
""The UAW will absolutely have to try again in Chattanooga,"" Shaiken said. ""The vote was too close not to.""

425,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 10:08PM ET</span>",All eyes on Fed as stock market pines for rate cut,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week is shaping up as a pivotal one for Wall Street, with stocks primed for a selloff should the Fed fail to take an even more dovish tilt after policymakers raised expectations for a rate cut in recent weeks. 
The benchmark S&P 500 has rallied more than 5% this month as softening economic data coupled with comments by Fed officials heightened expectations the Fed will cut rates by the end of the year and, at the very least, telegraph it is leaning toward a later rate cut at its June 18-19 meeting. 
Those gains came on the heels of a selloff in May of nearly 7% in the S&P, largely fueled by investor concerns that trade wars were escalating, slowing the economy and putting it at risk of falling into a recession. 
Bets for a rate cut were amplified by comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on June 4, who said the central bank will respond ""as appropriate"" to the risks from a global trade war and other developments, and after a weak May payrolls report on June 7. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) Chief Economist Michelle Meyer expects the Fed's ""dot plots"" projection of interest rates, which represents the anonymous, individual rate projections of Fed policymakers for the next few years, to shift lower as officials start to factor in cuts. However, ""the median dot will signal a Fed on hold,"" Meyer said in a note. 
""The market has somehow convinced themselves that we are in an easing cycle. I am not sure how we got so far ahead of ourselves,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. 
""So now you’ve got Powell is kind of painted into a corner that he is really going to have to navigate carefully because you have market expectations that he said he would do whatever is appropriate."" 
In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Jan Hatzius said one of the themes from recent Fed commentary is that there is a wide range of views from central bank officials, although most ""indicated trade policy increased downside risks by increasing uncertainty"" and the result of ongoing trade negotiations was highly uncertain. 
Many investors had been looking toward the Group of 20 summit later this month for more definitive signs of the direction of trade talks between the United States and China, giving the Fed a clearer picture on whether to take action on rates at the July meeting. According to CME's FedWatch tool, money market traders are pricing in an 88.4% chance of a rate cut of at least a quarter of a percentage point in July.
Any clarity from the G20 may be hard to come by, however. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday ""it doesn't matter"" if Chinese leader Xi Jinping attends the Group of 20 summit later this month, predicting a trade deal with Beijing would occur at some point anyway.
""They've put themselves in a position where they have optionality in both directions so they can respond,"" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies in New York said of the Fed. 
Economic data this week was a mixed bag, with retail sales topping expectations and halting a tide of weak indicators, including the payrolls report and readings on inflation in the form of May consumer and producer prices with implications for core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's favorite inflation measure. 
""There were some important prints that confirmed some of the Fed’s fears – we didn’t get PCE but in PPI and CPI, you are not seeing inflation pressure bleeding through,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 
Still, a cut at the June meeting has not been ruled out either, with the probability of a quarter point cut put at 24.2%, according to FedWatch. Asset manager Vanguard believes the Fed could implement an ""insurance cut"" as early as next week, according to the firm’s global chief economist Joe Davis.
And it's no surprise investors are willing to cheer a rate cut. According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, of the past 16 rate cut cycles going back to 1946, the S&P 500 has climbed an average of 10.3% in the six months after the first rate cut and 14.1% in the 12 months after. 
However, cuts didn't always precede a market boom, with declines coming five times in the six months following a new rate cut cycle, including the most recent ones in 2007 and 2001. 
And to some, any hope for a rate cut is misguided given the current economic and market environment. 
""You have first quarter GDP at 3.1%, you have almost record low unemployment and a stock market clamoring for a rate cut near all-time highs, it is basically ludicrous,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Brazil won a case against Indonesia at the WTO in 2017, but the South American country argues that the WTO decision was never implemented by Indonesia, which continues to block any chicken imports from Brazilian companies.
Brazil is not allowed to export poultry to Indonesia because it lacks an international sanitary certification that needs to be issued by the Islamic country's government.
In a statement, the Agriculture Ministry said a team of inspectors from Indonesia visited meat processing plants in Brazil last year, but has yet to release any documentation on the inspections. 
""WTO rules say a country can not delay indefinitely the issuance of the sanitary authorization,"" the ministry said, adding that the Indonesian government has never identified any reason for not doing so. 

Brazil, the world's largest poultry exporter, said its request for a panel will be evaluated by WTO's Dispute Settlement Body in a meeting scheduled for June 24.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian retail veteran Michael Klein and his family on Friday gained control of appliance retailer Via Varejo SA from retailer GPA SA in an auction, spending less than initially expected.
In a statement, Klein said he acquired a 1.6% stake in Via Varejo in an auction on the Sao Paulo stock exchange on Friday. GPA, which has wanted to exit the investment, sold its full 36% for 4.90 reais per share, raising a total of 2.3 billion reais ($590 million).
Klein, who was expected by market watchers to spend up to 500 million reais in the auction, spent only 101 million reais ($26 million). When combined with its previous stake of 25.4% in Via Varejo, the Klein family will own 27% and become the retailer's largest shareholder. 
The rest of GPA's stake was acquired by financial investors, mainly mutual funds, advised by XP Investments.
“It's a big challenge ahead, but we will push for better outcomes as our family has always done,"" Klein said in a statement. 
The family has been a significant shareholder in Via Varejo since 2009, when the Kleins sold appliance retailer Casas Bahia to GPA. Klein's father, Samuel Klein, founded Casas Bahia in the 1950s. 
The sale ends a two-year struggle by GPA, controlled by France's Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, to sell the appliance retailer. 
Shares rose to 4.97 reais at closing on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, higher than the auction price but down 1.4% from Thursday's closing.
Two sources with knowledge of the matter said Klein intends to appoint Roberto Fulcherberger as Via Varejo's chief executive officer and Marcel Cecci as chief financial officer. Both asked for anonymity because the matter was private.

The hearings beginning Monday will end on June 25, the USTR said in a statement on Friday. That timeline means Trump would not be able to trigger the fresh wave of tariffs until after July 2, when a seven-day final rebuttal comment period ends.
U.S.-China relations have deteriorated since Trump accused Beijing in early May of reneging on commitments to change its ways of doing business with the rest of the world.
Since then, Trump raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods and ordered his trade representative to prepare tariffs on another $300 billion, effectively covering almost all Chinese exports to the United States.
Trump has said he wants to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during June 28-29 G20 leaders summit in Japan, but neither government has confirmed a meeting. 
The proposed tariffs on another $300 billion are a further ""response to China’s unfair trade practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation,"" USTR said in its statement Friday.
The tariffs will hit consumer goods hard, including cellphones, laptop computers, toys, video game consoles, television sets, clothing and footwear.

The list of more than 300 scheduled witnesses includes representatives from retailer Best Buy, toy maker  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) vacuum cleaner maker iRobot, faucet maker Moen and other firms and trade groups in a diverse range of industries.

(Reuters) - Perdue Foods, one of America's largest chicken producers, said it will sell frozen chicken nuggets mixed with cauliflower, chickpeas and plant protein to address a growing demand for products combining meat and vegetables. 
A company executive on Friday said more blended products were in the pipeline, with Perdue aiming for its vegetable-enhanced items to become a $100 million segment within five years, making up around 5% of the company's overall business.
""Consumers have told us the vegetarian lifestyle is too hard, but they're looking for ways to introduce more vegetables into their diet,"" Eric Christianson, Perdue's chief marketing officer, said in an interview on Friday.
The new product could also help parents trick finicky children into eating healthier. They are ""like Trojan horses made of vegetables making it onto kids' plates and into their stomachs,"" Christianson said.
There has been a growing appetite for plant-based foods from both consumers and investors, with shares of vegan burger company Beyond Meat more than tripling since the company went public on May 2. Beyond Meat shares closed at $151.48 on Friday, taking the market value of the California upstart that has yet to make a profit to more than $8.5 billion.
Analysts expect the plant-based meat market to be worth $100 billion by 2035 as consumers seek to reduce meat consumption amid growing concerns over health risks and environmental hazards of industrial animal farming.
Perdue Foods, part of family-owned Perdue Farms, is not the only meat processor vying for health-conscious consumers as firms compete for precious supermarket real estate space.
U.S. meat processing giant  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) on Thursday announced it will begin selling mixed-protein products, including sausages and meatballs that combine chicken with plants including chickpeas, black beans and quinoa.
Canadian packaged meat producer Maple Leaf Foods Inc's vegan ""ground beef"" and burger patties, sold under its LightLife brand, will be on U.S. store shelves this summer.
Nestle, the world's biggest packaged foods group, is aiming to sell a pea-based veggie patty called Awesome Burger under its U.S. plant-based Sweet Earth brand in the fall.
""This is just the first wave and over time we expect our products to show up in a lot of different grocery store aisles,"" Christianson said.
Perdue is also developing ground meat products mixed with vegetables and experimenting with different plant proteins. The company was still evaluating whether to offer wholly plant-based products down the line, Christianson said.
Perdue's frozen products will ship to restaurants this summer and be available at retailers by September. Christianson declined to provide details on partnerships, but said the nuggets would appear on kids' menus at fast food chains and at school lunch programs.
Some analysts have questioned the strategy of mixing meat with vegetables to attract health-conscious consumers.

""We're less confident in blended meat/plant products as we believe in the early stages of alternative meat, consumers want to make a simple binary decision between eating meat or not,"" analysts at Mizuho Securities USA said in a note.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 06:01PM ET</span>","U.S. Justice Department set to decide on T-Mobile, Sprint merger as soon as next week: source","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is set to decide as early as next week whether to approve the $26.5-billion merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile USA and Sprint Corp, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday.
Earlier this week, Dish Network Corp executives met with the Justice Department's antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai as part of the government's review of the deal, which could dramatically reshape the U.S. wireless market.
A federal filing Friday revealed Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen was among the executives who attended the meeting Tuesday, and the firm ""discussed its opposition to the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile as currently constructed.""
Dish ""explained the need for a minimum of four nationwide mobile network operators,"" according to the filing, and also discussed ""the impact of the proposed merger on Dish’s market entry and its wireless buildout plans.""
Pai agreed last month to support the merger of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers, in part because the firms agreed to divest the prepaid service Boost Mobile.
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), T-Mobile and Sprint control more than 98% of the U.S. wireless market and have wireless service revenues of more than $160 billion. T-Mobile and Sprint combined have more than 135 million customers, while Verizon and AT&T control two-thirds of the total U.S. wireless market. 
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican like Pai, has said he backs the merger while a third commissioner, Mike O'Rielly, said he is inclined to support the deal.
The Justice Department wants the companies to sell off additional assets including some wireless spectrum to create a new wireless competitor before agreeing to approve the deal, the person briefed on the matter said.
Though a decision could be reached next week, the person cautioned that it may be delayed.
Justice Department and FCC spokesmen declined to comment, as did Sprint and T-Mobile.
Both the FCC and Justice Department want to create a fourth wireless competitor and Dish, Altice USA Inc and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) are potential acquirers of Boost and potentially some spectrum, the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
Ten state attorneys general led by New York and California have sued the companies and parent firms SoftBank Group Corp and Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), warning that consumer prices will jump due to reduced competition.

A status conference in the states' case is set for June 21, but they have yet to seek a court order temporarily blocking the merger.

(Reuters) - U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies Inc is exploring a sale of its space robotics business, which could fetch more than $1 billion and allow it to pay down some of its debt, according to people familiar with the matter.
The sale of the business, dubbed MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA), would help address concerns about Maxar's $3.2 billion debt pile. Its WorldView-4 satellite failed in January, causing shares to slide. 
MDA, which has helped construct part of the International Space Station, has about C$170 million ($127 million) in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the people said, asking for anonymity because the matter is confidential. 
""As a matter of company policy, Maxar does not comment on market rumors or speculation. As we have previously stated, the company is focused on strengthening our operational and financial performance, developing a strategy to drive long-term revenue, profit, and cash flow growth, and is assessing a variety of options to reduce leverage to achieve a more optimal capital structure for the company,"" Maxar said.
Maxar shares ended trading on Friday up 9.1 percent at $6.72 following the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $400 million. Headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, Maxar specializes in satellites for Earth imagery, geospatial data and analytics. 
MDA makes defense and maritime systems, radar geospatial imagery, space robotics, satellite antennas, and communication subsystems. 
Maxar acquired U.S.-based satellite imagery provider DigitalGlobe Inc for about C$3.1 billion in 2017, in a bid to boost its business supplying high-resolution images to customers such as the U.S. Department of Defense and companies including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. 
That deal was followed by a string of impairment charges, as its satellite business was plagued by cost overruns and supply chain issues.
In January, Maxar named Daniel Jablonsky president and chief executive to succeed Howard Lance ""given the company's performance in 2018 and the loss of over 90% of our value in the marketplace."" Jablonsky was previously president of DigitalGlobe.
Last month, NASA picked Maxar as the first contractor to help build its Gateway platform in lunar orbit, a crucial outpost for America's mission to relay astronauts to the moon in 2024.
Maxar Technologies will develop power, propulsion and communications components for the lunar mobile command and service module, NASA said.

The S&P 500 shedded 0.16%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.52%.
A sea of red washed over chip stocks, forcing the broader tech sector sharply lower, led by a 5.6% slump in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) after the chipmaker missed revenue estimates and cut its guidance amid slowing demand.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC); Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) ended the day more than 1% lower.

""We believe this may prove to be one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company to unlock new engagement and revenue streams,” RBC analysts Mark Mahaney and Zachary Schwartzman said in a note to investors.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, also contributed to the decline in the broader market, shrugging off a rise in oil prices. Still, the sunny end to the week for oil prices did little to a mask a 2% weekly drop.
Equity losses were kept in check, however, by an upward revision to April's retail sales data, prompting analysts to suggest that it was too early to call time on the U.S. growth story.
""With robust growth in May and huge upward revisions to April’s print, consumer spending looks to regain its footing in the second quarter with growth looking to exceed the 3% (annualized) mark,"" TD Economics said.
The upbeat U.S economic data was in sharp contrast to Chinese economic data showing the pace of industrial production slowed to a 17-year low, as manufacturing and production sectors, many of which depend on strong exports, were hurt by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.
With just over two weeks to go until the G20 meeting and little sign the trade war will be resolved sooner rather than later, traders are growing increasingly worried that both countries will escalate tensions.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>",U.S. says $168 million ITT for-profit student loans to be forgiven,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Former students at ITT Technical Institute will not have to pay $168 million they still owe on private loans from an affiliated lender to attend the now-defunct for-profit college, under a U.S. regulatory settlement announced on Friday.
Student CU Connect CUSO, created in 2008 to fund and manage loans for ITT students, reached the settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 44 states and Washington D.C. to resolve claims over its alleged shoddy business practices.
The accord also requires CUSO to stop collecting on loans, and ask consumer reporting agencies to effectively delete its loans from students' credit profiles, and tell borrowers they no longer owe money on the loans.
Court approval is required. CUSO did not admit wrongdoing. Its lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
ITT Educational Services Inc, which ran ITT Technical Institute, closed its roughly 130 campuses and filed for bankruptcy in Sept. 2016, amid growing regulatory scrutiny of for-profit colleges' recruiting and financing practices.
The closure affected an estimated 35,000 students and 8,000 employees. Another large chain, Corinthian Colleges, shut down in 2015.
Authorities said ITT typically targeted vulnerable students by first issuing ""temporary credits"" to cover the gaps between their tuition and other federal aid.
Many students thought the credits were similar to federal loans and would not become due until after they graduated.
But when credits became due sooner, ITT pressured many students into taking out CUSO loans with initial fees as high as 10% and interest rates as high as 16.25%, according to authorities.
By Jan. 2017, CUSO was projecting an overall 94% default rate on its loans, authorities said.
Last November, a federal bankruptcy judge in Indiana approved a separate settlement forgiving nearly $600 million of ITT student debt.

The ministry is leading talks between the administrators managing the loss-making Alitalia and state-owned railway group Ferrovie dello Stato, which is trying to set up a consortium to buy the carrier. 
So far Ferrovie has secured the commitment of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) but it is struggling to find another partner who is willing to invest more than 300 million euros ($336 million) in Alitalia, which has a long history of financial woes.
An involvement of Atlantia could be a turning point in the rescue effort led by Ferrovie, but sources have previously said the plan still lacked a political green light.
Atlantia is in bad terms with the governing coalition, in particular with the 5-Star Movement, after the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge it managed last August.
5-Star head Luigi Di Maio, who is also Italy's industry minister, have blamed Atlantia for poor maintenance of the motorway network, adding the government would revoke the group's motorway concession. Atlantia has always denied wrongdoing.
The ministry on Friday postponed for the fourth time a deadline for Ferrovie to present a binding rescue bid for Alitalia, extending it to July 15.
""The extension is aimed at giving every investor interested the opportunity to come forward ... everyone, including Atlantia,"" one of the sources said.
The second source, a 5-Star top official, confirmed the ministry was open to discussions with any potential suitor.

Atlantia could chip in as a way to mend its relations with the government, sources have told Reuters.

439,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 03:30PM ET</span>","Argentina’s Rally Is ‘Too Far, Too Fast’ After a Blockbuster Week","(Bloomberg) -- For some investors, this week’s spectacular gains in Argentine assets are too good to be true.
The stock market trounced global peers, while the peso, a perennial loser in recent years, was among the world’s biggest gainers. Moreover, the nation’s sovereign bonds had one of their best performances of the past decade.
Assets soared after President Mauricio Macri tapped moderate opposition leader Miguel Pichetto as his running mate, potentially expanding his voter base before October elections, while data showed inflation slowing for a second month. Some investors were unimpressed, warning that the inclusion of a Peronist on Macri’s ticket could scare away supporters and that Pichetto, who represents Rio Negro province on the northern edge of Patagonia, lacks the political pull to win over many undecided voters.
“The rally looks too far, too fast,” said Frances Hudson, a global strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.
On the economic front, it’s far from a given that the trend of decelerating inflation continues, and a report on Wednesday is likely to confirm Argentina’s deep ongoing recession.
Within hours of the Macri-Pichetto announcement, the rival campaign of Alberto Fernandez and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner bolstered its team by aligning with opposition lawmaker Sergio Massa. That’s negative for Argentine bonds because it increases the odds of their ticket receiving 40% of the vote in the first round, according to Ezequiel Zambaglione, head of strategy at Balanz Capital in Buenos Aires. Candidates can win outright by reaching that threshold and beating the runner-up by at least 10 percentage points.
“The recent rally offers a good opportunity to reduce positions in Argentina,” Zambaglione wrote in a note to clients on Friday, recommending local currency bonds over dollar debt.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 03:22PM ET</span>",Bombardier opening new California rail-car assembly site,"By Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier is opening a new facility in California that will assemble rail cars for San Francisco's rapid transit system by year's end, and potentially serve other West Coast rail projects.
The plane and train maker said in a news release that it will use the site for a 775-car contract with the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART).
Rail car work for the San Francisco contract will be transferred to the new site in Pittsburg, California from Bombardier's existing plant in upstate New York, the company said.
Bombardier began renting space at the site this month, and it will be operational by the end of the year, a Bombardier spokesman said. The company is eying other California contracts as its rail division pursues high-single digit growth in North America.
Bombardier said the new facility will help it meet U.S. content requirements. Railmakers awarded federally funded contracts for rolling stock in the United States will be required to complete 70% of the order with American content next year, compared with 60% in 2016, when the requirements were announced by the U.S. Federal Transit Administration (FTA). 
Bombardier declined to disclose the value of the new site. 
Bombardier’s rail division, its largest unit, has faced recent headwinds due to delivery delays and production problems at a handful of long-term projects, forcing the company to cut its first-quarter and full-year revenue targets for the division.
But Bombardier sees opportunities in the United States, rail division president Danny Di Perna told Reuters in May, and the company is eying a series of Los Angeles transit projects to coincide with the 2028 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.
“The Pittsburg site will also enable Bombardier to pursue additional business opportunities in the growing rail transit equipment market on the West Coast and to serve this market with increased effectiveness,"" said Elliot Sander, president of Bombardier Transportation's Americas division, in the statement. 
(This story corrects fourth paragraph to make clear that Bombardier is not renting space from Hitachi.)

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the message was understood by the world's largest aerospace supplier, whose Pratt & Whitney unit supplies engines for the A320neo jet.
Faury told a news conference he had spoken to UTC leaders and would do so again at the Paris Airshow next week.
He said earlier Airbus would take its time to study the plan, adding that he understood that it was aimed at acquiring bigger scale and balancing civil and defense activities. 
The head of Airbus Helicopters said he was cautious on the commercial helicopter market following a lengthy slump.

""I don’t see a major recovery in the commercial helicopter market before two years,"" Bruno Even told the news conference.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>","Trump defends adviser Conway, won't fire her over political comments","By Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he would not fire White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, a day after a federal watchdog accused her of breaking U.S. law by making political statements in her official role and called for her ouster.
""No, I'm not going to fire her. I think she's a terrific person ... She's been loyal,"" Trump told Fox News.
Conway, 52, is a former political pollster and consultant who became Trump's campaign manager in 2016. She was the first woman to have managed a winning U.S. presidential campaign.
Now serving as counselor to the president at the White House, Conway regularly defends Trump and attacks his rivals online and in television interviews, often on the White House grounds.
On Thursday, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) cited Conway's television comments and social media posts as violations of the Hatch Act. The 1939 law bars executive branch employees from engaging in some political activities.
The OSC, which is not connected to the office of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, is headed by Trump appointee, Henry Kerner, and is an independent agency that polices federal workers. One of its main missions is enforcing the Hatch Act.
It said in a statement: ""Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act on numerous occasions by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.""
In recent months, Conway has criticized Democratic candidates Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders on Fox News and CNN.
Trump, who is running for reelection in 2020, stopped short of telling Fox whether he would advise Conway to refrain from further political statements in her White House capacity.
""She's got to have the right of responding to questions. It really sounds to me like a free speech thing,"" the Republican president told the conservative news outlet.
Richard Painter, ethics counsel to former Republican President George W. Bush, rejected Trump's argument, saying Conway could make political statements in a private capacity, but not in her official, taxpayer-funded role. 
""If she wants to go and shill for her favorite candidate ... in her personal capacity on her own front lawn, she's free to do so,"" Painter said. ""But in an official interview on White House property, she doesn't have the right to do that.""
The OSC called Conway a ""repeat offender,"" who ""has shown disregard for the law."" The agency can make recommendations for dismissal, but it does not have the power to enforce them.
The White House rejected the OSC recommendation and demanded its withdrawal, according to a letter released on Thursday.

In one of the more unusual dynamics in Trump's Washington, Conway is married to lawyer George Conway, who regularly criticizes Trump. On Wednesday, George Conway published a Washington Post opinion piece that was highly critical of Trump.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>","Airbus readies A321XLR jetliner launch, sees A330neo sales","PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus sought on Friday to heighten anticipation surrounding a new longer-range version of its A321neo and hinted at new orders for its larger A330neo plane ahead of a Paris Airshow overshadowed by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX.
Sales chief Christian Scherer told a news briefing ahead of the June 17-23 event that the current longest-range A321 variant, the A321LR, had a range of 4,000 nautical miles and added ""hint, hint, hint, maybe soon a little more"".
Airbus has already started pre-marketing the longer-range A321XLR which will allow airlines to offer long trips in narrowbody planes on routes where demand is too slim to justify taking the risk of trying to fill a larger wide-body.
The aim of the plane, whose development was first reported by Reuters, is also to narrow the available market for a possible new middle-market jet that Boeing (NYSE:BA) is contemplating as a replacement for its out-of-production 757 and 767.
Airbus plans to launch the A321XLR with a maximum takeoff weight of 101 tonnes and a range of 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 km) based on some 210 seats, reaching as far as 4,800 miles.
Airbus officials avoided directly attacking arch-rival Boeing at a news conference ahead of the world's largest air show as the U.S. company's competing 737 MAX remains grounded for a third month.
Airbus is said to be concerned that any competition between regulators in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes could disrupt the industry including the global supply chain.
Scherer said the Airbus narrow-body family is 5 percent more efficient per seat than its competitor. Boeing makes similar claims for the 737 MAX 8. Both companies have sold thousands of the upgraded jets which boast fuel savings due to new engines.

The two giants typically make brash marketing claims at air shows but this year's event is expected to be relatively sombre.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 01:57PM ET</span>",Broadcom's $2 billion warning rattles global chip sector,"By Helen Reid and Arjun Panchadar
LONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc sent a shockwave through the global chipmaking industry on Friday with its forecast that U.S.-China trade tensions and the ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies would knock $2 billion off the company's sales this year.
The forecast, included in the company's second-quarter results late on Thursday, was the hardest evidence yet of the damage President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing may do to the global industry.
Shares in Broadcom fell as much as 8.6%, wiping more than $9 billion off the market value of the company, previously based in Asia but now with its headquarters and main listing in the United States.
U.S. chipmakers Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX) were all down between 1.5% and 3%.
The Philadelphia chip index was down nearly 3% with 29 of its 30 components trading lower. Shares of other Huawei suppliers like  Analog Devices  Inc (NASDAQ:ADI), Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions and Qorvo Inc also fell.
European peers including STMicroelectronics, Infineon and AMS ended the day lower.
""We'll see a very sharp impact simply because (there are) no purchases allowed and there's no obvious substitution in place,"" Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a post-earnings call with analysts on the Huawei ban.
Huawei accounted for about $900 million, or 4%, of the company's overall sales last year. Broadcom, however, also said the forecast cut ""extends beyond one particular customer.""
""We're talking about uncertainty in our marketplace, uncertainty because of the - of demand in the form of order reduction as the supply chain out there constricts - compress, so to speak,"" Tan said.
The semiconductor industry has been grappling with slowing demand since the second half of 2018 with bellwether Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) warning in April that a cyclical downturn could last for another two years.
That has related chiefly to signs that mobile phone markets in some major economies are increasingly saturated while mass demand in new areas like self-driving cars and internet of things devices for homes and offices is still developing.
The geopolitical risks from the trade conflict and Huawei ban are an additional shock.
""It's not just Huawei, it's deeper than that. OEMs [carmakers] aren't ordering. Inventory concerns, which were supposed to ease, have not gone away,"" said one European trader. ""Goodbye H2 recovery hopes!""
Broadcom, known for communications chips that power Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS connectivity in smartphones, is also a major supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and shares of the iPhone maker were down 1%.
""We believe Broadcom's 2H19 outlook is not only impacted by the direct Huawei export ban, but also includes the indirect impact from the Huawei export ban to other customers as well as the possible industry-wide impact of the possible additional import tariffs,"" Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said.
The CEO of chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) also said the ban on Huawei brings uncertainty and disturbance to the semiconductor industry. 
Micron will report its third-quarter results on June 25.
""I think you have seen all the companies (Qorvo, Skyworks, Maxlinear, Cree, Inphi, Lumentum, NeoPhotonics) which pre-announced negative for about half their quarter's impact due to this Huawei export ban,"" Chan said.
""The issue now is that there will be a second degree (indirect) impact as well that most companies do not want to talk about. We believe the next wave of companies that should be echoing what Broadcom says are Micron and  Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC),"" Chan added.

448,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 01:44PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Broadcom's Gloomy Outlook Wrecks Chip Stocks,"Investing.com - Broadcom fell sharply Friday, sending chip stocks lower after the company delivered an ominous outlook and reported revenue that fell short of estimates.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell 6.6% to $263 after slipping to a low of $257.47.
The US.-China trade war claimed yet another scalp as Broadcom sounded the alarm on semiconductors, lowering its guidance for the full year to $22.50 billion in revenue from $24.50 billion previously. That missed consensus among analysts for $24.31 billion.
The weaker guidance was accompanied by mixed first-quarter results, with earnings of $5.21 a share topping expectations, but revenue of $5.52 billion falling short.
The company blamed the disappointing quarter on the slowing demand, particularly in China, where its largest clients like Huawei have suffered from U.S. export restrictions.
""We currently see a broad-based slowdown in the demand environment, which we believe is driven by continued geopolitical uncertainties, as well as the effects of export restrictions on one of our largest customers. As a result, our customers are actively reducing their inventory levels and we are taking a conservative stance for the rest of the year,"" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement.
In an ominous sign for the broader chip sector, Broadcom’s biggest business segment, semiconductor solutions, generated revenues of $4.09 billion, missing estimates of $4.18 billion.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC); Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are on track to end the day in the red.
In the lead-up to Broadcom's results, the backdrop for semis has been deteriorating, with many analysts surprised that the chipmaker didn't adjust its outlook sooner.
""Broadcom’s reduced full-year revenue guidance is dismissing the 2H recovery thesis articulated by many semiconductor companies earlier this year - ignoring at the time high and still-rising inventories,"" Baird said."

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Friday, as shares of chipmakers sank on a warning from sector major Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) of a broad weakening in global demand and Chinese data pointed to the worst slowdown in industrial growth in 17 years.
Shares of Broadcom Inc fell 6.53% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast by $2 billion, blaming the U.S.-China trade conflict and export curbs on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also slipped 0.85% and weighed the most on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Broadcom is a major supplier to the iPhone maker.
""This is driven by the lack of agreement with China. Everyone knows that if and when this deal gets done, there is going to be a positive reaction from semiconductors,"" said Kevin Miller, chief investment officer at E-Valuator Funds in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Losses in chip companies, who both source product and sell heavily in China, dragged the benchmark S&P 500 index lower, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbling 2.80%. 
""People are backing off of optimism that a trade deal will get done and it'll probably drag out longer into the year,"" said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.
Earlier in the day, global stocks fell after China's industrial output growth in May slowed below expectations and showed signs of weakening demand.
Technology stocks fell 0.83%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. The trade-sensitive industrials slipped 0.54%, with 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co weighing on the sector. Shares 3M also added to pressure on the Dow. 
At 13:08 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.50 points, or 0.14%, at 26,069.27, the S&P 500 was down 7.34 points, or 0.25%, at 2,884.30 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 42.55 points, or 0.54%, at 7,794.58.
The S&P 500 index has so far gained 4.8% in June and was on track to record a second straight week of gains on hopes the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
A Fed meeting next week may provide the acid test of market expectations that the U.S. central bank could cut rates as much as three times this year, while a G20 summit at the end of the month may yet yield more progress on a trade deal.
In a bright spot, data showed U.S. retail sales increased in May and sales for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that could ease fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter. 
Online pet products retailer Chewy Inc rose 63% in its market debut on Monday, at a valuation of over $14 billion and joined a host of high-profile companies, such as  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc that listed on U.S. stock exchanges this year. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 27 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 64 new lows.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 01:13PM ET</span>",Power producers to appeal bankruptcy court ruling on PG&E energy contracts,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Power producers NextEra Inc , Consolidated Edison Inc (NYSE:ED) and Calpine Corp on Thursday said they will appeal to try to overturn a recent decision by a judge that a federal regulator has no say in whether utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG) may reject its power purchase agreements if it chooses to while in bankruptcy.
PG&E's power purchase agreements are valued at up to $42 billion and the matter of whether the company can walk away from them belongs exclusively in bankruptcy court, Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco said in a June 7 decision.
Montali, who is overseeing PG&E's bankruptcy, rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's argument that it has “concurrent jurisdiction” over the agreements.
The dispute involving the regulator, PG&E and companies from which it buys power has been one the most contentious fights so far in the San Francisco-headquartered utility's bankruptcy, launched in January.
PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection expecting billions of dollars in liabilities stemming from devastating California wildfires in recent years traced to its equipment.
In notices of appeal filed on Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, NextEra, Consolidated Edison and Calpine said they would appeal Montali's decision to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",GE poised for significant power orders in Iraq after U.S. push -sources,"By Alwyn Scott, Ahmed Rasheed and Timothy Gardner
NEW YORK/BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co potentially stands to win a large share of multibillion-dollar contracts to rebuild Iraq's electricity system, reflecting a change in how Iraq intends to award the work after the United States lobbied for GE, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Iraq signed five-year ""roadmap"" agreements with GE and  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) last October under which the country plans to spend about $14 billion on new plants, repairs, power lines and, eventually, equipment to capture for use natural gas that is now being flared off.
In awarding projects to Siemens in April, however, Iraq's prime minister said the German company was well-placed to win the bulk of future deals.
But sources familiar with all three sides of the matter told Reuters that, under U.S. prodding, Iraq is asking both Siemens and GE to bid on contracts and expects to make awards to each of the companies.
""Political pressures on the Iraqi government ... pushed the Abadi government to change plans and allow GE to get on board,"" an Iraqi electricity ministry official with knowledge of GE and Siemens activities in Iraq told Reuters, referring to former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
""It was obvious for us the U.S. government was not happy with Siemens taking over the megadeal alone without any chance for GE,"" the official said. ""Talks are underway to decide about mid- and long-term contracts, which we expect to be divided between them.""
Iraq's electricity ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
A U.S. State Department official confirmed that the U.S. pressed Iraq in GE's behalf. ""Harnessing the innovative capabilities of U.S. companies like GE is an essential component of our strategy to expand economic ties and increase foreign investment to help Iraq rebuild,"" the official said.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Iraq will be awarding contracts in three phases over the next four years.
""It is not one winner takes all,"" said one of the sources. ""It's an ongoing process that you have to work at every level.""
Siemens and GE have supplied generation plants and other electrical equipment to Iraq for decades. Many of these assets need to be refurbished and upgraded after years of war, creating substantial scope for work by both companies.
Since October, GE has signed agreements to upgrade, maintain and rebuild facilities to boost generation capacity by 5,000 megawatts, according to sources familiar with the situation. The Boston-based conglomerate also included as part of the October roadmap two 750 megawatt plants Iraq ordered in 2017, the sources said.
A GE spokesperson said ""Iraq and GE are in productive discussions to strengthen the country's power sector."" Last month, a 125-megawatt GE 9E turbine went online at Iraq's Al Qudus power plant, GE said.
Siemens said it took ""one first major step toward the actual implementation of the roadmap"" when it signed an agreement with Iraq on April 30 that lays out projects, budgets and timelines. The April agreement includes three contracts worth about 700 million euros for a new 500-megawatt power plant, upgrades to 40 gas turbines and new substations.
Iraq is one of the few bright spots in a shrinking global market for fossil-fuel power plants and equipment. The country's peak power needs outstrip its generation capacity by one-third, and the gap is expected to widen as Iraq's economy grows, the International Energy Agency said in April. 

Difficulty working in the war-torn country and the uncertainty about Iraq's funding likely will limit the payoff for the companies, two industry experts said. But new orders are vital for Siemens and GE, which are both cutting capacity in response to a steep drop in orders for large turbines.

Finance leaders from the world's top economies this month adopted new principles to ensure countries that lend and borrow for infrastructure spending do so in a sustainable manner. 
The principles, signed off by the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors, now go to the G20 leaders' summit in Japan on June 28-29.
""We expect to see the major banks in the world, including us, will voluntarily become signatories to these principles because they will bind us to a high level of transparency around our lending,"" Thiam told an alumni forum of INSEAD, a Paris-based graduate business school from which he graduated in 1988.
""And we hope and expect more importantly that this transparency will lead to lower risk premiums for borrowing of emerging economies and also greater investor confidence in countries where they invest.""
He pointed out that around 15 African countries were now technically in a state of debt distress with levels of debt that risk their economic development and political stability.
Credit Suisse has had its own issues with lending to poor countries. It was one of the lenders that helped arrange $2 billion in government-guaranteed loans that tipped Mozambique into a debt crisis from which it is still struggling to recover.
The International Monetary Fund and foreign donors cut off support when the loans were disclosed in 2016, triggering a currency collapse and a default on Mozambique's sovereign debt.
Mozambique in February filed a case in London's High Court against Credit Suisse.
A former Credit Suisse banker pleaded guilty last month to a U.S. charge that she helped launder money from a kickback scheme involving the loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique.

Credit Suisse has said that the defendants hid their contact from the bank.

LONDON (Reuters) - Many of Britain's fast-growing fledgling banks have little experience of downturns and could underestimate potential loan losses if markets turned sour, a Bank of England review of 20 lenders showed.
Britain has encouraged many new lenders to compete in a market dominated by HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), RBS (LON:RBS) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY), known as the Big Four.
Over the past year the central bank has been reviewing the business models and activities of 20 ""fast-growing"" smaller lenders that have balance sheets of at least 750 million pounds ($945.5 million).
Melanie Beaman, a BoE director for UK deposit takers supervision, said in a letter to chief executives of the 20 banks that many of them were ""overly optimistic"" with regard to the potential impact that stressed markets would have on their business.
""This was most apparent in their assumptions about stressed impairment rates that could emerge and their ability to raise capital, dispose of parts of their business or widen their margins in the context of a market-wide stress,"" Beaman said in the letter posted on the central bank's website.
It comes after the BoE's scrutiny of Metro Bank, which last month had to raise 375 million pounds to repair its balance sheet after disclosing in January that it had under-reported risks on its loan book.
Unlike its annual test of leading lenders such as HSBC and Barclays, the Bank has not named the 20 smaller lenders placed under the microscope or any of their individual results in the study.
The lenders, however, showed concentrations in higher-risk market segments that could be more vulnerable, Beaman said.
Many of these banks have ambitious growth plans that expect the additional income from new business to offset higher impairment charges, she added.
""We do not consider it appropriate to assume that significant growth would be available in generally falling markets,"" said Beaman, who works at the BoE's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority.
Some of the fast-growing banks could also be in too much of a hurry, the study said.
""Firms are reminded to be mindful of the speed of decision-making in commercial lending cases and whether this might be compromsing the quality of analysis and robustness of the underwriting process,"" Beaman said.
Some of the banks relied almost entirely on funding from competitively priced short-term, fixed-rate retail deposits, she added.
""You can expect your supervisory team to discuss the points raised in this letter with you as part of our ongoing supervisory engagement,"" Beaman said.

The outlook for the Fed was in focus, with BMO strategists saying the odds of a cut next week are higher than many expect, while DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach said he doesn’t think policy makers will cut interest rates this month.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",Why one U.S. can-maker avoids Trump's tariffs while rivals pay up,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the largest U.S. producers of aerosol cans, Colorado-based Ball Metalpack, has laid off 91 of its 500 U.S. workers since President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imported steel that abruptly hiked the firm's raw materials costs.
At a chief competitor, DS Containers, the story is different. The subsidiary of Japan's Daiwa Can Co has added more than 80 workers over 18 months at its two Illinois plants, bringing employment to 232.
Rivals of the Japanese-owned firm say the reason for its success is simple - it's not paying the tariff, allowing the firm to snatch business from competitors who have been forced to raise prices to cover their higher materials costs. The U.S. Commerce Department granted DS Containers an exemption from the import tax because it uses a raw material, plastic-laminated steel, that isn't produced by U.S. steelmakers.
Firms that use standard tin-plated steel, including Ball Metalpack and Mauser Packaging Solutions, have seen their exemption applications denied or delayed by Commerce after U.S. steelmakers objected to them, arguing the material is available domestically. Executives from the can makers counter that domestic steelmakers can't produce nearly enough tinplate to meet their needs - forcing them to keep importing and paying tariffs.
""Anytime they want to take a customer from us, they can do it,"" said Leslie Bradshaw, an executive vice president at Mauser Packaging, a maker of aerosol and other cans based just 19 miles away from DS Containers in Illinois. ""Their business is growing, and everyone else's is not. We're paying 25 percent tariffs, and they're not.""
The dynamics of the aerosol can industry illustrate the uneven impact of Trump's tariffs on U.S. manufacturers and the unintended consequences of policies that protect one sector or company from foreign competition at the expense of others who are hit with hefty import taxes.
It also underscores domestic steel producers' strong influence over the Trump administration's tariff policies. According to a Reuters review of Commerce Department exclusion requests for tinplate steel, the key factor in an approval or denial is whether they draw objections from U.S. Steel Corp or Arcelor Mittal USA, two major domestic producers of tinplate.
DS Containers Chief Executive Bill Smith dismissed any advantage the tariff exclusion has given his company, arguing that his materials are still more expensive that standard tinplate, even considering the tariff. 
His company has grown, he said, because of the innovative design of its two-piece, round-shouldered can, which can be manufactured more efficiently. He also credited a recent move into aluminum aerosol cans.
""We win on the manufacturing floor, not at the table negotiating steel prices,"" Smith said.
STEEL MAKERS VS. STEEL CONSUMERS
U.S. tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum - a cornerstone of Trump's ""America First"" trade policy - have increased steel prices and spurred investment in metals manufacturing. In March, U.S. Steel Chief Executive David Burritt told lawmakers not to ""blink"" in the face of criticism as the industry begins to recover from a long decline.
The tariffs, imposed in March 2018, initially caused Midwest hot-rolled coil steel futures prices to shoot up to $942 per ton by the end of May 2018. But this week they had fallen back to about $578 a ton, about where they were in October 2017 - but with increased market share and capacity utilization for domestic steelmakers. 
The rising fortunes of the steel industry have produced a modest uptick in employment, reported at 143,700 in March, up about 4,000 from a year ago, according to U.S. Labor Department data.
Steelmakers' employment is dwarfed by that of industries that consume steel and aluminum, which employ about 6.5 million people, according to the Precision Metalforming Association and the National Tooling and Machining Association, two trade groups representing metal processors. 
The Can Manufacturers Institute, a trade group, estimates its industry employment at 22,000 for cans of all types.
When Ball Metalpack's Chief Executive Jim Peterson laid off workers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin, he said: ""We let them all know that apparently their jobs are not as important to our government as U.S. Steel union jobs in Indiana.""
'READY TO SERVE'
In seeking a tariff exemption, Ball Metalpack argued that domestic steelmakers can produce only about half the tinplate needed for aerosol, food and paint cans in the United States.
U.S. Steel contended in its objections that U.S. tinplate mills were operating at only 43 percent of capacity because cheap imports had eroded domestic producers' market share.
""The United States has ample capacity to supply domestic tin mill customers with their needs, and U.S. Steel is ready to serve,"" U.S. Steel spokeswoman Meghan Cox said in a statement.
Cox said the company is pursuing a capital investment program in tinplate operations called ""Can Do,"" aimed at improving product quality and delivery. 
Whatever steelmakers can do in the future, says Peterson, they can't do it now - leaving his business with no choice but to import about half its tinplate from Europe and pay tariffs.
""It will take U.S. Steel years to get where they need to be, but we don't have years,"" Peterson said. ""The business we're losing is happening overnight.""
STEEL INDUSTRY INFLUENCE
Commerce has received tens of thousands of such exemption requests from U.S. manufacturers, and the agency has struggled to keep pace with the volume. It has often rejected requests if there are any objections from domestic metal producers.
""The bias in the Commerce Department’s administration of this has been totally towards the domestic industry"" of metal manufacturers, said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a Washington-based multi-industry group that promotes free trade.
In a statement to Reuters, the Commerce Department said exemptions are generally approved in the absence of objections from domestic providers - as in the case of DS Containers. Tinplate products that do draw objections would only get tariffs waived if the department determines the product is not ""reasonably available"" in a ""satisfactory quality"" from domestic steelmakers.
""The lack of objections would indicate the product is not available from U.S. sources. The DS Container requests received no objections and thus were granted,"" the department said.
Commerce overruled can-makers' arguments that they could not purchase enough tinplate domestically. In one denial of a Ball Metalpack exclusion request, the agency found that the material is ""produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount and of a satisfactory quality.""
Some of the tinplate exclusion requests, including many from Mauser Packaging Solutions, are still pending as the Commerce Department reviews rebuttals and counter-rebuttals.
Bradshaw, the Mauser executive, said the company may not wait around hoping for more favorable tariff treatment. 
It's exploring moving the manufacturing of can tops and bottoms to South America to tap into cheaper foreign steel supplies and import the components to the United States duty-free.

""If we do that,"" he said, ""those jobs are never coming back.""

465,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>","Carrefour sees more retail sector consolidation, including in France","By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - The boss of  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) said on Friday the retail sector was bound to consolidate in the coming years, notably in France, as competition intensifies, and that his mission was to make sure the French retailer came out a winner.
When asked if Carrefour could exit underperforming countries such as Italy or China, Alexandre Bompard told an annual shareholders meeting he was confident his overhaul plan ""could improve the operational situation in each of our countries"".
Carrefour, which is Europe's largest retailer, is in the midst of a five-year plan it launched in January 2018 to cut costs and jobs, boost e-commerce investment and seek a partnership in China with Tencent.
Carrefour's plan, which also entails a greater focus on areas such as fresh local products, organic food and sustainability, is aimed at helping the retailer boost profits and revenues, and tackle competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""There are a lot of competitors in markets like Italy or in France and weak sector margins and we are only at the beginning of the arrival of large platforms like Amazon. There will be difficulties and consolidations in coming years,"" Bompard said.
""My mission is to be in the winners' camp and the transformation we are conducting will put us among winners,""
Last year, Carrefour and French rival Casino were locked in a dispute after Casino said it had rejected a tie-up approach from Carrefour that Carrefour denied making.
Since then, Casino's parent Rallye has filed for protection from creditors.
Meanwhile, French rival Auchan has sold most of its loss-making business in Italy, while it also faces tough market conditions in France.
Last month, people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Carrefour was exploring the sale of a minority stake in its loss-making business in China and had started sounding out potential buyers.
The group has, however, said a sale of the business in China was not on the agenda.

In line with Carrefour's ambition to become a leader in the global transition towards healthier and more sustainable food, its shareholders on Friday approved a new mission statement to include its commitment to the transition in its bylaws.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Business and pleasure - how Russian oil giant Rosneft uses its corporate jets,"(Reuters) - Jets used for corporate travel by Russian state-owned oil major Rosneft flew at least 13 times to Mallorca, Ibiza, Sardinia and the Maldives when CEO Igor Sechin or people from his social circle were in the same vacation spots.
Using publicly available data, Reuters tracked 290 Rosneft flights between January, 2015 and May, 2019. Of those round trips, 96 took place during Russian public holidays or between Friday lunchtime in Moscow and Monday morning.
Since the start of 2015, Rosneft corporate jets traveled eight times to Sardinia's Olbia airport, 15 times to the Maldives and seven times to Spain's Palma de Mallorca, according to the flight tracking data from planefinder.net, flightaware.com, opensky.network.org and flight-data.adsbexchange.com.
Reuters found no public information released by Rosneft or the Russian authorities about official events at those destinations, although the company does not always disclose information about its meetings.
For some of the flights to vacation spots, Sechin's associates, including his wife before their divorce and mutual friends, posted photos on social media placing them at the same location as the Rosneft aircraft at the same time.
    Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and head of the world's largest listed oil company by production, has not appeared in social media posts from the holiday resorts.
But Reuters did photograph a man closely matching his description boarding a Rosneft plane at Palma da Mallorca airport on Aug. 6 last year.
Overall, Reuters found public information from Rosneft or the Russian authorities about official events corresponding to 42 of the 290 flights.
In a statement issued on Friday, after the Reuters article was published, Rosneft said: ""the employment contract of Rosneft Chief Executive I. I. Sechin envisages the provision of transport for him and accompanying members of his family on official visits and holidays.""
Rosneft declined to answer detailed questions about the flights that Reuters submitted prior to publication, saying the news agency was conducting ""information sabotage in the service of the intelligence services of interested states.""
The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions from Reuters on Friday requesting details of Sechin's contract relating to the use of corporate aircraft by him and his family.
Among the questions the company declined to address were whether Sechin's employment contract entitled him to use corporate jets for personal purposes or whether Sechin reimbursed the company for private flights.
In a reply sent in April to previous Reuters questions about the use of corporate aircraft by the friends or family members of Rosneft employees, the company said: ""No private transport of family members was carried out at the expense of the company.""
   A source close to the Rosneft board of directors said no clause in Sechin's contract allowing private flights had been put before the board for approval.
Sechin's use of corporate aircraft for travel to holiday destinations - regardless of whether his contract permits it or not - is part of a pattern of wasteful spending by Rosneft, said Vladimir Milov, Russian deputy energy minister until 2002.
Milov is now a critic of the Kremlin, arguing that Putin's circle is using Russia's natural resources wealth for their own benefit.
He also cited a 2017 order placed by a company subsidiary to buy tableware including caviar dishes and silver spoons with a total value of $83,000.
After Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny disclosed the order on YouTube on May 22, 2017, it was canceled the next day, according to Rosneft's website.
    The office of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the Rosneft flights, saying it was an internal, corporate matter. The Russian government's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. 
    
    SIX FLIGHTS TO MALLORCA IN A YEAR
Between January 2015 and May 2019 Rosneft used a fleet of six business jets registered in Austria and the Isle of Man. They were owned by Rosneft subsidiaries, chartered by Rosneft, used for official Rosneft corporate trips, or in most cases all three.
The photograph Reuters believes is of Sechin shows him boarding a Rosneft-operated Bombardier 6000 aircraft at Palma de Mallorca airport on Aug. 6, 2018. The photograph was taken from a public thoroughfare.
The same jet - with tail number M-YOIL - flew into Palma de Mallorca six times between mid-July and late-August, 2018, according to flight tracking data and photographs taken by Reuters at the airport.
    Over that period, the aircraft was on Mallorca or nearby for 27 days, not including the day of arrival or departure.
    On July 15, the day a Rosneft flight landed in Palma de Mallorca, the Russian pop singer and Sechin family friend Anita Tsoy posted on Instagram that her family's long-awaited vacation had begun.
    On July 19, she posted a photograph on Instagram, tagged as having been taken on Mallorca, of her, her 26-year-old son and her husband, Sergei Tsoy, a senior Rosneft executive. 
    On Aug. 1, the day after the Rosneft jet landed back in Moscow, she posted a photo tagged Moscow. ""The holiday has come to an end,"" she wrote.
    Neither Anita Tsoy nor Sergei Tsoy responded to requests for comment. Rosneft did not respond to questions about the flights to Palma.
    
    CODE OF CONDUCT
    Rosneft's corporate code of conduct, a public document, states that ""we do not use the company's property and assets not for the purposes intended, or to personal ends or with the aim of extracting personal benefit.""
The full cost of the flights is not available, but Reuters found documents showing the costs of running one of the private jets in 2016.
The jet with tail number M-YOIL is operated by a Singapore-registered company called AV Asia Developments Pte Ltd, according to Eurocontrol, an inter-governmental aviation body.
    A 2016 financial report for AV Asia Developments, 100 percent controlled by Rosneft, stated the company received $1.86 million for the charter of the sole jet it operated at the time, and more than $2 million for services related to the same plane.
AV Asia Developments did not respond to a request for comment.
Flight tracking data showed that during 2016, the plane carried out 12 flights totaling around 96 hours in the air. 
When set against the figures in the AV Asia Developments report, that  works out at an hourly cost – a standard industry measure of the cost of private jet services - of about $40,000, or about $19,000 excluding services costs.
A return business class flight from Moscow to the Maldives with Russian carrier Aeroflot, departing June 28 and returning July 4, costs $3,770 according to the Aeroflot booking website. 
""EMERALD COAST"", MALDIVES FLIGHTS
    Sechin's then-wife Olga Sechina spent part of the summer of 2015 at Costa Smeralda in Sardinia, according to her posts on social media tagged with the location, and posts of her friend Olga Tonkikh.
Sechina's first post from there was on June 30, and the last social media record of the vacation was an Aug. 21 post on one of Tonkikh's social media accounts, featuring Sechina.
    Around that period, a Rosneft Bombardier Global 6000 jet with the tail number OE-IRS was recorded three times at Sardinia's Olbia airport: on July 26, Aug. 16 and Sept. 9, according to flight tracking data.
On Aug. 14, the Cala Di Volpe hotel at the Costa Smeralda resort hosted a private concert by British pop singer Robbie Williams (NYSE:WMB), according to the hotel's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts. 
The same day, Olga Tonkikh posted a photograph on Instagram showing both women with hashtags including #robiwilliams. 
    Neither Tonkikh nor Olga Sechina responded to requests for comment. Rosneft did not reply to questions about flights to Sardinia.
    On the night of Dec. 24, 2016, a Rosneft Boeing (NYSE:BA) business jet with tail number OE-IRF took off from Moscow's Vnukovo airport in the direction of the Indian Ocean, flight tracking data showed.    Two days after the flight departed, Tsoy, the pop star, posted a picture of herself on Instagram from inside an aircraft that matches the interior of a Boeing business jet.
    ""And here the long-awaited moment has arrived: VACATION,"" she wrote next to the photo.
    On Jan. 3, 2017 she posted a picture of herself on a golf course that matched publicity photos for Velaa Private Island, an exclusive Maldives resort.
    On Dec. 28, 2016 and Jan. 4, Sechin's then-wife Olga posted photographs on Instagram of herself in a room that matches publicity material of Velaa Private Residence posted on the resort's website. 
    Sechin and his wife divorced in June 2017, according to court documents seen by Reuters.
    There have been Rosneft flights to the Maldives since then.
Flight tracking data showed two Rosneft private jets flying into the international airport in the Maldives on Dec. 28 and out again hours later. The same two planes flew back to the Maldives on Jan 9. and returned to Moscow on Jan. 12.

Reuters saw photographs of the aircraft taken while they were at Velana International Airport in January before they took off for Moscow.
There is no public record of Rosneft executives having any business meetings in the Maldives in the last three years.
Sechin's ex-wife and Anita Tsoy did not respond to questions about their trips to the Maldives.

MONS, Belgium (Reuters) - Belgium's labor laws can apply to Ryanair employees based in the country, a local court ruled on Friday, in a case that could set a precedent elsewhere in Europe and upholds a 2018 agreement reached between the airline and Belgian unions.
A series of strikes in 2018 prompted the Irish airline to agree to apply Belgian law to cabin crew and pilots based in the country. The union and airline finished negotiations, including on salary increases, last month. 
The ruling at the Mons labor court, under which employees can decide whether to be covered by Belgian or Irish labor laws, reinforces the agreement and will prevent the airline from taking disputes to court in Ireland, said Yves Lambot, a representative of the CNE union.
""This is a great union victory for all of Europe,"" he said after the ruling. ""It will allow all workers, be they Belgian or from other European countries, to be able to consult the court they consider the best.""
Ryanair, which had argued that Irish courts had jurisdiction over their Irish contracts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The case was first brought forward in 2011 by six former employees of Ryanair and Crewlink, a recruitment agency for Ryanair, based at Charleroi airport in Belgium. 

The former employees will return to court in February next year to seek compensation for previously not being treated as if covered by Belgian labor laws.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has held meetings with non-bank financial institutions recently to learn about the industry's liquidity and funding conditions, as well as to assess credit default risks, said four sources with knowledge of the situation. 
CSRC was not immediately reachable outside working hours for comment. 
Chinese financial regulators took control of Inner Mongolia-based Baoshang Bank on May 24 due to ""serious"" credit risks, rattling domestic markets and prompting the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to inject cash into the banking system.
Financing has become especially difficult for small banks, as well as brokerages and fund houses, due to demand for higher credit ratings and higher-quality collateral in the interbank lending market.
CSRC has met some institutions that had been aggressive in issuing structured products, which are facing mounting default risks in the current funding environment, one of the sources said.
Another source said it was unclear whether regulators would roll out fresh supportive measures after their surveys.
""Most institutions at the meetings say they are struggling,"" said the source. ""But we don't know the attitude of the regulators, or whether there will be fresh policies or not.""
To soothe market concerns, regulators have taken a series of measures to ease liquidity stress, and repeatedly said risks at small financial institutions are manageable. 
In the latest such measure, the PBOC said on Friday it will boost the quotas for two lending facilities to pump liquidity into the banking system.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers have discussed on Friday a plan for a 0.2% tax on shares, which Germany sees close to be agreed, although further work remains to be done.
Plans for an EU financial transaction tax (FTT) have stumbled over the past years. After an initial proposal in 2011 was blocked by member governments, a group of states pressed ahead, while the majority of the 28 EU states backed down.
Only ten countries, including France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain - are still interested in the common tax. 
In a televised debate Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said a limited deal on a levy could be reached this autumn in order to apply the tax in 2021..
The EU Commission supported his stance, but no other ministers took the floor in the debate on the matter during a meeting attended by representatives of all EU governments. 
""It is hard to say whether a deal is possible this time ,"" an EU official told Reuters.
""There's need for further work. Things seem to be moving in the right direction but we have been there several times before,"" the official added.
The latest tax proposal would apply to purchases of shares in listed companies headquartered in the EU at a rate of 0.2% or more, according to a text prepared by the German government. 
It is less ambitious that the original plan covering derivatives and other financial instruments.
Under the German plan, which is backed by France, the tax would be charged on companies with a market capitalization above 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to avoid hurting smaller businesses. Initial public offerings, market making and intraday trading would also be exempt.
The levy is based on a tax already in place in France.
Discussions continue on how to share the revenue of the tax among those countries considering it. One option is to fund the EU budget, which is used to finance research projects, investments and other economic activities in member states.
""The risk is that the FTT is seen as a tax on liquidity,"" said Jason Piper, Head of Taxation at ACCA, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.
In that case, ""those traders who can will simply move their activities to another jurisdiction, with knock-on impacts on the markets that they've deserted,"" he added. ($1 = 0.8861 euros)

472,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",How an Obama Fed appointee is scuttling Wall Street's bid to ease rules,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a U.S. Federal Reserve governor, Lael Brainard gets only one vote on proposals that come before the central bank's board. Over the past year, she has used it to combat the Trump administration's efforts to ease rules for Wall Street.
Brainard has broken ranks six times with other governors, voting against measures that she says would unnecessarily weaken regulations put in place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. She told Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance last week that she was concerned ""we may be whittling away at that core resilience of our financial system.""
A review of her votes and speeches, and interviews with eight people familiar with the workings of the Fed show that even though Brainard has been the lone dissenting voice, she has wielded outsized influence due to the Fed's long-held practice of arriving at decisions by consensus.
Her resistance is moderating and sometimes slowing the Fed's deregulatory agenda, six regulatory sources and bank lobbyists said.
""She's stood her ground,"" said Sheila Bair, who led the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp during the financial crisis.
The Fed's deliberative approach has prompted public complaints from several Congressional Republicans that the central bank has been dragging its feet. Three Wall Street lobbyists told Reuters they worry the window for major changes will close soon as Washington gears up for the 2020 presidential election.
Brainard, 57, has sat on the Fed board since 2014 when President Barack Obama nominated her for the post through 2026. A moderate Democrat, she was once accused by progressives of being too friendly to corporate interests. 
Her emergence as the moderating voice on bank deregulation underscores how far the pendulum has swung under President Donald Trump. Her actions have global implications: The Fed leads an international group of regulators that oversee global financial stability, and its moves are closely watched by other central banks. 
    The White House declined to comment.
DEREGULATION DIRECTIVE
Last year, Congress rewrote the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, the signature post-crisis banking regulation that left the industry with tens of billions of dollars in compliance costs and lost profits. It directed regulators to ease rules for small lenders.
Much of the Fed's agenda comes from that law and is overseen by Governor Randal Quarles, a former private equity investor appointed by Trump in October 2017.  
    While Brainard agrees with Quarles that some regulation such as the Volcker Rule banning proprietary trading are cumbersome or arbitrary, she fears the Fed is going too far in relaxing rules for the big Wall Street lenders. 
    In particular, she has opposed efforts by Quarles to use the Fed's discretion to extend capital and liquidity relief to the larger banks, according to two sources and a review of her public statements. 
    Quarles' position is supported by Fed chair Jay Powell as well as some academics and banking experts. 
    ""Dodd-Frank never should have been passed in the form that it was. It was largely unnecessary, it was overly cumbersome,"" said Thomas Vartanian, a law professor at George Mason University who was interviewed for the job that Quarles got.
    SPEAKING OUT 
    Brainard's voting record shows she has pushed back against moves to relax rules on capital, liquidity, bank living wills and annual health checks for big banks.
In April 2018, when the Fed board proposed easing a rule restricting bank leverage, Brainard dissented. The proposed change would free up capital for the largest U.S. banks but could also weaken their balance sheets. It is still under discussion 14 months later. 
Before that the last time a Fed governor had voted against a regulatory change was in 2011.
In October, the board also proposed relaxing some capital and liquidity requirements for domestic banks with $250 billion to $700 billion in assets. Brainard voted no. That proposal is still being reviewed by Fed staff. 
    She is also nudging the Fed to finish pending post-crisis tasks, including a rule limiting global banks' credit exposure to any single counterparty.
    Several Wall Street lobby groups said the rule did not take into account other regulations designed to mitigate the risk of counterparty exposure. First proposed in 2016, the rule had fallen down the Fed's agenda but Brainard pushed the board to finalize it last June, two lobbyists said. 
THREAT OF DISSENT
    Major Fed decisions are put to a majority board vote. Some are put to a preliminary vote, opened to public feedback, and then finalized by a second vote. 
The threat of dissent from a governor can drive changes and potentially delay a final vote for months or longer, three regulatory sources said. Final rules that encounter dissent are also more vulnerable to legal challenges.
Brainard also chairs the Fed's financial stability committee and sits on its supervision and regulation committee. That gives her a seat at the table as rule changes are crafted before being presented to the Fed board for a vote.  
While governors often have differing views, the Fed staff strive to reach compromises before a vote, said Nellie Liang who led the Fed's Division of Financial Stability until 2016. 
    This tradition has continued under Powell. He told reporters in March, when asked about Brainard's votes, that it was ""very healthy"" to have different views, but added: ""We'll always be trying to reach consensus.""
Brainard's dissents are boosting Democratic pressure on Powell, a Republican, to hit pause on deregulation. 
    Democratic Representative Katie Porter, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, wrote to Powell in March raising concerns over Fed proposals to change capital rules. She cited Brainard's dissent. 

    ""Not all of us have forgotten what happened 10 years ago,” she told Reuters.

The move will pause until Dec. 31 an investigation requested by the U.S. that says various Chinese regulations violate the WTO’s intellectual property rules.

The dispute was one of the first salvos in the U.S.-China trade war and came prior to President Donald Trump’s decision to impose unilateral tariffs on Chinese exports in response to the nation’s alleged theft of U.S. technology secrets and forced technology transfer policies.
The U.S. complaint alleged that China “appears to be breaking WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including U.S. companies, basic patent rights to stop a Chinese entity from using the technology after a licensing contract ends.”"

“If you ask Boeing (NYSE:BA) they still say June or July,” Kjos said at the Paris Air Forum. “But we’re already in mid-June - we've planned for the MAX to be out until the end of August.”
More than 300 Boeing 737 MAX jets have been grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed nearly 350 people. Some airlines now expect the plane to remain out of action until the end of 2019.
Norwegian, which operated 18 of the planes, has said the grounding will raise its costs by up to 500 million Norwegian crowns ($58 million). The low-cost, long-haul operator has delayed disposal of older Boeing 737 models or prolonged leasing contracts while it waits for their MAX replacements.
Boeing is awaiting a decisions by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on software improvements it proposed after the crashes and whether to require additional pilot training before flights can resume.
If more training is ordered, a shortage of simulators means that “it might be much longer” before commercial flights resume, Kjos said. “For some operators it could take up to a year.”
As a customer of Boeing’s GoldCare maintenance program, however, the CEO said Norwegian might not have to wait that long. 

“We’d hope to be at the front of the queue,” he said.

An agreement in excess of 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) has been reached, according to the BBC, while the Times of London said the amount could rise to 8 million pounds. Juventus shares declined as much as 3.8% versus a 0.4% decline for Italy’s FTSE MIB benchmark.
Sarri’s maiden season in the U.K. capital was marred by media speculation that he’d be dismissed as results fell short of expectations. Such an eventuality would have allowed a new club to gain the former foreign-exchange trader’s services for free.
Chelsea’s results improved during the latter months of the season as the club finished third in the Premier League to secure a spot in the UEFA Champions League for next season and also won Europe’s second-tier knockout competition, the UEFA Europa League.
Sarri previously worked for Banca Toscana, now a unit of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, before quitting finance to pursue a career in soccer in 2001, according to a BBC profile."
478,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 07:56AM ET</span>","Volkswagen to float 10% of truck unit, seeks to raise 1.9 billion euros","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) aims to raise up to 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) by listing truck unit Traton, it said on Friday, scaling back earlier ambitions to list up to a quarter of the unit by opting to float a 10% stake.
The German carmaker said in a statement that the offering would be priced at 27-33 euros per share, which Jefferies analysts said valued Traton at a slight discount to industry peers but at a premium to Swedish competitor Volvo.
Wolfsburg-based VW plans to invest proceeds in transforming its auto production as it readies the launch of dozens of electric vehicles over the coming years and deepens an alliance with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
It is also seeking to capitalize on the premium that truck stocks command over automakers to create an acquisition currency, having earlier shown interest in U.S.-based truck maker Navistar.
Management denies that a Navistar deal is in immediate prospect, but such a move would fit with a broader pivot by the leading European carmaker towards the United States to balance its reliance on China, where it sells half its cars.
The stake size is at the bottom end of a range of 10%-20% that sources had earlier indicated. If banks running the deal exercise an over-allotment option, the issue size could reach 11.5% of Traton's equity.
At the offer range, the initial public offering values Traton at 13.5-16.5 billion euros. 
Shares in VW eased by 0.5% in early trading in Frankfurt on Friday as analysts cautioned that Traton's potential acquisitiveness could lead to the issue of fresh equity that would dilute existing shareholdings.
Jefferies, in a note, said that Traton's enterprise value as a multiple of core earnings - a measure of a company's ability to support its equity and debt costs - of 8.2 times was slightly lower than the sector average but higher than Volvo's, which it sees as offering better value.
The carmaker is being more cautious about the volume of shares it will place after halting earlier listing plans in March, when it had planned to place a stake of up to 25% on the stock market, citing market conditions.
More shares could be sold subsequently if the IPO is successful, a person familiar with the matter said this month, adding VW would remain Traton's majority shareholder for the foreseeable future.
The offering will begin on Monday, with management holding a series of investor roadshows. It ends on June 27, with the first day of trading in Frankfurt and Stockholm set for June 28.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 07:52AM ET</span>",U.S. farmers experimenting with hemp as China trade war drags on,"By Julie Ingwersen and David Randall
HAYSVILLE, Kansas (Reuters) - A growing number of U.S. farmers battered by low grain prices and the threat of a prolonged trade war with China are seeking salvation in a plant that until recently was illegal: hemp.
A cousin of cannabis plants that produce marijuana, hemp is used in products ranging from food to building materials and cannabidiol, or CBD oil, which is being touted as a treatment for everything from sleeplessness to acne to heart disease.
Interest in hemp picked up with the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill in December, which removed hemp from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration's list of controlled substances and put it under the oversight of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Unlike marijuana, industrial hemp doesn't contain enough of the psychoactive chemical THC to give users a high.
The new rules call for the USDA to award hemp planting licenses to farmers but the agency has not yet regulated the process, meaning individual states are still issuing the licenses. 
Industrial hemp plantings this year could double from the 78,176 acres seeded in 2018, said Eric Steenstra, president of advocacy group Vote Hemp. In 2017, 25,713 acres were planted on pilot programs authorized under the 2014 farm bill.
The U.S. hemp market is growing along with supply. U.S. sales of hemp reached $1.1 billion in 2018 and are projected to reach $1.9 billion by 2022, according to Vote Hemp and the Hemp Business Journal, a trade publication.
The profit potential is high: A good yield of food-grade hemp, for instance, can net farmers about $750 per acre, said Ken Anderson, founder of Prescott, Wisconsin-based hemp processor Legacy Hemp. Hemp seeds can be baked in to bread or sprinkled onto cereal or salads.
""That's a profit that blows corn and wheat and everything else out of the water,"" he said. 
By comparison, soybeans bring in $150 or less per acre, and sales of the U.S. crop to China have fallen sharply since the onset of the trade war last year.
Before they can cash in on hemp, however, U.S. farmers must learn the science of producing an unfamiliar crop and wrestle with shifting regulations and other uncertainties.
""Nobody has any experience whatsoever,"" said Rick Gash, 46, a businessman in Augusta, Kansas, who plans to grow his first-ever hemp crop on a horse pasture on his old family property.
NEW FRONTIER FOR REGULATION
CBD oil, which is concentrated in the hemp plant's flowers, made up an estimated 23 percent of hemp sales in 2017, according to the Hemp Business Journal.
While the USDA oversees hemp planting, regulation of hemp products mostly falls to The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Though the agency has not approved food and supplements containing CBD, such products are widely available and the agency has done little to curtail their sales.
Furthermore, the FDA mainly has jurisdiction over commerce between states, meaning products developed and sold locally in states that have more tolerant laws for hemp products is legal.
“To date, the FDA has only gone after people making aggressive claims - cancer treatment claims, AIDS treatment claims and the like,"" said attorney Jonathan Havens, former FDA regulatory counsel and current co-chair of cannabis law practice at Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr.
Other CBD products with no health claims or 'soft' claims have drawn no federal enforcement, he said, ""causing many people to confuse availability with legality.""
The FDA said in a statement to Reuters it had developed a strategy to evaluate existing CBD products and create lawful pathways for bringing them to market. The agency knows some companies are marketing products containing hemp-derived compounds in ways that violate the law but has prioritized those making unwarranted health claims for enforcement action, the FDA said.
""Our biggest concern is the marketing of products that put the health and safety of consumers at greatest risk, such as those claiming to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer,"" the agency said in the statement.
CBD ICE (NYSE:ICE) CREAM?
Despite the uncertainty, analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co estimate that products with CBD as an ingredient will generate $16 billion in retail sales for humans and animals in the U.S. by 2025.
Companies are also making big bets: Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, the nation's largest grocery chain, said on Tuesday it plans to sell CBD creams, balms and oils in nearly 1,000 stores across 17 states.
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR) Plc's Ben & Jerry's ice cream chain said in a May 30 statement it planned to debut CBD-infused ice cream flavors as soon as consuming the oil is ""legalized at the federal level."" 
In Kentucky, which launched a pilot program for hemp in 2014, farmers who used to grow tobacco are finding hemp grown for CBD oil to be a profitable alternative with a better reputation.
""When I was growing tobacco, everyone said I was growing something that's bad for your health,"" said Brian Furnish, an eighth-generation tobacco farmer. ""It's fun to grow something that is making people feel better.""
Farther west, in the U.S. midsection where farmers are more familiar with commodity crops like corn and wheat and have been more scarred by the trade war, some see hemp as a rotational crop grown on a larger scale for seed and fiber, rather than for its labor-intensive CBD oil.
EXPENSIVE SEED, HARVESTING BY HAND
The Kansas Department of Agriculture began issuing licenses to growers this spring, allowing the crop to be cultivated in the state this year for the first time in decades. 
    Jason Griffin, a specialist at Kansas State University, remains skeptical of the crop's potential and cringes when he hears descriptions like 'gold rush' to describe it.
Beyond navigating changing regulations, expensive seed is one of many challenges that pioneering hemp farmers will face.
Special equipment for harvesting hemp may also be required, although some growers have been able to re-purpose the combines they already own. The hemp plant's flowers are typically harvested by hand, while hemp for fiber is grown in fields and must be cut mechanically and dried in the field before storage.
Farmers are particularly dependent on the end buyers of hemp, as there are few third-party brokers to sell it as there are for other cash crops. 
""You can't just go to the local grain elevator and ask what's your cash price for hemp grain right now,"" said Legacy Hemp's Anderson. 
He often cautions farmers not to plant seeds until they have a contract with a buyer because prices vary widely. Legacy Hemp signs contracts with farmers before the planting season.
Other farmers are concerned over the long-term prospects. Montana wheat farmer Nathan Keane is growing female hemp plants exclusively for CBD oil, starting in a greenhouse and transplanting each plant later by hand. 

“Honestly, I think the CBD thing is going to be a bubble,"" he said. ""I will ride the wave … but I'm really hoping the sustainability of hemp is going to be in the grain and the fiber.”

480,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 07:51AM ET</span>",Huawei delays global launch of foldable phone by three months,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei will delay the launch of its much-touted foldable 5G Mate X smartphone by three months, the latest setback for the company that was slapped with U.S. sanctions last month.
The Mate X, a competitor to Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics' Galaxy Fold, is expected to be rolled out globally in September, Vincent Pang, Huawei's head of corporate communications, said on the sidelines of the WSJ Tech D.Live conference in Hong Kong.
It was originally slated for a June launch.
The delay comes as Huawei phones face being cut off from updates of Google's Android operating system (OS) in the wake of the U.S. blacklist that bans American companies from doing business with the Chinese firm.
Pang, however, denied the delay was due to the ban, saying Huawei was in the process of running certification tests with various carriers that were expected to be completed in August.
He also told Reuters that Huawei, the world's second-largest maker of smartphones, could roll out its Hongmeng operating system (OS) - which is being tested - within nine months.
""Our preference will of course be Google and Android as we have been partners for many years,"" said Pang, also a senior vice president at Huawei. ""But if the circumstances force us to, we can roll out Hongmeng in six to nine months.""
Hongmeng is based on the version of Android that is publicly available via open-source licensing and is mainly meant for phones, Pang said. Hongmeng will support other devices later.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has earlier said it would no longer provide Android software for Huawei phones after a 90-day reprieve granted by the U.S. government expires in August.
Huawei has applied to trademark its Hongmeng OS in various countries, Reuters reported on Thursday, in a sign it may be deploying a back-up plan in key markets.
At home, Huawei applied for a Hongmeng trademark in August last year and received a nod last month, according to a filing on China's intellectual property administration's website.
Pang denied recent media reports that Huawei was cancelling the roll out of its next new laptop and said it will still launch at a later date.
BAN FALLOUT
Huawei has come under mounting scrutiny for over a year, led by U.S. allegations that ""back doors"" in its routers, switches and other gear could allow China to spy on U.S. communications. 
The company has denied its products pose a security threat.
However, consumers spooked by how matters have escalated are offloading their devices amid Android worries.
Huawei's hopes to become the world's top-selling smartphone maker in the fourth quarter this year have now been delayed, a senior Huawei executive said this week.
Problems at Huawei, the world's largest network-equipment maker, are spilling over to the broader chip industry.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc has warned of a broad slowdown in chip demand, blaming the U.S.-China trade conflict and export restrictions on Huawei, and cut its revenue forecast for the year by 8%. Huawei accounted for about or 4% of the company's overall sales last year.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) Inc's CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said at the WSJ conference on Friday that the ban on Huawei brings ""uncertainty and disturbance"" to the semiconductor industry.

Mehrotra said Micron was assessing impact from the ban on Huawei, one of its largest customers.

China officially launched the STAR Market on Thursday, Shanghai's new tech board which was designed to give market forces a bigger role in setting stock prices.
But the country's top securities regulator Yi Huiman flagged the risk of short-term speculation and high volatilities when stocks start trading on the board. [L4N23K15K]
There will be no daily limits for the first five days of trading in new stocks, compared with the existing 44 percent limit on other boards. In contrast to a 10% daily trading limit on other mainland exchange-run boards, stocks listed on the STAR Market are allowed to rise or fall by up to 20% a day. 
SSE published rules on Thursday which it said were aimed at ""preventing big market fluctuations, while maintaining market liquidity.""
If stocks rise or fall more than 30%, or 60%, for the first time within a session, trading would be suspended for 10 minutes. 
The rules also defined what SSE sees as serious abnormal fluctuations over 10, and 30 trading days.
The exchange said it will punish investors engaged in abnormal trading behaviors including fake bidding, pump and dump, and stock price manipulation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fathers pass down many things to their kids, but not just genetic traits like eye color or hairlines.
Another inheritance, perhaps the most impactful of all: Money habits. 
After all, kids see and hear much more than you realize. So if you are a parent who saves and is thoughtful about spending, your children are picking that up. If you are racking up debts and getting late on your bills, your kids are absorbing that, too.
In honor of Father’s Day, Reuters asked a few prominent Americans about the financial habits they got from their own fathers.
Al Roker
Co-host, 3rd hour of TODAY Show; weather and feature anchor, TODAY
The financial advice I got from my dad was to make sure to hand it to someone who knows what they’re doing. My father admittedly didn’t know a whole lot about money, and my mom ran all the finances. So he would hand my mother his check, and she is the one who paid for stuff and put money in the bank. As long as they lived, that was the way it worked.
Ironically, at his job, he was responsible for handling large sums of money every day. He was a bus driver, and I used to ride the bus with him. Back in those days there were no MetroCards, so people paid for rides in cash, and he would have to tally it all up at the end of the bus route.
When I started to have after-school jobs, I did the same thing as him, and would hand the money to my mom to put it in the bank. She was pretty savvy about money – strict about saving, and about giving to charity, since she was very involved in her church.
Nowadays, with my son who is almost 17, I make sure to give him an allowance in cash. I think it’s important for kids to handle cash, not just debit cards, and see how it goes from Point A to Point B. That way they realize that money doesn’t just magically appear.

Two things he always stressed, and these were lessons I learned early, even back when we were playing Monopoly on Thanksgiving. One was to do your best to avoid debt whenever possible. Save as much as you can, and pay for things out of earnings.
The second thing was to invest early, and often, and consistently. The sooner you put it to work, the more time it has to work for you. As a young adult I was a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps, with very small paychecks.
But he stressed that even if it was just 50 bucks, put it into a fund. You won’t see it, you won’t even think about it. And he was right: For most of the ‘90s little bits of money were being funneled from my paycheck, and over time it grew for me.
As for Monopoly: My dad would always beat me, and I used to cry.

The best financial advice I got from my dad was to keep track of every dollar I spend. We have a family tradition that started with my great-great-grandfather, John D. Rockefeller Sr., who wrote down everything he spent in a ledger.
So I got my first ledger from my dad, David Rockefeller Jr., when I first started getting an allowance around 10 years old. It’s a little lined notebook that helps you track input and output, so you can budget and plan efficiently. To this day I still uphold that habit.
I really do try to make a conscious effort to track the smaller things, like lunches, as well as larger items. You have to be mindful of what you’re taking out of your wallet. It has served me well, and taught me to have respect for money.
I kept that paper ledger all the way until college, but these days I use an Excel spreadsheet. I guess I should use an app, but that system works for me.

Indicators from services to manufacturing and hiring all cooled, dragging the headline index to 13, far below the 33 threshold consistent with positive real economic growth, economists led by Ellen Zentner wrote in a note.
“The decline shows a sharp deterioration in sentiment this month that was broad-based across sectors,” they said. “The MSBCI Manufacturing Index fell dramatically to zero, a decline that was likely exaggerated by the recent turn lower in oil prices, while marking the lowest level for the subindex on record.”
Morgan Stanley’s conclusions dovetail with recent data from job growth to inflation that all point to a cooling American economy. Signs of slowing economic expansion have fueled speculation the Federal Reserve will cut rates this year, spurring this month’s concurrent rallies in bonds and stocks.
Beneath the headline reading, Morgan Stanley’s services sub-index dropped to the lowest since July 2012, while gauges of hiring, capital expenditure plans and pricing power all fell.
Yet the uncertainty around trade policy is probably not the main cause, the economists wrote. The survey respondents pointed to headwinds including weaker commodity prices for oil-related companies and a deflating consumer spending boom for retailers."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A severe shortage of computer skills in South Africa has left its major banks fighting over a limited pool of people with the skills they need to upgrade technology platforms and keep pace with changing customer demands and competition from new rivals. 
The country's four biggest lenders - Absa, Standard Bank, Nedbank and FirstRand - told Reuters it was hard to access the skills they need to rapidly digitize - a response to growing demand for online and mobile banking and the arrival of a host of digital-only banks trying to steal their customers with slick apps and cut-price fees.
All four said they had taken a number of measures to address the shortage, including changing their hiring strategies, implementing for example 'speed dating' style events where large numbers of candidates undergo short interviews in one go, and developing training programs. 
But in some cases lenders said it still took months to hire and they were paying ever-rising salaries to win talent.
The problem is particularly acute for positions that did not exist just a few years ago, such as cloud engineers, said Standard Bank Group Chief Information Officer Alpheus Mangale.
In September last year, he said the bank wanted to hire 12 such engineers to make sure its cloud systems were up and running and look after their day-to-day upkeep. 
""We are probably at about 40 percent of that, because the skills just don't exist ... in the market,"" he said. 
Banks can expect to pay a 20-30% premium when they do find such skills, he added. 
Specialist recruitment agency Acuity Consultants said salaries for software developers had also leapt by up to 30% over the past year.
Thando Lukhele, a divisional executive in Nedbank's group technology division, also said it could take months to fill roles and the bank paid extra for new hirings. Absa and FirstRand's retail unit cited similar problems. 
The banks' issues highlight how the skills shortage is complicating some of South Africa's largest companies' ability to compete, making adapting to technological and market changes more time-consuming and costly. 
Such skills are in short supply globally, and McKinsey has estimated demand for technological skills will rise by 55% by 2030 based on analysis focusing on the United States and Western Europe. 
But Yossi Hasson, a co-founder at non-profit technology school WeThinkCode_, said the issue was magnified in South Africa by problems in public education, limited access to the internet and computers and the fact that those with skills are often taken overseas by global companies. 
The banks, many of which sponsor WeThinkCode_ alongside companies ranging from news organizations to Nandos, have tried a range of other steps to attract or develop talent. 
Standard Bank's Mangale said it had created training programs with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as internal programs and partnerships with universities or technical schools and initiatives to retrain existing staff. 
The bank, he said, had decided it should not rely on other institutions to create skills whose presence was increasingly becoming make or break for companies of all sectors: 

""The use of technology, and how you leverage all the emerging tech ... is really at the heart of how organizations will win or lose in the market.""

Brazil's pension reform bill is aimed at restoring public finances and reviving a flagging economy, but is fiercely opposed by some sectors of society for raising the minimum retirement age and workers' contributions. 
Workers at nine refineries including Reduc in Rio de Janeiro state and Paulínia in São Paulo state were participating in the strike, which also affected a Petrobras port terminal in Pernambuco, and a fertilizer plant in Bahia, FUP said.
On the Campos basin in Rio de Janeiro, workers were keeping operations to a minimum, it added.
In Brazil's largest city São Paulo, public transport was disrupted as subway workers adhered to the strike, affecting train schedules and closing some stations, local media reported.
Road blocks and demonstrations in streets and highways in and around São Paulo, including burning tyres close to the city's international airport, have also been reported. 
As well as seeking to block changes in public sector pensions, FUP said, the oil workers were protesting against ""the privatization of the Petrobras system"".

Ekaterina Trofimova, who oversaw the creation of ACRA after western sanctions had resulted in Russia being downgraded by the top three international credit rating agencies, joined global accountancy firm Deloitte's Moscow office in April to lead development of internal ratings processes at domestic companies and banks, among other tasks.
""Modeling of credit risk components helps to build a fast decision system, allowing evaluation of borrowers who have no rating from the agencies,"" the ex-S&P director and former Gazprombank executive told Reuters. 
Trofimova said that internal ratings make for speedier decision-making on loans and credit lines by banks and companies, thereby improving competitiveness. 
""This (internal rating system) is a question of survival,"" she added.
Credit ratings became a hot topic in Russia after the sanctions over Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, with Russian companies immediately affected by the downgrading of Russia's creditworthiness by the world's leading rating agencies. 
ACRA has been promoted by the Russian government and central bank, with domestic companies requiring ACRA ratings to access most state funds. Since mid-2017 Russia has relied on its own rating agencies to manage its domestic debt market. 
For the past couple of years the Russian central bank has required lenders to comply with tougher bank capital rules to protect against possible shocks, which makes effective risk assessment essential.

So far Sberbank and the Russian unit of Raiffeisenbank have gained central bank approval to use their own ratings systems to meet the regulatory requirements.

For the week to June 12, bond funds had inflows of $2.5 billion and equity funds saw $1.6 billion inflows, the highest in 13 weeks, BAML said, citing data from flow tracker EPFR.
The data is the latest sign that expectations of a more accommodative U.S. central bank following comments by Fed chairman Jerome Powell last week had pushed investors into both safe haven bonds and riskier assets like stocks.
Powell said the Fed was closely monitoring the implications of the trade war between the United States and China on the world's No. 1 economy and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion"". 
Those comments, on June 4, were interpreted as a sign the central bank would take a more proactive, rather than reactive, approach to interest rate cuts, with two cuts expected.
The comments, aimed at blunting the impact of the escalating trade tensions, have helped drive global stocks higher, with the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average last Friday both registering their biggest weekly gains since November.
Investment grade bonds were favorites among investors with $2.3 billion in flows last week, suggesting they were cautious ahead of the Fed meeting next week and the G20 summit at the end of the month.
In equities, stocks in defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer products and utilities outshone other sectors.
Over the past six months, a record $46 billion has ploughed into government bond funds, while investors have largely shunned equities as trade war worries prompted them to take shelter in safe-haven assets.
Overall, $185 billion has flowed into bonds so far this year, while $154 billion has been drawn out of equities.

European equity funds remained unloved with investors pulling $600 million, marking the 64th week of outflows in the last 66.

China’s industrial output growth slowed to its slowest rate in over 17 years in May, as the world's second-largest economy showed signs of weakening under U.S. trade pressure.
Meanwhile, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) slumped 8.7% in premarket trading after forecasting a slowdown in demand for chips, citing the trade war between the U.S. and China. Most chipmakers have been predicting a stronger second half to the year after a weak first half, and Broadcom's warning damages one of the biggest props to sentiment for the sector.

He spoke after Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria explained Rome's public finances to euro zone counterparts at a meeting in Luxembourg. The EU has said there is room to open a disciplinary procedure against Italy, which could lead to fines.
Asked at a news conference when Italy should reply to the EU's executive commission to avert disciplinary proceedings, Le Maire said: ""I would say a few days.""
EU governments this week endorsed the European Commission's assessment that Italy was in breach of EU fiscal rules because of its growing debt, which Rome's eurosceptic government has not tackled, pursuing instead free-spending policies.
This would justify the opening of a disciplinary procedure, the EU said. Such punitive action would need to be started before the summer break under EU rules.
The Commission is expected to decide on whether to recommend the move on June 26, EU officials and documents said, although a one-week delay could be possible. The final decision by EU finance ministers is expected on July 8-9.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 05:48AM ET</span>",Haitong International Securities cuts business ties with UBS after pig comment,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Haitong International Securities Group Ltd said it has cut ties with UBS Group AG, following a comment about Chinese pigs made by the Swiss bank's global chief economist that was perceived by some as a racist slur. 
Haitong International has suspended all collaboration with UBS, including corporate finance and trading, the Hong Kong-listed firm said in an email to Reuters on Friday. 
""There is not a clear timetable on when to resume the collaboration, which is subject to the management's decision,"" Haitong International said. 
Paul Donovan, global chief economist of UBS' wealth management department since 2016, said in a podcast on Wednesday that consumer prices in China had risen mainly due to sickness among pigs.
""Does this matter? It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China,"" Donovan said.
Some people interpreted his comment as a reference to people, not livestock.
No other Chinese brokerages and financial institutions collaborating with UBS have cut ties, but some in the Chinese financial community have expressed their displeasure and have rejected an apology from UBS.
The stakes are high for foreign companies looking to expand their presence in China as the world's second-largest economy further opens up its financial sector. 
In December last year, UBS became the first foreign bank in China to get official approval to acquire a controlling stake in its local securities joint venture.
Lin Yong, chief executive of Haitong International - the Hong Kong unit of Chinese brokerage Haitong Securities Co - earlier announced the decision to freeze ties with UBS on his personal WeChat account, a Haitong employee who saw the post told Reuters.
It was also announced in an email circulated among Haitong International staff, a second Haitong employee said.
UBS said it apologized unreservedly for any misunderstanding caused by Donovan's innocently intended comments.
""We have removed the audio comment from circulation. To be clear, this comment was about inflation and Chinese consumer prices rising, which was driven by higher prices for pork,"" UBS said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday. 
The bank said it was enhancing its ""internal processes"" to avoid any recurrence of such an incident, adding: ""We remain fully committed to investing in China.""
'ARROGANT'
The Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong (HKCSA), whose 124 member firms include offshore subsidiaries of Chinese brokerages and fund houses, said it was not aware if any other members were cutting ties with UBS, when contacted by Reuters on Friday.
Haitong International's Lin is the president of the HKCSA.
The association had demanded on Thursday that UBS dismiss Donovan and issue a formal apology from the board, while calling companies and individuals to consider carefully when it comes to conducting business with UBS.
""Regrettably, this information (UBS' apology) is not only insincere, but also arrogant, again hurting the feelings of Chinese people,"" it said in an open letter to the UBS board. 
Lin did not respond to emails and telephone calls seeking comment. The Haitong employees were not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified.
UBS declined to comment on Haitong International's decision on Friday and referred to the apology issued a day earlier.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>","Bond yields slip, stocks suffer on cooling China data","By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks struggled and safe haven bets were back in play on Friday with German bond yields plumbing record lows as Chinese data rekindled woes about the health of the global economy and fears of a new U.S.-Iran confrontation intensified.
Data from Beijing painted a fairly gloomy picture of the world's second largest economy as the trade war with the United States starts to bite. May industrial output growth slowed to a more than 17-year low, well below expectations, while fixed-asset investment also fell short of forecasts. 
Expectations for more stimulus in China are growing as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute threatens to escalate into a full-blown trade war that many fear could push the global economy into recession.
The data saw yields on German 10-year Bunds -- seen as one of the safest assets in the world -- fall to fresh record lows. U.S. Treasury yields were also grinding lower. Safe-haven bond yields have already fallen in recent days amid rising speculation about monetary easing by major central banks. Spain bond yields have fallen for the first time below 0.5%.
Gold prices hit a 14-month high. [GOL/]
""The Chinese data was disappointing, especially the industrial output numbers,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. ""That's given bond markets additional momentum.""
Equity markets across Europe chalked up hefty losses on the risk-off sentiment, with a warning by U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc of a slowdown in demand due to trade tensions and the U.S. ban on Chinese tech and mobile phone company Huawei Technologies exacerbating the glum mood. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5%, with Germany's trade-sensitive DAX falling 0.6%. 
European tech shares led the indexes lower, with semiconductor companies Infineon, AMS, STMicroelectronics, Siltronic and Dialog Semiconductor all dropping between 2%-3% after Broadcom outlined the impact of a total halt in sales to Huawei. (EU)
""The sales warning from Broadcom is also weighing on markets this morning as it suggests that both semiconductor and auto sectors are under pressure worldwide,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief strategist at brokerage Market Securities in Paris, adding that expectations for a rebound were now shifting from the second half of this year to 2020. 
""Given both these sectors are key for world trade, it's not good news for trade.""
U.S. stock futures indicated Wall Street was in line for a lower open, with the S&P e-mini pointing to a 0.2% fall.
Wall Street shares have had a strong run in June on hopes the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy soon to counter pressure on the U.S. economy from the escalating trade war. The S&P 500 index is up about 5% so far this month.
WAIT FOR THE FED
The Fed's June 18-19 meeting will give investors an opportunity to see if the U.S. central bank's monetary policy stance matches market expectations for a near-term rate cut.
A Reuters poll showed a growing number of economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates this year although the majority still expect it to stay on hold.
""There is a large degree of uncertainty going into next week's FOMC (Federal Reserve Open Committee) meeting as market reaction will differ significantly depending on whether the Fed hints toward easing policy,"" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX and equity strategist at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.
""A wait-and-see mood is likely to begin prevailing in the markets ahead of the FOMC.""
Growing worries about a new U.S.-Iranian confrontation after two attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday added to the unhappy mood. 
Washington blamed Iran, but Tehran bluntly denied the allegation. But U.S. and European security officials as well as regional analysts left open the possibility that Iranian proxies, or someone else entirely, might have been responsible. 
The attacks set crude prices on a roller coaster ride, with Brent futures slipping 0.2% to $61.18 per barrel. Brent surged 2.3% on Thursday after the Norwegian- and Japanese-owned tankers both experienced explosions. 
In currency markets, the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 96.957 after ending the previous day nearly flat, with caution ahead of the Fed meeting keeping the greenback in a tight range.
The euro was steady at $1.1282 while the greenback inched down 0.2% to 108.19 yen.

The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell on Friday as bets on interest rate cuts undermined demand and Group of 20 meeting later this month sidelined investors.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",Maersk explores Arctic shipping route with Russia,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk said on Friday it is in talks with Russia's state-owned icebreaker operator to send more goods via the Arctic, which is becoming more accessible as climate change reduces the sea ice.
Russia has made developing the so-called northern sea route (NSR) - which requires new ports and heavy icebreakers to move goods - a priority, with supporters dubbing the route the northern Suez Canal.
Last summer, Maersk carried out what it said was a one-off trial, becoming the first to send a container ship - loaded with Russian fish and South Korean electronics - on the route.
At the time it denied that the route could be commercially viable, partly because it is only accessible for around three months of the year due to ice. 
However, Maersk is now exploring the possibility of offering a service in cooperation with Russia's nuclear-powered icebreaker company Rosatomflot, High North News reported on Friday. 
""We have experienced growing demand for transport of goods from the Far East to West Russia, which we are currently exploring the possibilities of offering together with Atomflot,"" Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping group, confirmed in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
Maersk, which offers shipping on its own vessels and in cooperation with a number of other carriers and providers, added that it has no current plans to deploy Maersk vessels in commercial service along the route. 
The Northern Sea Route is significantly shorter than going via the Suez Canal and could cut sea transport times from Asia to Europe. It runs from Murmansk near Russia's border with Norway to the Bering Strait near Alaska. Ships sailing it require a permit from Russian authorities.
Sea ice around the North Pole covers the largest area at the end of the winter in March, and thaws to an annual minimum in September. The ice has shrunk in recent decades in a trend scientists have linked to man-made climate change. 
Russian officials have said there is strong interest in the sea route from Asian countries and that new icebreakers will allow for year-round navigation in the 2020s.

Beijing laid out ambitions in January 2018 to form a ""Polar Silk Road"" by developing shipping lanes opened up by global warming and encouraging enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic.

A further delay of a cash injection could raise questions about the survival of the ailing smartphone screen maker, which has been hit by Apple's slowing iPhone sales and a late shift to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.
Japan Display said in a statement it would make an announcement once it had received notice from the consortium, which includes Taiwanese flat screen maker TPK Holding Co Ltd and Chinese investment firm Harvest Group. 
The consortium reached a basic agreement on the deal in mid-April but delayed formalising it to reassess Japan Display's prospects.
Soon after that delay, client Apple agreed to wait for money owed and the biggest shareholder, the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund, offered to forgive 44.7 billion yen in debt.
Japan Display is shrinking the smartphone display business to stop cash outflows and seeking to cut 1,200 jobs. It is also temporarily suspending a main display panel plant funded by Apple and closing one of the lines at another main panel plant. 
Those restructuring measures could result in a loss of as much as 79 billion yen for this financial year ending in March, the company said this week.
The bailout deal would allow the buyers to become Japan Display's biggest shareholders with a 49.8 percent stake, replacing the Japanese government-backed INCJ fund.
Japan Display was formed in 2012 by combining the LCD businesses of Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp (T:6758) in a deal brokered by the government.
It went public in March 2014 and was worth more than 400 billion yen then. It is now worth 67 billion yen.

""(We are) very confident we can solve the problems at the now defunct carrier,"" Hardeep Singh Puri said on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi, in comments widely interpreted as referring to Jet.
Massive debt and suffocating price competition forced what was once India's biggest private-sector airline to halt operations in April at the cost of thousands of jobs, and resulting in higher airfares across the industry.
The airline and its lenders have been searching for new investors, while employee unions have been calling for government intervention. The government, however, has largely been quiet on the issue since its election victory.
Puri has assumed office at a time of distress in areas of Indian aviation. Last year, the government unsuccessfully sought a buyer for money-losing state-owned carrier Air India Ltd.
""We have made mistakes in civil aviation in the past which we need to correct,"" Puri said.

Jet's share price was 9% lower in early afternoon trade. The stock sunk in the last two trading sessions after India's largest stock exchange limited speculative trading in the firm.

Investing.com -- UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) is feeling the heat of Chinese wrath Friday, its stock down 2% by 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), amid fears that it may lose precious business as the result of a flippant remark by one of its economists about the swine flu epidemic that has ravaged China's pork industry this year.
That puts it at the bottom of a Swiss market that is down 0.5% overall, although Switzerland is faring better than most European bourses on a day when a gloomy outlook by U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) revived fears of a global economic downturn. Germany's Dax is down 0.9% while the U.K. FTSE is down 0.7%. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 is down 0.7% at 377.58.
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS's Global Wealth Management unit, was accused of racism after a podcast in which he discussed the impact of an epidemic that led to pork prices rising 18% last month, a big enough rise to drive overall Chinese inflation to a 15-month high of 2.7%.
In an attempt to put that into the broader economic context, Donovan asked rhetorically in the UBS Morning Audio Comment whether that mattered, answering his own question:
“It matters if you are a Chinese pig. It matters if you like eating pork in China. It does not really matter to the rest of the world.”
His point was that the outbreak was likely to have little longer-lasting impact that could affect the price of Chinese or global assets. However, he was quickly accused of racism, not least by an economist at one of UBS's competitors in Hong Kong.
Hao Hong, head of research at Bank of Communications International, the state-run Chinese bank’s Hong Kong unit, accused Donovan in a Twitter post of ""distasteful and racist language"" according to the Financial Times. The Global Times, an English-language mouthpiece for the Communist Party, took up the theme, detailing a storm of outrage on Chinese social media.
Despite apologies from UBS and from Donovan personally, the Hong Kong Securities Association said it ""urges UBS to terminate the employment of the staff involved, and report the result to the Chinese public.”
It also demanded “the management of UBS make an open and formal apology, and to ensure that such incidents will not occur again.”
The incident puts UBS in an awkward position. Since slashing its once-freewheeling investment bank, it has come to rely more and more on the fees it generates from Donovan's division, which manages the wealth of the world's ultra-rich. The biggest single growth market for that division is, of course, China (not least since its U.S. business has been crimped for years by the after-effects of a brush with U.S. authorities over abetting tax evasion). Asia accounted for nearly 80% of the division's $22 billion in net new assets under management in the first quarter of the year
But if UBS fires Donovan, it risks getting a reputation for becoming the sort of bank that bows to political pressure. That will damage its reputation in the rest of the world, even if putting a price on that damage is hard.
The incident underlines the risks of business models - especially models that revolve around the exchange of ideas such as giving investment advice - that depend on China, where public discourse is tightly controlled. The country's image abroad has suffered this week from coverage of demonstrations in Hong Kong, which showed police firing rubber bullets and pepper spray at protesters objecting to a new law that allows citizens to be extradited to the Chinese mainland for trial.
Small wonder that HSBC (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), which also have above-average exposure to the region, have also underperformed in the last couple of days.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Airbus agrees new contract for delayed A400M military transporter,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has reached an agreement with European state buyers to revise a contract for its delayed A400M military transporter plane, resetting Europe's largest defense project after a lengthy wrangle over costs and military capability.
Airbus said on Friday it had signed an A400M contract amendment with arms procurement agency OCCAR, which coordinates the A400M purchase for seven core nations, to lengthen the model's production plan while sticking to the program's overall contractual timeframe until 2030.
Dirk Hoke, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Defense and Space, said: ""The overall aim... both for Airbus as well as for OCCAR and the Launch Customer Nations, was to recover a sustainable contractual basis for, and to ensure a proper execution of, the A400M program.""
The A400M was commissioned in 2003 to give Europe an independent airlift capacity to support military or humanitarian missions, rather than relying on the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) C-130 or the now out-of-production Boeing (NYSE:BA) C-17.
A 3.5-billion-euro bailout from Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey rescued the program from cancellation in 2010 after delays and cost overruns.
But problems remained with some of the plane's classified defensive systems, as well as some types of paratrooper drop and helicopter refueling, prompting a new set of contract talks.
Industry officials blame some of the project's problems on an over-ambitious wishlist from the seven purchasing countries, designed in some cases to support local jobs. But the largest buyer Germany has criticized Airbus for failing to do what it promised.
The buyers had already agreed that Airbus would need more time to deliver the plane than originally planned and in return, Airbus pledged to provide ""all necessary support and resources"" to the A400M program.
Despite being a transporter plane, designers say the A400M's advanced systems such as ground-hugging technology make it one of the most complex military aircraft ever built in Europe. France has praised its performance on operations in Africa.

Even so, Europe's new troop transporter may never go into battle with all its planned military capabilities after buyers agreed to let Airbus negotiate an opt-out for features deemed too complex, a document revealed last year.

Reuters reported on Thursday that the parties had reached an agreement on a new contract.
Airbus said the agreement with OCCAR, which represents Germany, France, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Belgium and Luxembourg, included key points such as new capabilities development plan, a new production delivery schedule and new financial terms.
Under the new financial terms, it said the partners agreed on the implementation of a revised financial retention mechanism which is the amount of cash that buyer countries can hold back while waiting for delayed deliveries.

""On the basis of this contract amendment signature, Airbus is fully committed to continue on this positive path and to providing its A400M current and future customers with the most powerful and technologically advanced military transport aircraft available on the market,"" said Dirk Hoke, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Defense and Space.

Launching a public relations offensive to repair an image tarnished by fallout from its takeover of glyphosate maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), Bayer also promised to reduce its environmental impact by 30% through 2030.
""We listened. We learned,"" Bayer said on its website https://www.bayer.com/en/our-commitments-on-transparency-sustainability-and-engagement.aspx, affirming its ""heightened responsibility and ... unique potential to advance farming for the benefit of society and the planet.""
Bayer shares recently plumbed seven-year lows after a California couple was last month awarded more than $2 billion, in the largest-ever U.S. jury award over claims that Monsanto's glyphosate-based weedkiller Roundup causes cancer.
It was the third consecutive U.S. jury verdict against Roundup, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of Monsanto last year. Bayer says glyphosate is safe.
The share-price slide has left Bayer with a market valuation of $56 billion - less than it paid for Monsanto - piling pressure on CEO Werner Baumann who championed the takeover and has faced a backlash from shareholders.
Baumann has beefed up Bayer's crisis PR operation and taken personal charge of efforts to repair the company's image, as it also faces a backlash at home in Germany over a collapse in insect populations that environmentalists blame on excessive use of weedkillers by farmers.
""While glyphosate will continue to play an important role in agriculture and in Bayer’s portfolio, the company is committed to offering more choices for growers,"" Bayer said in a statement.
The company also said it would seek to reduce its environmental footprint by scaling down crop protection volumes and enabling more precise application. It would increase transparency around research efforts and the forthcoming process of re-registering glyphosate in the European Union.

506,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 03:50AM ET</span>",The Best Candidate to Replace Mario Draghi,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- At the end of October, Mario Draghi will step down as president of the European Central Bank. The gun has been fired on the race to replace him, with Europe’s leaders debating the merits of candidates ranging from the hawkish Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann to Olli Rehn, the more dovish governor of the Bank of Finland.
One person, though, has failed to appear in the list of potential successors despite his stellar qualifications: Olivier Blanchard. The Frenchman is a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. He’d certainly have what it takes to succeed Draghi.
As one of the world’s most highly regarded macroeconomists, Blanchard possesses the intellectual rigor and creativity needed to steer the ECB at a difficult juncture. The central bank is struggling to hit its inflation target of below but close to 2 percent, while inflation expectations have fallen even lower than when the ECB launched its program of quantitative easing. Skepticism is rife about the central bank’s ability to provide effective stimulus, as interest rates are already ultra-low, or even negative, and QE may be less useful than in the past. Were the euro zone to enter a new crisis, a macroeconomic brain such as Blanchard’s would be sorely needed.
He’d also provide continuity. There are legitimate concerns that the next ECB president might row back on some of Draghi’s key policies, including the pledge to buy unlimited quantities of short-term bonds from countries in crisis (provided they apply for a rescue program). Blanchard strongly supported the ECB’s effort to end the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and rescue the currency union from deflation.
Of course, it’s unclear whether he’d posses the political skills that allowed Draghi to introduce his unorthodox policies despite Berlin’s initial doubts. Yet his seven-year tenure at the IMF gave him plenty of experience in mediating the sensitivities of different national stakeholders.
Plus he’s been vocal in the debate on reforming the euro zone. For example, he wants to change the EU’s fiscal rules, which he believes are no longer fit for purpose. Here again he could continue Draghi’s work in pushing for reform, even though not all of the current ECB chief’s calls, including creating a euro zone budget, have been heeded. 
There are reasons why politicians may prefer someone else. Blanchard has never headed a central bank, which is a usual prerequisite for running the ECB. Some may find his views on fiscal policy too lax. In January, in an address to the American Economic Association, he argued that in an era of low interest rates, public debt may be less of a problem than many think. Finally, there are several other good candidates, especially Benoit Coeure, an ECB executive board member whose nomination may however face legal hurdles.
But as they mull how to fill Draghi’s shoes, the EU’s leaders would be foolish not to consider Blanchard. On Monday night, he’s scheduled to give a speech during dinner at the ECB’s yearly central banking shindig in Portugal. The euro zone could do a lot worse than having him as next year’s host."

510,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 02:51AM ET</span>",Australian rare earth miners push development deals to counter China grip,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rare earth developers in Australia say they are edging closer to signing deals with new customers that would drive forward their projects amid mounting global supply concerns over the minerals that are crucial to high-tech industries.
Australia contains only 2.8% of the world's rare earth reserves, according to the United States Geological Survey. However, the country accounts for more than half of the new projects in the global pipeline, according to data compiled by the Western Australian School of Mines (WASM) at Curtin University.
Rare earths are a group of 17 minerals critical to a wide array of industries from high-tech consumer electronics to electric vehicles and sophisticated military equipment. 
Most of Australia's projects, however, have been stuck as developers struggle to secure financing because of the domination of China, which accounts for about 90% of global rare earths processing capacity and one-quarter of the world's reserves.
Even the projects closest to start-up are unlikely to begin operations until 2023 at the earliest, the WASM data shows. 
Still, those projects may speed up amid the escalating trade war between the United States and China. The United States imports 80% of its rare earths from China, where state-owned news outlets have reported it could cut its shipments to the U.S. as part of the dispute. 
Northern Minerals, which is developing the Browns Range project in Australia's northwest, said last week that it was in ""discussions with an internationally recognized industrial group"" for supply.
""The level of interest has increased since the increased news focus on the issue,"" a company spokesman said this week. 
Hastings Technology, which is readying its Yangibana rare earths project in Western Australia for late 2021 production already has one preliminary supply agreement with Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and signed another with automotive supplier Schaeffler AG last week.
""We are working on another German supply agreement which we expect to tie up this year,"" said Charles Lew, Hastings' executive chairman.
Additionally, Hastings is receiving financing from Germany's strategic minerals procurement body, he said. 
(For a graphic on 'Rare earth production' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2I4ixHG)
The prospects for Australia's rare earths industry are picking up based on growing demand expectations.
The U.S. said this week it would look to Australia and Canada to develop rare earths reserves around the world to reduce the global reliance on China. 
A Thyssenkrupp spokesman said last week that ""in the area of rare earths we are regularly on the lookout for new partners to serve the growing global demand."" 
The reason rare earths projects outside of China have not advanced is because China's vast production, underpinned by cheaper labor and less stringent environmental regulations, means no one else can compete on cost, said WASM Professor Dudley Kingsnorth.
Australia's Lynas Corp, the world's only rare earths producer outside of China, has been supported by low interest loans from Japan's government. Last month Lynas outlined expansion plans including building a U.S. processing plant. 
Kingsnorth estimates the world will need 75,000 tonnes of rare earths per year to be independent of China by 2025. However, his projections are that the rest of the world will only be producing 50,000 tonnes independent of China by that time. 
End-users are not willing to invest in mines that are years away from production and more costly than in China, he said.
However, companies are not pricing in the risk of a politically driven supply disruption, he said. 
""It's not about being competitive with China, it's do you get your metals or not?"" said Kingsnorth.

Without government support, most new projects will struggle to see the light of day, said a resource companies analyst who declined to be named because of company policy. 
Especially if companies are planning to build processing plants, the cost of which can be an order of magnitude more than the value of the companies building them, he said.
For example, Australian rare earths miner Arafura Resources, a company with a market capitalization of A$77 million ($53.24 million), is seeking to secure $1 billion in funding for its project that includes a processing plant. 
Arafura and fellow miner Alkane Resources met with U.S. defense officials as part of an Australian trade delegation in February but returned empty handed, executives from both companies said.
""The conundrum that's occurring is do or don't people wish to put money on the ground to pay higher costs to mitigate risk?"" said Alkane's Managing Director Nick Earner.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 02:43AM ET</span>",Gushing European energy IPO pipeline faces muted investor appetite,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's oil and gas sector is building up a crowded pipeline for stock market flotations, but investor appetite is limited given painful experiences after the last oil price crash and a backlash against fossil fuels.
Norway's Okea, Britain's Neptune, Chrysaor, Siccar Point and Spirit Energy are all either actively preparing or expected to plan an initial public offering (IPO) in the short term, as are recently merged German-Russian Wintershall Dea and Israeli-owned Ithaca Energy.
Oil and gas companies with a combined value of around $41 billion are seen as candidates for listing in the coming years, according to estimates by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Shares of oil and gas companies historically rise after a crash in oil prices as investors bet on a recovery in prices.
But the recovery following the 2014 downturn, the worst in decades, has been slow and bumpy amid surging U.S. shale production and wider uncertainty over long-term oil demand as the world transitions to cleaner energy.
""IPOs tend to come when markets are sizzling hot and valuations are high – that is not the case for the energy sector currently,"" said Bertrand Born, portfolio manager for global equities at German asset manager DWS.
Listed oil and gas companies have struggled in recent years, underperforming in many cases oil prices and other sectors, and offering a tough backdrop for any company contemplating a public listing.
In a sign of the challenging conditions, Okea on Thursday lowered its offered price per share and delayed its listing on the Oslo stock exchange.
Sam Laidlaw, executive chairman of Neptune, backed by private equity firms  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and CVC Capital Partners, said he saw no time pressure for his company's IPO. 
""Lower returns at $100 a barrel than at $60 raised concerns among capital markets. There is less appetite from generalist investors. We don't see anything that's IPO ready yet,"" he told Reuters this month.
""Some will consolidate, some will never make it to market, some will take longer. If we wanted to be first, there's plenty of time still."" 
Many of the IPO candidates, including Neptune, were set up in the wake of the 2014 crash by private-equity funds seeking to buy cheap and sell high when the oil price recovers. 
But nearly five years on, the going is still tough for the sector.
In the first quarter of 2019, European IPOs slumped to their lowest since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as uncertainty over Brexit and the U.S.-China trade dispute left companies not wanting to take their chances.

UNIQUE STORY
To succeed, companies will have to offer investors something unique, says Jon Clark, regional transaction leader at EY.
""The European oil and gas IPO landscape looks like it will shift from famine to feast and the potential IPO candidates need to think how they will best position themselves,"" Clark said.
Wintershall-Dea is the largest producer of the group, aiming to boost its output by around 30% to at least 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2023, in a portfolio stretching from Brazil to Europe and Russia and the Middle East.
Chrysaor, backed by Harbour and EIG, is the largest oil and gas producer in the North Sea after acquiring large portfolios from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). 
Neptune has assets in a number of regions and is focused on gas, seen as the least-polluting fossil fuel.
In addition to returns, environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are an ever-growing concern for fund managers and their clients.
Unlike any other time, investors are likely to question a company seeking to list on its role in the transition to a lower carbon economy following the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.
""Sentiment in the market is not necessarily as strong as it used to be for oil and gas assets... we're moving towards a lower carbon economy,"" said Les Thomas, chief executive of Ithaca, owned by Israel's Delek Group, which last month acquired most of Chevron's North Sea assets for $2 billion.
Greek group Energean was one of a handful of energy companies to list in London in recent years, betting on Israeli gas production and long-term offtake agreements. Its shares have risen over 90% since listing last year.
""Oil price upside is not enough anymore. You have to offer investors at least partial, if not complete, security of a return on their investment regardless of commodity prices,"" Energean Chief Executive Mathios Rigas said.

""It's not enough to say I have this amazing geologist or knowledge of a basin or promise to find oil in frontier areas. To continue investing as an energy company only in oil, from an ESG perspective, is suicidal.""

513,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 01:40AM ET</span>",Having a gas: Australia dominates China's LNG supply,"By Henning Gloystein and Jessica Jaganathan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australia's fast-expanding liquefied natural gas industry has this year been supplying the lion's share of China's growing demand for imports of the commodity, with appetite surging as Beijing shifts away from dirtier fuels such as coal.
Australia supplied over 53% of China's LNG imports during the first five months of 2019, shipping data in Refinitiv showed, up from around 40% in 2016 when a previous round of new Australian export projects started to ramp up.
With Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude facility delivering its first LNG cargo this week from northwest Australia, that share is likely to increase further.
Prelude's start-up completes a $200 billion LNG construction boom that is putting Australia on track to surpass Qatar as the world's top exporter of the fuel.
""With uncertainty of demand in more traditional LNG markets ... China has emerged as the largest source of new LNG demand growth, and hence a focus for LNG marketing efforts for the next wave of Australian LNG volumes,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
(For a graphic on 'China LNG imports by origin' click https://tmsnrt.rs/2WJupsQ)
The export surge means Australia is well ahead of China's traditional main suppliers of gas such as Malaysia, Qatar and Indonesia, as well as newer exporter the United States.
The United States, which only started LNG exports in 2016, initially saw increases to China, supplying a peak of around 10% of its overall imports last year. But shipments have all but ceased after Beijing enacted a 25% tariff on U.S. supply as part of a tit-for-tat trade dispute with Washington.
""The China-U.S. trade dispute has had an impact on LNG markets. The tariffs make U.S. LNG much less cost-competitive for Chinese buyers, so they have to consider other options,"" said James Taverner of consultancy IHS Markit.
With production surging across the world, the Asian LNG market has become oversupplied just as demand stutters from traditional buyers like Japan, resulting in a 60% plunge in prices since last year to near record lows of just over $4 per million British thermal units.

SHIFT TO GAS
China's natural gas consumption has surged amid a gasification program that is shifting millions of households and a large number of factories to natural gas from coal. Global LNG producers are keen to meet that demand. 
However, some analysts warn that headwinds in China's economy could take the edge off demand for LNG.
""Coal-to-gas mandates have moderated in line with affordability ... and weakening economic growth will weigh on demand,"" Taverner said, adding that growth in LNG imports could ease over the next few years.
China also appears to be diversifying gas supply, potentially importing more from sources such as Russia and Mozambique, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said in a paper released this month.
""The 'Power of Siberia' line commissions at the end of this year and Russia will become China's most important new supplier in recent years,"" the firm said.

""China may also look more favorably on additional pipeline deals with Russia given its resource base and its desire to reach agreement on further gas projects.""

By Diego Oré
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An executive of China's Huawei, which has been banned from working with U.S. tech firms, said on Thursday that the telecoms giant is in the process of potentially launching its ""Hongmeng"" operating system (OS) to replace the U.S. Android OS.
Andrew Williamson, vice president of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's public affairs and communications, said in an interview that the company will ""presumably"" trademark Hongmeng.
President Donald Trump's administration last month put Huawei on a blacklist that barred it from doing business with U.S. tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, whose Android OS is used in Huawei's phones.
""Huawei is in the process of potentially launching a replacement,"" Williamson said in Mexico City. ""It's not something Huawei wants. We're very happy of being part of the Android family, but Hongmeng is being tested, mostly in China.""
""Presumably we'll be trying to put trademarks,"" he added.
Williamson said he expected 2019 revenue growth would be almost flat at around 20%, compared with last year's expansion of 19.5%. Huawei said in March its three main business groups were likely to post double-digit growth this year.
Williamson said that if trade tensions escalate into a full-blown trade war, Hongmeng would be ready to go ""in months."" 
Data from the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization shows that Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecoms network gear, has already applied to trademark Hongmeng in a number of countries.
Williamson said chipmakers knew that cutting off Huawei could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for their business.
""We're not specifically asking anyone to lobby for us. They're doing it by their own desire because, for many of them, Huawei is one of their major customers,"" he said.
Huawei has come under mounting scrutiny for over a year, led by U.S. allegations that ""back doors"" in its routers, switches and other gear could allow China to spy on U.S. communications.

The company has denied its products pose a security threat.

Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy expanded at the weakest pace since 2014 in the first quarter as exports, tourism and public investment slowed. Already $20 billion of spending on transport and logistics projects has been delayed because of a three-month impasse in forming a government. Growth may ebb to 3.6% in 2019 from 4.1% a year earlier, according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
“Foreign inflows are unlikely to be sustained as the main focus is now on the slowing economy,” said Win Phromphaet, the Bangkok-based chief investment officer at Principal Asset Management Co., which oversees about $4.8 billion of assets in Thailand. “Thai equities’ valuations will still be stretched as the weak economy will affect companies’ earnings growth.”
International funds, mostly index trackers, increased purchases of the nation’s stocks as MSCI Inc. announced the inclusion of non-voting depository receipts in its free-float calculations on May 28.
And while some funds continue to boost Thai holdings to match higher MSCI weightings, a clearer political outlook has also buoyed foreign buying, Pakorn Peetathawatchai, Stock Exchange of Thailand president, said June 6.
The return this month of junta leader Prayut Chan-Ocha as prime minister of an elected government eased concern about political unrest following a disputed general poll, sending the benchmark SET Index up 3.3% in June -- poised for its best monthly return since January. Still, the new administration has a razor-thin majority that may make it difficult to pass meaningful laws.
Weaker Profits
Thai company earnings in the second quarter are likely to deteriorate along with weaker economic growth, according to a report Tuesday from Bualuang Securities Pcl, the brokerage unit of Thailand’s biggest commercial bank.
Earnings at most locally-listed companies in the January-March period slid 9.3% from a year earlier, led by energy, petrochemical and commerce companies, according to a stock exchange statement dated May 27.
The nation’s shares are also trading at a historically higher average price-to-earnings ratio, said Mark Matthews, head of research at Bank Julius Baer & Co. in Singapore. Government spending has been “extremely weak” so far this year, and investors are hoping for a pickup, he said.
Thailand’s key stock index trades at about 15.7 times 12-month forecast earnings, compared with an average 15.5 multiple over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and more than 600 other companies urged U.S. President Donald Trump in a letter on Thursday to resolve the trade dispute with China, saying tariffs hurt American businesses and consumers.
This letter is the latest of many sent to the Trump administration by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, the national campaign against tariffs supported by more than 150 trade groups representing agriculture, manufacturing, retail and tech industries.
But it is significant as U.S.-China trade tensions escalate and comes before a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the June 28-29 G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. Trump has said he wants to meet Xi there and will decide on whether to extend tariffs to almost all Chinese imports after that.
With less than three weeks to go before talks between Chinese and U.S. leaders, expectations for progress toward ending the trade war are low. Sources have told Reuters there has been little preparation for a meeting even as the health of the world economy is at stake.
""We remain concerned about the escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs,"" the new letter sent on Thursday said. ""Broadly applied tariffs are not an effective tool to change China's unfair trade practices. Tariffs are taxes paid directly by U.S. companies ... not China.""
With less than three weeks to go before proposed talks between the Chinese and U.S. leaders, expectations for progress toward ending the trade war are low. Sources have told Reuters there has been little preparation for a meeting even as the health of the world economy is at stake.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Walmart, the largest U.S. private sector employer and the world's largest retailer, has said tariffs will increase prices for U.S. consumers.
""Trade overall has been good for Americans, good for consumers ... and I realize it gets criticized at times,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said last week. He urged the Trump administration focus on how trade helps a broad number of people in the country and ""not just those it harms.""
Additional 25% tariffs on $300 billion in imports, on top of those already levied, would wipe out more than 2 million U.S. jobs, the letter said, citing estimates from international consultancy the Trade Partnership. 
They would also add more than $2,000 in costs for the average American family of four and reduce the value of U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1%, it said. 
""An escalated trade war is not in the country's best interest, and both sides will lose,"" the letter said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chewy Inc said on Thursday it priced its initial public offering at $22 per share, above its target, and sold more stock than originally planned, valuing the online pet products retailer at $8.77 billion.
The IPO raises funds to help manage the debt load of parent company PetSmart, and indicates investor demand for a loss-making but fast-growing e-commerce company to tap into the roughly $70 billion U.S. pet industry market. 
Chewy's sales have rocketed from $26 million to $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2018. Its 2018 net loss narrowed to $267.9 million from $338.1 million in 2017.
Some 46.5 million Chewy shares were sold in the IPO, up from the anticipated 41.6 million as PetSmart sold more shares than originally planned. 
At $22 per share, PetSmart will receive almost $900 million from the sale of its stock. Chewy raised $123.2 million, which the company has said will be used for working capital and other expenses. 
Chewy had set a price range of $19 to $21 per share, which was raised earlier this week from $17 to $19 per share.
Chewy pitched its stock to investors as a way to buy into the trend of ""pet humanization"" by owners who are increasingly treating pets as a part of their families, as well as buying into an industry which has historically held up well in economic downturns.
Private equity firm BC Partners Inc acquired PetSmart for $8.7 billion in 2014, as it sought to capitalize on consumers lavishing their pets with expensive treats and gear. 
However, the company quickly faced strong headwinds as many customers snubbed its stores for the convenience of online shopping.
In response, PetSmart acquired Chewy in 2017, adding $2 billion to PetSmart's debt load to do the deal. The IPO values Chewy at almost three times the $3.35 billion PetSmart paid for the company. 
Chewy competes with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Blue Buffalo Pet Products, which was acquired by  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) last year. 
Chewy is trying to foster customer loyalty, an effort which has included sending bereavement cards to shoppers who have recently lost a pet. 
Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen sees plenty of growth left for the company and long gone are the company's early days when it struggled to attract capital. 
""There's still lots of penetration and growth to be had just within the U.S. market, there's continuing to expand internationally,"" Cohen, who stepped down as CEO of Chewy in 2018, said in an interview earlier this week. 
After the IPO, PetSmart and BC Partners will retain control of Chewy through their class B shares, which carry considerably more voting power than the class A shares investors in the IPO are buying. 
The IPO comes after PetSmart settled a dispute with lenders in April over the transfer of a portion of its stake in Chewy to certain PetSmart subsidiaries. 
Shares of Chewy are expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the symbol ""CHWY"".

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Allen & Co and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) are leading the 12-member underwriting team.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 10:07PM ET</span>","Fannie, Freddie government guarantee should be limited: U.S. housing finance chief","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said on Thursday that Congress should create a ""limited"" explicit guarantee for government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
""The explicit guarantee should be limited, clearly defined, and paid for,"" Mark Calabria told an audience in Washington.
Fannie and Freddie have operated under government conservatorship since they were bailed out during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Washington has struggled for years to devise a plan to safely return the companies, which guarantee over half of the nation’s mortgages, to the private sector.
In April, President Donald Trump appointed Calabria to spearhead the release of Fannie and Freddie from federal control. One key question for investors and the markets has been whether the housing giants would continue to enjoy some kind of government backstop when they return to the private realm.
Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg that he would prefer an explicit government backstop of Fannie and Freddie securities. That would make the debt extremely safe in the eyes of bond investors, even if the two companies were released from government control.
This week Calabria wrote to Congress asking lawmakers for more powers to overhaul the country's housing system, including the ability to boost competition by creating more GSE charters, FHFA said in its annual report to Congress. 
On Thursday, Calabria said that in addition to working with Congress, he will separately use his powers as FHFA director to pursue reforms that will help transition Fannie and Freddie into post-conservatorship, including reviewing their regulation, capital rules, and other programs.
The Department of Treasury has said it expects a complete overhaul of the agencies before they can be recapitalized and released to private ownership. It is expected to release a blueprint for the privatization process in coming weeks.
""We are still very much in the early stages of this process,"" Calabria said, adding that he is committed to engaging with Treasury to develop a responsible plan.

""We will move toward a new, reformed structure of our mortgage finance system that protects the American taxpayer, meets the housing needs of American families, and supports financial stability at home and abroad.""

Huawei's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested on U.S. fraud charges in Vancouver last December, will challenge Washington's extradition request at hearings that are set to begin next January.
China angrily demanded Canada release Meng and detained two Canadians on spying charges. It has also blocked imports of Canadian canola seed and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he fears further retaliation.
The Globe and Mail newspaper on Thursday said former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien had floated the idea of the government intervening to stop the extradition case and thereby improve ties with Beijing.
""When it comes to Ms Meng there has been no political interference ... and that is the right way for extradition requests to proceed,"" Freeland told a televised news conference in Washington.
""It would be a very dangerous precedent indeed for Canada to alter its behavior when it comes to honoring an extradition treaty in response to external pressure,"" she added, saying to do so could make Canadians around the world less safe.
Canadian officials say they see no prospect of relations with China improving until Meng's future is resolved.
Trudeau said last week he would look at whether it was ""appropriate or desirable"" to seek a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Japan later this month.

Trudeau plans to visit Washington for talks on June 20 which will address the case of the two detained Canadians.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking watchdog on Friday said it had imposed stricter licensing conditions on AMP Ltd's pension fund units following concerns regarding its compliance with superannuation laws, sending its shares down more than 4%.
The move comes as the country's largest listed wealth manager works to rebuild its brand after revelations of serious wrongdoing at an inquiry into the financial sector last year, including the charging of fees for services not rendered.
Responding to the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA), the 170-year-old company said it would ""fully implement"" the additional requirements dictated by the regulator at pension fund units AMP Superannuation Limited and N.M. Superannuation Proprietary Limited, collectively known as AMP Super.
Neither APRA nor AMP disclosed details of the conditions.
""We have been working constructively with APRA on this matter and have already taken action on a number of the issues raised,"" AMP said in a statement.
Areas APRA said required attention included conflicts of interest, governance, risk management practices, remediation processes and accountability mechanisms.
Since the Royal Commission drew revelations of misconduct, Australia's oldest wealth manager has struggled to sell its products and instead has seen clients pull out billions of dollars worth of assets.
The firm is due to report its latest cash flow statement and strategy update on Aug. 8.
AMP is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of pension fund account holders claiming overcharging of fees.
​Sean Sequeira, chief investment officer at Alleron Investment Management, said he expected AMP would be able to comply with any new conditions, but the regulator's move would make it even harder for the company to win clients.
""In regards to finding, keeping and managing all of their clients and even one day grow their client base, it makes their job harder when the regulator comes out and says they will be imposing further conditions on them,"" he said.

Shares of AMP were trading down 4.4% at $2.14, while the broader market was 0.1% lower.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook on Thursday to discuss trade and other hot-button issues facing the tech company as Trump deliberates whether to make good on his threat to hike tariffs on imports from China.
Trump's meeting with Cook was disclosed by daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump during an event that Trump held with governors on skills development.
Cook is a frequent visitor to the White House and has worked with Ivanka Trump on her job training and education initiatives. The president often name-checks Cook as a business leader who has brought jobs and investment back to the United States.
On Thursday, Trump spoke with Cook about ""trade, U.S. investment, immigration and privacy,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said. A spokesperson for Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.
The meeting comes as Trump weighs whether to go ahead with proposed increases to tariffs in his trade war with China. He has said he will make a decision some time after the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan at the end of June, where he hopes to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Trump is using tariffs to push Xi to change a host of Chinese trade practices, but negotiations have flagged. Makers of consumer electronics like phones and tablets have escaped the brunt of tariffs to this point but likely would be affected by the next hike.

U.S. authorities are also preparing to probe market power of large technology companies, according to sources. Cook has defended his company, saying it has a moderate share of the market and is not too large.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden on Thursday took umbrage with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's $0 federal tax bill in 2018 and said no company making billions in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.
""I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth,"" Biden said in a tweet.
The former U.S. vice president's remark comes at a time when Amazon has been repeatedly criticized for paying no U.S. federal income taxes on more than $11 billion in profits before taxes in 2018. 
The company also received a $129 million tax rebate from the federal government.
Amazon responded saying in a tweet that it had paid $2.6 billion in corporate taxes since 2016.
""We pay every penny we owe,"" Amazon said, adding: ""Congress designed tax laws to encourage companies to reinvest in the American economy. We have.""
Amazon said it has invested $200 billion since 2011 and created 300,000 U.S. jobs. 
""Assume VP Biden's complaint is (with) the tax code, not Amazon,"" the company tweeted.
Amazon told Reuters in May its low tax bill mainly stemmed from stock-based employee compensation, the Republican tax cuts of 2017, carry forward losses from years when the company was not profitable and tax credits for massive investments in R&D.
Biden is not the first Democratic presidential candidate to call out Amazon over its taxes. 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has said Amazon paying nothing in federal taxes is a ""disgrace"" and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will tax Amazon's profits as well to ensure the largest American corporations do not pay zero corporate income tax. 

The political scrutiny also comes as antitrust regulators have put the Seattle-based company under the watch of the Federal Trade Commission, which is gearing up to investigate whether Amazon misused its massive market power.

(Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, said on Thursday the odds of the United States sliding into a recession in the next six months have risen to 40-45% and the odds were 65% within the next year.
Gundlach, who oversees more than $130 billion in assets under management, said the yield curve and the New York Fed recession probability showed a rising chance of recession.
""Several indicators suggest a recession could take place in one year,"" Gundlach said on an investor website, adding consumer indicators point to ""the front edge of a recession.""
Earlier this year, he said a recession was not on the horizon, but the U.S.-China trade war and the weak momentum of the global economy have raised red flags for him. 
Gundlach said the Fed probably will not cut rates in June but likely will later in summer. Gundlach says the bond market indicates the Fed will cut rates by a quarter percentage point either two or three times by year end. 
As for the bond market, Gundlach, who has long forecasted 6% on the 10-year Treasury yield by the next presidential election or a year after, said if the government would not get involved in the manipulation in bond yields, the 10-year bond yield would rise to 6% by 2021. The 10-year yield is currently about 2.1%
If the United States starts heading on the path to 6%, the Fed ""will not let the market price"" and ""manipulate interest rates down,"" Gundlach said. 
Gundlach said he is not backtracking on his 6% investment call. ""We will go to 6% for sure if there is true free market pricing. The Fed has added a lot of information this year, which is contradictory to prior information,"" he said.
As for the investing environment, he said 2019 is opposite of last year's: ""Gold is making money, bitcoin is making money, stocks are making money, bonds are making money,"" Gundlach said.
""I'd rather own gold than bitcoin,"" he said. 
Gundlach said the S&P 500 Index has outperformed the major tech stocks since mid-2018, which he thinks will be the peak of the stock market. Gundlach says U.S. deficits ""are showing no signs of going away"" and that the budget deficits may get ""much, much worse in the next recession.""
Overall, Gundlach said the U.S. government has a very bad debt-to-income problem, even in a supposedly growing economy. Gundlach says true liabilities of the U.S. government are around $23 trillion to $24 trillion. 

Gundlach said if the budget deficit and current account deficit increase, that could be a precursor for a further decline in the dollar.

(Reuters) - Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc on Thursday warned of a broad slowdown in chip demand, blaming a trade conflict between the United States and China and export restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and the chipmaker cut its revenue forecast for the year by 8%.
Shares of the San Jose, California-based company fell 8% to $258.75 in extended trading and the remarks dragged down stocks of other chipmakers, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions.
""It is clear that the U.S.-China trade conflict including the Huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility,"" Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a conference call with analysts.
Shares of Broadcom have been under pressure after the U.S. government put Huawei on a trade blacklist last month. Huawei accounted for about $900 million, or 4%, of the company's overall sales last year.
Tan said that if consumer demand for smartphones remains steady, other phone makers could start taking Huawei's market share, and those phone makers are likely to buy chips from Broadcom. However, he cautioned that the process will take up to six months.
""What's the impact of the Huawei ban on a company like us selling components and technology? Well, short term, keep in mind we'll see a very sharp impact simply because (there are) no purchases allowed and there's no obvious substitution in place,"" Tan said.
Revenue from semiconductor solutions, Broadcom's biggest business unit, fell 10% to $4.09 billion in the second quarter, while revenue from its infrastructure software business came in at $1.41 billion
Demand for enterprise and mainframe software remained stable, mainly in North America and Europe, Tan said.
The company, known for communications chips that power Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS connectivity in smartphones, lowered its full-year revenue forecast by $2 billion to $22.50 billion, saying that its customers are actively reducing inventory levels.
Net revenue rose to $5.52 billion in the quarter ended May 5, from $5.01 billion a year earlier, but missed analysts' estimates of $5.68 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to ordinary shares fell to $691 million, or $1.64 per share, in the quarter, from $3.72 billion, or $8.33 per share, a year earlier. (https://reut.rs/2F8Mgyt)

529,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 06:24PM ET</span>","U.S. denies Tesla, GM, Uber 25% Chinese tariff relief","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is expanding efforts to block the use of Chinese technology in advanced vehicles, denying additional requests by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for tariff relief on key components of its electric vehicles, and rejecting ride-hailing company Uber's petition to waive tariffs on electric scooters and at least 50 separate requests by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
After the United States slapped 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports last year under the two countries' trade dispute, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) allowed companies to petition for exemptions. 
Government documents show the USTR rejected requests to exempt Tesla's Model 3 car computer and center screen in May 29 letters, saying they both concern ""a product strategically important or related to 'Made in China 2025,' or other Chinese industrial programs."" 
In May, Reuters reported that USTR had rejected a separate request by Tesla to exempt the company's Autopilot ""brain"" from the tariffs.
The more than 50 requests by GM rejected by USTR were for exemptions from Chinese-made parts used in vehicles including electronic controllers used for high voltage battery controls in hybrid and electric vehicles. It also rejected GM requests for high frequency antennas, push-button ignition switches, battery cables, electric motor parts and brake parts.GM declined to comment. In filings it said that some parts were not available outside China or that it would be cost prohibitive to shift production elsewhere.
The USTR denied Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's request on May 29 for an exemption from the 25% tariff for its Chinese-made electric bikes that customers rent through its app. Uber declined to comment.
USTR also rejected dozens of requests by Nissan Motor Co. It denied nearly two dozen requests from Fiat Chrysler for parts including wire harnesses and an electrical power steering pump used in vehicles like the company's 2019 Ram 1500 and Jeep Wrangler.
Fiat Chrysler warned USTR in one request that without exemptions it will ""reduce its margins, pass the additional cost onto consumers, or some combination of the two."" 
The denials of relief for more than 7,000 products to date out of 13,000 requests illustrate a systematic approach by the Trump administration to thwart China's efforts to develop high-technology industries that Washington alleges benefited from theft and forced transfer of U.S. intellectual property.
Tesla had warned that increased tariffs on the car computer it has dubbed the ""brains"" of the Model 3 causes ""economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.""
Tesla had also urged the office to approve a request by its supplier SAS Automotive USA Inc, builder of the touchscreen control screen for the Model 3, which displays navigation, media, audio and other functions.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said in an April 29 securities filing that ""costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from China.""
Shares of Tesla were off earlier highs after Reuters first reported the decisions, but closed up 2.2% at $213.91 on the Nasdaq.
Tesla said in its tariff exemption request that ""choosing any other supplier would have delayed the (Model 3) program by 18 months with clean room setup, line validation and staff training.""
China's ""Made in China 2025"" strategy is focused on 10 strategic advanced manufacturing industries including new energy vehicles, where it aims to be a global leader.
Reuters reported previously that U.S. trade officials also rejected on May 29 separate requests from GM and Chinese-owned Volvo Cars for an exemption to the 25% U.S. tariff on their sport utility vehicles made in China.
Both GM and Volvo Cars, a unit of Geely, had not raised the sticker price to account for tariffs, which came into play last July.
GM's Buick Envision, a midsize SUV with a starting price of about $35,000, has become a target for U.S. critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.

USTR has also rejected dozens of other requests by suppliers for major auto companies.

(Reuters) - U.S.-based equity funds attracted $4.4 billion of inflows in the week ended Wednesday, following two consecutive weeks of cash outflows totaling $34 billion, according to Refinitiv's Lipper, as the United States and Mexico struck a deal to avert tariffs. 
U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds - which move in sympathy with equity flows - attracted more than $1.7 billion of inflows in the week ended Wednesday, also following two straight weeks of cash withdrawals, Lipper said.
Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper, said it was ""definitely a risk-on week"" with net new money into corporate investment-grade bond funds of more than $4 billion.
""Interestingly, though, we saw retail investors being net redeemers of equity funds at negative $4.9 billion, while authorized participants were net purchasers of equity ETFs at plus $9.4 billion. So once again it was a tale of two cities,"" Roseen said. 
Mom-and-pop investors ""appear to be content sitting on the sidelines until the trade deals are completed, parking cash into the money market funds of more than $12.9 billion,"" he said.
Mom-and-pop investors are also putting money into select bond fund classifications: corporate investment-grade debt funds of plus-$1.2 billion and municipal bond funds of plus-$887 million, their 23rd consecutive week of net inflows.

1. Retail Sales, Consumer Sentiment Data on Tap
Retailers have woken up from their slumber, with the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) on track to record its second consecutive weekly win after previously falling for four-straight weeks.
Friday's retail sales figures will give investors insight into the health of the consumer, whose willingness to spend has been supported by a healthy labor market.
The Commerce Department will release the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:50 GMT).
On average, economists expect that retail sales rose 0.6% last month and that core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, rose 0.3%. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP – is expected to slow from last month's 1.1% print.
The University of Michigan releases its preliminary measure of May consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Consumer sentiment is expected to fall to 98.1, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. The expectations component is forecast to fall 92.
2. Rig Counts Roll 
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production, which continues to flirt with record highs.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell by 11 to 816.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Oil prices, despite a surge on Thursday, remain on course to end the week in the red following a slump earlier this week amid US-China trade tensions and data showing an expected build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
As well as higher domestic crude stockpiles, expectations for lower oil-demand growth has also kept a lid on prices.
The Energy Information Administration downgraded its expectations for oil demand, while OPEC also cut its forecasts on expectations for a lower demand from the OECD regions.
Crude futures on Thursday settled 2.2% higher at $52.22 a barrel.
3. China Data Watch 
With the U.S.-China trade war no closer to reaching a resolution, investors are keen to get a sense of whether China's economic rebound is in trouble and will likely look to a deluge of data on industrial production, fixed asset investment, and loan growth from the world's second largest economy due overnight.
Economists forecast industrial output rose 5.4% in the 12 months to April, unchanged from a month ago, while expansion in the year-to-date private sector investment, an important driver of growth, was also expected to remain unchanged at 6.1%, though still within the historic low of 5.3% reached in September.
New loans will also be under the spotlight after rebounding in May, as policymakers ramp up cheap loans to support smaller companies struggling with weaker demand both at home and abroad amid pressure from U.S. tariffs.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose levies on $300 billion additional Chinese products if his counterpart Xi Jinping fails to attend the G20 meeting in Tokyo, scheduled for June 28-29."
534,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 05:07PM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Rises Despite Oil Tensions ,"Investing - Stocks finished higher Thursday despite worries about Middle East tensions after two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman.
The S&P 500 finished up 0.41%. The Nasdaq Composite finished 0.57% higher and the Dow Jones industrials rose 0.39%.
The averages were all higher, with the Dow up as many as 142 points, when the potential for disruption of crucial Middle East oil supplies seemed to creep into investors' thinking. That trimmed the early gains by half or more. A very late bout of buying boosted the averages at the close, with the Dow rising 40 points in the last nine minutes of the regular session.
The rally was supported by lower interest rates. The 10-Year yield fell to 2.098%.
Airlines had a strong day, thanks to an upgrade for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), up 6.4%, and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) moved up 4.4% because of a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report extolling the potential of Disney's streaming service, due to launch in November.
American Airlines was the top-gaining S&P 500 stock because it was able to boost fares last month, and the increases have stuck while fuel prices have moved lower in the last month. Disney, third-best among S&P 500 stocks, was the top percentage and point gainer among the 30 Dow stocks.
Energy was the market's leading sector on the day, thanks to rebounding oil prices, the product of renewed unease in the Middle East. WTI futures rose 2.23% to $52.28 after falling about 4% on Wednesday. Brent futures rose $1.34 to $61.31.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) rose modestly. But such stocks as Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and offshore boat company Tidewater (NYSE:TDW) rose 2% or more.
Prices rose after attacks on two tankers sailing through the Straight of Oman. The United States said Iran was the aggressor, though that could not be confirmed. There have been two other tanker attacks in the Persian Gulf, through which about 20% of the world's oil flows.
Healthcare stocks were the market laggards.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), three of the biggest pharmaceutical stocks, were the Dow laggards on the day.
Big tech stocks were mostly higher, led by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the biggest market caps, saw small gains. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) dipped slightly

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after two days of declines, as energy shares rebounded with oil on concerns of a supply disruption following attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States has assessed that Iran is responsible for the attacks, which occurred near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil consumption passes.
Oil futures settled more than 2% higher, while the S&P 500 energy index gained 1.3%, the most of the 11 major sectors.
""We're meandering here with strength in the oil sector because that's where the market-moving news is today,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
While the gains in energy shares helped the market, the tanker attacks added to potential worries for investors.
""There are still concerns over geopolitical risk,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
Stocks have had a strong run in June so far on hopes the Federal Reserve will act to counter a slowing global economy due to the escalating trade war with China. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up about 5% so far for the month.
But caution ahead of the Fed meeting next week and the Group of 20 summit at the end of the month limited the day's advance. Markets have been anticipating an interest rate cut at some point this year.
""The market is waiting to hear from the Fed... and whether they will deviate at all from their latest stance - and I call it an active dovish position - and to see if they continue to lay the groundwork for a rate cut perhaps later in the summer,"" Krosby said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 101.94 points, or 0.39%, to 26,106.77, the S&P 500 gained 11.8 points, or 0.41%, to 2,891.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.41 points, or 0.57%, to 7,837.13.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co shares gained 4.4%, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost, after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its forecast for Disney Plus subscriber growth. 
On the trade front, there were doubts of any improvement in what President Donald Trump called ""testy"" trade relations with China in the run-up to the G20.
Several companies including furniture chain RH cited the potential impact of higher tariffs on their businesses in reports after the bell Wednesday, though RH said it has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs and raised its outlook for the year.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) shares fell 3.1% after brokerage Moffett Nathanson said it expects the social media company's costs to rise and revenue growth to slow.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.66-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 64 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.99 billion shares, compared to the 6.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative's Office rejected Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's request for relief from 25% tariffs imposed on Chinese-made electric bicycles, according to a May 29 letter.
The ""Jump"" bikes that operate in more than a dozen U.S. cities were among $16 billion in Chinese products hit by the Trump administration with new tariffs in August. 
Uber did not immediately comment but noted that 96% of electric bikes sold in the United States are made in China and said the tariffs have ""caused disproportionate harm to the innovation and competitiveness of U.S. digital transportation platforms.""
Separately, USTR rejected California startup Bird Rides Inc's request for tariff relief from Chinese-made electric scooters after the company said it did not have an alternative to Chinese low-speed scooters.
""American innovation created and is poised to dominate a brand-new industry worth tens of billions of dollars, despite attempts by foreign imitators to copy Bird’s success,"" the company wrote USTR.

USTR said Bird ""failed to show that the imposition of additional duties on the particular product would cause severe economic harm to you or other U.S. interests.""

Target said Shipt shoppers can now order about 65,000 items on Target.com and have it delivered on the same day by paying a fee of $9.99 per order for shipment. 
Target is using Shipt, the membership-based grocery delivery platform it bought for $550 million in 2017, for delivery. Earlier, Target offered same-day delivery only for Shipt members at an annual fee of $99.

The move follows e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's announcement in April of a plan to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club Prime in just one day. A month later, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) also announced a free one-day shipping for orders worth at least $35 in some markets.

Judge Victor Marrero of U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York set the hearing for June 21, in response to a request for an expedited hearing. 
Ten states, led by New York and California, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday aimed at stopping the merger of the No. 3 and No. 4 national wireless companies, saying that the deal would cost Sprint and T-Mobile subscribers more than $4.5 billion annually.
The Federal Communications Commission has agreed in principle to approve the deal while the U.S. Justice Department is believed to be nearing a final decision.
The companies have offered to sell the Boost brand currently owned by Sprint to reduce the combined company's market share in the prepaid business. They have also indicated they were considering divesting wireless spectrum.
T-Mobile indicated in a filing on Thursday that its attorneys will include George Cary and David Gelfand, who oversaw litigation at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division during the Obama administration when there were at least three major merger challenges.

Sprint has filed that its attorneys will include Karen Hoffman Lent and Steven Sunshine of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, who have handled some of the biggest antitrust cases in the past 10 years.

539,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 04:05PM ET</span>",Michael Avenatti is sued for allegedly siphoning paraplegic's $4 million settlement,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who represented porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against U.S. President Donald Trump, has been sued by a paraplegic former client who accused him of siphoning away a $4 million settlement he had won.
Geoffrey Johnson is seeking at least $9.5 million, plus punitive damages, from Avenatti and several former colleagues in his civil lawsuit filed with the Orange County Superior Court in California.
""I never thought I would get victimized by my own attorney,"" Johnson, who uses a wheelchair, said at a press conference on Thursday. ""I wish he had just given me my money.""
Johnson's claims are also part of federal prosecutors' criminal case against Avenatti, who has pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, bank fraud, extortion and other charges, including defrauding other clients, in California and New York.
""Mr. Johnson's claims are categorically false and frivolous, and his case will be thrown out of court,"" Avenatti said in an email.
Avenatti drew national attention through his representation of Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits against Trump and the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen, and briefly flirted with a 2020 White House run.
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS
Johnson said he obtained the $4 million settlement with Los Angeles County in January 2015 over injuries he sustained by jumping from an elevated floor in a downtown Los Angeles jail, in the second of two attempted suicides in August 2011.
He said he had mental health issues when he was wrongly arrested in April 2011, and tried to kill himself after enduring abuse by sheriff's deputies and other inmates at the jail.
The June 11 complaint accused Avenatti of draining nearly all of the $4 million settlement, while paying Johnson roughly $1,900 a month to lull him into thinking his money was safe.
Johnson also said Avenatti lied to the Social Security Administration about the monthly payments, costing him needed supplemental benefits.
""On a 1-to-100 scale, the despicability of his conduct ranks 1,000,"" Johnson's lawyer Daniel Callahan said at the press conference, referring to Avenatti. ""It is off-the-charts bad.""
Johnson also accused Avenatti's former colleagues Michael Eagan, Jason Frank and Scott Sims at the Eagan Avenatti law firm of covering up his activities.
The firm filed for bankruptcy protection in March, and there has been litigation among its former lawyers.
Eric George, a lawyer for Frank, called him ""as much a victim of Michael Avenatti as anyone else. It is regrettable that Mr. Johnson's lawyers are misdirecting their claims.""
Sims, in an email, said he has evidence that Avenatti ""stole Mr. Johnson's settlement money,"" and alerted federal authorities. ""We are appalled by Mr. Avenatti's conduct and hope that Mr. Johnson obtains justice against Mr. Avenatti,"" he said.
Eagan was not immediately available for comment.
""PILE ON""
Prosecutors had in April said Avenatti diverted some of the $4 million to finance his coffee shop business and a lavish lifestyle, and gave Johnson only about $124,000.
In his email, Avenatti said Johnson would have been convicted ""but for my assistance,"" and had previously acknowledged in writing that he had always acted ethically when representing him.
He called the lawsuit ""part of a 'pile on' publicity stunt to smear me.""
In addition to the $4 million and punitive damages, Johnson is seeking at least $500,000 for lost Social Security benefits and $5 million for severe emotional distress and other damages.
The criminal case also accuses Avenatti of trying to extort more than $20 million from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to college basketball recruits, and misappropriating from Daniels nearly $300,000 of payments for her memoir. 

If convicted on all charges, Avenatti could face more than 400 years in prison, but would likely face a lesser punishment.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been riding a wave optimism thanks partly to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s chip-shortage woes. The chipmaker has been scooping up new business at the lower end of market, providing chips to manufacturers who haven't been able to source them from Intel.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil wants Chinese investment in infrastructure projects as long as investors create local jobs and play by Brazilian rules, Vice President Hamilton Mourao told Reuters in an interview.
Mourao met with Chinese leader Xi Jingping in China last month as part of efforts to maintain warm relations with Brazil's top trading partner. While campaigning last year, President Jair Bolsonaro had warned that China was trying to ""buy Brazil,"" but he has since taken a more pragmatic approach.
In a Wednesday interview in Brasilia, Mourao said Brazilian infrastructure was hindering productivity and Chinese investment is welcome as long as it follows local rules.
""A Chinese company cannot arrive here and bring 100,000 Chinese people to work in Brazil,"" he said.
He added that he had not spoken with the Chinese about any particular infrastructure projects during his trip, but that he saw room for Chinese investment in rail, road and port projects. 
Regarding the trade war between the United States and China, Mourao described Brazil's position as ""pragmatic and flexible,"" seeking to make decisions in the Brazilian interest without taking sides. 
Despite a deal with Washington for the United States to safeguard U.S. space technology at Brazil's Alcantara launch site near the equator, China could also become a partner at the base, he said. 
Mourao said China had not expressed any particular interest in such an agreement, but he noted that science and technology cooperation was an area of potential growth between the nations. 
Mourao also reiterated that Chinese telecom company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd would not be excluded from operating a fifth-generation (5G) mobile telecoms network in Latin America's largest economy, but would be expected to play fair.

Mourao, who met with Huawei Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei on a trip to China last month said: ""I have spoke clearly with the CEO of Huawei, and told him they have to give us confidence that ... the data they have will not be put in the hands of the Chinese (government).""

543,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 02:45PM ET</span>",U.S. healthcare stocks shielded from political pressures prove profitable,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare investors have found success this year buying stocks of companies whose products improve eyesight, treat pets and fix crooked teeth, all viewed as unlikely to fall victim to political and regulatory issues pressuring a wide swath of the sector.
The S&P 500 healthcare sector overall has underperformed the broader stock market this year. But a number of companies have posted standout returns even as healthcare reform and prescription drug pricing loom as hot topics with the 2020 presidential election campaign heating up.
“The reason that people have been gravitating toward names like these is they feel more comfortable that they are less susceptible,” said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager who focuses on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York. 
""People are trying to stay away from anything that is viewed as susceptible to headline risk.""
The healthcare sector, which accounts for 14% of the S&P 500 benchmark stock index, is due for another test later this month, when the Democratic Party holds its first presidential debates. 
Healthcare is poised to be a prominent issue, with left-leaning candidates embracing government-run Medicare for All plans. At the same time, the high cost of medicines has drawn attention from Democrats as well as President Donald Trump and his Republican party.
So far this year, the S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed 5.5%, well below the roughly 15% return for the overall S&P 500.
(Graphic: How healthcare stocks stack up in 2019 link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XdKqGU)
Shares of many health insurers, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and pharmacy services companies have lagged.
But a number of large-cap healthcare stocks have thrived in 2019, generally benefiting from factors specific to their businesses as well as from their place away from the political glare afflicting others in the sector.
For example, shares of Mettler-Toledo International and Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), which specialize in equipment used for drug development and research laboratories, are up 43% and 27.5%, respectively. Shares of animal health company  Zoetis Inc  (NYSE:ZTS) have climbed 30%, while contact lens company Cooper Cos Inc has seen its stock price jump 29%.
(Graphic: Healthcare stock winners and losers in 2019 link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2R7zsgm).
In general, life-science tool makers, medical device companies and animal health firms are ""all higher growth and they all have low healthcare reform risk,"" said Martin Jarzebowski, sector head of healthcare for Federated Investors.
""Those two things in combination mean that those best-performing names are safe havens amid both economic and regulatory uncertainty,"" Jarzebowski said. ""That’s the glue behind all of them.""
Earnings for S&P 500 healthcare companies are expected to rise by 6.2% in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, more than twice the 2.7% earnings growth expected for the S&P 500 overall, despite the market's strong performance this year.
(Graphic: Putting up profits in healthcare link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2X1OcTB).
Two of the three top-performing S&P 500 healthcare stocks so far in 2019 are in the dental space. Shares of Dentsply Sirona Inc and Align Technology Inc have jumped 53% and 49%, respectively in 2019. Shares of biotechnology company Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) are up about 51% this year because it is being acquired by drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). Bristol, by comparison, is down 9% this year.
Dentsply Sirona, which makes an array of products found in the dentist's office, is a ""turnaround story"" after a rough 2018 for the shares, said William Blair analyst John Kreger. New products and a solid first-quarter report have helped the stock, he said.
Align Technology, which specializes in clear aligners that straighten teeth, saw its shares sell off late last year with tech and growth stocks as the market swooned. Along with those other stocks, shares of Align are rebounding as they also benefit from lessening concerns about competitive price pressures, Kreger said.
""No one is really talking about reforming dental and how dental is provided,"" Kreger said. ""The idea is you can get the growth potential without the regulatory uncertainty or the political uncertainty.""
Healthcare's overall sluggishness this year means the sector looks relatively cheap. It now trades at 14.8 times forward earnings estimates compared to 16.2 times for the S&P 500, according to Refinitiv data. The sector and the broader market began the year with similar valuations.
(Graphic: Healthcare stock valuations link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rh9FCv).
Healthcare, a topic that helped Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, is likely to come into the spotlight when a crowded field of Democratic candidates meet on June 26 and 27 for the party's first presidential debates.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who tallied the most support in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this month, is seen by investors as likely to back more moderate healthcare reform efforts than left-leaning candidates, such as U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Should Sanders, who advocates Medicare for All, or other candidates with similar views gain more prominence, the healthcare sector could face increased pressure.

""I think there’s more potential downside to the debates,"" McRoberts said.

Airbus, which declined to comment, is trying to cement the launch of its longest-range single-aisle jet at the Paris Airshow next week. 
Indigo Partners, which also declined comment, buys aircraft on behalf of four airlines in which it holds stakes, using its bulk purchasing power to squeeze lower prices from planemakers. 
Led by airlines investor Bill Franke, Indigo Partners placed a record order for 430 narrow-body Airbus A320neo-family jets spread among four low-cost carriers in 2017.
Airbus hopes to persuade the veteran airlines promoter to invest in a longer-range version of the same aircraft family. 
The European planemaker is widely expected to announce the launch of the roughly 4,500-mile A321XLR model at the showcase event in Paris on June 17-23. The model will enter service in late 2023 or early 2024.
It was not immediately clear to what extent a new Indigo Partners deal would involve conversions from existing models included in the big 2017 order.
American Airlines Group is also considering the A321XLR as one new aircraft option, an American source said, but noted that it was premature to discuss whether any potential order would be new or a conversion of existing Airbus orders.
Airbus is expected to insist that airlines wanting to reserve some of the early production slots reserved for the A321XLR must place new orders, though it is also likely to allow buyers to trade some existing purchases for the new jet.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) had a similar mix of new orders and conversions when it announced the Boeing 737 MAX 10 in 2017.

Asked by shareholders on Wednesday about new aircraft purchases, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said ""there's nothing that we haven't announced coming to us"".

""The overall economic burden will hurt China more than it hurts us,"" said Larry Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council.
The White House intends for President Donald Trump to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Japan later this month, though the meeting is not ""formalized"" yet, Kudlow said.
The United States kicked off a tariff battle with China in 2018, seeking sweeping structural changes from Beijing. But tensions between Washington and Beijing rose sharply in May after the Trump administration accused China of reneging on promises to make structural economic changes during months of trade talks.

Trump has said he would decide after G20, the meeting of the leaders of the world's largest economies, whether to carry out a threat to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese goods.

549,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 01:27PM ET</span>",StockBeat - Disney Gets Morgan Stanley Lift on Optimism Over Streaming Service,"Investing.com – Shares of  Disney  racked up gains on Thursday, as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it expected the media giant's streaming services would win over new subscribers faster than previously expected.
Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) to $160 from $135, sending its shares up 4.2% higher by 1:25 p.m. ET (17:12 GMT). The bullish view on Disney comes as the media giant has expedited the launch of its streaming service, Disney+, and bolstered its catalog of content.
Disney has been the top performer among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday, adding about 39 points to the Dow's 97-point gain. 
The investment house estimates that Disney+ should bring in 130 million global subscribers by 2024, in line with company's own new guidance.
""Our willingness to underwrite these higher DTC (direct-to-consumer) estimates stems from 1) a faster-than-expected global launch, 2) more IP aggregated more quickly than anticipated, and 3) a plan to leverage third-party distribution,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Despite the U.S. launch of Disney+ still months away, there has been much fanfare over its upcoming streaming service.
A survey by Ampere Analysis last week revealed that customer awareness of the service is widespread, and a significant part of those polled plan to subscribe for the digital platform when it launches in November. More than 1,000 respondents were polled, with 22% confirming plans to subscribe to the service.
With the streaming wars set to widen in the months to come, Wall Street is seemingly betting on Disney to lead the charge against leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), whose growth in its core U.S. market has come under scrutiny.
“Netflix appears to be nearing its peak subscriber point in the U.S.,” said PwC in its Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2019–2023 report, released earlier this month. ""The first-mover advantage in streaming video that Netflix has capitalized on to date continues to be eroded, as the industry begins to fragment, with more and more companies entering the market, from pay-TV heavyweights to specialized, niche players,” PwC added.
Disney+ is expected to launch in North America on Nov, 12.
Disney shares are up about 28.4% this year, fourth best among the Dow stocks, after ending 2018 with just a 2% gain."

552,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","In VW Chattanooga vote, UAW seeks elusive U.S. southern toehold","By Nick Carey
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (Reuters) - For the second time in five years, workers at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's Chattanooga, Tennessee, assembly plant have been voting this week on whether to unionize, potentially handing the United Auto Workers its first toehold in the U.S. South.
The vote by 1,700 workers at VW's Chattanooga plant, which makes the Passat sedan and the Atlas SUV, comes at a pivotal time for the UAW. Its membership fell 8% last year and the union faces contentious contract talks this summer with Detroit automakers General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
The result in Tennessee could mark a small but significant step toward the UAW's cherished goal of unionizing foreign automakers. In 2014, VW's Chattanooga workers voted against unionization by a small margin, extending the UAW's decades-long losing streak in the South.
The latest organizing vote has been opposed by prominent Republican elected officials in Tennessee and is expected to be close. Voting began on Wednesday and polls close late Friday.
Pro-union VW workers complain of lax health and safety procedures, of quality of life issues such as constant last-minute changes in scheduling, insufficient vacation time and small bonuses. 
""This is not about a pay raise,"" said Steven Fugat, 26. ""I just want some stability, I want to know when I have to work and when I get to be with my family or helping out at my church."" 
Fugat makes $20 an hour hanging tires, installing consoles, seats and rearview mirrors on Atlas and Passat vehicles near the end of the assembly line.
""I want respect for my time and we are ready for a change for the good,"" he said. 
UAW faces membership challenge: https://tmsnrt.rs/2I4S0wa
Detroit automakers pay more for unionized workers: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WE3UEM
Pro-union workers allege VW has argued against unionization in daily meetings, but a company spokeswoman said it respected ""the right of our employees to decide."" 
In January, the German automaker said it would invest $800 million to build a new electric vehicle in Chattanooga starting in 2022, creating 1,000 new jobs.
When asked if a vote for unionization could affect that plan VW's spokeswoman said the automaker's commitment ""is unchanged.""
VW also has workers on the factory floor who oppose the UAW.
Keri Menendez, 44, said her problem was not with organized labor but with the UAW, which has struggled with a wide-ranging federal corruption probe.
So far seven people linked to the union and Fiat Chrysler have been sentenced in the investigation into illegal payouts to UAW officials. The UAW and the automaker insist only a few individuals were involved.
""Corruption has been a problem for the UAW,"" said Menendez, a team leader on the line making $23.50 an hour. ""They're more interested in their own business than caring for people."" 
Republican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said in a statement it was ""deeply concerning that an organization with such a troubled past could soon force their grip onto workers in Chattanooga.""
FALLING MEMBERSHIP
At its peak in 1979, the UAW represented 1.5 million workers. Last year, after nine years of gains, membership dropped again to below 400,000.
The union's gains in recent years had come mostly from unionizing casino workers, graduate students and nurses instead of automotive workers.
Brandi Ginger, 43, who works in quality control at the VW plant, dislikes that history of decline.
""How can an organization that has fallen that far ever be considered successful?"" she asked. 
Maury Nicely, a Chattanooga attorney who oversees Southern (NYSE:SO) Momentum, an anti-UAW group, said the union would scare away other potential investors and ""render us less competitive."" 
A victory in Chattanooga would give the UAW a psychological boost, but the major manufacturing operations of Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd lie further south in states like Alabama and Mississippi that lack Tennessee's history of partial unionization - GM, for instance, has a plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
""A win at VW would give the UAW bragging rights,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. ""But a win in the Deep South is not in the cards."" 
Unionizing those major operations could strengthen the UAW's hand with the Detroit automakers, which want to narrow the gap between what they pay U.S. hourly workers and their foreign counterparts.
For instance, VW notes that in 2018 the average assembly worker at Chattanooga earned nearly $55,000 last year and skilled workers made more than $78,000, above the Chattanooga area's average annual wage of almost $46,000. But that is well shy of the $95,000 and $123,000 the average U.S.-based GM assembly worker and skilled work made respectively, including overtime and profit-sharing bonuses.
Steven Bernstein, a Tampa-based labor attorney at Fisher Phillips LLP, said that if the UAW wins in Chattanooga, it must prove its worth to win elsewhere.
""The UAW would have to deliver meaningful, tangible benefits to VW workers, otherwise why vote for them?"" Bernstein said.
But first, the UAW must win.
Shannon Fossett, a team leader at the Chattanooga plant, campaigned for unionization in 2014 and said he believed the UAW could win, but was nervous about how close the vote could be.

""It's got to happen, we've been pushing for a union for years,"" he said. ""After all that work, how can it not happen?""

556,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",Burnout Nation: How companies are de-stressing workforces,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - No matter who you are or what you do, let me take a wild guess: You feel a little burned out right now.
Was I right? If so, you are one of the two-thirds of Americans who report feeling burned out on the job, according to a recent Gallup poll.
That breaks down into 23 percent who are burned out very often or always, and another 44 percent who feel that way sometimes. Those numbers are epidemic.
But they do not surprise Cleveland Clinic’s Dr. Adrienne Boissy. When the famed clinic asked its own physicians about burnout, surveying over 1,500 of them, 35 percent reported at least one symptom. Across the nation for physicians it is even worse: a whopping 54 percent, according to Mayo Clinic researchers.
“People are feeling like their bucket is empty at the end of the day,” says Boissy, who as the clinic’s chief experience officer is leading the charge to combat employee burnout. “There is an ocean of distress and suffering out there.”
Burnout does not just happen in healthcare, though, with its particularly intense life-or-death environment. It takes place across industries and across regions. Popular YouTuber Lilly Singh even made headlines when she announced she was taking a break to recharge her batteries.
So what exactly is going on, to make everyone feel so depleted? There is no one answer. Rather, a host of factors conspire to make modern workers feel tapped out.
Technology is one. Smartphones now make people accessible 24/7, leading to the expectation that they will be responsive outside of normal office hours. It can develop into a two-shift day: one at the office, one at home.
“All the ways we can get in touch with people these days, puts stress on people about how to balance it all,"" says Julie Coffman, a Chicago-based partner with consultants Bain & Co and global head of its organization practice. ""It’s exhausting to navigate.”
To their credit, organizations are starting to realize that burnout is in no one’s interest. At the Cleveland Clinic, Boissy and her team have rolled out a number of fixes to help reduce physician burnout. Since much of the problem stems from overwhelming documentation, assistants are now handling more paperwork or refilling prescriptions, so doctors can interact more with patients.
Cleveland Clinic is using innovative solutions like “Code Lavenders,” where dedicated teams help during the painful or traumatic moments that happen every day in a hospital.
TIPS TO PREVENT BURNOUT
Some burnout prevention tips from Bain & Co’s Coffman: Try no-meeting or no-email days to give staffers a break from overscheduling. 
Another suggestion is to analyze your employee networks. If everyone wants access to a particular manager, you need to help that manager out with his or her workload.
And remember that it is okay to say no. If you have five project groups demanding your time, go to your supervisor and figure out which are priorities, and which you can pass on. 
Changing jobs can also relieve some pressure. Just ask Jane Barratt, who has plenty of experience working in the digital space, where “all anyone could ever talk about was how tired they were.”
When she signed on with financial-data firm MX as its chief advocacy officer, it was like a different world. Dedicated areas for spouses and kids, nap rooms, massage time, big family events like booking movie theaters or taking over theme parks – the list goes on.
As a result, her new venture ""does not have the level of exhaustion of other tech companies,” she says. “It’s something I haven’t really seen before.”

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co said on Thursday it was extending the removal of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX aircraft from its flying schedule through Sept. 2, after the plane was grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes.
Southwest, the largest global operator of the MAX with 34 jets, had previously said it was cancelling flights through Aug. 5. The revision is in line with American Airlines Group Inc's recent decision to extend MAX cancellations through Sept. 3, from Aug. 19 previously.
Airlines worldwide are awaiting regulatory approval for a software fix and pilot training updates by Boeing that would pave the way for the jets to fly again after two deadly crashes https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-airplane-developments-factbo/factbox-what-we-know-about-boeing-737-max-crashes-and-what-comes-next-idUSKCN1RG1Q8 in Indonesia and Ethiopia triggered a worldwide grounding.
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it did not have a specific timetable for allowing the MAX to resume flying.
Boeing has not yet conducted a certification test flight that is required before it can submit the software fix and training upgrade for approval, but has been discussing proposed changes with airlines and the FAA. 
""We are encouraged by the reported progress and proposed path forward for returning the aircraft to service, and we remain confident that, once certified by the FAA, the enhancements will support the safe operation of the MAX,"" Southwest said.
Once the FAA approves the MAX for flight, Southwest has said it would take about 30 days to get the jets up and running again.
The Dallas-based carrier's schedule revision will keep about 100 flights out of its total peak daily schedule of 4,000. Southwest is notifying and accommodating customers affected by the amended schedule, it said.
Without enough airplanes to meet passenger demand, MAX operators are bearing revenue losses and cost increases after having had to cancel thousands of flights during the peak U.S. summer travel season.
On Wednesday, American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said he believed it was ""highly likely"" that the MAX would be flying again by mid-August. He said the decision to keep the planes off the airline's schedule into early September merely reflected monthly scheduling plans for crew.

The measure is part of a wider set of reforms that could be approved at a meeting on Thursday. Under the overhaul, holders of debt issued by one of the 19 countries of the bloc could see their power to block bond restructuring or haircuts vastly reduced.

The new measure, if approved, would apply to bonds issued after Jan. 1, 2022 and with maturity above one year, the draft document says.

BASF, the world's largest supplier of chemicals and plastics to the car industry, said on Thursday that it would cut 200 jobs at its coatings site in the German city of Muenster by 2021, citing ongoing weakness in car markets.
The downturn in the global car market has shown no signs of abating as the U.S.-Chinese trade dispute continues. China reported the worst-ever monthly sales drop in the world's largest vehicle market on Wednesday.
BASF's spokesman, however, said the company was currently not changing the assumptions underpinning its guidance for 2019 group earnings.
BASF, a maker of petrochemicals, coatings, catalytic converters and foams, said last month that it was aiming for growth in 2019 operating profit at the lower end of a 1-10% range, despite analyst predictions of a decline in full-year earnings.

While the group's automotive business had seen a weak start to the year, BASF predicted slight growth over the full year, it said last month.

""Allowing the use of Huawei equipment in U.S. telecommunications infrastructure is harmful to our national security,” the senators wrote. ""In no way should Huawei be used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations."" Trump said last month that while Huawei was ""very dangerous"" he could imagine Huawei potentially included in a trade deal with China.

China accounts for up to 10% of the company's sales and is critical to its growth prospects as it is one of the world's largest commodities importers. 
Despite the drop, machine retail sales globally rose 6% during the period, the world's largest construction equipment maker said in a regulatory filing.
Caterpillar had spooked investors in April when its first-quarter results showed rising costs hitting margins in its construction equipment business and tepid sales in the Asia-Pacific region pointing to subdued growth in China.
""Results are running slightly ahead of 2Q estimates, though given the uncertain global macro backdrop and tougher comparisons investor concerns into 2H are building,"" Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.
Total retail sales for construction equipment in Asia Pacific fell 12% and that for machines used by mining companies slumped 63% in the period, the company said. 
Caterpillar had said in April during an post-earnings call that it expects full-year sales in China to remain flat.
Worldwide retail sales for construction machines rose 2% and that for resources gained 21% for the rolling three-month period ended May.

Shares of the company were marginally up at $127.32 in morning trade.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 11:11AM ET</span>",U.S. retailers' halting outlook reveals scale of tariff fear,"By Aishwarya Venugopal and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - The first half of 2019 was expected to be a boon for U.S. retailers, buoyed by solid consumer sentiment at home and expansion in China - the market many of them have targeted for the future.
Instead, new tariffs President Donald Trump slapped on some Chinese imports last month and fears that more could come in the escalating trade conflict between Washington and Beijing, had many investors bailing from the sector.
The tensions have hovered as a potential risk for markets for more than two years. But what really unsettled investors in the latest round of earnings calls was retailers admitting that tariffs were starting to bite and how little they had to say on how they could soften the blow.
 Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) warned higher duties would put pressure on prices for U.S. consumers, while Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney Company Inc said their businesses would suffer if tariffs were extended to include apparel and footwear.
Kohl's Corp said trade tensions were one of the reasons for a cut in its profit outlook and called the situation ""fluid."" 
""We have been watching this tariff story play out,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research and a portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management. ""There doesn't seem to be in the immediate term (any sign) of things getting any better."" 
Many high-end brands have relied on China to boost sales and counter a slowdown in saturated developed markets and it is now by far the world's biggest market for luxury goods, fueled in particular by young shoppers.
Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) has invested heavily, partnering with Alibaba's TMall, JD.com and WeChat to sell its products and targeting $500 million in revenue in China in five years. Asian sales have risen 18% in the past two years to over $1 billion. 
Capri Holdings' Michael Kors last year had Chinese actress Yang Mi visit their flagship store at Rockefeller Center in New York City for a fan meet-up event and PVH's Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Tapestry Inc's Coach have all hosted Chinese fashion shows and opened flagship stores in China.
However, with China's economy growing last year at the slowest pace in nearly three decades and April data pointing to surprisingly weak retail sales, growth of the luxury market globally has slowed by around two percentage points to 6%-8% annually, according to Boston Consulting Group.
CONSUMER SHIFT BACK TO MAINLAND CHINA 
Investors are on edge after any signs of a further downturn.
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH's shares dropped more than 7% in October after it said sales growth in China fell from the high-teens to the mid-teens, dragging shares in Gucci parent  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA,  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS) SCA and  Burberry  Group (LON:BRBY) PLC.
Stocks have since recovered and some top brands have flagged a pick-up in mainland China, with Vuitton saying last week that demand for its handbags was still at ""unheard of"" levels. 
Spending by Chinese shoppers, however, is increasingly shifting from overseas shopping capitals like Paris or New York back home, encouraged by cuts in import tariffs and other measures by China's government to boost domestic spending. That trend has in turn dented sales at labels like jeweler Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) that are exposed to falls in spending by Chinese tourists to the United States. 
WHO CAN WITHSTAND THE TARIFF BLOW?
Until early May, S&P 500 retail companies were outperforming the broad market, up 23% compared with 17.5% for the main index. 
Since Trump's May 5 tweet announcing tariffs would rise to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese imports, they trail by about 2% and the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF saw outflows of $162.4 million in May, Lipper flow estimates from Refinitiv show. 
Among the most exposed are firms who have poured much of the investment capital worked up in the good times into a near-future that they assumed would be largely Chinese. 
Shares of winter jacket maker Canada Goose fell 26% in one day after it reported the first slowing in sales growth in two years, undermining its plan to open three stores in China in the coming years on top of the six it has already.
By contrast, analysts say  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart are among a few with the scale to force suppliers to absorb part of any tariff-driven rise in costs. Both have been working to trim China's role as their chief supplier by sourcing products elsewhere. 

""Companies that are doing well and indicate they can mitigate tariffs are being rewarded while those that are missing are being doubly punished,"" said John Zolidis, president of New York-based investment advisor Quo Vadis Capital.

Santander declined to comment.
CCOO said that details of the agreement still needed to be finalised.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 10:30AM ET</span>",DHL says it will invest $150 million to expand U.S. healthcare business,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) DHL Group on Thursday said it will spend $150 million this year to expand its U.S. healthcare distribution network capacity by roughly 40 percent.
The investment from DHL, the healthcare logistics leader with worldwide annual medical-related revenue of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion), comes as rivals  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) also eye that sector for growth.
DHL's Supply Chain unit will add or expand nine Food and Drug Administration-compliant distribution sites for pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies in Indiana, North Carolina, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, California and Virginia - bringing the total of such U.S. facilities to 30.
Healthcare is the fastest-growing sector for DHL's North American Supply Chain unit that counts Zimmer Biomet Holdings and Avanos Medical Inc among its U.S. customers.
It stores products in temperature-controlled facilities for healthcare customers, who send orders to the site to be packed and shipped to wholesalers, hospitals and doctors' offices. 
Outsourcing those services helps companies increase reliability and reduce costs that can help slow ballooning U.S. healthcare costs, experts said. 
""This market is changing pretty dramatically,"" Scott Cubbler, president of Life Sciences & Healthcare at DHL Supply Chain, said of the U.S. healthcare industry that is navigating consolidation, changing regulations and cost pressures.
U.S. car makers and other manufacturers have been squeezing cost and waste from supply chains for years, but ""healthcare is relatively late"" to such efforts, said Steven Melnyk, professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's Broad College of Business.
DHL's investment also covers technology that reduces labor and inventory costs - including robots that assist with ""picking"" products; glasses that guide warehouse workers to the location of particular items; and computer ""dashboards"" that allow customers to track goods.
Parcel delivery companies like DHL, UPS and FedEx have spent years building and acquiring the expertise and infrastructure to handle heavily regulated, high-value and sensitive products like cancer drugs and vaccines.

That gives them a leg up over would-be rivals like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is building its own logistics network and inching into the healthcare business.

DUBAI (Reuters) - International bonds issued by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states weakened on Thursday after two tankers were hit in suspected attacks in the Gulf of Oman, a month after a similar incident in which four tankers in the region were struck.
Regional debt markets did not react to the May attacks - when oil tankers were hit off the Fujairah emirate, one of the world's largest bunkering hubs - but their weakness on Thursday showed the latest incident was making investors jittery.
Details of the tanker incident were not immediately clear, but oil prices surged 4%, as the suspected attacks came amid increased tensions between Iran and the United States over Tehran's nuclear program.
""Even if direct conflict is ultimately avoided, heightened geopolitical tensions will continue to act as a headwind to local financial markets,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""So long as tensions remain elevated, investors are likely to demand a higher risk premium to hold assets in the region.""
Saudi Arabia's bonds due in 2049 were down over 0.6 cents in early trade while $3 billion in bonds issued by state oil giant Saudi Aramco, also due in 2049, were down by roughly 1 cent on the dollar, according to Eikon Refinitiv data.
The price drop, however, started to ease later in the day and regional credit default swaps - which indicate the cost of insuring against a default - were fairly stable, with only Saudi Arabia up by one point early in the morning, IHS Markit said.
GEOPOLITICS
""This looks like a knee-jerk reaction,"" said a Gulf analyst, who asked not to be named. ""The market is very sensitive to geopolitical developments.""
Regional stock markets were also in the red, with a missile strike by Yemen's Houthi rebels on a civilian airport in southern Saudi Arabia on Wednesday also weighing on risk sentiment.
The tensions have hit regional stock markets at a time of strong performance, with Saudi Arabia in particular enjoying money inflows as it entered the MSCI emerging market index last month. The Saudi main exchange, Tadawul, was down 1.5% on Thursday. The index is still up 14% so far this year, making it one of the Gulf's best performing markets.
The Gulf of Oman lies at the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz, a major strategic waterway that is a conduit from Middle East producers for a fifth of global oil consumption.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said in a research note this week that if diplomatic and military tensions escalate to the point of threatening a blockage of the Strait, this could lead to an increase in Gulf sovereigns' funding costs, and to a disruption in foreign direct investment.

But the agency said it had not changed any of its ratings or its outlooks for Gulf governments.

But Asia had been a different story. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped sharply again overnight as public tensions continued there about a bill which would allow extradition to China.
Doubts were growing too about any improvement in what U.S. President Donald Trump called ""testy"" trade relations with China before this month's G20 summit while some market anxiety emerged that Federal Reserve rate cut speculation may be overdone.
Investors will be looking to what Fed policymakers say after their next policy meeting on June 18-19, with Fed Funds rate futures pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut for the subsequent policy review on July 30-31. 
That is completely at odds with the Fed's projection three months ago, when policymakers saw gradual rate hikes in coming years. 
""The U.S. real economy has not worsened that much. But given market expectations, the Fed will have no choice but to cut rates,"" said Kozo Koide, chief economist at Asset Management One.
RATE EXPECTATIONS 
With bonds in demand again, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dipped to 2.113 percent, near Friday's 2.053 percent, its lowest level since September 2017, while in Europe, German borrowing costs sank back toward all-time lows. 
Italy also paid the lowest rate in more than a year to sell seven- and 15-year debt on Thursday, helped by signals last week from the European Central Bank that it will keep borrowing costs down, and Rome's efforts to avoid a budget clash with Brussels.
Yields had tumbled in Asia too. Long-dated Japanese government bond yields hit their lowest levels since August 2016, before rising back a bit after a weak 30-year bond auction.
In Australia, long known for its high-yield currency, rates fell to record lows, with three-year yield now slipping below 1 percent after jobs data pointed to another interest rate cut in July to follow one last week.
Currency markets saw plenty of action as well. The safe-haven yen gained 0.2% to 108.32 to the dollar as risk sentiment soured, while the Australian dollar dropped 0.3%..
The euro steadied at $1.1293, having taken a hit on Wednesday after Trump said he was considering sanctions over Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project and warned Germany against depending on Russia for energy.
The pound was still subdued at $1.2680 after British lawmakers defeated an attempt led by the opposition Labour Party to try to block a no-deal Brexit by seizing control of the parliamentary agenda from the government.
Turkey's lira tanked, though, dropping 1.4% as the rising cost of oil compounded tensions in Syria and a dispute with Washington over Ankara's plans to buy a Russian missile defense system.
""You still have a lot of uncertainty when it comes to geopolitics,"" said Manuel Oliveri, analyst at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR).

""The focus is shifting to the G20 meeting. Risk sentiment remains relatively unstable,"" he added, while cautioning that expectations for interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve were keeping investor confidence from weakening further.

(Reuters) - U.S. meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) on Thursday launched its first vegetarian and mixed protein products as it joined a growing number of companies catering to rising demand for plant-based meat products.
Tyson will sell vegetarian nuggets, blended protein burgers made from beef and pea protein, and sausages and meatballs that combine chicken with plants including chickpeas, black beans and quinoa, the company said in a statement.
The products, under Tyson's new Raised & Rooted brand, will be sold through its customers, sales outlets and foodservice operators, Justin Whitmore, head of Tyson's alternative protein business, said in an interview, declining to elaborate.
The nuggets will be launched in the summer, and burgers in the fall, he added.
The largest U.S. meat processor, known for its Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean sausages, believes the company's long experience in protein product development, manufacturing and distribution puts it in a unique position to enter the plant-based market and drive sales across all segments.
Whitmore said it was too early to estimate revenues, calling Tyson's plant-based business highly incremental, but he noted that that could change.
""The double-digit growth in the sector is largely driven by meat eaters who want the health and nutrition that they perceive to come from plants along with the taste they've always had from animal protein,"" Whitmore said, adding that the company was working on additional plant-based products.
Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said in a statement the company remained firmly committed to expanding its traditional meat business, but is shifting toward becoming a protein company.
The change comes as many companies are trying to carve out a space in the U.S. alternative meat market which analysts estimate to be worth $100 billion by 2035.
California upstarts Beyond Meat Inc and Impossible Foods Inc each sell 100% plant-based meat alternatives to retailers and fast food chains across the United States.
Tyson sold its 6.5% stake in Beyond Meat in late April, just days before the company went public, to focus on the development of its own plant-based products.
Vegan ground beef and burger patties by Canadian packaged meat producer Maple Leaf Foods Inc, sold under its LightLife brand, will be on U.S. store shelves this summer.
Nestle, the world's biggest packaged foods group, is aiming to sell a pea-based veggie patty called Awesome Burger under its U.S. plant-based Sweet Earth brand in the fall.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 08:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Petrobras ignored warnings about fuel broker implicated in graft probe,"By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras found suspicious activity in its oil trading business - and failed to stop it - six years before an alleged bribery scandal erupted in that unit in 2018, according to three people with knowledge of the situation and documents seen by Reuters. 
A 2012 internal probe at the state-run oil company turned up more than two dozen instances in which traders in Petrobras' Singapore office overpaid for fuel, the people said. Big oil companies frequently purchase and sell petroleum products, taking advantage of price differences to maximize profits. Some employees in 2013 recommended halting transactions with one particular fuel brokerage that had consistently sold fuel to Petrobras at above-market prices, according to the people.
But the deals continued at the behest of at least three senior company managers, the people said. 
The little-known fuel broker – Seaview Shipbroking Ltd - was subsequently implicated by prosecutors in Brazil's long-running ""Car Wash"" corruption investigation centered on contracting graft at Petrobras. Authorities say this latest chapter of Car Wash is just ramping up.
Prosecutors in December alleged in public documents that four of the world's largest commodities trading firms - Vitol SA, Trafigura,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) PLC and Mercuria Energy Group - used Seaview or other intermediaries to funnel at least $31 million in bribes to corrupt Petrobras employees. 
In return, prosecutors say, these insiders would buy oil and derivatives at inflated prices or sell at discounted prices, thus delivering outsized profits to the parties on the other end of those trades. Prosecutors allege such transactions were routine between at least 2011 and 2014 among some employees in the Petrobras trading unit, which has offices stretching across the globe.
Reuters was unable to locate active contact information for Seaview. Brazilian prosecutors investigating the brokerage have focused on Konstantinos Kotronakis, a former Greek consul in Rio de Janeiro. They allege Kotronakis used a Seaview bank account that he controlled in Luxembourg to administer kickbacks related to Petrobras fuel trades. Kotronakis has not been charged with a crime. 
In Brazil, it is not uncommon for prosecutors to allege wrongdoing by suspects in publicly available documents - and cite evidence to that effect - without immediately charging those people. Prosecutors so far have charged 14 individuals, six of them former Petrobras employees, and have said more charges are coming. 
A lawyer for Kotronakis said he was unaware of the Petrobras audit, and that his client was not one of Seaview's owners.
Glencore, whose subsidiaries likely channeled bribes through Kotronakis, according to prosecutors, declined to comment on its alleged dealings with the businessman.
Petrobras' decision not to cut ties with Seaview - despite evidence turned up by its own probe that something was amiss - is a case that challenges the company's oft-repeated narrative that it was an unwitting victim of corruption.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-run firm is formally known, declined to comment on the internal probe of its Singapore trading desk. A spokeswoman referred Reuters to previous statements in which the company said it is committed to rooting out graft and has made strides in improving its compliance programs since the Car Wash scandal exploded in 2014. 
Petrobras last month disclosed that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission had requested information about aspects of its trading operation related to the Brazilian bribery investigation. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has also joined the probe. 
Mercuria, Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore said they are cooperating with the Brazilian investigation. All stressed their commitment to ethical business practices. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing.
Mercuria and Trafigura did not respond to additional requests for comment regarding this story. Vitol declined to comment.
SUSPECT FUEL TRADES
According to an internal Petrobras report from December 2012 and the people familiar with the matter, company managers tipped off by a whistleblower examined 29 purchases of fuel by the firm's Singapore trading desk from January through November of that year.
In 28 of those transactions, according to the report, Petrobras paid above prevailing rates for bunker fuel, a type of fuel often used by ships. In ten of those instances, the report said, the premium came to at least $20 per metric ton. Documents viewed by Reuters did not provide a cumulative amount that Petrobras allegedly overpaid. But given the large volumes of product involved, prosecutors have said even tiny overcharges per unit of product could deliver huge illicit profits to shady traders over time.
According to a non-public 2017 federal police document seen by Reuters examining trading irregularities at Petrobras, as well as two people familiar with the matter, Seaview was among the firms facilitating suspect trades in Singapore. Prosecutors say Seaview essentially functioned as an intermediary that helped large commodities trading firms fleece Petrobras. Seaview executed advantageous fuel trades on their behalf, and it routed bribes through offshore accounts, authorities said.
In the first months of 2013, an internal debate emerged at Petrobras about whether to halt business with Seaview, according to the documents and the people. Petrobras declined to do so, they said, after some senior managers argued that the oil company could lose money by limiting the number of brokers it interacts with.
Among the people who supported maintaining the relationship was Marco Antonio Costa Tritto, who was then a manager of Petrobras' bunker fuel operations, according to the people and documents, dated early 2013. He is now general manager of one of Petrobras' European subsidiaries, according to UK registration documents.
Costa Tritto referred Reuters to Petrobras headquarters for comment. Petrobras declined to comment.
Another Petrobras employee who supported sticking by Seaview, Jorge de Oliveira Rodrigues, was charged by prosecutors in December for money laundering and pocketing bribes in connection to the alleged oil trading scheme. 
A lawyer for Oliveira Rodrigues declined to comment.
Prosecutors have identified suspicious transactions involving Seaview as late as February 2014. 
Following two additional audits in 2013, Petrobras singled out at least three staffers for improper conduct, none of whom was fired, the people said.
Among them, the people said, was Cesar Joaquim Rodrigues da Silva. Brazilian authorities arrested him in December, accusing him of money laundering and taking kickbacks in connection with the alleged scheme. 
A lawyer for Rodrigues da Silva declined to comment.
Another trader, Daniel da Silva Gomes Filho, was also found at fault by Petrobras for irregular trading operations, according to the people. The 2012 Petrobras audit said an internal whistleblower alleged Gomes Filho made ""under the table"" arrangements with counterparties in fuel trades. He has not been implicated by prosecutors.
Gomes Filho wrote in an e-mail to Reuters that he was suspended for 29 days for the alleged incident and had been subject to three Petrobras internal investigations. He said he traveled to the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba, where the Car Wash probe is based, to answer questions from authorities there.
""Even after six years, they have not been able to discredit me,"" he wrote.

He said he retired from Petrobras in 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - Equity funds that stick to blue-chip shares cope best with calls from investors for their money back, a senior Bank of England official said on Thursday as fallout from the suspension of top UK fund Woodford continued.
Alex Brazier, the BoE's executive director for financial stability, said it was striking that the more illiquid or difficult to trade the assets in a fund were, the more aggressively its investors withdraw their funds as prices of the assets fall.
""When a fund holds assets traded almost instantly on exchange – like blue-chip equities – investors tend to sit on their hands,"" Brazier said in a speech.
""Liquidity isn't costless,"" Brazier he added.
Last week in Britain fund manager Neil Woodford suspended his flagship equity fund. Some of the companies it has invested in are illiquid and listed on an exchange in Guernsey.
Brazier did not name Woodford in his speech.
""Of course, redemptions can be suspended – funds can be gated – to limit the selling pressure. But such measures are a double-edged sword,"" Brazier said.
""They can allow time for an orderly re-structuring of a fund, avoiding unnecessary fire sale pressure, but the expectation that such measures could be imposed tomorrow can create an incentive to be at the front of the redemption queue today,"" Brazier added.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority is finalizing rules for funds investing in illiquid assets, but it was also a global issue, Brazier said.
""Macroprudential authorities across the world will need to review new global asset management rules. An assessment is needed of whether they will be effective in dampening any restriction to the supply of finance during economic downturns,"" Brazier said.
He said Britain's big current account deficit represented its biggest underlying economic vulnerability, recalling how BoE Governor Mark Carney has previously warned of the reliance on ""the kindness of strangers"".

PARIS (Reuters) - China's plan to increase local production of baby formula products has not come as a surprise to global dairy maker Danone, which has plans to launch a new ultra-premium product in that market, said Danone's chief financial officer.
According to a document jointly released earlier this month by China's central planner and several ministries, China aims to increase local production of baby formula so that more than 60% of the market can be supplied domestically.
The move could be a blow to the baby milk businesses of Nestle, Danone and Reckitt Benckiser which have generally flourished in China's $25 billion baby formula market.
""What is happening is not a surprise. At the end of the day there will be a few local players and international players. We see the category growing 3-5% in China with middle-class affluence,"" Finance Chief Cecile Cabanis told the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Access Global Consumer Conference in Paris.
Growth was driven by demand from ""lower-tier cities and for ultra premium"" categories, she added.
China is an important growth market for Danone, contributing about 30% of sales to Danone's Early Life Nutrition (ELN) business which makes infant formula and baby food products.
Cabanis reiterated on Thursday that Danone expects its ELN business in China to return to growth in the second half of the year, having suffered a slump in the first quarter partly due to lower birth rates.
She added that focusing on premium products would help the division, and also said Danone had an ""innovation in the pipeline"" in that area, but declined to give more details.
Her comments come as rival Nestle plans to launch a new line of baby formula under an existing brand in China this year, targeting smaller cities.
Cabanis also reiterated Danone was confident of delivering all its financial targets for 2019 and 2020.

PARIS (Reuters) - Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR is tackling a slump in deliveries resulting from a combination of industrial delays, unsold aircraft and pilot shortages, industry sources said.
The turboprop maker, owned jointly by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo, has delivered only a handful of aircraft in 2019 but aims to recover in the second half.
Toulouse-based ATR declined to give a figure for mid-year deliveries but said it was confident of achieving its target of matching last year's total handover of 76 aircraft.
""Our market is a very volatile one and we are used to managing that well,"" a spokeswoman said. 
ATR dominates the turboprop market, competing against the Bombardier-developed Q400, recently acquired by Canadian manufacturer Viking Air, and China's upcoming MA700.
With debate about aviation's environmental impact intensifying, ATR aims to pitch its 72-600 at next week's Paris Airshow as cleaner than regional jets, with 40 percent less emissions per trip.
While the show is dominated by competition for big jets, ATR says a third of the world's commercial airports rely solely on turboprops, which help drive regional economic development.
But in India, a top growth market, ATR is struggling to deliver planes as quickly as it had hoped, partly due to problems finding enough pilots for leading customer IndiGo.
ATR agreed in 2017 to sell 50 ATR 72-600 aircraft, worth more than $1.3 billion at list prices, to the budget carrier.
In order to grab one of the turboprop sector's biggest deals, ATR assumed responsibility for recruiting some pilots and instructors for IndiGo, which like many Indian airlines faces an acute shortage, the sources told Reuters.
""The Indigo deliveries progress on a monthly basis,"" the spokeswoman said. ""In addition we are working with Indigo to address the pilot shortage and co-operate very closely with them on pilot instructors,"" she added.
IndiGo was not immediately available for comment.
The delivery snag is the latest indication of the cost of a global pilot shortage as air travel grows faster than the economy. In India, trained captains are particularly scarce.
ATR predicts annual average growth of 10.9 percent in 50-70-seat turboprop traffic in South Asia.
In addition to pilot recruitment problems, ATR has an unspecified number of ""white tails"" or aircraft that have been built but not sold, the sources said. ATR declined comment.
It is also wrestling with some quality problems associated with the delivery of fuselages from Italy, the sources said. ATR said it did not comment on commercial or industrial issues.

Deliveries can have an impact on revenue and profits as airlines pay most of the cost of a plane on delivery. Analysts say ATR is a useful source of additional profit for Airbus and Leonardo though its margins are not published.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 06:30AM ET</span>",Leveraged loan risk not enough to warrant new rules for now: Basel official,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Regulators are stepping up checks on the $1.3 trillion leveraged loan market for threats that echo the subprime mortgages which defaulted 10 years ago, but new rules are not needed for now, the Basel Committee's secretary general said.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and others have raised concerns about the huge growth in loans to highly-indebted, non-investment grade companies.
""More does need to be done and we are doing it, but don't confuse that with the knee-jerk reaction that we need regulation as a response,"" said William Coen, who heads the Basel Committee's secretariat, a body that sets capital rules for thousands of banks across the world.
""There are different ways of dealing with emerging risks,"" Coen told Reuters.
An implosion in U.S. subprime home loans in 2007 led to a global financial crisis and a welter of new capital rules. The committee's ""hot"" concern is now over weaker underwriting standards in the leveraged loan sector.
""There are some parallels with subprime, but I do think the best approach right now is carefully assessing growth, underwriting standards, and getting a better handle on who are the ultimate investors,"" Coen said.
    ""I don't see the need at this point for a global policy response,"" he added. 
The sense of urgency during the financial crisis that drove through new rules has faded, along with the appetite in countries like the United States for more reforms, making it harder for Basel to find consensus to act.
Coen said it was a ""marvel"" that regulators agreed on tougher capital rules, leverage ratios and liquidity requirements for banks, the latter an elusive goal since Basel was created in 1974.
""We have done everything that we want to do in response to the financial crisis, but then there is the all-important implementation, and some people are concerned about backsliding, delays and dilution,"" Coen said.
""Are there going to be new or revised standards to respond to issues arising from the crisis? I don't expect there to be,"" Coen said.

Basel will focus on implementation and supervision, but there is pressure from some countries and banks for rules in the growing crypto assets and fintech sectors.
""I don't think we are there yet on whether a policy response is needed for fintech and crypto assets. We need better data and we are doing a stocktake,"" Coen said.
Basel will consider later this year whether more specified treatment of crypto assets is needed.
It has been criticized for not requiring banks to set aside capital against holdings of their own country's debt, an issue during the euro zone debt crisis, but the prospect for action is slim.
""The sentiment that we expressed in 2017 discussion paper still holds today and that was there was no consensus to make changes to the regulatory framework, but consideration of this important risk class will remain on our agenda,"" Coen said.
A 20-year veteran of Basel and due to step down at the end of June, Coen faced intense lobbying by banks arguing that tougher capital requirements would crimp lending. It is a claim he says will again be refuted in a report from Basel shortly.
The committee's relations with banks are much better these days, with rule-making discussions more focused on data rather than hearsay and speculation, he said.

""Some people make the mistake of thinking this is a negotiation between the authorities and industry. It's not.""

588,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 06:22AM ET</span>",Alibaba files for HK listing that may raise $20 billion as soon as third quarter: source,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's biggest e-commerce company  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd has filed confidentially for a Hong Kong listing that could raise up to $20 billion as early as the third quarter of this year, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A deal of that size would be the biggest follow-on share sale globally in seven years and give Alibaba funds for technology investment - a priority for China as economic growth slows and a trade spat with the United States intensifies.
Alibaba holds the record for the world's largest initial public offering with its $25 billion float in New York five years ago.
Then, the company had initially hoped to float in Hong Kong but the tech firm's management structure clashed with the city's listing rules. Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, the city's bourse operator, changed its listing rules last year - primarily with the aim of attracting Chinese tech groups.
Alibaba declined to comment on the deal when contacted by Reuters. Japan's SoftBank Group, which is Alibaba's largest shareholder with a 28.7% stake, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The person with knowledge of the matter was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified. News of the filing was first reported by Bloomberg.
Investment banks China International Capital Corp Ltd and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG are leading the deal. Both banks declined to comment. No other banks have been formally mandated as yet.
BIG DEAL FOR HONG KONG
A listing by Alibaba in Hong Kong will be seen as a victory for the city by its stock-focused market professionals, who mourned the lost trading revenue when the e-commerce group chose to float in New York. 
Trading in Alibaba shares averaged $2.2 billion a day in the first quarter of this year, according to Refinitiv data, compared with average daily turnover on the Hong Kong exchange of $12.9 billion in the same period.
Listing in Hong Kong would also give mainland Chinese investors their first direct access to one of their country's biggest success stories, via the stock connect trading link between Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Since its U.S. listing, Alibaba's market value has nearly doubled and is now $423 billion, the largest in Asia-Pacific.
The filing comes amid growing political unrest in Hong Kong this week that raised concerns over the potential impact on the city's financial market and businesses.
Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in the southern Chinese territory this week over a planned extradition agreement with mainland China.
Logistics real estate developer ESR Cayman Ltd on Thursday pulled what would have been the largest Hong Kong listing so far this year, citing ""current market conditions"".

So far this year, the benchmark Hang Seng index has gained 5.6% compared with a 22.4% jump in China's blue-chip CSI 300 and a 14.9% rise in the U.S. S&P 500.

PARIS (Reuters) - Chinese ""Gen Z"" shoppers in their early 20s are emerging as an increasingly powerful force in the luxury industry as brands try and tap into buoyant demand for high-end goods in the world's second-biggest economy, consultancy Bain said on Thursday. 
Chinese consumers account for more than a third of the luxury goods sector's worldwide revenues, and are still fuelling growth in the sector in spite of a U.S.-China trade war.
Bain forecast that global sales of luxury handbags, high-end clothing and cosmetics would expand by 4% to 6% at constant currencies in 2019 thanks largely to booming Chinese demand, after growing 6% last year. 
But as shopping patterns shift - with fewer Chinese tourists traveling to the United States, and Beijing encouraging more domestic spending with VAT and import tariff cuts - a generational overhaul is also gathering pace. 
""Gen Z"" consumers in their late teens and early 20s are rapidly taking center stage in China, where according to top luxury labels the average shoppers are already younger than anywhere else in the world. 
""They are the ones to watch. They are a huge spending force, they are impulse buyers,"" said Federica Levato, a partner at Bain. 
American and European brands are trying to work out how best to capture the trend with digital marketing campaigns, and events that ""keep up the hype"" like concerts or temporary pop-up stores, Levato added. 
Italy's Prada, hit as Chinese shoppers begin to spend less in markets like Hong Kong, last month named 20-year-old singer and actor Cai Xukun as a brand spokesman in China as it jostles with other labels to capture growth on the mainland.
Millennials in China - the generation born between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, just ahead of ""Gen Z"" - derive the bulk of their income from their parents, a Bain study from earlier this year showed, as do ""Gen Z"" shoppers. 
The United States, another major market for luxury goods players, was still strong despite a first quarter blip linked to shifts in U.S. tax policy and lower rebates, which should be temporary, the consultancy added in its latest report. 
Some companies like jeweler Tiffany have flagged sharp declines in spending among Chinese visitors, which Bain said was the principal fallout from the trade war so far.

""We don't have any evidence right now of any impact (on the luxury sector) beyond the tourist flows,"" Levato said.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 06:05AM ET</span>",UK watchdog defends lack of penalties in RBS small-business scandal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog has defended its decision not to penalize lender RBS (LON:RBS) or its former executives for past mistreatment of small business customers.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was sticking by its decision not to apply penalties for actions of RBS's former turnaround unit, the Global Restructuring Group (GRG).
""Our investigation has found that GRG clearly fell short of the high standards its clients expected, but it was largely unregulated and so our powers to take action in such circumstances, even where the mistreatment of customers has been identified and accepted, are very limited,"" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a statement on Thursday.
The mistreatment of businesses that were in financial distress and moved into GRG is one of the biggest scandals RBS has faced in recent years.
A previous FCA report had found that GRG was responsible for widespread mistreatment of business customers between 2008 and 2013 and blamed former bank bosses for pursuing profits at the expense of the health of some companies.
Last July's FCA decision not to apply penalties was widely criticized by lawmakers and victims' groups, with MP Nicky Morgan calling it ""bewildering"".
On Thursday the watchdog repeated its view that it did not have the powers to take action and that external legal counsel had agreed with its conclusion.
The FCA said that stronger powers had since been introduced to give it greater powers to act in future cases.
RBS Chairman Howard Davies welcomed the conclusion of the investigation and confirmation that no further action will be taken.
“The way the bank deals with business customers in financial difficulty today is fundamentally different to the aftermath of the financial crisis,"" he said.
""We are committed to ensuring that past mistakes cannot be repeated.”

591,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 05:44AM ET</span>","China, Hong Kong homebuyers play cross-border musical chairs in Bay Area","By Clare Jim and Joy Leung
HONG KONG (Reuters) - An ambitious plan to transform the industrial towns of China's Pearl River Delta into a modern economic zone powered by new technology ventures has triggered a rush of cross-border property investments between Hong Kong and the mainland.
The promise of reduced investment barriers in the region known as the Greater Bay Area (GBA) has driven greater partnerships between Hong Kong and mainland property firms, who are looking to capitalize on a two-way rush for homes.
In one direction, cashed-up investors from Southern (NYSE:SO) China's factory belt are moving into Hong Kong's luxury apartment sector, where prices can be more than 100 times those on the mainland. In the other direction, Hong Kong residents are scrambling for bargains in mainland cities like Zhuhai and Zhongshan - some for quick profit, others a sea change.
""Hong Kong's housing environment is very cramped, while the mainland provides good space for retirement,"" said H.C. Lee, a 47-year-old Hong Kong resident who recently made a HK$4 million ($510,000) profit on the sale of her Hong Kong apartment in the New Territories. She used half that money to buy two apartments, one in Guangzhou and another in the third-tier city of Huizhou.
Her investment was also driven in part by expectations the commute between Hong Kong and Huizhou, currently about four hours, will be halved when a new rail connection opens in five years.
Faster transport links to the mainland that opened last year, including the world's longest sea-crossing bridge and a high speed rail, are boosting the area's appeal as an alternative destination for Hong Kong property buyers.
The plan to develop the area - which has a population of 68 million and a $1.5 trillion gross domestic product - will lead to an increase in such investments, say analysts and real estate agents.
The scheme is part of Beijing's plan to increase social mobility between Hong Kong and its hinterland and bring the restive former British colony deeper into its China's political and economic fold. It includes major initiatives at the national, provincial and local levels.
Some districts in Zhuhai and the third-tier city of Zhongshan recently relaxed home purchase rules to allow Hong Kong and Macau residents to buy new units. Previously, they could only buy second-hand apartments or commercial properties.
More incentives, such as tax subsidies and healthcare and education benefits, are also being introduced by policymakers to lure Hong Kong people to work and live in the GBA.
One Hong Kong investor, surnamed Lam, bought a 1.2 million yuan flat in Zhuhai in mid-May, her first in China. She hopes to use it as a holiday home and later sell it for a profit.
Driven by this interest, Chinese developers are stepping up marketing efforts in Hong Kong, such as cold calls to prospective buyers, a tactic not commonly used in the city in the past.
In one such call received by Reuters, Country Garden, China's largest developer, offered a two-day tour of its sites in the GBA, with transport, accommodation and meals included.
The price for the developer's 35 square meter apartments in the third-tier cities of Foshan and Zhaoqing is about 315,000 yuan ($45,522.20). That compares with about $800,000 for a similar sized unit in Hong Kong.
Promotional calls from developers Agile Group and Kaisa Group were also received by Reuters. 
In recent weeks, Logan Property and Times China separately set up partnerships with Hong Kong realtors to promote their GBA developments.
""We saw the demand, that's why we're doing more marketing,"" said Ben Ho, general manager of marketing management at Times China, which set up a partnership with agent V+ last month.
Property realtor Century 21, which partners with Logan Property, expects the market share of Hong Kong purchases in cities such as Zhuhai to double to 20% by the end of this year. 
LUXURY LURE
The GBA's growing pool of capital, driven by a booming tech ecosystem that is tipped to one day rival San Francisco's, is in turn finding its way into Hong Kong's residential market, already one of the world's most expensive. 
Property agents in Hong Kong said more China money is flowing into the luxury market after a softening last year, and they expect this segment will outperform the market this year, rising by up to 20%.
""Many bought on the GBA concept - they think Hong Kong has a lot of upside under the policy push and much tech talent and the management of unicorns will move to Hong Kong in the long run,"" said L.S. Wong, Centaline senior associate director of research, referring to start-ups worth more than $1 billion.
JLL, another real estate consultancy, expects Hong Kong's luxury properties to benefit the most from the GBA, as the tech economy fuels the growth of ultra-high net-worth individuals in southern China, which has already increased 24% over the last three years to around 22,000.
""Hong Kong's high quality of medical services and education is expected to continue to attract mainland China's ultra-high-net-worth individuals to move in,"" JLL said.

592,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 05:31AM ET</span>",Comic: The Bubble In Beyond Meat Is Starting To Look Beyond Ridiculous,"Investing.com - Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) shares have soared nearly 500% since the alternative-meat producer went public in May, giving it a nearly $8 billion valuation and leading some to liken the euphoric rally to a bubble.
The El Segundo, California-based company's stock set an all-time high of $186.43 on June 10, after recently being priced at just $25 for its initial public offering on May 1.
It jumped more than 12% on Wednesday, closing at $141.97, amid expectations of wider acceptance of its Beyond Burger and more deals with fast-food chains and restaurants.
The plant-based meat company reported quarterly earnings for the first time since its IPO last week, fueling optimism among investors when it forecast sales would exceed $210 million this year, a more than 100% increase from the $88 million seen last year.
The rosier outlook was accompanied by sizzling first-quarter results. The company reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of 14 cents a share, a penny narrower than the 15 cents a share analysts were expecting, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Despite the upbeat outlook, critics say Beyond Meat’s market value isn't justified given that the company has yet to turn a profit.
Analysts are starting to back away from Beyond Meat, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bernstein both downgrading the stock this week on valuation concerns as competition in the alternative-meat industry heats up.
Rival Impossible Foods recently announced an expansion with Burger King, while food giants like  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Nestle (SIX:NESN) are reportedly working on their own faux-meat products.

The aircraft is also expected to serve demand during the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, Japanese officials said.
Airbus clinched its first jet order from Japan Air Lines in 2013, cracking a big national market long dominated by the European firm’s main rival, Boeing (NYSE:BA).
The $9.5 billion deal came after a lengthy campaign to woo JAL officials who were unfamiliar with Airbus aircraft, including their distinctive side-stick controls.
JAL Chairman Yoshiharu Ueki, a former pilot, said an experience on the A380 simulator had helped sway his decision to choose Airbus for JAL, which at the time was one of only two full-service airlines globally without any Airbus aircraft.
""I have the urge to take the control stick on the ferry flight to Tokyo,"" he joked at a webcast ceremony in Toulouse.
Boeing dominates the market for wide-body jets in Japan but there is a more mixed market for smaller narrowbody jets.

The A350 will fly to Japan using traditional fuel blended with alternative fuel, said Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer. Planemakers and airlines have reiterated pledges to cut emissions sharply amid growing environmental pressure in Europe.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",Lockheed Martin says F-35 cost cuts a year ahead of plan,"HELSINKI (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) is a year ahead of schedule with its plan to cut the cost of its F-35 A fighter jet variant to $80 million by 2020, the U.S. company said on Thursday.
""We have beaten the goal by a full year,"" Lockheed Martin campaign manager Mark Pranke told a news conference in Helsinki, where the company is seeking a deal worth an estimated 7-10 billion euros ($7.9-11.3 billion) to replace Finland's ageing 64 Hornet fighter jets.
Finland's new center-left government said last week it would pick new fighter jets in 2021 from five shortlisted options, including U.S.-based Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, French firm Dassault's Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Swedish firm Saab's Jas Gripen, as well as the F-35.
The new jets are considered crucial for the defense capability of the Nordic country, which shares an 833-mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history with Russia but has opted to stay out of NATO.
However, their purchase is also a costly move for the small nation, representing about 15% of the government's annual budget of 55.5 billion euros ($62.7 billion) in 2019.
Lockheed Martin's cost cutting could make its F-35s a more affordable option, but Pranke stressed there were factors other than price to be considered, such as the aircraft's stealth capability, allowing it to evade radar detection. 
""In this environment in Finland, where you have threats just across the border, it's not enough just to have an aircraft that meets the price,"" Pranke told Reuters.
Finland's choice is also about the deal's impact on defense cooperation, which could favor Sweden's Jas Gripen. 
Finland has kept the door open to joining the NATO but is unlikely to do so in the near future, with the center-left government and public opinion against such move.
In its government program, the center-left government led by Social Democratic Prime Minister Antti Rinne highlighted the importance of cooperation with neighboring Sweden.

""Closer defense cooperation between Finland and Sweden, which are militarily non-allied states, offers special opportunities for strengthening the two countries' defense"", it said.

Bonds also fell.
The benchmark equity indexes in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Riyadh fell about 1% each. Oman’s MSM30 gauge dropped 0.8% as of 9:19 a.m. in London, while the yield on its 2028 dollar bonds climbed nine basis points, the most among Gulf peers.
The U.S. Fifth Fleet said two oil tankers were damaged in an incident near the Strait of Hormuz that one of the ships’ operators described as a suspected attack. The incident follows attacks on oil tankers near the Persian Gulf last month and raises the possibility of a disruption of crude flows.
The decline may be a knee-jerk reaction, said Nader Naeimi, the head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “Even if it’s not an accident, we have seen incidents like this before and they usually pass, without a prolonged effect. Unless, of course, if a war breaks out!”
The Strait of Hormuz, at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, is a waterway for about 40% of the world’s seaborne oil shipments. While most economies in the region are trying to diversify their income away from crude, revenue from energy sales still accounts for a large proportion of their cash inflow.
“The question is if we see escalation from here, or efforts to calm tensions,” said Timothy Ash, a strategist at Blue Bay Asset Management in London. “Trump appeared eager to call off the attack dogs in his administration last month. He seems eager to avoid a major war in the Middle East, involving U.S. troops.”"

(Reuters) - A surge in telecom stocks on Germany's completion of its 5G mobile spectrum auction pulled European shares higher on Thursday, overturning a weak opening as investors continued to worry about global trade tensions. 
Shares in 1&1 Drillisch and parent United Internet surged 9% and 5% respectively while market leader Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) gained 1% even as chief Dirk Woessner said the process had led to high prices and left a ""bitter aftertaste"".
The moves drove the European telecom index 0.6% higher and, allied to gains for oil companies after a surge in crude prices, pulled the pan-European STOXX 600 index 0.16% higher by 0815 GMT.
Germany's DAX also outperformed with a 0.4% rise.
""Focus will now switch to whether Drillisch will proceed with a mobile network build, but it could be several months before the outcome is known,"" UBS analysts said in a note on the tender. 
""We re-iterate our view that both Deutsche and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) are well placed regardless of whether a mobile network build does or does not go ahead.""
Europe's benchmark index has risen about 3% this month, undoing roughly half of a sell-off in May that was its worst monthly performance in more than two years.
The recovery has come largely on hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will take action to impede any slowdown in global growth in the wake of the trade tensions that have plagued markets and major economies over the past year.
U.S. inflation data on Wednesday raised the number of Federal Reserve rate cuts priced in to the money market to three this year and some analysts worry that is overdone. 
Germany's final inflation reading for May came in line with estimates on Thursday and banking stocks, which tend to suffer when expectations for interest rates fall, fell 0.4%.
""The expectations that central banks would intervene and might cut rates and start stimulating again, acts as a sort of buffer,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior macro strategist at Rabobank. 
The biggest decliner on STOXX 600 was Aurubis AG, down 10.8% % after Europe's largest copper producer warned on profits and said its CEO would leave the company immediately.

Thales rose 2.5% after the French defense electronics group raised its profitability target for 2019 as it factored in the contribution of the recently-acquired  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) business.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fast-growing British digital bank Monzo is set to announce on Thursday its imminent launch in the United States, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since its launch in 2015, Monzo has signed up more than 2 million customers in Britain, lured by its signature coral pink debit card and promise of slicker customer service than traditional banks.
Monzo is one of a range of so-called neobanks that have launched in Britain in recent years, joining a worldwide trend for digital-only banks that eschew traditional branch networks.
The new bank has seen rapid success in winning customers from the six large incumbent banks such as Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and RBS (LON:RBS) that dominate the market, although many customers have yet to switch their monthly pay cheques to Monzo.
The prize if Monzo succeeds in the United States' $7 trillion financial services sector is potentially huge, but banking experts say it will face a tough task.
""For UK fintechs looking to fly the nest, one major contrast will be the complexity of federal- and state-level laws, compared to the UK’s fintech-friendly regulatory environment,"" said Richard Lumb, group chief executive for financial services at consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN).

598,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 04:22AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Winners and Losers from Germany's 5G Auction,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe's second big auction of 5G spectrum is over, and there are only winners - unless you're a maker of network gear.
As far as the stock market is concerned, the biggest winner to emerge from Germany's auction, which started back in March, is the upstart new entrant 1&1  Drillisch  (DE:DRIG) and its parent,  United Internet  (DE:UTDI). They were up 9.1% and 6.6% respectively after early trading in Frankfurt Thursday, after Drillisch managed to walk away with a large chunk of spectrum for a relatively modest 1.07 bilion euros ($1.21 billion). They gave up some of the gains later.
Drillisch's larger rivals are also in the green, although not by as much.
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), which had to pay the most at €2.17 billion, was up only 0.7%, while  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) was up 3.7% and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD), which has bet heavily on the German market with its acquisition of Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA)'s assets, was up 1.2%.
Executives from Telekom and Vodafone were quick to complain that the high cost of the auction, which for them represents only a fraction of the overall costs of rolling out 5G services. Vodafone's German head Hannes Ametreiter called it ""a disaster for Germany"" while Telekom director Dirk Woessener said in a statement that the auction left a “bitter aftertaste”, complaining that the money spent on the auction is money that won\'t be available for spending on network-building.
“The network rollout in Germany has suffered a significant setback,"" he said.
Woessener is perhaps guilty of protesting too much. The overall auction proceeds of 6.6 billion euros were almost exactly what Italy raised in October for its considerably smaller market. That's due partly to the fact that the German auctions were less competitive, with only four major participants. Vodafone in particularly paid some 30% more for its spectrum in Italy than it did in Germany.
Even so, the market is allowing a grain of truth in the moaning from the carriers this morning. The worst performing stocks in the space are those of network builders Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA). They fell in early trading, only recovering later to trade up less than half a percent."
599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",Alibaba Files for a Hong Kong Mega-Listing,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. has filed confidentially for a Hong Kong listing, people familiar with the matter said, moving closer to what is potentially the city’s biggest share sale since 2010.
The online emporium filed a stock listing application with the exchange this week without the need for financial disclosures, the people said, requesting not to be named because the matter is private. It is said to have picked China International Capital Corp. and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG as lead banks. The offering from China’s largest corporation could raise as much as $20 billion, though Alibaba hasn’t finalized its fundraising target, the people said. An Alibaba representative declined to comment.
Alibaba -- which had roughly $30 billion of cash as of March -- has ridden a surge in Chinese online commerce alongside an increasingly affluent middle class. But it’s struggling to sustain growth as the world’s No. 2 economy slows, and China clashes with the U.S. over trade.
The deal could help finance a costly war of subsidies with Meituan Dianping in food delivery and travel, and may also divert investor cash from rivals like Meituan and WeChat-operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. The transaction could also bolster the city’s status as a destination for Chinese tech listings and boost the online retailer’s cash pile.
News of Alibaba’s filing sent shares in affiliated firms soaring. New Huadu Supercenter Co. and Sanjiang Shopping Club Co., both backed by the e-commerce giant, rose by their 10% daily limits on mainland exchanges. China TransInfo Technology Co., in which an Alibaba affiliate will take a 15% stake, gained as much as 5.4% in Shenzhen. And CICC climbed as much as 1.8% while the Hong Kong market was down a tad.
A successful deal will rival AIA Group Ltd.’s 2010 IPO as Hong Kong’s largest-ever share sale, a triumph for a city that’s ceded many of China’s largest corporations to U.S. exchanges. Alibaba raised $25 billion in New York in the world’s largest initial public offering after struggling to persuade Hong Kong regulators to approve its unique structure.
In the Hong Kong offering, the company will seek to preserve its existing governance system, where a partnership of top executives has rights including the ability to nominate a majority of board members, a person has said. Under new rules for secondary listings introduced by the Hong Kong bourse last year, the company can apply for an exemption to standard restrictions in the city that would bar that kind of setup.
The monster share sale comes as Chinese companies grapple with rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, and an increasingly hostile U.S. government that’s slapped export curbs on Huawei Technologies Co. and is considering similar restrictions against a clutch of artificial intelligence firms. A Hong Kong offering may have the benefit of tightening Alibaba’s ties with Beijing, in addition to the money raised.
Yet while China has supplied some of the world’s biggest initial public offerings over the last 12 months, it’s also been home to major disappointments. Xiaomi -- the first firm to list with a weighted-voting right structure in Hong Kong -- has tumbled more than 40% since its July debut. This year, games-streaming giant Douyu International Holdings Ltd. postponed its U.S. IPO launch following market jitters over a trade war.

The company, which makes corrugated cardboard, recycled paper and plastic packaging, posted a 31% rise in full-year adjusted pretax profit, but said box volumes growth slowed due to previously flagged weakness in certain export markets during the second half of the year.
""We saw some volume weakness in certain export-led markets in the second half of 2018/19, including Germany, but we expect this to improve during the current year,"" Chief Executive Miles Roberts said.
The company raised its medium-term margin target to 10%-12%, after recording margins of 10.2% this year, beating its 8%-10% guidance range.
DS Smith, which bought Spanish rival Europac for 1.9 billion euros ($2.15 billion) last year, also raised its savings target from the deal to 70 million euros ($79.1 million) from 50 million euros.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog said on Thursday it had fined PwC 4.55 million pounds ($5.8 million) for failing to challenge management at IT services company Redcentric where a 20 million pound hole was later found in the books.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said it had also required PwC, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms, to supplement the monitoring and support of its audit practice in the northern English city of Leeds.
The watchdog said breaches were numerous and in certain cases basic or fundamental in nature.
Two partners, Jaskamal Sarai and Arif Ahmad, were fined 140,000 pounds each. Both, along with PwC, were given a severe reprimand. PwC also had to publicly declare that its audit reports did not satisfy the relevant requirements.
All fines were discounted to reflect an early settlement of the case that covered audits for the financial years ending March 2015 and March 2016.
In a statement, PwC apologized that its work fell below the professional standards expected of the company. ""Since the work in question was completed we have taken numerous steps to strengthen processes,"" it said.
PwC said this month it was investing an extra 30 million pounds to focus more quality in audits.
Redcentric's 2016 statements were extensively restated, with net assets written down by 15.8 million pounds, and a profit after tax of 5.3 million pounds was restated to a loss of 4.2 million pounds.
The FRC said Sarai and Ahmad had undertaken training in relation to applying professional scepticism to what a client tells them.
""Professional scepticism was lacking in this audit. Had it been applied, it is likely that certain material misstatements would have been detected,"" said Claudia Mortimore, the FRC's deputy executive counsel.
""As this is the second final decision notice involving PwC Leeds office in recent years, we have mandated that the firm supplements its ongoing monitoring and support for that office, to further improve the quality of audit work in the future,"" Mortimore said.

The audit sector, and the FRC itself, face sweeping reforms in a bid to improve standards in auditing after the high-profile collapse of construction company Carillion and retailer BHS, which PwC audited.

604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 02:50AM ET</span>",Tesco Suffers From Weak U.K. Market,"(Bloomberg) --  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) started the financial year on a downbeat note as the U.K.’s largest retailer said sales were held back by the political turmoil over the U.K.’s plan to leave the European Union.
Comparable sales in the U.K. rose 0.4% in the first quarter, half the rate analysts expected. The latest results show that the supermarket operator is not immune to the challenges facing other British retailers, which are getting squeezed by competition from discounters, the rise of online shopping and side effects of Brexit.
“The subdued nature we talk about is the consumer sentiment, which is weakening in the U.K.,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis said on a call with reporters. “Some of that is clearly driven by the political situation.’’
The governing Conservative Party is seeking a new leader after the resignation of Theresa May, which followed her inability to secure Parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal. Now the EU exit has been delayed until Oct. 31, leaving shoppers in limbo over what comes next.
Tesco also suffered from comparisons against a particularly strong period last year, when it benefited from warm weather and a royal wedding. The Booker wholesale division, which has been driving growth, continues to expand but was also held back by a similar effect after securing contract wins last year.
Tesco has used its scale to hold down prices, until now insulating it from the troubles faced by rivals like J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) Plc, whose bid to combine with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.’s Asda was blocked by regulators. The deal would have given them the purchasing heft to rival the market leader.
Tesco said it was still growing more rapidly than the overall U.K. market as it expands its range of private-label items. But the rate in the latest period was a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter’s 1.7% gain. Tesco’s shares have climbed 20% so far this year.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 02:24AM ET</span>","Seeking shelter from trade war, fund managers bet on China's consumers","By Swati Pandey and Noah Sin
SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China may be an odd choice for investors seeking shelter from a Sino-U.S. trade war. Yet, money managers in Asia are pouring funds into Chinese stocks as the long-term promise of a growing middle class trumps more immediate fears about tariffs. 
It is also a vote of confidence in Beijing's aggressive policy response to a festering Sino-U.S. trade standoff which has hurt its economy, unsettled world financial markets and triggered fears of a global recession.
The anxiety has forced investors into defensive holdings such as the safe haven yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries.
Paradoxically, for China, the rising U.S. import barriers have an upside as they inject impetus to the shift in its economy from an investment-driven growth model towards one led by consumption and services. And, the nation's 400-million-plus growing middle class provides a major attraction for fund managers.
""Owning domestic-focused names in China has been successful in 2019, even with all the noise around trade tension, weakening macro and the magic '7' level for the renminbi,"" said Sat Duhra, a portfolio manager for Janus Henderson Investors' Asia ex-Japan Equities strategy. 
""Names in the sportswear and beverage sectors have performed well as trade issues have not impacted them and their strong branding and high margins have attracted investors looking for less cyclical and global trade exposure,"" Duhra said.
Domestic consumption already drives just over 75% of China's annual economic output. 
In an effort to revive its $14 trillion economy, China has pumped cash into banks, fast-tracked infrastructure spending and rolled out tax cuts worth trillions of yuan to support consumers and businesses. And, it has said it could do more. 
Local governments have chipped in. Guangdong Province last month rolled out 29 measures to boost consumption, including relaxing restrictions on auto purchases. 
SAFE, BORING, DEFENSIVE
Consumer shares have been relatively unscathed, even as escalating trade tensions wiped out 11% of the main Shanghai stock market since mid-April, though the market is still up 17% year-to-date.
The Chinese consumer staples index has jumped almost 50% so far this year whereas its information technology companies index has climbed over 24%, tracking the rise in the benchmark CSI300 Index.
CSI300 has risen 22% in the same period, outpacing the 6% gains in the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index and the 15% rally in the S&P 500
Hot-pot condiment maker Yihai International, for instance, is already up more than 100% this year after sky-rocketing 155% in 2018. Shanghai-listed Tsingtao Brewery has risen over 30% and Foshan Haitan Flavouring and Food Co has surged 51%.
""We don't think the trade war will have much impact on the Chinese consumption space,"" said Robert Mann, a Singapore-based portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management, who sees opportunities in China's service sector. 
""More of what China is doing is helping consumption. So, that's one place to hide."" 
Khiem Do, head of Greater China investments at Barings, also expects the ""safe, boring and defensive high-yielding stocks"" from consumer staples to utilities to continue to outperform in China.
Pimco, which has $1.76 trillion in assets under management as of March 2019, is betting on U.S. Treasuries and Australian government bonds to take cover if the world slides into recession, but also sees opportunities in Chinese debt, said its co-head of Asia-Pacific portfolio management, Robert Mead. 
POWDER DRY
None of the fund managers had recession as their base case scenario although most saw downside risks to growth and possibility the Federal Reserve would ease policy, an outcome that could hurt the U.S. dollar and ultimately benefit Asian markets. 
For a factbox on fund managers' views on recession risk and investment plans, please click
The futures markets currently hint at nearly 100 basis points of rate cuts in the United States by September 2020.
Fund managers were also wary of a worse-than-expected Chinese slowdown or disruptions in global trade that would pose risks to the entire region. Which is why many of them were also squirreling away some money into markets such as Indonesia and India, nations less exposed to the vagaries of global trade.
For Dwyfor Evans, head of APAC Macro Strategy at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets, South Asia is the sweet spot as things get gloomy globally.
""The problem for North Asia is that they are so beholden to global conditions. That's less of an issue for India or Indonesia because they are less demand-driven,"" Evans said.
Both these countries recently re-elected their leaders, paving the way for long-expected economic reforms. India could additionally get a lift from lower oil prices in the event of a global recession. 
For some, though, just sitting tight was the ideal approach for now.
""Keeping our powder dry and being alert to future opportunities seems the best strategy,"" said Mark Schofield, Citi's managing director for global strategy which has a 'modest overweight' for Asia-focussed EM equities.

""The Swiss big banks Credit Suisse and UBS have slightly improved their capital situation overall, in spite of the moderate deterioration in economic and financial conditions"", the central bank said in its 2019 financial stability report.
""According to FINMA, further efforts by the big banks are required, to demonstrate that systemically important functions can be maintained without interruption in a crisis.""
UBS and Credit Suisse have until the end of 2019 to prepare so-called resolution plans that would prevent taxpayers from having to bail them out in the event of a crisis.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB), which helps oversee the stability of the country's financial system, further highlighted risks to the country's domestic banks from real estate lending and mortgage markets.
Domestically focused banks further increased their exposure to these markets in 2018, the SNB said, against a backdrop of persistent imbalances on mortgage and real estate markets and as already-high affordability risks continued to rise.

Targeted measures remain necessary to address issues in residential investment property lending, the SNB said, adding it supported new measures proposed by the government and by industry lobby Swiss Bankers Association.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>","Lobby group tells China to focus on reform, not retaliation on U.S. firms","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China should focus on market reforms and avoid restricting access for U.S. financial firms if the trade war escalates and spills into the financial sector, said a lobby group representing global banks and asset managers.
The Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) also urged Beijing to accelerate the opening up of the country's financial markets to attract much-needed foreign capital to aid a slowing economy amid rising trade tensions. 
""Our message to the Chinese authorities would be that it wouldn't be wise at this point in time to play those kind of games between U.S. and non-U.S. firms,"" ASIFMA CEO Mark Austen told Reuters.
""China really needs to open up their markets for their own interests and create a transparent, fair, non-discriminatory access to their market."" 
Austen added that there was as yet no evidence of China favoring non-U.S. firms over U.S.-based ones. 
In March, U.S. banking giant JP Morgan won regulatory approval from China to take majority control of its securities joint venture, putting it on a par with Swiss rival UBS and London-headquartered HSBC, who already have that right. 
JP Morgan is also close to becoming the first foreign firm to own a majority of its Chinese mutual fund business, Reuters reported last month.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have sharply intensified since trade negotiations collapsed last month, with both countries slapping higher tariffs on each other's goods. The U.S. blacklisting of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies also raised the prospects of a ""technology cold war"".
Amid concerns the trade dispute could affect other areas such as rare earths and capital markets, China on Tuesday vowed a tough response if Trump insists on dialing up the pressure with more tariffs.
On Thursday, however, Chinese officials promised to continue reforming the country's financial sector.
""We will further open China's banking, insurance, securities and trust sectors,"" said Guo Shuqing, head of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), at a financial forum in Shanghai. ""We especially welcome experienced global asset managers, along with domestic players, to raise yuan capital, and invest in yuan-denominated securities markets.""
In a report published on Thursday, ASIFMA complained that China has been slow in granting local operation licenses to U.S. rating agency Fitch Ratings, and U.S. bank card payment firms Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), but Austen sees no links between these cases and rising trade tensions. 
""We certainly see at this point no evidence of very significant escalation in slowing down of U.S. firms getting access to the Chinese market in favor of other non-U.S., non-Chinese firms,"" Austen said. 
""I think the Chinese authorities are well aware that they need to create a transparent, non-discriminatory access and not allow politics to be infused into that because it actually undermines everything they're trying to do in developing their financial markets.""
In its report, ASIFMA urged China to accelerate reform of its capital markets, relax foreign ownership rules and create a level playing field between domestic and foreign firms. 
China needs to step up its transformation toward a consumption-led economy and cut its reliance on exports, so ""there's a real domestic imperative for China to develop its own capital markets and allow foreign investment to flow in and foreign firms to operate in China to help with that development,"" said Austen, who expects a current account deficit in China in the medium term.
ASIFMA also urged China to relax capital controls, even as the trade war triggers concerns about capital outflows and yuan depreciation.
China has been very sensitive to capital outflows since 2015/2016, and ""with the escalation of the trade tensions, they will become even more sensitive in the short term,"" Austen said.

""But curbs on outflows would discourage foreign capital inflows,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The senior Democrat on the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday criticized the FCC's review of the proposed $26.5 billion tie-up of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, saying Republican commissioners moved toward approving the merger without adequate economic and legal analysis.
""This is highly unusual. I have no economic analysis, legal analysis or paper before me and yet my colleagues have announced that they are going to support this transaction via press release,"" FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, told the Senate Commerce Committee during a hearing. ""This is just the worst of what people expect from Washington. It looks like some backroom dealing.""
On May 20, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, recommended to his colleagues that they approve the deal. Commissioner Brendan Carr said he would vote to approve while the third Republican Mike O'Rielly said he was inclined to approve it.
Brian Hart, a spokesman for Pai, said ""the chairman’s views and comments are based on the extensive public record that the commission has compiled over the last year.""
On Tuesday, 10 state attorneys general led by New York and California filed suit in New York against the firms and their parent companies Softbank Group Corp and Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), seeking to block the merger which they say would hike consumer prices.
The Justice Department has not yet offered a view on whether the merger should proceed.
T-Mobile chief executive John Legere defended the deal after the attorney generals sued, saying on Twitter the ""broad and deep nationwide 5G network we will build, is our best bet for America to truly compete on a global scale.""
Pai sent letters to some Democratic senators on Tuesday defending the review. Pai told Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, the agency followed a standard review process and was ""more transparent"" than usual by disclosing details of company commitments weeks before a formal order is circulated.
Some Democrats questioned the review and asked why Pai was not giving the public a chance to formally comment on the merger commitments.
Pai said he had no contact with anyone from the White House about the merger.
The FCC's review process won backing from Republican senator Roy Blunt, who said the agency did not need to wait for the Justice Department.

""Not everybody agrees with the attorneys generals on this who frankly probably haven't spent a whole lot of time thinking about this particular marketplace,"" Blunt said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jess Ravich, the head of alternative products at TCW Group Inc, has left the U.S. asset management firm, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
Ravich last year was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment case filed in New York state court by Sara Tirschwell, a distressed debt specialist who had worked at TCW. The lawsuit, which is also against TCW and its chief executive David Lippman, is pending in court. 
Through his lawyer, Ravich declined to comment on the reason for his departure. TCW declined to comment on the reason why Ravich left the firm. 
""Tirschwell's complaint filed January 25, 2018 in New York State Supreme Court is quite clear about her position concerning the conduct of Jess Ravich, David Lippman – TCW’s chief executive officer – and TCW toward her,"" a spokesperson for Tirschwell said in a statement. ""Beyond this, Tirschwell has no comment."" 
Ravich stepped down from TCW's board of directors in October 2018 after the firm found ""some unprofessional communications"" between Ravich and Tirschwell, according to a copy of an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. He had previously been on leave from the board, according to the memo.
TCW had hired an independent law firm to look into Tirschwell's allegations after it learned of them, according to the memo.
In her lawsuit, Tirschwell said Ravich, who was her boss at the time, ""coerced"" her into having sex with him. She alleged that after complaining of his advances, TCW fired her on the pretext that she had violated the firm's conflict of interest rules.
TCW has said in the past that it is proud of its inclusive culture and has a zero tolerance policy for any form of predatory behavior. In past statements, Ravich has said Tirschwell's ""allegations are completely false,"" and that he was her ""biggest supporter.""
Ravich worked as head of alternative products at TCW since 2012. Earlier in his career, he was head of the capital markets group at investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. 
Tirschwell spent 11 years at hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management, according to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, and has been named as among the top women in her field. 
She is now the interim chief financial officer at Foundation House, a transitional sober living program for men aged 17 to 35, according to the program's website. 

Over the last few years, dozens of men have been fired or resigned from jobs in politics, media, entertainment and business after facing sexual misconduct accusations, including Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and broadcaster Charlie Rose.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House Office of Management and Budget has told the U.S. Congress it will now meet a two-year deadline to ban federal contracts with companies that do business with Chinese telecom giant Huawei, part of a defense law passed last year, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
""Congress has made it clear in recent days the importance of implementing the law within the two years provided, and we will,"" Russ Vought, the acting director of OMB, said in a letter to Senator James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Last week the OMB had said it would need more time to implement the ban, which requires third-party suppliers and contractors to restrict their purchases and use of Huawei equipment.
But the White House reversed course after ""recent conversations with Congress,"" Vought said in the letter dated Wednesday.
""As we move forward to meet the statutory deadline without further delay, we will work with Congress to address any unforeseen issues that arise,"" Vought said.
The ban is one part of a multifaceted U.S. push against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's largest telecoms network gear maker, which Washington accuses of espionage and stealing intellectual property.
Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. It has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government over the restrictions in the defense policy bill.
The defense law, called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), placed a broad ban on the use of federal money to purchase products from Huawei, citing national security concerns.

It included a ban on direct federal purchases of Huawei equipment, which will take effect this year.

(Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it does not have a specific timetable on when Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's troubled 737 MAX jet would return to service after two fatal crashes led to the airplane's worldwide grounding in March.
FAA spokesman Greg Martin said the agency has ""no timetable"" for allowing the 737 MAX to resume flying and will act ""only when it is safe to return to service"".
Bloomberg reported earlier that the troubled 737 MAX aircraft will be back in the air by December, citing a top Federal Aviation Administration safety official.
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has not given a timeline on when the planes would be back in service.
Boeing is not expected to submit its formal software fix to the FAA this week or conduct a certification test flight that is required before it can submit the fix and training upgrade for approval, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
A battered aviation industry has been speculating on when Boeing will win regulators' approval to put the plane back in the air along with a batch of software upgrades and training.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc on Wednesday announced a sweeping overhaul at Jet.com, an online start-up it acquired in 2016 for $3.3 billion, after it failed to live up to the world's largest retailer's e-commerce ambitions. 
Walmart said it will integrate Jet.com's retail, technology, marketing, analytics and product teams with its own online business. The current president of Jet.com, Simon Belsham, will leave in early August.
Walmart's move reduces the scope and importance of Jet.com in its overall U.S. e-commerce business, which competes with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to interviews with six vendors, two consultants and three Walmart employees.
Jet.com, which was expected to boost Walmart's reach particularly with city dwellers and millennial shoppers, failed to become a driver for online grocery sales and growing market share in urban areas, the sources added. 
Walmart has put more emphasis on shopper perks such as same-day delivery and curbside pickup of groceries ordered online, focusing on food and grocery sales using those delivery methods. Jet, as a platform to sell similar items, has fallen by the wayside, the sources added.
The Jet overhaul is the latest sign that Walmart is attempting to fix the ways it reaches shoppers using different websites and delivery methods. Earlier this year, it ended a delivery partnership with Google-backed Deliv and last year Reuters reported its struggles to use its own employees to deliver products. 
Multiple large and medium-sized consumer goods companies that do business with both Walmart and Jet have told Reuters they began noticing Walmart executives buying less of their merchandise to sell through Jet. 
The reductions in Walmart’s order sizes for its Jet unit, they said, started in March, when many vendors began discussing business priorities with Walmart for the 2019 fiscal year.
In 2016, Jet forecast revenue of $1 billion and according to recent estimates from consulting firm Kantar, which was shared with some vendors, the company’s sales shrunk to $689 million in 2019. 
The data from Kantar also shows the number of U.S. households that shopped on Jet.com in January 2019 was 2%, down from 3% during the same period three years ago, forcing Walmart to recalibrate using Jet as a platform to drive online grocery sales.
Several vendors, who told Reuters they were keen to introduce new packaging and pricing on Walmart.com and Walmart-owned websites like Jet this year, said the retailer told them to look for ways to push more sales on Walmart.com going forward and not spend resources on a new strategy for sales of their merchandise on Jet. 
Walmart merchants are also informing grocery, apparel and electronics suppliers that want to introduce new products online that Jet is not a priority, according to vendor sources.
Separately, current and former Jet employees told Reuters that Hoboken, New Jersey-based Jet, is struggling to keep up its sales momentum and hit revenue goals. Two retail consultants, who advise Walmart on e-commerce and online grocery, have confirmed to Reuters that Jet is failing to keep pace with Walmart’s internal sales goals.
They said Walmart has de-prioritized the business and is focusing more on growing sales through its namesake website and offering a broader assortment of fashion and accessories through the multiple smaller brands like Moosejaw, Modcloth, Bonobos, Eloquii, Hayneedle and others it has acquired in the past few years to attract millennials. 
The retailer has previously said it expects losses from its online business, including Jet.com, to increase this year, without giving additional details. In the most recent quarter, Walmart's online sales grew 37% and Marc Lore, founder of Jet.com, who Walmart hired in 2016 to run its U.S. e-commerce operations, is still leading the business.
In 2018, the first cracks in Jet's business started to appear when Walmart’s CEO said the retailer’s marketing efforts will always be centered on Walmart.com as it is cheaper to acquire a new customer nationally with such a strategy and it is investing fewer ad dollars in Jet. He said the retailer will target Jet's investments in urban markets, where the business is “well-positioned to grow.”
A study from a retail analytics firm the same year found shopper traffic on Jet.com had declined in March, a study Walmart said then was inaccurate and not reflective of a trend.

Going forward, Kieran Shanahan, who oversees Walmart's food, consumables, health and wellness categories, will be responsible for Jet.com's strategy and management, in addition to his current role.

The French-U.S. engine maker, owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), has been competing with the airline's existing engine supplier, Pratt & Whitney, to provide the power for 280 twin-engine A320-family jetliners already on order from Airbus by the Delhi-based budget carrier.
The airline has selected CFM for the order, which is expected to rise above 600 engines including spares, the sources said. It was unclear if this includes previous options.

The two sides are putting finishing touches to the deal in time for an announcement at next week's Paris Airshow, they added. CFM International and IndiGo declined to comment.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wants to obtain majority ownership of a joint venture in China, but regulators there have not signed off on the idea, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on Wednesday.
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has a mutual funds joint venture in China called Morgan Stanley Huaxin Fund Management Co, as well as a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities. In April, the bank became the largest shareholder in the funds venture, but remains a minority owner.
Gorman did not identify which venture he was referring to.
""China is, I think, the only country in the world where we do business (and) don't have 50% or more ownership of our business,"" Gorman said at the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal. ""That is unacceptable.""
China has historically prevented foreign investors from becoming too powerful in its markets. That stance softened recently, with Beijing allowing foreign financial institutions to expand their presence onshore, but some Western companies have complained that progress is too slow.
Gorman said he recently spent time with regulators in China, seeking authority for Morgan Stanley to acquire a majority stake in one of its joint ventures.
Although they were open to the discussion, the broader trade war between the United States and China is hurting business ties and threatening to destabilize both countries' economies, Gorman said.

""There’s a hardening of attitudes on both sides,"" he said.

(Reuters) - DoubleLine Capital, run by widely followed investor Jeffrey Gundlach, is planning to launch a new fund that will invest in mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings on Wednesday. 
The Doubleline Income Fund will be overseen by Morris Chen, Andrew Hsu and Ken Shinoda, the filings said. DoubleLine, which oversees more than $130 billion in assets, declined to comment, citing a quiet period. 
Investors have become increasingly hungry for yield and income against the backdrop of ultra-low yields capped by central banks around the world.
DoubleLine said the fund may invest in securities of any credit quality and may invest without limit in securities rated below investment-grade - securities rated Ba1 or below by Moody’s and BB+ or below by S&P and Fitch Ratings, Inc. High yield corporate bonds and certain other fixed-income instruments in which the Fund may invest are commonly known as junk bonds.

The filing said: ""Although the fund will normally invest principally in mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and CLOs, the fund may invest in other debt instruments of any kind.""

That hamstrung energy stocks, which was the main drag on Wall Street.
For tomorrow, the new-issues market might be a driver for equities. Fiverr is set to debut, and it’ll be interesting to see if it falls into the trap of other money-losing initial public offerings like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), compared with profitable Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM).
1. Initial Jobless Claims Expected to Fall
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 8. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims to decline to 215,000 from 218,000 previous
The latest update on the U.S. job markets comes less than a week after the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy created far fewer jobs than expected last month, fueling expectations the Federal Reserve would cut rates at its July meeting.
2. Fiverr IPO Pricing on Watch
Fiverr is set to test investor appetite for yet another gig-economy stock, as it gears up to price its initial public offering.
The company, whose business proposition relies on connecting freelancers with clients, plans to issue 5,300,000 shares at $18.00-$20.00 per share, expecting to raise $101 million in an initial public offering on Thursday. The shares should start trading Friday with the ticker FVRR.
The company's net losses grew from $19.3 million in 2017 to $36.1 million in 2018, while revenue grew by nearly 45%, from $52.1 million to $75.5 million.
Rival Upwork, which went public in October, has lost its grip on investors as it ended the day down 3.7%, falling below its IPO price of $15.
3. Broadcom Guidance to Come Under Scrutiny 
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is set to report its fiscal second-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday. The chipmaker is expected to report earnings of $5.21 a share on revenue of $5.69 billion, up from $4.88 a share and revenue of $5.02 billion a year ago, according to analysts polled by Investing.com. Shares are up 10% this year.
Following a ramp up in U.S.-China trade tensions, the chipmaker's previous guidance for a rebound in its wireless business in the second half of the year will likely come under scrutiny. The U.S. and China have both imposed tariffs on each other's goods since Broadcom reported its first-quarter earnings and guidance in March."
621,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 05:40PM ET</span>",Trump considering sanctions over Russia's Nord Stream 2 natgas pipeline,"By Steve Holland and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was considering sanctions over Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project -- which the United States has told European companies 
to avoid -- and warned Germany against being dependent on Russia for the fuel.
""We're protecting Germany from Russia and Russia is getting billions and billions of dollars from Germany,"" Trump told reporters at an appearance with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the White House.
Nord Stream 2, a 760-mile (1,225-km) pipeline project to ship gas from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany, would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream pipeline and has divided the European Union.
Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries see the pipeline as increasing Moscow's economic grip on Europe. But many politicians and energy companies in Germany support Nord Stream 2 because the country, Europe's biggest economy, needs steady gas supplies as it seeks to wean itself off of coal and nuclear power. 
Nord Stream 2 is led by Russian state gas producer Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), with 50% of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper and BASF's Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's and France's Engie.
U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said last month that a sanctions bill putting onerous restrictions on companies involved in the project would come in the ""not too distant future.""
Any sanctions on European companies involved in the project could increase friction with countries including Germany, Austria and France. 
Perry has visited Europe to promote U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help it diversify its sources of natural gas beyond Russia, which has occasionally stopped shipments of gas via Ukraine during times of pricing disputes. 
The administration of former President Barack Obama also opposed Nord Stream 2.
Trump said Nord Stream 2 ""really makes Germany a hostage of Russia if things ever happen that were bad.""
U.S. LNG companies have made some long term deals with European countries, but the shipments are also generally more expensive than gas sent by pipeline from Russia.
Earlier on Wednesday at the White House, Polish Oil and Gas Company (PGNiG) signed a deal to purchase 1.5 million metric tons of LNG per year from U.S. company Venture Global LNG starting in 2023, bringing its total planned purchases from the company to 3.5 million metric tons per year. Trump and the Department of Energy said sales outlined in the contract are worth about $8 billion.

Poland gets most of its gas from Russia, but its long-term contract for gas supplies from Gazprom ends in 2022. Poland also signed an agreement with U.S. officials on civilian nuclear power cooperation.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 05:05PM ET</span>",Huawei fights to keep U.S. funds flowing to its rural mobile customers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, argued on Wednesday that Washington should scrap plans to prohibit wireless companies from using U.S. government funds to buy Huawei gear for their networks.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said in March 2018 that he was proposing banning the use of money from its Universal Service Fund to buy equipment or services from companies that pose a security threat to U.S. communications networks. Pai identified Huawei as a company of concern in a letter to Congress.
The rule has not gone into effect, although Pai reiterated support for it in a congressional hearing last month. A commissioner also asked for comment on whether existing gear from companies of concern should be removed from U.S. telecommunications networks.
Huawei argued in a filing to the FCC Wednesday that the proposed rule would do nothing to protect national security, and could destabilize rural networks if they are required to rip out Huawei equipment they installed years ago.
""Huawei cannot and will not sabotage its customer networks. But recent actions by the United States government are only one step away from doing so,"" Huawei said in its filing.
The Rural Wireless Association has estimated that it would cost $800 million to $1 billion for all members to replace equipment purchased from China's Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763).
Huawei has been battling the U.S. government for more than a year. National security experts worry that ""back doors"" in routers, switches and other Huawei equipment could allow China to spy on U.S. communications. Huawei has denied that it would help China spy.
Rural carriers have also opposed the bar on using Universal Service Fund monies on Huawei equipment, which is often cheaper than competitors. 
Missouri's Mark Twain Communications, for example, also noted in a recent filing that it would be difficult for the companies to determine which suppliers it should avoid because they may in the future pose a national security threat.
The Universal Service Fund subsidizes equipment used to provide service in four programs, including some rural or hard-to-reach areas, libraries and schools and a program that helps low income consumers get phone service.
Huawei also said in the filing that it had sought to meet with FCC commissioners to discuss the rule-making but were rebuffed.
Huawei also argued in the filing that banning its equipment from sale in the United States ""would likely violate"" U.S. obligations to the World Trade Organization. 
""The Commission should not allow unsubstantiated 'national security concerns' to serve as a pretext for potential violation of long-standing international trade agreements, especially since such targeted actions would fail to address supply chain security concerns effectively,"" the company said in the filing.

The U.S. government has also angered China by putting Huawei on a blacklist that would ban U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese firm.

WTI futures were off 4% to $51.14 a barrel, the lowest close since January. Brent crude, the global benchmark, slumped 3.7%, or $2.32 a barrel to $59.97, its lowest close since Jan. 8, as traders worried about a global supply glut.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were among the losers. Goldman Sachs' 2.4% decline subtracted nearly 32 points from the Dow.
Toymaker Mattel jumped 5.27% after reporting it had received and rejected a takeover offer from privately held MGA Entertainment. The offer was the second from the maker of Bratz dolls. A price wasn't disclosed.

Pompeo's remarks at the U.S.-India Business Council refer to a decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to end preferential trade treatment for India from June 5 over the trade barriers.
""We remain open to dialogue, and we hope that our friends in India will drop their trade barriers and trust in the competitiveness"" of their own companies, Pompeo said ahead of his June 24-30 travels to India, Sri Lanka, Japan and South Korea.
""We'll also push for the free flow of data across borders – not just to help American companies – but to protect data and ensure consumer privacy.
He added: ""And speaking of privacy, we are eager to help India establish secure communications networks – including 5G networks.""
The privileges come under the General System of Preferences, or GSP, which had been allowing preferential duty-free imports of up to $5.6 billion a year into the United States from the South Asian nations. India is the biggest beneficiary of the GSP program.

Washington has been particularly annoyed by India's tightening of regulations that have undermined major U.S. companies but favored domestic entities in the past year. In particular, tighter e-commerce rules that came in earlier this year hurt Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, which last year bought Indian online retailer Flipkart for $16 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended down slightly on Wednesday, with bank stocks declining as prospects of a U.S. interest rate cut rose and energy shares tumbling along with oil prices.
The S&P 500 energy index slid 1.4%, the most among the 11 S&P sectors, as demand worries drove U.S. crude prices down 4%. The day's losses made energy the worst-performing S&P 500 sector for the year-to-date.
A report from the Labor Department showed U.S. consumer prices rose 0.1% in May, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters, pointing to moderate inflation. This backed the case for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
Banking stocks, which tend to benefit from higher interest rates, dropped 1.4%. The broader financial sector fell 1%. 
Still, hopes that the Fed will act to counter a slowing global economy due to the escalating trade war with China have spurred a rally in stocks this month. The S&P 500 index is up 4.6% so far in June.
Fed policymakers will meet on June 18-19. Markets have priced in at least two rate cuts by the end of 2019. Fed fund futures imply around an 80% chance of an easing in rates as soon as July.
Investors are reducing exposure to stocks after the recent rally and as they brace for the Fed meeting.
""People don't want to be too far over their skis going into next week,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43.68 points, or 0.17%, to 26,004.83, the S&P 500 lost 5.88 points, or 0.20%, to 2,879.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 29.85 points, or 0.38%, to 7,792.72.
S&P 500 utilities, which are positively affected by falling rates, was the day's best-peforming sector, rising 1.3%. 
Lingering worries on the trade front weighed on sentiment, a day after President Donald Trump said he was holding up a deal with China and had no interest in moving ahead unless Beijing agrees to four or five major points.
Less than three weeks before proposed talks between the United States and Chinese leaders, sources say there has been little preparation. Trump said a deal could be reached, but again threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese goods unless that happens.
Semiconductor stocks, which get sizeable revenue from China, declined on Wednesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index dropped 2.3%. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT) and  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX) dropped more than 5% each.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) shares declined 1.7% after the Wall Street Journal reported the social media giant uncovered emails possibly connecting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to potentially problematic privacy practices.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 104 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.98 billion shares, compared to the 6.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Americans spent $72.56 billion last year on their pets, according to American Pet Products Association. Prescription drugs were expected to account for over $10 billion, according to an estimate https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/competition-pet-medications-industry-prescription-portability-distribution-practices/150526-pet-meds-report.pdf from the Federal Trade Commission, and overall pet product sales are expected to keep growing by 4% a year. (Graphic:https://tmsnrt.rs/2KfxTvy)
With deep discounts and online convenience, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, soon-to-be listed Chewy.com and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Wag brand have effectively conquered the market for pet food, care products and other supplies, but until now veterinary practices, which both prescribe and sell drugs, have been a major source of prescription medication.
While Amazon so far has shown no interest in that market, Chewy's and Walmart's forays into the online pet pharmacy business threaten to change that, prompting veterinary clinics to seek help in defending their turf. Enter Covetrus Inc, Vet Source, which partners with  Patterson Companies Inc  (NASDAQ:PDCO), and others that offer tools to help vets manage their practices and give customers the convenience they have come to expect from online shopping. 
""We started to realize this is what our clients want,"" said Stephanie Foster, practice manager at Kings Veterinary Hospital in Loveland, Ohio. ""They want to be able to order things at 11 o' clock at night. They're used to the Amazon mentality."" 
Foster says she began using Covetrus to order drugs and supplies for the practice after it began losing sales of pet food and other products to online retailers. Now, her hospital has a website run by Covetrus under the practice's name that effectively acts as its online pharmacy.
With that comes software that helps the clinic manage its inventory and track prescriptions, so Foster knows when clients need a refill and for those Covetrus collects a service fee that is a percentage of sales.
Foster said partnering with Covetrus has helped boost overall sales by half over the past three years because it gives clients online convenience, timely reminders and, despite the fees, competitive prices. 
""Covetrus now has more leverage with the manufacturers than I will ever have as a small business,"" she said. ""They're able to get the manufacturers to agree to instant rebates and they can do flash sales on products and things that we just can't compete with."" 
The company, formed by the combination of medical supply firm Henry Schein's animal health unit and Vet's First Choice and listed in February, represents some 100,000 veterinary practices globally. In the United States, 27,000 use some form of its services with over 8,000 - about a quarter of the market - signed up for prescription management, Covetrus says.
HOME TURF ADVANTAGE 
PetSmart Inc-backed Chewy.com, whose sales soared from $26 million to $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2018, said in a filing ahead of its New York Stock Exchange debut this month it planned to expand its online pharmacy business launched last year.
The company has yet to update on the pharmacy's performance and it would not comment for this article, citing the silent period ahead of its stock exchange debut.
Walmart joined the fray last month when it launched its online pet pharmacy WalmartPetRx.com and said it aimed to operate 100 in-store animal clinics by the end of the year. 
Analysts say, however, the prescription pet medicine business could prove more challenging than other pet products.
Those who want to buy medication online still need a prescription from a vet and must either email or upload a copy or have the online retailer contact the practice first.
That, analysts say, offers the practices a chance to sell the first batch on site and then direct customers to their own online service. 
Kristen Cook, a practice manager at the Belton Veterinary Clinic in Belton, Texas, says their doctors have no obligation to write a prescription for those shopping elsewhere and the clinic's policy is to handle prescriptions internally.
""It's not something like I am handing them a piece of paper to take it wherever they want to take it,"" Cook said.
The stakes are high.
Cook said that at least half of the clinic's revenue comes from prescription drug sales.
Nationally, pharmacy sales on average make up about a third of a practice's revenue, according to Gary Glassman, partner at accounting and financial services firm Burzenski & Company, which serves veterinary practices across the country.
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) says, however, that 40 states have already adopted laws, regulations or guidelines that specifically or implicitly require veterinarians to provide a written prescription upon request in some circumstances. 
To see the summary report from AVMA, please click here https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.avma.org_Advocacy_StateAndLocal_Pages_veterinary-2Dprescription-2Dorders.aspx&d=DwIFAw&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=8jyBHTp-ftbYVmyI068K1Q8yRVK2gfuVwhoRAbfROYc&m=arUS1W7HMxh0UqRAv-sYY0hDRvfIMSZVaQNL1Edm9Pc&s=PfO34q_x6QpWzO-T3CgPMN-qmVyZ5H2ziNmFNqzgr40&e 
This means pet owners could fill those prescriptions with Chewy or other online providers, and the market is just too attractive to e-commerce players for the vets and their partners to get complacent, analysts say. 
According to a 2018 TD Ameritrade online survey of U.S. millennial pet owners, they were willing to spend up to $2,000 on average if their pet got sick, with dog owners prepared to spend more on their pets than what they expected to spend on their own healthcare.

""People are treating their pets more like people,"" William Blair analyst John Kreger said. ""Historically ... you'd frankly euthanize the pet when they started to have some of these chronic conditions. That's just not happening now.""

At the company's annual meeting on Tuesday, Musk said Tesla had a “decent shot"" at delivering a record quarter on every level and railed against claims that the automaker had a demand problem.
""I want to be clear: There is not a demand problem,"" Musk said. ""Sales have far exceeded production, and production has been pretty good so we’re actually doing well.""
But Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2.7% to $211.14 after hitting a session high of $223.37, with traders seemingly taking profits in automaker's stock, which rose more than 15% in June through Tuesday in the run up to the shareholder meeting.
Some of selling was also attributed to company's lack of emphasis on returning the company to profit, with Musk warning last night that ""profitability is always challenging when you're a fast-growing company.""
In late April, Tesla guided for a second quarter net loss and a return to profitability in the third quarter.
Wedbush analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe said Tesla's profitability ""remains a hot button issue of the Street in light of the softness seen in the March quarter and the recent capital issue."" In early May, Tesla raised about $2.7 billion in the sale of stock and notes to bolster its cash reserves.
In addition, proposals to reduce board terms and give stockholders a greater voice in company matters failed at the annual meeting."
631,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 03:06PM ET</span>","Zell, other former Tribune executives reach $200 million settlement over LBO","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Real estate billionaire Sam Zell and other former officers and directors of Tribune Co have reached a $200 million settlement resolving allegations of fraudulent transactions related to the media company's disastrous 2007 leveraged buyout.
Marc Kirschner, a litigation trustee representing Tribune creditors, filed the proposed settlement on May 31 with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware. The accord requires court approval, and a hearing is scheduled for July 11.
Roughly 50 defendants, including former Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons, agreed to the settlement, without admitting liability or wrongdoing.
Lawyers for Zell and FitzSimons did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.
Zell took Tribune private in an $8.2 billion buyout in December 2007 that saddled the Chicago-based owner of the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Baltimore Sun and WGN superstation with too much debt.
Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a year later, during the global financial crisis, after advertising revenue tumbled as more readers began getting their news online.
The company later split its broadcasting and newspaper businesses into what are now Tribune Media Co, which is being bought by Nexstar Media Group Inc, and Tribune Publishing Co. Some assets have been sold.
Zell, 77, who also served as Tribune's chief executive, has called the LBO the ""deal from hell."" He is worth $5.6 billion according to Forbes magazine.
Kirschner had sought damages for various alleged breaches, including ""unlawful"" dividends and fraudulent transfers, and has said Tribune officers and directors received more than $107 million from the LBO.
The trustee said the $200 million payout ""significantly"" exceeds the amount of available insurance, and the defendants will have to split the remainder among themselves.
Kirschner is pursuing other litigation over Tribune.

The bankruptcy case is In re Tribune Media Co, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 08-bk-13141. The multidistrict Tribune case is In re Tribune Co Fraudulent Conveyance Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 11-md-02296.

632,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 02:27PM ET</span>",Germany raises 6.55 billion euros in epic 5G spectrum auction,"By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT(Reuters) - Germany raised 6.55 billion euros ($7.4 billion) from its 5G mobile spectrum auction, the Federal Network Regulator (BNetzA) said on Wednesday after a near three-month battle that will see a fourth operator enter the market.
The sum pledged in a record 497 rounds of bidding for the 41 blocks on offer was more than analysts had expected, while operators complained that the price they were paying would sap their ability to invest in next-generation networks.
""The auction leaves a bitter aftertaste,"" said Deutsche Telekom's Germany chief Dirk Woessner. The market leader bid 2.17 billion euros for 130 Megahertz of the 420 MHz of spectrum being allocated in the 2 Gigahertz and 3.6 GHz bands.
""The result is a dampener on our network buildout. Spectrum, again, is much more expensive in Germany than elsewhere,"" added Woessner. 
Deutsche Telekom's Austrian unit recently bagged 5G spectrum far more cheaply.
The end of the auction fires the starting gun to upgrade networks to run connected factories or 'smart' cities in Europe's largest economy, which is lagging countries like the United States, Japan and Korea that are already starting to roll out 5G services.
Vodafone's Germany CEO Hannes Ametsreiter described the results of the auction as ""catastrophic"".
""I'm very unhappy about how long the process took and the high price that we as bidders must pay,"" he told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. ""Germany is losing valuable time in the digital stakes. In Europe, we won't be among the first to launch 5G services.""
 Vodafone  (LON:VOD) also won 130 MHz, paying 1.88 billion euros, while  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) Deutschland secured 90 MHz for 1.42 billion euros.
Telefonica bid less aggressively because it has a reserve of spectrum adjacent to the 2GHz band suited to bolstering its existing rural 4G coverage. The 3.6 GHz band has greater data capacity but shorter range, making it more useful for industrial and urban 5G uses.
""We've acquired a valuable package of frequencies that ideally complements our existing spectrum,"" said CEO Markus Haas. Telefonica Deutschland confirmed its financial guidance.
FOURTH PLAYER
New entrant 1&1 Drillisch, until now a 'virtual' mobile player controlled by United Internet, paid 1.07 billion euros for 70 MHz, bringing billionaire CEO Ralf Dommermuth closer to his dream of running Germany's fourth operator.
Drillisch, which also has the right to rent some Telefonica capacity through 2025, said it had ""laid the foundation for a successful and permanent"" position as Germany's fourth operator.
In the end, the auction raised more than the 5.1 billion euros from 2015's 4G spectrum auction, but far less than the 50 billion euros forked out by bidders in a ruinous auction in 2000.
The 5G contest started briskly on March 19 but soon slowed to a crawl as participants gamed a design that allowed incremental bids of just 2 million euros.
That dynamic was only broken last week after BNetzA raised the minimum allowable bid more than sixfold, a step that helped bring matters to a close.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors extended their retreat from the U.S. stock market by pulling nearly $8.2 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic equities last week, according to data released on Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
The declines came amid the Trump administration's threats to impose 5% import tariffs on all Mexican goods starting on Monday June 10. The United States and Mexico struck a deal to avert the tariffs but concerns still remained about the lingering U.S.-China trade war. 
Worries about the health of the global economy and persistent low inflation have led financial markets to brace for interest rate cuts as soon as this summer by the Federal Reserve. 
Net withdrawals from U.S. equity funds last week were almost double the $4.4 billion pulled out the week before, and the largest since the $9.5 billion lost during the week that ended May 15. For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $48.5 billion from U.S. stock funds. 
Bond funds, meanwhile, continued to attract new investor dollars. Taxable and municipal debt funds pulled in a net of $4.7 billion last week, adding to the $181.9 billion bond funds have brought in since the beginning of the year. 

World stock funds shed nearly $1.5 billion in assets last week, bringing the category's year to date decline to nearly $7 billion.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) will more than double its investment in European original programming and start an in-house studio at its European unit Sky after Sky's success with the mini-series ""Chernobyl,"" the company said on Wednesday. 
The U.S. cable and media conglomerate will invest about $1.27 billion (about 1 billion pounds) in Sky Studios programming over the next five years. 
""Chernobyl,"" a dramatization of the 1986 Soviet nuclear disaster, was one of Sky’s most-watched original productions and a catalyst for the new investment, according to sources familiar with the company. The show, which aired on AT&T-owned HBO in the United States, stood out amid a flood of content available on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services to become part of the cultural zeitgeist.
Sky Studios will produce content for Comcast subsidiaries NBC and Universal Pictures as well as other distributors hungry for programming. It will focus on drama and comedy shot in English, Italian, German and other European languages, from low- to high-budget.
Philadelphia-based Comcast bought Sky in September, paying roughly $39 billion after outbidding 21st Century Fox in a months-long battle. In doing so, the U.S. telecom conglomerate expanded its reach into Europe and continued a move into content that accelerated with its 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal. 

News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) Chairman Rupert Murdoch launched what was then Sky Television in 1989, building the company into a major European broadcaster over three decades.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 2% to $174.51.
The emails show that Zuckerberg raised questions about how the company was sharing data with third-party developers, suggesting he knew that the social media may be at risk of falling foul of privacy laws, the paper reported, citing sources. The increased scrutiny of Facebook, already under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission over its handling of user data, comes as the company warned that it is on the hook for a fine of up to $5 billion.
The potential impact of the mails has forced the company to opt for a quick settlement of its FTC investigation, according to the report.
The FTC is investigating whether Facebook's lax security measures violated a 2012 consent decree between the agency and Facebook that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal where a British consulting firm had harvested the personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles without their consent and used it for political advertising purposes. In the weeks that followed the scandal and after scrutiny from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Zuckerberg vowed to ramp up spending on security to beef up protection of user data on the social media platform, fueling fears that rising costs would hurt margins.
Facebook's tangle with regulators is unlikely to end anytime soon as The Journal reported last week that the FTC is also investigating the tech giant’s practices on digital competition.
But some on Wall Street are downplaying the impact of a potential increase in regulatory overnight on the social media giant, claiming the threat has already been priced in.
""When we downgraded Facebook from Buy to Neutral in September 2018, we were primarily concerned about four core issues,"" said Moffett Nathanson, an independent research firm, who upgraded its rating on Facebook stock to buy from neutral.
""First, we were worried that the shift in monetization from News Feed to Stories would weigh on revenue growth. Second, we assumed operating costs would remain elevated as Facebook invested to clean up its platform, which would depress margins going forward. Third, we were concerned that the market was ignoring the increasing global regulatory risks. Finally, we held a longer-term concern that Facebook lacked a “third act” after Facebook and Instagram monetization. Now, less than a year later, each of our main concerns around the health of Facebook’s business has been addressed.""
Despite today's slide, Facebook shares are up more than 33% this year. after falling 25.7% in 2018. Despite the recovery of the stock this year, it's still off 20% from its 52-week high of $218.62."

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has turned down a request to meet  Renault  (PA:RENA) chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, who is furious over the government's interference at the carmaker, sources told Reuters, raising questions over Senard's future. 
News of the rebuff came as Renault shareholders voted on Wednesday to endorse Senard's January appointment to replace Carlos Ghosn, the ousted leader of the Renault-Nissan alliance. 
Senard, whose bid to merge with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) over Nissan's reservations was thwarted by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Macron to appeal for his support, four government and company sources said.
Seven months after Ghosn's arrest on financial misconduct charges - which he denies - the alliance he forged is on life support. Nissan refused to study a full Renault tie-up proposed by Senard, and wants to weaken its 43.4% shareholder's grip.
Instead, Senard then tabled an FCA-Renault deal proposal developed without Nissan's knowledge. But FCA Chairman John Elkann withdrew the offer after France, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked the June 5 board vote and demanded more time to secure Nissan's endorsement.
Days later, in a third risky move that caused outrage in Japan, Senard vowed to block governance reforms introduced by Nissan after the Ghosn scandal unless Renault gets more seats on the Japanese firm's powerful new board committees.
Renault sources say Senard's exasperation deepened when Le Maire, seeking to smooth tensions from the sidelines of a weekend G20 meeting in Japan, publicly discussed a possible cut to France's 15% Renault stake or even Renault's Nissan holding.
Senard felt further undermined by Le Maire's surprise pronouncements and told colleagues he expected to be ""backed up from the highest level of government"", according to one. But Macron's office declined a proposed sit-down, the sources said. 
""There is no meeting with Senard on the president's agenda,"" an Elysee official said on Wednesday.
Renault declined to comment. But sources close to the chairman played down the rebuffed meeting request and said he was determined to stay put.
ON TOP FORM
Senard and Macron ""communicate regularly by text message"", one said, and the French head of state is extremely busy with other matters. ""Senard is on top form for his shareholders' meeting and is resolved to continue.""
France is not seeking to replace Senard, another government source said. ""He may have taken some bad advice, and he should clearly have made more personnel changes for Renault to move on"" from the Ghosn era, he added.
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa and Renault CEO Thierry Bollore, Ghosn's former second-in-command who was promoted in January, barely speak and are now seen as clear irritants to the relationship, French official and company sources say.
""Senard has become well aware of this,"" said a person familiar with his thinking. ""So we'll see how things evolve after the shareholder meeting.""
Saikawa's position also appears more fragile, after two leading investment advisory firms recommended a vote against his reappointment at the Japanese carmaker's June 25 shareholder gathering.
The recommendations may boost the chances of Saikawa's exit, although a vote against him remains unlikely. Under a 2015 amendment to alliance shareholder pacts, Renault is required to support the Nissan board's proposal to renew his mandate.
Senard told Renault shareholders on Wednesday that he remained ""distressed"" that a board vote on the FCA merger had been prevented. ""I don't know what the future holds, but the proposal remains an exceptional one to my mind,"" he said.
Senard and Elkann have discussed ways to revive the deal with Nissan's support, Reuters reported this week.

Hewing more closely to the government's line, however, Senard added that his priority was to strengthen the alliance. ""Renault cannot succeed unless the alliance succeeds,"" he said.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","Global FDI down in 2018 due to government interventions, Trump, Brexit: U.N.","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - Global foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by 13 percent last year because of government intervention, Brexit uncertainty and U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and trade policies, the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday.
UNCTAD forecasts a modest recovery of 10% this year, though with high uncertainty, since several of the policies that have dampened investment enthusiasm are still in place, and there is no sign of an end to technological rivalry between major powers.
""The Cold War that underpins technological competition is not going to be over in the next few years,"" UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi told reporters, referring to the rivalry between China and the United States. 
FDI, comprising cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A), intra-company loans and investment in start-up projects abroad, is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of growth of corporate supply chains and future trade ties.
In 2018, FDI into developed countries totaled $557 billion, the lowest since 2004, while a record 54% of the total went to developing countries.
NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS
Policies rather than economic factors put the brakes on FDI spending, UNCTAD investment chief James Zhan said, including Trump's tax reform, which encouraged U.S. firms to repatriate earnings, effectively sucking FDI out of foreign projects. 
Preliminary UNCTAD figures in January suggested that effect might be even bigger than it turned out to be, but after withdrawing $400 billion in the first half of 2018, some companies started looking afresh at foreign deals.
A second dampener on FDI was big countries blocking deals for national security reasons and for dominance of emerging strategic industries. 
UNCTAD found 22 deals worth $50 million or more that were blocked in 2018, worth $150 billion in all, equivalent of 12 percent of global FDI.
The largest was a proposed $117 billion takeover of U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) by Singapore's Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which Trump blocked for national security reasons, UNCTAD said.
This year the trend has continued, while the United States has stepped up its technology battle by trying to thwart the takeup of 5G mobile phone technology developed by Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, which Kituyi said was ""at the very center and embodies the main features of the emerging technology war"".
But with firms working across so many international borders, it is unclear how the struggle will play out, he said. 
China has discouraged outward investment in real estate, cinemas and soccer clubs to prevent capital flight and conserve foreign exchange reserves, restricting some deals and producing a ""chilling effect"" to discourage others, Zhan said. 
FDI was also impacted by a reordering of global assets driven mainly by the U.S.-China trade war, with many export-oriented firms moving out of China to Southeast Asia or India. 
The reconfiguration could accelerate with the advent of two major multi-country trade deals, known as the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership).
Britain's plan to leave the European Union also weighed.

""Investment flows to the UK declined last year by 36% and it’s not just for the UK – the process creates unpredictability and that affects the whole EU market,"" Zhan said.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",GM to invest $150 million to boost heavy-duty pickup truck production,"By Joseph White
FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) president Mark Reuss said on Wednesday that the automaker is investing about $150 million at its Flint Assembly plant, Michigan, to boost production of heavy duty trucks by another 40,000 vehicles a year.
Reuss announced the investment at the Flint truck assembly plant wearing a United Auto Workers pin.
The Detroit automaker announced in February it was adding 1,000 jobs in Flint to build a new generation of heavy-duty pickup trucks. 
GM did not say that the latest investment would add more jobs at the plant, but Reuss said there could be opportunities to add workers as the launch of the automaker's new trucks progresses. 
GM has been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and lawmakers of both parties to add jobs in the United States after it said last November it would idle a small car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and had no new products for three other U.S. manufacturing plants.
The Flint investment will include upgrades to the plant's conveyors and other new tooling, and will be completed in the first half of 2020. GM has invested more than $1.6 billion in the plant since 2013.
Last month, GM said it would invest $24 million to increase truck production at its assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which makes Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models.
Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000.

GM's Chevrolet and GMC brands have long trailed Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's F-series heavy duty trucks in the lucrative segment. The new Chevrolet and GMC heavy duty trucks have been re-engineered to tow heavier trailers, and keep pace in what has become an arms race among the Detroit Three automakers to claim superior torque and towing capability.

""The priority now is to make the alliance successful, efficient and strong,"" Senard said during the company's shareholder meeting in Paris on Wednesday.
""There won't be any success for Renault if there is no success for the alliance.""
Senard said a strengthening of the alliance would require efforts from both sides. Even though trust between the two partners had deteriorated, nothing was beyond repair, he said.
The alliance between Renault and Nissan had already been shaken by the ousting of chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is facing financial misconduct charges. Ghosn denies any wrongdoing.
Senard, who succeeded Ghosn as chairman, has been working to repair relations with Nissan. But Nissan refused to study Senard's proposed full merger with Renault and Renault has blocked governance changes at Nissan and demanded more seats on Nissan's committees.

French President Emmanuel Macron has turned down a request to meet Senard, who is furious over the government's interference at the carmaker, sources told Reuters, raising questions over Senard's future.

All seven of the Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs) proposed by Green's Arcadia Group were approved by the required majority of creditors, including its pension trustees, suppliers and landlords, the retailer said.
The restructuring will close stores, cut rents and make changes to the funding of the group's pension schemes, but it will enable it to keep operating.
""We are extremely grateful to our creditors for supporting these proposals,"" said Ian Grabiner, Arcadia's CEO.
""The future of Arcadia, our thousands of colleagues, and our extensive supplier base is now on a much firmer footing.""
A week ago the creditors' meeting was adjourned after several landlords chose not to back Green's plan.

He responded on Friday by offering better terms to landlords, with the costs met by Tina Green - his Monaco-based wife and the ultimate owner of the group.

Musk told shareholders on Tuesday that Tesla was on track to hit its volume production goal for the year, indicating the demand for its cars remains strong.
""We made as many cars last year as we had in our entire history. And this year, it's going to be pretty similar at least sort of 60% to 80% growth of the total vehicle fleet, maybe more than that, "" Musk said.
Analysts at Cowen & Co, however, questioned the 47-year old billionaire's comment, saying ""Musk claims that sales have far exceeded production, but the data doesn't suggest"".
""Basic microeconomic theory would suggest that goods or services that don't have a demand problem, don't see their prices lowered by half a dozen times in 4-5 months."" 
The company has lowered prices for its vehicles multiple times in the past few months to boost sales of its models. 
In the first quarter ended March, Tesla reported a 31% fall in deliveries, sparking concerns about the company's ability to make profits and meet its delivery targets while it grapples with issues related to cash flow and manufacturing.
However, Baird analyst Ben Kallo, rated four out of five stars for his accuracy on estimates for Tesla, believes ""bear arguments will be disproven in the coming weeks and months"". 
He also expects the carmaker, which witnessed steady demand over the past few weeks, to be cash flow positive in the second quarter. 
At least eight Wall Street brokerages cut their price target for Tesla in May to an average of $280.31 a share, according to Refinitiv data. Shares of the company have fallen by around $120 in 2019 and were trading at around $222 before the bell on Wednesday. 
Of the 31 analysts who cover the stock, only 12 now recommend buying Tesla shares, while another 12 have a ""sell"" rating and the rest have ""hold"". 
""There is clearly a somewhat healthy level of demand, but maybe not as aggressive as what Tesla management would like. Maybe galloping growth, not blistering growth,"" said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin.

Irwin rates the stock ""buy"", with a price target of $238.

The investor in a letter to the company's board said it was disappointed by the stock's performance despite the acquisition of smaller rival Rowan Cos Plc for $2.38 billion in April.
A commitment to pay out the dividend should lead to an immediate re-rating of the stock, according to Luminus, which said it owns a 4.5% stake in the London-based company. 
Ensco Rowan's shares have lost more than half their value since the merger closed on April 11. They were down at $7.07 in morning trade, giving the company a market capitalization of about $1.40 billion.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 09:48AM ET</span>","Reckitt picks PepsiCo executive as CEO, going outside for first time","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser has picked PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) executive Laxman Narasimhan as its next chief executive, becoming the latest industry heavyweight to turn to a company outsider to tackle faltering growth and new media-savvy rivals.
Narasimhan, PepsiCo's global chief commercial officer, is the first external candidate to be appointed as CEO at Reckitt since the maker of Durex condoms, Nurofen tablets and Dettol cleaners was formed in 1999. 
The 52-year-old takes over as CEO on Sept. 1, replacing Rakesh Kapoor, 60, who has led Reckitt for more than eight years and said in January he would retire this year. 
Analysts welcomed the appointment, saying the new CEO would inject a fresh perspective to a company facing industrywide challenges to growth, though some said it raised doubts about the fate of Reckitt's restructuring plan. 
The appointment is the latest in a series of external hirings as major consumer goods groups look to make up ground lost to smaller brands that have done a better job selling online and connecting with millennials on social media, while also facing investor pressure to boost efficiency.
Analysts had tipped Reckitt's health division operations chief Aditya Sehgal and hygiene home president Rob de Groot as potential internal successors to Kapoor. 
In the end, Narasimhan's experience running large scale consumer businesses in developed and emerging markets helped him beat out 60 candidates reviewed for the job, Reckitt Benckiser Chairman Chris Sinclair told Reuters. 
""He has got great perspective, but first and foremost we saw him as a consumerist and a consumer marketer and that's what set him apart,"" Sinclair said. 
At PepsiCo, the chief commercial officer position held by Narasimhan will now be filled by the company's Greater China CEO Ram Krishnan, the U.S. drinks maker said.
As well as industry challenges, Reckitt has faced company-specific setbacks in recent years, including a safety scandal in South Korea, a failed product launch and a cyber attack.
Kapoor launched a restructuring plan, dubbed RB 2.0, to split the group into two business units – one for health and one for hygiene and home products - under the same parent company. 
Reckitt said on Wednesday Narasimhan would be charged with delivering the plan, due to be completed in 2020, but some analysts suggested he might have other ideas. 
""The appointment of a new, external CEO is bound to raise questions regarding the timing of the end of the group's RB 2.0 plan and whether it will ultimately lead to a split of the company,"" Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt said.
Sinclair, however, said Reckitt was on track to complete the 2.0 program by mid or late 2020 and that Narasimhan agreed with the plan.
'FRESH PERSPECTIVE'
Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo questioned why a company already smaller than rivals Procter & Gamble and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) wanted to ""descale itself"", which could hobble its ability to compete in emerging markets. 
Reckitt shares were up 1.6% in afternoon trading on the London Stock Exchange. 
At least three analysts welcomed Narasimhan's appointment. 
""Narasimhan's strategic and leadership background make him a strong fit for Reckitt. We believe he will bring a fresh perspective to both the business and to investors,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Richard Taylor wrote in a note.
Narasimhan led Strategy, Global Category Groups and Global R&D in his capacity as Chief Commercial Officer at PepsiCo. 
Prior to that, he headed the beverage maker's Latin America, Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa operations, managing annual sales of 14.5 billion pounds ($18.5 billion) - more than the total annual sales of Reckitt Benckiser. At one time he was also chief financial officer of the group's Americas Foods business.

Narasimhan studied mechanical engineering in India before moving to the United States for an MBA degree. Before joining PepsiCo, he worked at consultants McKinsey for two decades, where he advised on large consumer and healthcare deals.

The Dow gained 24 points or 0.1% by 9:40 AM ET (13:40 GMT), while the S&P 500 rose 0.8 points or 0.03% and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite lost 10 points or 0.1%.
Consumer inflation data edged up 0.1% in May and was up 1.8% on the year, below expectations for 1.9% and slipping marginally from the Federal Reserve's 2% target. 
""We're not seeing much signs of creeping inflation, or at least increasing inflation. That's one of the things that gives the Federal Reserve to think about lowering rates later this year,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
Meanwhile, concerns lingered after President Donald Trump said he had no intention of a trade deal with Beijing, absent concessions on five major but unspecified points.The comments appear to reduce the chance of a meaningful de-escalation of the conflict when the two leaders meet at the G20 summit on June 28-29.
""This is a market that would love to see us get back to the negotiating table,"" Hogan said. ""The longer these trade tensions last, the most damage it'll do to the economy, and therefore to earnings.""

661,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 09:38AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ethiopia plans to issue telco licenses by year-end,"By Maggie Fick
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia is aiming to award telco licenses to multinational mobile companies by the end of the year, ending a state monopoly and opening up one of the world's last major closed telecoms markets, three people with direct knowledge of the process said.
Ethiopia's telecoms industry is considered the big prize in a push to liberalize the country's economy launched last year by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed because of its huge protected market serving a population of around 100 million. 
Government officials have already looked at several potential options, including the sale of a minority stake in Ethio Telecom, granting of new licenses to multiple telecoms operators or a combination of both.
Abiy is keen to deliver quickly on his reform pledges but preparing Ethio Telecom, the monopoly operator, for a partial sale is proving a lengthy process, said the sources, who asked not to be named. As a result, the authorities are opting to auction new licenses first.
The plan, which has not yet been formally announced, would open the bidding process for two licenses in September and they would be awarded in December. 
The government will expect the winning companies to start operations next year, initially using Ethio Telecom's infrastructure to run their networks, the sources said.
State Minister of Finance Eyob Tekalign Tolina told Reuters the government hoped to launch a bidding process in September, but he declined to give further details of the reform plan.
""By this time next year, we hope that many Ethiopians will be using different SIM cards,"" he said. ""We are operating on a very aggressive timeline."" 
 Vodafone  (LON:VOD), South African operator MTN, France's Orange and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates are likely to be among the leading contenders vying for entry into the Ethiopian market.
Senior executives from those companies attended a telecoms conference in Addis Ababa this week and met with government officials.
Ethiopia's potential as an untapped market could outweigh concerns about any risks, including Ethiopians' low income levels and the country's over-valued birr currency.
""There will be a bidding war. It's the last greenfield site. There's an opportunity to be market dominant,"" said one company executive. 
A new telecoms regulator will issue the licenses, but this institution has not yet been set up. A law to create the new watchdog - the Ethiopian Communications Regulatory Authority - is scheduled to be debated by parliament on Thursday. 
TOO OPTIMISTIC?
Company executives who met with government officials this week were told to expect an announcement on the liberalization plan, possibly next week.
New licenses are the preferred option of telecoms executives, rather than a potential sale of part of Ethio Telecom. 
But several executives expressed scepticism over the government's ability to deliver new licenses by the end of this year. 
One company official said opening a bidding round in September was ambitious given the complexities of the process and the number of issues that still needed tackling.
""We need a credible, robust, unambiguous roadmap for the next two years,"" said another executive. He said Ethiopia must clarify details of the sector's future structure before company boards could consider a possible investment.
Even if the government opts for new licenses over a partial sale of Ethio Telecom, information on the state-owned company's existing infrastructure and balance sheet will be crucial for assessing the licenses' value. 
Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) and Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) have been involved in developing infrastructure for Ethio Telecom over the past few years.
Executives said they were more hopeful than at any point in the past decade that the government was serious about reforming the sector. 
""It feels real this time, for the first time,"" one of them said.
State finance minister Eyob said the reforms were on track and that, having consulted advisers from regulators including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the authorities were ready to move forward. 

""We've reviewed global experiences, the best and worst. We are a late comer in this so we can learn from what others did wrong and right,"" he said.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",South African tribunal says it can't charge foreign banks in rand-rigging case,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African legal case over exchange-rate rigging is set to drag on after the anti-trust tribunal ordered the competition watchdog on Wednesday to clarify the charges it is seeking, particularly regarding foreign banks it has no jurisdiction over.
The tribunal also dismissed a request from the banks involved to have the case dropped altogether.
In a probe that has rumbled on since 2015, the Competition Commission has been seeking to impose fines on more than a dozen local and foreign banks that it alleges colluded to coordinate activities when giving quotes to customers buying or selling currencies.
The Commission referred its case to the Competition Tribunal. But the Tribunal said on Wednesday it has sent the case back, giving the Commission 40 days to clarify the charges, partly because it has no authority over foreign lenders with no presence in South Africa.
""The Tribunal, in line with common law precedent, found that it did not have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring the foreign banks to pay any administrative penalty as such an order would not be effective,"" it said.
It may instead seek an order declaring the conduct of these foreign banks with no presence in South Africa to be anti-competitive, without issuing penalties to them.
With regards to foreign banks with a presence in South Africa, fines will be calculated based on the turnover of the representative unit in the country, the Tribunal said.
The foreign banks with no presence in South Africa are Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) International,  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd, Standard New York Securities Inc, Nomura International PLC, Macquarie Bank Ltd, HBC Bank USA, National Association (N.A), Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities (USA) LLC.

""The Tribunal found that, in both of these instances, the Commission would still need to allege that the conduct of the respondent banks had an effect in South Africa,"" it said.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",Dutch lawmakers step up tax demands on multinationals,"By John O'Donnell and Toby Sterling
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Dutch lawmakers have launched an inquiry into how to make multinationals pay their fair share of tax, after public criticism that government reforms do not go far enough.
Scores of multinationals use the Netherlands to pare their tax bills but the Dutch, who bore tax hikes after the financial crisis, are growing increasingly hostile to minimizing company tax, which is legal and has gone unchallenged for decades.
Parliamentarians voted on Tuesday to establish an expert commission to examine how to make taxing multinationals ""more fair"" after Netherlands-based Shell (LON:RDSa) recently acknowledged it had paid virtually no Dutch corporation tax in 2018. 
Royal Dutch Shell refused to release details of its unique advance tax ruling with the Dutch government at a recent hearing of a parliamentary panel on taxation.
""The Dutch people take note that one pays income tax when earning a minimum wage but some multinationals make (a) profit and pay no taxes,"" Pieter Omtzigt, the Dutch Christian Democrat parliamentarian who instigated the vote, told Reuters.
Government data shows that more than 4 trillion euros ($4.5 trillion) of assets, more than four times the size of the Dutch economy, are parked with thousands of letter box companies in the Netherlands. Many are used to route profits to low-tax countries.
""During election times, parties committed to limit the flow. The government needs to deliver,"" Omtzigt said.
'SHADY ROOMS'
Menno Snel, the top Dutch official in charge, said the government intends to introduce reforms to break with the image of ""deal-making ... in shady rooms"". 
Snel will target letter-box companies with a tax on outgoing payments to discourage 22 billion euros of royalty payments moving through the Netherlands, chiefly to Bermuda.
""If a company is trying to come ashore here for only one reason, to channel capital away, I make sure that this company is not feeling welcome any more,"" Snel said. 
He also wants to publish 'advance tax rulings' previously decided in secret by tax authorities for companies, who use them to establish the legality of tax structures.
Lawmakers have said the government measures fell short of what is needed and called for more details to be published of tax rulings, including the company name.
""Many people feel they paid for the financial crisis,"" said Bart Snels, a member of parliament from the Green party. ""Now they see they still have to pay higher taxes. VAT has risen and corporate taxes are lowered. They are angry.""
Paul Tang, a member of the European Parliament, said the Dutch reforms were ""highly symbolic"", pointing to the gradual lowering of the main corporate tax rate to 20.5% in 2021.
""They just keep on continuing the race to the bottom.""
Philips and Akzo Nobel told the parliamentary hearing that they also paid little or no Dutch corporation tax in 2018.  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), which routinely discloses its taxes, paid a modest 30 million euros. 
Snel said that while firms should still have a ""red carpet treatment"", the Netherlands would not be ""only tax friendly"".
The Tax Justice Network, which campaigns for transparency, has placed the Netherlands near the top of a global ranking of countries that helped to cut corporate tax bills. 
""15 years ago, no-one in the Netherlands knew this tax avoidance was going on,"" Francis Weyzig, a tax expert at anti-poverty charity Oxfam, said. 

""They know now. And they are angry.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World share markets snapped a seven-day winning streak on Wednesday as the White House took a tough line on trade talks with China, while an impending reading on U.S. inflation was set to refine the odds of an early cut in interest rates there.
Europe's main markets and Wall Street futures both followed Asia lower. London's FTSE, the DAX in Frankfurt and CAC40 in Paris fell 0.4% to 0.6% as traders trimmed June's near 4% gains. 
Benchmark government bonds rallied as the caution returned. FX dealers kept the dollar near an 11-week low as they waited to see whether the U.S. inflation numbers would bolster their bets on the first U.S. rate cuts since the financial crisis.
""I think we are in for a very nervous wait until next week's FOMC meeting,"" Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy, John Hardy, said.
""You have had the markets taking out aggressive positions on where the Fed is going to go and everybody is wondering whether they are ready to deliver as much, in terms of guidance, as has been priced in.""
Chinese inflation was in the mix, too. Figures overnight showed it picked up to a 15-month high of 2.7%, mainly because of surging pork prices. Excluding food, inflation rose only 1.6% and suggested plenty of scope for more stimulus. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had slipped 0.6% after two days of gains and after Wall Street's recent rally had stalled on Tuesday. 
Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3% and Shanghai blue chips fell 0.7% following a 3% jump the day before.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.7% as demonstrators stormed roads next to government offices to protest against a bill that would allow people to be sent to China for trial. 
""The impact was short-lived in the past,"" noted Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong. ""This time people will look at how the U.S. reacts to this kind of news. The U.S. attitude towards Hong Kong and China are also not the same.""
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was holding up a trade deal with China and had no interest in moving ahead unless Beijing agrees to four or five ""major points"", which he did not specify. He said interest rates were ""way too high"" and the Federal Reserve had ""no clue"".
Fed policymakers will meet on June 18-19. With trade tensions rising, U.S. growth slowing and hiring in May declining, markets have priced in at least two rate cuts by the end of 2019. Futures imply around an 80% chance of a rate cut as early as July. 
That might change depending on what U.S. consumer price data show later in the session. Headline inflation is expected to slow to 1.9%, with the core rate steady at 2.1%.
OIL TOILS
Trump also alarmed currency markets by tweeting that the euro and other currencies were ""devalued"" against the dollar, putting the United States at a ""big disadvantage"".
The euro gained to $1.1336, just short of the recent three-month high of $1.1347. The dollar fell against the yen to 108.25 and stalled on a basket of currencies at 96.608.
""The President's tweets on the USD have the potential to have much more lasting impact in the coming election year,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). ""Global conditions are nicely set for what has colorfully been described as a 'currency war' or a currency race to 'the bottom'.""
The Turkish lira weakened before a central bank meeting that's expected to leave Turkey's main interest rate unchanged at 24%. In commodity markets, all the chatter of rate cuts kept gold near 14-month highs at $1,335.51 per ounce.
Oil prices dropped over 2% as concern about a global economic slowdown offset expectations that OPEC and its allies will extend their supply curbs. 
Hedge fund managers have been liquidating bullish oil positions at the fastest rate since late 2018 amid growing economic fears.

Brent crude futures fell $1.4 cents to $60.87, while U.S. crude lost $1.2 to $52.10 a barrel.

668,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",American Cars Lose Shine in China as Trade Tensions Simmer,"(Bloomberg) -- As China’s car market cools, American manufacturers are among those getting hurt the most.
The market share of U.S. brands fell to 9.6% in the first five months of 2019 from 10.9% a year earlier, the state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Wednesday. German and Japanese brands, meanwhile, gained share in the world’s largest car market.
The decline suggests U.S. marques have lost some of their competitiveness as trade tensions between the world’s two economies simmer. Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) have their work cut out for them as Japanese competitors and European giants seek to take advantage of any weakness in the U.S. companies’ brand image.
GM’s Buick and Chevrolet were among the American brands that saw sales fall this year through April, according to LMC Automotive. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Honda and Toyota were among brands who boosted sales, according to the researcher.As a whole, the industry faces a common problem: a shrinking market. After soaring for the past three decades, car sales in China have fallen for a year after the government cut excess industrial capacity, tightened environmental norms and cracked down on peer-to-peer lending. The rising popularity and availability of car-sharing and ride-hailing services is also reducing the need for individuals to buy vehicles.
As the U.S. and China continued to negotiate toward a trade deal, China in April extended a suspension on retaliatory tariffs on U.S. autos. For now, the duty on cars brought from the U.S. is 15%, same as for other auto imports, though if China ends the suspension the duty could again increase to 40%.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",ArcelorMittal boss says EU must respond further to Trump's steel tariffs,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe urgently needs to take further measures to offset the impact of import tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, the chief executive of steelmaker ArcelorMittal told a German newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday.
The European Commission is currently reviewing its ""safeguard"" measures designed to limit incoming steel and prevent a surge of imports as a result of Washington's 25% import tariffs, which have effectively closed the U.S. market.
""The EU has announced safeguard measures but they weren't effective,"" Chief Executive Lakshmi Mittal told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""Further measures are urgently necessary given the import tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed on steel imports to the United States.""
Across Europe, the steel industry is struggling with cooling demand and growing supply, in part as steel tariffs deflect supplies from the United States, steelmakers say.
""The EU's safeguard clauses have gaps - it's too easy for exporters to evade them and the impact is massive: we have a steel glut.""
Mittal said imports into the European Union had increased by 30% to 40% since 2017.
He said it would be negative if the European Commission were to relax tariff protections for the steel industry in July, adding that the review of the safeguard measures should be completed before permitted import levels are reduced. 
""From 1 July, imports to the EU can increase by 5% but we'd actually need a 20% reduction to return to 2017 levels,"" Mittal said. 
He added that quotas were also needed for individual export countries for hot-rolled coil - steel that is heat processed into metal sheets used for car bodies and household appliances.
Mittal said he was concerned about the European steel situation, saying the trade conflict between the United States and China is also hurting Europe. 
He also pointed to growing tensions in trade relations between the United States and Europe, a weakening economy in China and Brexit uncertainty. 
Mittal said there was around 500 to 550 million tonnes of overcapacity in the steel industry, amounting to a quarter of global steel production.
To tackle that overcapacity, state subsidies need to be dismantled in China and unproductive manufacturers taken off the market, Mittal said.
Asked if his son Aditya would one day succeed him as chief executive of ArcelorMittal, Mittal said: ""Aditya has done great work for our company in the last 22 years.""

""He has demonstrated his abilities and leadership qualities. I think he'd be a strong CEO.""

670,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>",Motorbike taxi firms rev up for race into West Africa,"By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS (Reuters) - Motorcycle taxi companies are expanding in West Africa with backing from investors betting that the meteoric rise of two-wheeled taxi firms in Asia can be replicated in some of the fastest growing countries in the world.
Four bike taxi firms are now battling it out on the streets of Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos and the oldest, Nigerian motorcycle taxi firm max.ng, is planning to launch in Ghana and Ivory Coast this year, as well as a fourth Nigerian city.
While informal motorcycle taxis have been around in Africa for years, the new companies are hoping to win market share by offering trained, accountable drivers and the convenience of booking rides through a mobile app.
As in Asia, the companies are also looking to turn their ride-hailing apps into one-stop mobile shops offering a host of services from e-payments to deliveries to insurance - the kind of strategy that transformed Indonesia's Go-Jek into a $10 billion company in less than a decade.
Max.ng co-founder Adetayo Bamiduro said its expansion would be funded by a recent investment round that raised $5 million-$7 million and that it was targeting an accumulated total of 2 million rides by the middle of 2020, up from 200,000 by May.
The company started out as a motorbike delivery service in 2015 in Lagos and added an app for ride-hailing in 2017, as well as credit facilities for would-be drivers to lease new bikes and pay for them over time.
""What we've done is to look at the market in Nigeria and across the region and say 'what pieces are missing?': financial infrastructure for mobility doesn't exist, ride-hailing technology for two-wheeled and three-wheeled mobility doesn't exist,"" Bamiduro told Reuters.
Africa offers huge potential for motorcycle ride-hailing firms due to low personal car ownership, rapidly expanding populations and a lack of efficient mass transport systems in fast-growing cities that are clogged with cars.
BIG OPPORTUNITY
Known as okadas in Nigeria and Ghana and boda bodas in East Africa, informal motorbike taxis are part of the African transportation fabric. In Nigeria alone, there are an estimated 8 million okada drivers, according to max.ng and rival Gokada.
Nigeria has Africa's biggest economy and largest population while Ghana and Ivory Coast are two of the world's fastest growing economies, according to the International Monetary Fund.
While the motorbike taxi firms in West Africa are small now, investors hope some can replicate the success of the Asian ride-hailing unicorns.
""Go-Jek showed what could be achieved in a market like Indonesia, then the Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) IPOs led to a global interest in mobility,"" said Aubrey Hruby, co-founder of Tofino Capital, which invests in emerging market tech firms.
""People are looking at mobility and they're looking at the next big opportunity,"" Hruby said.
Bamiduro declined to name the investors in max.ng's latest funding round, but said two had also invested in Singapore's Grab which, like Go-Jek, expanded quickly thanks to consumers using smartphones to shop, commute and make payments.
Besides max.ng, the other three companies offering motorbike taxis in Lagos are Gokada, SafeBoda, which started out in the East African, and ORide.
Gokada is funded by U.S. and Gulf investment and venture capital funds while SafeBoda counts Go-Jek and Allianz (DE:ALVG) among its backers.
When the German insurance giant's Alliance X digital division announced its investment in SafeBoda in May, it said the firm had substantial growth potential with scope for developing financial services and insurance products.
Founded in Uganda in 2015, SafeBoda launched in Kenya last year. Babajide Duroshola, who heads its Nigeria operations, told Reuters the West African country's population of about 190 million made it appealing. 
By comparison, about 120 million people live in the East African Community, which is made up of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.
ORide, the latest motorbike ride-hailing app to enter the Lagos market, is part of OPay in which Norwegian software firm Opera has an equity interest.
The company told Reuters it hopes ORide will help both its Opera web browser and OPay expand their reach into new services.
E-WALLETS
The idea of booking a motorbike taxi through a company that has trained drivers and provides passengers with a helmet appeals to some commuters in Lagos.
Engineer Dayo Omolosho said he booked a Gokada rider with his mobile phone after his car broke down in the Victoria Island business district, partly because he wanted to feel more secure.
""Everybody wants faster movement in Lagos but we're still afraid of the normal okada. You see some people already drunk, they're already high, so you can't control them,"" he said, adding that riders working for companies have been trained and are accountable through a ratings and complaints system.
Okadas were so heavily criticized for unpredictable driving and accidents that in 2012, Lagos banned motorcycles with a cylinder capacity below 200cc from using major roads or the bridges that criss-cross the city built around a lagoon.
That was a blow to the informal sector where most bikes are about 100cc. But max.ng and Gokada bought fleets of 200cc motorbikes that met legal requirements.
Gokada launched in Lagos in January 2018 and its bright green motorbikes and helmets have become a fixture on the city's streets.
Founder Fahim Saleh, who set up motorcycle taxi firm Pathao in Bangladesh in 2013, said the company was planning to launch services in the northern Nigerian city of Kano and southern oil hub Port Harcourt by the end of this year.
He told Reuters the expansion into new cities, along with repair centers and rider training schools, will be funded with some of the $5 million it raised this year. Gokada then plans to start rolling out other services.

""Within the next couple of months we will start developing a wallet that would allow you to pay for rides,"" he said. ""We want to be in all forms of transport. And also food, and services - a hairdresser delivered to your door, or a masseuse.""

A combination of positioning indicators and momentum-based analysis suggests a short-term reversal after the global bond benchmark dipped into the 2.01% to 2.08% zone before recovering, technical strategist Jason Hunter wrote in a note Tuesday. Yields may climb toward the 2.24% level, with a move even higher attracting buyers again, he said.
“Treasury technicals favor some near-term mean reversion to higher yields,” Hunter wrote. “We expect significant buying interest near the 2.28%-2.36% March to May breakout area if a backup extends that far.”
The 10-year yield fell as low as 2.05% on June 7 after a disappointing U.S. jobs report bolstered bets the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates, before subsequently recovering. It was at 2.13% Wednesday in early London trading.
Read about how bond markets are “almost taunting the Fed”
The moves suggest yields are at least temporarily basing near the 2.08% level, according to Hunter.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 04:54AM ET</span>",European shares retreat from three-week highs,"By Amy Caren Daniel and Susan Mathew
(Reuters) - European shares pulled back from three-week highs on Wednesday as this month's recovery rally ran out of steam on the back of soft Chinese factory activity data and the latest signs of friction between Washington and Beijing on trade. 
At peaks in the previous session Europe's pan-regional STOXX 600 index had gained 4.5% this month, undoing most of a sell-off in May that was its worst monthly performance in more than two years. 
That came largely courtesy of signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank will take action to stem any slowdown in global growth due to the erecting of tariff barriers between some of the world's biggest economies.
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would hold up a trade deal with China unless it agrees to four or five major points, reheating tensions between the two sides.
The STOXX 600 fell 0.44% by 0816 GMT, tracking Asian markets lower, with the tariff-sensitive technology sector down 0.76%.
""The markets ... had a very strong start to the month, there is no real reason for them to keep going at the moment,"" said Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex in London, pointing to U.S. inflation numbers later in the day as the next possible driver.
Also pressuring the tech sector was an almost 1% drop for Dassault Systemes' after the French technology company agreed to buy U.S. software firm Medidata Solutions in a deal worth $5.8 billion.
Chipmakers, which get a huge portion of their revenue from China, fell, with AMS AG and STMicroelectronics declining about 0.5%.
With under three weeks to go before proposed talks between U.S. and China, expectations for progress toward ending the trade war are low and sources say there has been little preparation for a meeting even as the health of the world economy is at stake.
Trump also said that interest rates were ""way too high"", ahead of a reading on U.S. inflation that could shift the odds towards a cut in rates as soon as July.
Banking stocks, which tend to suffer when expectations for interest rates fall, lost 0.81%, taking the biggest hit among the major European sectors.
Italy's FTSE MIB fell 0.81% and its banking index dropped 1.28% as the European Union moved closer to taking disciplinary action over the country's growing debt.
Axel Springer jumped 12.3% after funds controlled by U.S. private equity investor KKR offered to buy out minority shareholders of the German publisher for 63 euros a share, a 40% premium to its market price.

 British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) fell 3% after four straight sessions of gains and weighed on the STOXX 600, despite forecasting sales of vaping and e-cigarette products would accelerate in the second half of the year.

The faux meat-maker was downgraded to market perform from outperform at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Inc., losing its last bullish analyst rating after a stratospheric gain of just over 400% since the company listed last month. Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) shares were down 2.9% at 4:14 a.m. in New York trading before U.S exchanges open.
“The downgrade is driven by valuation considerations as the stock has traded in a highly volatile manner since its IPO likely due to its limited public float,” analyst Alexia Howard wrote in a note. While Beyond Meat is one of the frontrunners in the still-growing plant-based meat category, there is limited upside left in the shares, she said.
Howard’s downgrade follows JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Ken Goldman cutting his rating on Tuesday, which sent shares tumbling 25%. He had been the final bullish analyst among the underwriters of Beyond Meat’s IPO. Goldman also said his downgrade was purely on valuation grounds.
The shares closed at $126.04 on Tuesday compared with the $25 they were sold at in May’s IPO. They had risen 572% through to the end of trading on Monday following a two-day frenzy driven by expectation-busting earnings which now appears to have prompted a wave of analyst caution. Beyond Meat now has nine analyst ratings overall, all holds, and an average price target of $96.

Investing.com -- The world’s largest fashion retailer is back at the top of its game.
 Inditex  (MC:ITX), the Spanish-based owner of Zara, Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear, said Wednesday it will raise its dividend pay-out after a strong quarter in which it increased sales in all of its brands and all of its geographies.
The company said it’ll propose paying out 60% of net profits in future, up from 50%. It’s also going to propose a special bonus dividend of 1 euro a share for the fiscal years 2018-2020.
The move reflects a degree of confidence in the balance sheet that seemed unlikely a couple of quarters ago, when the company was struggling with its multi-channel strategy and with the effects of a freak summer in Europe that had customers putting off purchases of autumn and winter gear.
However, the group looks in much better shape today. Net profit was up 10% on the year to €734 million in the three months to April, while sales were up 5.9%. The company upheld its forecast of 6% comparable sales growth in the fiscal year. More than anything, that’s due to the smooth roll-out of online stores worldwide, which has protected it from the worst of the woes affecting bricks-and-mortar chains. The company launched Zara in Brazil in March, a swathe of further openings across the Middle East and North Africa and Indonesia followed in May.
The shares were up 0.5% on the news and are now up 13.5% in 2019. That’s on a day when Europe’s bourses were shaken by another bout of risk aversion against the backdrop of the U.S.’s various trade-related disputes. Spain’s IBEX 35 was down 0.3%, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.8 points, or 0.5% at 379.04 by 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT). The U.K. FTSE was down 0.3% and Germany's Dax down 0.6%.
Elsewhere, one of Inditex’s fast-fashion smaller rivals, U.K.-listed boohoo.com (LON:BOOH), also posted another strong set of quarterly results, with revenue up 39% and its gross margin stable at 55.0%. The company didn’t raise its conservative full-year guidance of 25%-30% sales growth however. The shares also came after pressure after news of a lawsuit against founder Mahmud Kamani from a web designer who claims he was promised a 10% stake in the company in return for designing its all-important website. Kamani has dismissed the claims as “without merit”."

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Dassault Systemes moved to build up its life sciences presence with a $5.8 billion cash deal to buy Medidata Solutions, a U.S. firm focused on clinical trials.
Dassault Systemes has been doing deals to diversify its technology and software businesses further and its agreed acquisition of Medidata, its largest, follows its purchases of companies including Trace Software and Argosim.
Medidata has a market capitalization of around $5.9 billion, Refinitiv Eikon data shows, while Dassault has a stock market value of around 36 billion euros ($41 billion).
Although the $92.25 per share offered marked a slight discount to Medidata's closing price of $94.75 on June 11, analysts said that it was at a premium of 6.6% to Medidata's 50-day average price of $86.50 over the last 50 days.
Medidata's shares had also risen 5.5% to around $100 in after-hours trading on Tuesday, on growing speculation of a takeover by Dassault Systemes.
The French company added the Medidata takeover, which it said has a $5.8 billion enterprise value, would strengthen its position in life sciences and boost earnings from 2020 onwards.
""Multidiscipline scientific innovation and industrial performance call for a platform approach connecting the dots between people, ideas and data,"" said Bernard Charlès, Vice Chairman and CEO of Dassault Systèmes.
Deloitte this year forecast strong growth in the life sciences industry, saying it would benefit from a general rise in spending on healthcare, which in turn would necessitate more spending on technology. (https:// France's Dassault family has stakes in both Dassault Systèmes and the aerospace-focused Dassault Aviation company, but the two are separate entities. Dassault Systeme's finance director, Pascal Daloz, said the French company had also signed a debt financing deal worth around 4 billion euros to fund its purchase of Medidata. Invest Securities said the size of the deal had taken some investors by surprise, but Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Gregoire Laverne said it was seen as a positive step. ""Dassault Systemes nevertheless has a big enough balance sheet to able to finance part of the acquisition,"" said Laverne, whose firms owns Dassault shares. 
Medidata had 2018 revenue of $636 million, and Dassault Systemes expects to close the deal in the fourth quarter.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",Chinese auto sales post worst-ever monthly decline as trade war intensifies,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China reported the worst-ever monthly sales drop in the world's largest vehicle market on Wednesday, exacerbating concerns over the country's economic slowdown and growing impact of an ongoing trade war with the United States.
Sales tumbled 16.4% in May from the same month a year prior, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said. That marked the 11th consecutive month of decline and followed falls of 14.6% in April and 5.2% in March.
Xu Haidong, CAAM's assistant secretary general, said one key reason for the drop was provinces implementing ""China VI"" vehicle emission standards earlier than the central government's 2020 deadline, stoking uncertainty among manufacturers.
(GRAPHIC: China car sales fall further - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WGKWh5) 
""We gave the manufacturers too little time to prepare,"" he said, adding that the industry's supply chain was finding it difficult to keep up with market changes.
Automotive sales in China contracted for the first time last year since the 1990s as a slowing economy and tit-for-tat import tariffs between Beijing and Washington affected consumer sentiment.
Industry executives have said they believe the market will return to growth in the second half of this year due to government support.
On Wednesday, Xu said May demand also suffered from a decline in purchasing power in the low-to-middle income groups as well as expectations of government stimulus to encourage purchases.
Earlier in June, the government announced measures to revive sales, including stopping local authorities from imposing new restrictions on purchases and eliminating restrictions on NEVs.
Contrary to market expectations, the measures did not include the relaxation of controls over the issuance of licenses for petrol-powered cars in major cities.
Xu also noted that the measures did not include subsidies, but said it was unrealistic to continue expecting such support.
""This is a perfectly competitive industry and doesn't need the government to intervene day in and out,"" said Shi Jianhua, a senior CAAM official.
SHARP SLOWDOWN
Growth in the new energy vehicle segment, usually a bright spot for the sector, also slowed sharply in May. Sales grew just 1.8% versus 18.1% in April. For all of last year, NEV sales jumped almost 62% even though the broader market shrank.
NEVs include petrol-electric hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. China, blighted by air pollution, has been a keen supporter of NEVs, requiring automakers to meet sales quotas.
Xu said NEV growth had been dragged down by a fall in sales of commercial vehicles like buses, and that sharp discounting on traditional petrol-powered cars - prompted by increasingly stringent emission standards - had also lured buyers away from NEVs. 

In May, most automakers reported a decline in China sales, except Japan's Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd which logged double-digit growth.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund may have to sell its $1 billion stake in commodities giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), among other companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenue from coal, to meet proposed tighter ethical investing rules.
Under the center-right government's plan, expected to be adopted by Norway's parliament on Wednesday, the world's largest fund would no longer invest in companies that mine more than 20 million tonnes of coal annually or generate more than 10 gigawatts (GW) of power with coal.
Environmental campaigners Greenpeace and Urgenwald said the new guidelines mean the fund would have to divest its stakes in Glencore, in which the fund has a stake of 2.03%, worth $1 billion at the end of 2018, according to fund data.
The fund would also have to sell its 2.16% holding in miner  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), worth $620 million, they added, citing their own analysis.
The fund, Glencore and Anglo American all declined to comment.
""What this does do ... is give a very clear signal to both governments and companies that the time for financing fossil fuels is coming to an end, for the benefit of both people and planet,"" said Martin Norman, Sustainable Finance Campaigner at Greenpeace in Norway. 
Other divestments would include the fund's 1.39% stake in Germany's RWE worth $186 million, its 2.22% holding in Australia's South32 worth $266 million) and the 1.03% it owns of Germany's Uniper among others, the green campaigners said.
The proposed rules on investing in coal, part of a broader shift to renewable energy, led the fund to sell its stakes in 83 mostly coal-producing companies, such as Peabody Energy and Coal India, as well as power producers ranging from Portland  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) to Korea Electric Power.
The first major fund to do so, the decision in 2015 prompted other long-term investors to set similar guidelines, including German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) later that year.
Parliament is expected to back the plan as the ruling center-right coalition has a majority in the assembly.
Uniper said its generation capacity globally was less than one third coal-based, adding that it aims to use more low-carbon fuels and had already cut its carbon dioxide emissions by some 20% since 2016.
""We see ourselves as partners in the energy transition and want to accompany it constructively,"" a Uniper spokeswoman said.
RWE said its transformation plan includes not building any new coal-fired power plants, and it added that it will invest up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.70 billion) annually in new renewable energy projects once its transaction with EON is completed.
""By the end of 2019, more than 60% of RWE's plants will be able to supply electricity with little or no CO2 emissions,"" a spokeswoman said.

The business makes tobacco heating product glo and Vype e-cigarettes as well as snuff and nicotine pouches.
Tobacco firms around the world have been investing heavily in e-cigarettes and vaping products as demand for traditional cigarettes wanes.
BAT, which also reaffirmed its full-year targets, said first-half revenue growth for the ""New Category"" business was approaching its annual target range.

The company said it expects revenue growth for the year at the business to be around the middle of the 30% to 50% range on a constant currency basis.

(Reuters) - Two leading proxy advisory firms have urged Nissan shareholders to vote against reappointing its chief executive as a director, heaping more pressure on Hiroto Saikawa as he struggles to find accord with alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA).
The move marks a rare public rebuke by international proxy firms against the leader of a top-tier Japanese firm, and comes just as the scandal-hit automaker struggles to move on from the legacy of Carlos Ghosn, its ousted chairman who stands accused of financial misconduct.
It also underscores the precarious position of Saikawa, who was groomed for leadership by Ghosn but appears unable to mend a relationship with Renault that one source said appeared to be in jeopardy.
Institutional Shareholder Services recommended shareholders vote against Saikawa as director at Nissan's annual general meeting this month, to ensure a ""clean break"" from the Carlos Ghosn era. Ghosn, first arrested in November, is awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges. He denies all the charges against him.
""When the company needs to break from the past and build a strong board with fresh members, the reelection of Hiroto Saikawa, who has been on the board for 14 years and worked closely with Carlos Ghosn, does not appear appropriate,"" Institutional Shareholder Services said in a research note.
The firm also advised shareholders to vote against the nomination of Moto Nagai to Nissan's board, saying the former executive of Mizuho Financial Group served as an independent auditor at Nissan during Ghosn's tenure, and ""shares responsibility"" for failing to exercise oversight of Ghosn's alleged wrongdoing.
Another proxy adviser, Glass Lewis, similarly told shareholders not to vote for Saikawa, who needs the support of at least half of voting shareholders at the June 25 meeting to be reappointed. 
""We cannot confidently support the nomination of Mr. Saikawa who - as the representative director and president of the Company - should have taken greater steps in performing its oversight responsibilities in the misconduct of the board members,"" it said in a report to clients.
Nissan declined to comment on the recommendations, which were both published on Friday.
ALLIANCE CRISIS
A recent push by Renault to block a governance overhaul at Nissan has put the Franco-Japanese automaking alliance in jeopardy, a person familiar with Nissan's thinking told Reuters.
The two-decade-old partnership was plunged into fresh crisis this week after Renault signaled it would block its partner from adopting planned governance reforms unless the French automaker received more say in the new system. Nissan has publicly called that demand ""most regrettable"".
""I have to say that they are endangering the alliance. They have to be very careful not to antagonize Japanese people, shareholders,"" the person said, referring to Renault.
""Renault has been saying the alliance is important and irreversible but what they are trying to do is to break the alliance,"" the person said, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
By abstaining from the governance vote, Renault would effectively block the new governance system - which includes three committees - as adoption requires two-thirds approval.
The rift lays bare the deep strain between the two automakers, whose alliance has been under pressure since Ghosn's arrest. What's at stake now may be even bigger than their vast alliance, which includes Mitsubishi Motors.
Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are looking for ways to resuscitate a collapsed merger plan and secure Nissan's approval for that deal, Reuters reported this week. Nissan is, therefore, poised to urge Renault to significantly cut its 43.4% stake in Nissan, Reuters has reported. 

Nissan recently said it would abstain from voting on the FCA-Renault merger, although both FCA and Renault later blamed the failure of that deal squarely on the French government.

In a U.S. court filing late on Tuesday, the South Korean firm opposed Qualcomm's efforts to put a sweeping U.S. antitrust decision against it on hold, arguing setting the ruling aside could force it into signing another unfair deal.
""If Qualcomm does not participate in negotiations with LGE in accordance with the Court’s Order, LGE will have no option but to conclude license and chipset supply agreements once again on Qualcomm's terms,"" LG's filing in the federal court in San Jose, California said.
The lack of clarity over a new license deal raises concerns over the rollout of LG's newly launched 5G smartphones, crucial for the loss-making handset maker to boost flagging smartphone sales and catch up with Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd.
""If LG Electronics fails to renew its contract with Qualcomm, it is very likely that it will not be able to make any phones since LG does not manufacture chips by itself,"" BNK Securities analyst Park Sung-soon said.
""It would do catastrophic damage to its mobile business.""
An LG spokeswoman said she could not elaborate on the potential impact as negotiations with Qualcomm were in progress. 
The firm launched its first 5G smartphone powered by Qualcomm in the United States in May after debuting it in South Korea in the same month. 
LG is the third-largest smartphone vendor in the U.S. market with an 11 percent market share as of the first quarter of this year, and trails Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, according to market researcher Counterpoint.
The firm has been renegotiating a licensing deal with Qualcomm after terminating the existing agreement in 2018 to seek better terms with the chipmaker. But the two companies have failed to reach a new deal and their interim license agreement will end this month. 
Qualcomm in late May asked a U.S. federal judge not to enforce her antitrust decision while it pursued an appeal. The company said the judge's ruling would entail ""radically restructuring its business relationship"" in ways that would be impossible to reverse if it won an appeal. 
LG said Qualcomm would be able to extend its chipset monopoly status into the 5G market if the court decided to put the antitrust ruling on hold. 

""Staying the Court's Order as Qualcomm requests will cause LG Electronics irreparable harm in its negotiations with Qualcomm and that may ultimately impact the entire 5G market,"" LG said in the filing.

""A small fraction of Amazon employees are affected by this decision, and many of those affected have already found new roles at Amazon,"" the company said in a statement. ""Employees will be offered personalized support to find a new role within, or outside of, the company.""
Amazon Restaurants was launched in 2015 in Seattle and was designed to give Prime members a way to order meals, apart from products and groceries, through the online retailer. The service was expanded to more than 20 U.S. cities, and then to London where the program ended in November.
The unit was led at one point by the executive also in charge of Amazon's ticketing business, but was overseen later by an executive running its two-hour grocery delivery service, Prime Now, according to their LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles.

MGA Entertainment made the proposal in a letter to Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz dated May 21, according to emails that Larian shared with Reuters.
In response, Bob Normile, Mattel's chief legal officer, wrote to Larian on June 7 that the company's board unanimously concluded that the proposal was ""not in the best interests of Mattel and its shareholders."" 
MGA's renewed offer was on condition that Larian would become Mattel's chairman and CEO and all of Mattel's board members resign ""without any further compensation"".
While Larian did not propose a specific price for the bid, he told Los Angeles Times that it would ""absolutely"" be at a premium to Mattel's current market price. Mattel had a market value of $3.52 billion as of Tuesday's close.
Larian first made overtures to Mattel in April of last year, the emails showed. 
Mattel has been struggling to boost its sales, which have fallen for the past three years, and the Barbie maker's stock has lost 37% of its value in the past 12 months.
Larian said that Mattel's problems have worsened since his original offer.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>",Dash for growth at company founded by Indian yoga guru leads to stumbles,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Rajendra Jadhav
HARIDWAR, India (Reuters) - Three years ago, Indian yoga guru and entrepreneur Baba Ramdev was riding high.
The consumer goods empire he co-founded had tapped into a wave of Hindu nationalism after the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Customers were snapping up Patanjali Ayurved's affordable, Indian-made products such as coconut oil and ayurvedic remedies, in a mounting threat to foreign companies that had bet big on India.
""Turnover figures will force multinational companies to go for kapalbhati,"" saffron-robed Ramdev declared in 2017, in reference to a yoga breathing exercise, vowing sales would more than double to 200 billion rupees ($2.84 billion) in the year to March 2018.
But instead Patanjali's sales plunged 10% to 81 billion rupees, according to its annual financial report. 
And in the last fiscal year, it likely deteriorated further, say company sources and analysts. Provisional data indicated sales of just 47 billion rupees in the nine months to Dec. 31, CARE Ratings said in April, based on information from Patanjali. 
(Graphic: Patanjali yearly sales link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WZ0MiW)
According to interviews with current and former employees, suppliers, distributors, store managers, and consumers, Patanjali's ambitions have been hobbled by missteps.
In particular, they highlight inconsistent quality as Patanjali expanded very quickly.
The company says its rapid expansion did bring some teething problems, but that they had been overcome.
Patanjali also suffered, like many others, from Modi's 2016 ban on high-denomination banknotes and 2017 introduction of a new goods and services tax. The moves disrupted economic activity.
""PROBLEMS WERE EXPECTED""
Patanjali says it has 3,500 distributors that supply some 47,000 retail counters across India. Patanjali shops, mostly popular with rural Indians rising into the middle class, sell snacks like mango candy or ayurvedic remedies promising to cure joint pain. 
Ramdev, a household name whose TV yoga shows are watched by millions, has been the public face of Patanjali since it was set up in 2006 and remains its brand ambassador - his bearded face smiles down from ubiquitous billboards and hoardings in Indian villages. 
But the company is owned by his business partner Acharya Balkrishna, who met Ramdev at a Sanskrit school three decades ago and holds 98.55% of Patanjali's shares, according to a 2018 company filing. 
The 46-year-old Balkrishna, whose net worth Forbes puts at $4.9 billion, brushed aside concerns about the company's health during an April interview at one of Patanjali's yoga centers near Haridwar, an ancient pilgrimage site in northern India. 
""We suddenly expanded, we started three-four new units, and so problems were expected. We have solved that network problem,"" said Balkrishna, referring to supply chain issues that affected deliveries. The problems were concentrated in ""set-up and networking"", he said, without elaborating. 
One ex-employee said issues included not having long-term deals with transporters, which complicated planning and increased costs. Patanjali executives also lacked the software needed to effectively track sales, another former worker said. 
Balkrishna declined to give sales estimates for the current fiscal year or last but said future results would be ""better"". 
Reuters sent follow-up questions to Patanjali's public relations officer K.K. Mishra, who said the queries had been forwarded to a special committee. Calls and messages to Balkrishna's assistant about the queries went unanswered. 
THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS
As Patanjali has ramped up its offering to more than 2,500 goods, it has prioritized scale over quality and farmed out production to third parties, which has dented quality, two former office executives and a supplier said.
In 2017, Nepal's drug watchdog found that six Patanjali medical products had microorganism content above a maximum ceiling set by the regulator. Santosh K.C., an official at Nepal's Department of Drug Administration, said there were no problems with other Patanjali products. 
Balkrishna denies there have been quality issues, noting that India's national laboratories accreditation board has approved Patanjali's central lab. 
""Quality is not a problem,"" Balkrishna said. 
Patanjali products marketed as ayurvedic come under the regulatory purview of the Ministry of Ayush, created in 2014 to promote alternative therapies including Ayurveda, an ancient Hindu healing method. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Patanjali's product quality.
India's food regulator FSSAI, which oversees Patanjali's processed foods, declined to disclose data on quality tests, saying it only did so in the event of safety concerns.
Balkrishna said only ""a few products"", including wheat, pulses and rice, were sourced externally. 
Reuters reviewed 81 Patanjali products in a Mumbai Patanjali store and found that 27 of them had labels that listed the goods as partially or wholly manufactured by other Indian producers. 
These suppliers either declined to comment or did not respond to questions. 
The construction of Patanjali's own factories has been dogged by delays, which the company attributes to starting multiple projects simultaneously. 
A food plant in Maharashtra due by April 2017 and an ayurvedic and herbal products factory outside Delhi expected by 2016 are now slated for 2020, according to Patanjali.
UNPAID SUPPLIERS, DWINDLING ADS
Some unpaid suppliers are turning their backs on the company, according to interviews with three suppliers as well as letters, reviewed by Reuters, sent to the company by those owed money. 
A chemical supplier said Patanjali started delaying payments by a month or two in 2017. By 2018, delays had grown to almost six months. 
Two managers at stores of leading Indian retailers and two mom and pop stores owners, all in Mumbai, said they were only keeping a handful of Patanjali products in stock due to faltering demand.
Faced with the threat from Patanjali, competitors such as Hindustan  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and Colgate Palmolive India Ltd have launched ayurvedic products themselves, adding to competition.
Meanwhile, Patanjali has slashed ad spending. In 2016, it was third biggest Indian television advertiser, but by last year it did not make the top 10, according to Broadcast Audience Research Council India data. 
Patanjali's main advertising agency, Mumbai-based Vermmillion, declined to comment.
Abneesh Roy, a senior retail analyst at broker Edelweiss, said Patanjali would likely lose market share as a result. 
(Graphic: Patanjali Ad Insertions link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WVLADb)
FRAUGHT BROMANCE 
Ramdev passionately backed Modi in the 2014 election. He tapped into his following as a TV celebrity, mobilizing voters and synchronizing messaging with Modi's Hindi nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Patanjali has benefited from more than an estimated $46 million in discounts for land acquisitions in BJP-controled states, Reuters revealed in May 2017.
More recently, however, Ramdev seemed to have cooled on Modi, a fellow yoga aficionado.
In its 2017-2018 financial statement Patanjali complained that demonetization ""affected consumers' spending habits,"" while the sales tax hit ""costing and pricings of inputs and products"". 
Ramdev also told journalists earlier this year he had withdrawn himself politically. But he popped up on the campaign trail to support the BJP in the April-May election, saying Modi was ""the pride of mother India"".
The mixed message has ruffled some in the BJP's powerful fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). ""Ramdev,"" one senior RSS official said, ""makes different kinds of statements that makes it difficult to put trust in him.""
Representatives for Modi, who cruised to re-election, did not respond to requests for comment. 
APP FLOP 
Devotees and detractors alike say Patanjali's management style is a far cry from standard corporate culture.
Employees at Patanjali's main food plant in Haridwar gather to chant ""om"" every morning. Senior managers must dress in white. Failure to follow wardrobe rules and late arrivals result in pay deductions, current and former employees said.
Patanjali, which said it employs around 25,000 people, last year advertised for salesmen across India. But one ex-employee said Patanjali had also chopped several hundred posts since mid-2017. The company did not respond to queries about staffing. 
Patanjali has also announced plans to sell SIM cards, solar panels, bottled water, phones and jeans.
Balkrishna said the diversification was working. 
""Solar is good. Our apparel division is going... We have big plans for bio-organic products,"" he said. 
In 2017, computer scientist Aditi Kamal pitched Ramdev the idea of an Indian-made messaging app.
""When I said 'WhatsApp rival and all,' he said: 'This is great, why didn't we think of this before?'"" recounted Kamal.
Kamal said she was hired, and six months later was overseeing 100 employees.
But the 2018 launch of the app, called Kimbho, was marred by privacy flaws and Patanjali halted the venture.

""We have not dropped the project completely, but we have stopped,"" said Balkrishna.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 08:57PM ET</span>","Tesla is serious about a possible record quarter, not so serious about a submarine car","By Vibhuti Sharma and Rama Venkat Raman
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has ""a decent shot at a record quarter on every level"", Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, soothing concerns about weak demand for the electric car maker's sedans.
Tesla's stock rose 3.6% to $225 in extended trading, and Musk also said the company was on track to hit its volume production goal by the end of this year.
Musk was treated as a star by investors at the annual meeting, receiving applause as he laid out plans for global expansion and going so far as to tell an inquiring investor that Tesla engineers ""actually have a design for a submarine car"". He said making one would be a distraction and have a small market.
Analysts have questioned whether there is global demand for the hundreds of thousands of Model 3 sedans and other vehicles Tesla aims to produce, after deliveries fell 31% in the first quarter. Rivals are stepping up efforts and Tesla continues to invest heavily in expansion.
Musk's positive comments on Tuesday echoed his forecast last month that the company was on track to hit record deliveries in the second quarter. 
Tesla previously said it plans to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 vehicles to customers in the second quarter versus 63,000 vehicles in the first, and is aiming to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
But ramping production strains finances, and Tesla is increasing output at its U.S. factory, launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models.
""It's hard to be profitable with a high growth rate,"" Musk said, expressing confidence that Tesla would be ""cash flow positive"" despite those challenges.
Tesla lost $702 million in the first quarter and has said profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year.
Musk's plans include unveiling an electric pickup truck this summer and getting into semi truck production toward the end of next year. He said he hoped to have an investor day on batteries by the end of the year and emphasized that battery production was the key to vehicle production. 
""Having to not pay tariffs and have the really long delivery chain and high transport costs will make the cars a lot more affordable to people in Europe and China,"" Musk said.
Tesla was likely to settle on a location for a European factory by the end of the year and expects to start selling in India by next year.
Musk also teased that Tesla could get into mining of metals crucial for battery production to further lower costs.
""We'll do whatever we have to, to ensure that we can scale at the fastest rate possible,"" he said.
Musk has faced criticism about his outspoken nature, including Twitter use that led to a settlement with U.S. regulators, but shareholders rejected corporate governance proposals calling for reducing the terms of directors and eliminating some supermajority voting requirements.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman's activist hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP is opposing United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Corp's planned $120 billion aerospace merger with defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The move makes Ackman the first major Wall Street figure to come out against the deal. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed concerns over the merger's impact on competition, though he also said he hoped the deal would happen.
Ackman wrote an email to United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes early on Sunday morning to express his concerns about the proposed deal after reading press reports about it, the source said. 
The fund manager, whose firm owns roughly 0.67% of United Technologies, had previously supported the company in its plans to split into three businesses - aerospace, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners. 
""We are extremely concerned that such a transaction will significantly lower the business quality of pro-forma United Technologies' aerospace business, and, to make matters worse, will be accomplished through the highly dilutive issuance of large amounts of United Technologies stock,"" Ackman's email, seen by Reuters, said.
A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment. Raytheon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
""We are confident that our shareholders will see the merits of this transaction and the value it brings to them and the company. We will be working diligently in the days and weeks ahead to make sure that the details of the transaction are presented to and fully understood by all shareholders,"" United Technologies said in a statement. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported on Pershing Square's opposition to the deal.
Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC also has a stake in United Technologies. Like Pershing Square, it supported the company's break-up, but its views on the Raytheon deal are not known. A Third Point spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
The merger would reshape the competitive landscape by forming a conglomerate which spans commercial aviation and defense procurement. United Technologies provides primarily commercial plane makers with electronics, communications and other equipment, whereas Raytheon mainly supplies the U.S. government with military aircraft and missile equipment.
United Technologies and Raytheon shares have dropped 7% and 4.5% respectively since their deal was announced, as investors expressed disappointment with the low value of synergies the companies announced. Investors also fret that major clients of the companies such as the Pentagon would seek to review their supply chains.
Shareholders of United Technologies and Raytheon would have to approve the deal in separate votes.
Activist hedge funds are increasingly targeting announced deals and are seeking to upend them, often by betting that the acquirer's stock would go up were it to walk away from the purchase.
Earlier this year, activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP sought to muster opposition against Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) Co's $74 billion acquisition of biotech  Celgene Corp  (NASDAQ:CELG), but abandoned the effort after two leading proxy advisory firms backed the deal.
United Technologies' deal with Raytheon also faces regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Defense Department and big customers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) will have a lot of clout in the antitrust review, and may worry about over-reliance on one company for a big suite of products.
ACKMAN'S CONCERNS
Ackman's email said that if the company moves forward with the deal, he expects the substantial majority of other shareholders to also line up against it.
The deal with Raytheon would be structured as an all-stock merger of equals because United Technologies, which currently has a market capitalization of $106 billion, would separately spin off Carrier and Otis. United Technologies bulked up in aerospace last year with its $23 billion acquisition of avionics maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL). 
""We cannot comprehend why United Technologies would attempt to effectuate a merger with Raytheon now, when United Technologies' shares are likely to be materially higher after the business separation is effectuated early next year,"" Ackman's email said.

This year, Ackman's firm has been one of the hedge fund industry's best performers delivering gains of nearly 40% in the first four months of the year. This follows a rough patch where he faced big losses on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (NYSE:BHC) and  Herbalife  (NYSE:HLF) Nutrition Ltd and lost a proxy fight with Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP). He has vowed to make back the money that he lost by reshaping his organization.

The reality was a bit different. The open was strong, stocks shot seriously higher just as they had in the prior five days, and then the rally stalled.
The result was the S&P 500 ending flat, off 0.03%. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.05% (although just 12 of the 30 stocks in the average were lower), and the Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.01% -- less than a point.
There wasn't a lot of news to push markets around. President Donald Trump didn't complain much about the Federal Reserve, although the 10-year Treasury yield  closed down slightly at 2.14%. Trade tensions seemed mostly put away for the day. There's a big G20 meeting coming at the end of June to look forward to.
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) hit 52-week highs. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also hit a 52-week high of $134.24, but then fell back. Still, the Nasdaq 100 index was up 0.2% on the day.
Oil prices were flat. WTI futures were up 1 cent to $53.27 a barrel. Brent futures, the global benchmark, were flat at $62.29 a barrel.
Clearly profit-taking was at work -- for good reason. The S&P 500 had risen 5.3% since June 3 through Monday. The Dow had jumped 5% between May 31 and Monday. The Nasdaq's gain between June 3 and Monday was 6.7%.
And maybe it was just the day for a pause.
There was a little drama.

700,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 04:56PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - There was a time when all that U.S. Treasury Secretaries were permitted to say about the U.S. dollar was that a strong dollar was in best interests of the country. There was a fear that anything else would roil the markets. That looks overly cautious given today the president has pretty much called for a weaker U.S. dollar.
President Donald Trump tweeted that the euro and “other currencies” are devalued, putting the U.S. at a disadvantage and took another swipe at high U.S. rates and “ridiculous” quantitative tightening.



The best bet for excitement tomorrow looks to be the oil market. Crude traded flat today, with traders wary about what the EIA will say in its latest inventory report.
Crude inventories have been stunning the market of late, rising sharply at a time when drawdowns are expected as summer driving boosts gasoline demand. And with U.S. production at record highs the glut has kept prices on the back foot.
Here are the three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. More Jawboning on US-China Trade
U.S. markets are likely to continue to ebb and flow to the tune of ongoing comments on trade from both Washington and Beijing as the G20 meeting edges closer.
Both nations upped the ante on Tuesday, with China's foreign ministry warning that it would respond firmly if the U.S. insisted on escalating its standoff with China.
U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to suggest the U.S. has the edge in the ongoing trade war.
""It’s me right now that’s holding up the deal,” Trump said. “And we’re going to either do a great deal with China or we’re not going to do a deal at all.""
2. Consumer Inflation to Cement July Rate-Cut Expectations?
Market participants look ahead to the release of consumer inflation data due Wednesday 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) for further signs to support the current narrative that subdued price pressures will force the Federal Reserve to cut rates as soon as July.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, more than 84% of traders expect the Fed to cut rates next month.
Economists forecast overall inflation, measured by the consumer price index (CPI), in May slowed to 0.1% from 0.3% the prior month, while the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy price, is seen rising to 0.2% from 0.1% a month earlier. That would bring year-over-year CPI growth to 1.9% and core CPI growth up 2.1%.
3. Crude Inventories on Tap
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) petroleum report is due Wednesday, with many wary of another unexpected build in crude stockpiles.
Crude oil futures climbed 1 cent to settle at $53.27 a barrel.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data - while not perfectly correlated with the EIA's report - showing that crude stockpiles rose by 4.852 million barrels last week.
The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 0.481 million barrels for the week ended June 7.
U.S. weekly production, which hit a record 12.4 million barrels a day, will likely also attract attention after the EIA cut its forecast on domestic output. The EIA forecasts 2019 U.S. crude production of 12.32 million barrels a day, down 1% from the May forecast, and cut its 2020 outlook by 0.9% to 13.26 million barrels a day."
701,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Wall Street treads water after recent rally,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended near flat and the Dow snapped a six-day winning streak on Tuesday, as investors paused following a run of gains and fresh worries emerged over the U.S. trade war with China.
President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was holding up a trade deal with China and had no interest in moving ahead, unless Beijing agrees to four or five ""major points"" which he did not specify.
Separately, Trump said he would impose more tariffs on Chinese imports if there was no progress in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit later this month. 
Stocks were mostly higher in early trading amid lingering optimism over Trump's decision late on Friday to hold off import tariffs on Mexico.
""Trade sentiment is driving everything,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""What we're seeing today is the more pessimistic view on what might happen by the end of the month. Most selling in the month of May could be put down to China and Mexico.""
Investors also may be reluctant to push stocks higher without a fresh catalyst for support, some strategists said.
Data showed U.S. producer prices increased solidly for a second straight month in May, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters, pointing to a steady pickup in underlying inflation pressures. 
Industrials and utilities indexes led the way lower Tuesday, with the S&P 500 industrial index falling 0.9%, weighed down by losses in United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.17 points, or 0.05%, to 26,048.51, the S&P 500 lost 1.01 points, or 0.03%, to 2,885.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.60 points, or 0.01%, to 7,822.57.
Recent optimism over trade tensions and the prospect of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve had helped stocks rally in recent sessions. The benchmark S&P 500 is just 2% away from its early May all-time high.
The market is betting the Fed will cut interest rates in July and cut two more times this year as Trump's hard bargaining on trade with Beijing and others could push the economy back into recession.
United Technologies fell 4% and Raytheon shed 5.1%, a day after Trump gave mixed signals on whether he believed the $121 billion merger between the companies should go forward. On Monday, Raytheon edged higher while United Technologies lost 3.1%. 
The S&P utilities index on Tuesday was down 0.7%.
 Symantec Corp  (NASDAQ:SYMC) fell after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the antivirus software maker's stock, citing increased competition.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 53 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 88 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.76 billion shares, compared to about 6.92 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ten states led by New York and California filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to stop T-Mobile US Inc's $26 billion purchase of Sprint Corp, warning that consumer prices will jump due to reduced competition.
The complaint comes as the U.S. Justice Department is close to making a final decision on the merger, which would reduce the number of nationwide wireless carriers to three from four.
The all-Democratic attorneys general from the 10 states, including Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Virginia and Wisconsin, say the reduced competition would cost Sprint and T-Mobile subscribers more than $4.5 billion annually, according to the complaint.
""When it comes to corporate power, bigger is not always better,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at a news conference. 
""To many upstate New Yorkers, (the carriers) still struggle with 3G,"" she said, adding that there is nothing in the merger that will guarantee more towers and coverage for certain communities.
James said the lawsuit was not filed to influence the Justice Department's decision on the merger, adding that negotiations were ongoing among the states, the Justice Department and the carriers.
James also said her office did not notify Justice before the states filed the lawsuit, adding it was not required for them to do so. State attorneys general often participate in lawsuits aimed at stopping mergers but rarely go it alone.
The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York.
""This is the third time T-Mobile has tried to merge and shrink the market to three players,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.
""Every time they’ve tried they’ve been blocked or forced to walk away because of opposition from the government… Opposition that’s based on the same concerns laid out in our lawsuit today.""
T-Mobile, whose parent company is Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), and Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank Group Ltd, did not comment. A spokeswoman for Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai declined to comment. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Shares of Sprint dropped 6.2% to $6.56 while T-Mobile was down 1.4% at $75.28.
WAITING ON DOJ
The T-Mobile/Sprint deal has won the backing of a majority of the FCC. The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division staff has recommended the agency block the deal, but no final decision has been made.
Calling the proposed merger ""anti-competitive, anti-worker and anti-consumer,"" Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said the Justice Department ""must follow the leadership of State AGs"" who are fighting back for consumers.
""Saying no to this deal should be easy,"" Blumenthal said in a tweet.
While AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) dominate the overall U.S. wireless market, T-Mobile is the most popular among customers who make less than $75,000 per year, and Sprint's Boost Mobile prepaid brand counts 83 percent of its users in that income range, according to Kagan, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence data.
As part of their push to win regulatory approval, T-Mobile and Sprint have pledged not to raise rates for three years. 
The companies have also offered to sell Boost to reduce the combined company's market share in the prepaid business. They have also indicated they were considering divesting wireless spectrum. 
The states' complaint also said that divesting Boost would not resolve competitive concerns since Boost would be dependent on another carrier to provide network access, meaning that it is not independent.
The two companies have been in regular contact with regulators as they lobby for approval. Sprint Chief Executive Officer Marcelo Claure and John Legere, his counterpart at T-Mobile, met with Justice Department officials on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter.
If the states' lawsuit goes forward, the courts would have the last say, not the Justice Department, Blair Levin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note on Tuesday. 

The next two big steps will be determining the position of Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and the identity of the judge assigned to the states' lawsuit, Levin wrote.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Mexico tariff uncertainty leaves U.S. produce importers in the lurch,"By Richa Naidu and Lisa Baertlein
CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - On Friday evening, watermelon importer Scott Vandervoet received a flurry of WhatsApp messages from his fellow Nogales, Arizona produce brokers: U.S. tariffs on all Mexican goods due to take effect on Monday were off after the United States and Mexico reached a migration pact.
With shipping season for Mexican produce such as table grapes, melons, avocados, mangoes and salad mixes at its peak, the brokers were elated. But their relief was short-lived; on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs if Mexico's Congress did not approve the plan.
""I'm beleaguered. We're just on the edge of our seats here. The threat lingers at the back of our minds ... As long as trade is linked to this asylum-seeker situation that has nothing to do with us, we'll continue to be pressured,"" Vandervoet said.
Anxiety has plagued the industry for two years, starting with agonizing negotiations to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and spiking each time the White House threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico to halt the flow of migrants. 
Worries peaked on May 30 when Trump suddenly announced the 5% levy on Mexican imports to begin on June 10, rising to 25% by October unless Mexico stemmed the stream of Central American migrants crossing into the United States. 
Like Vandervoet and his father, most produce brokers have slim margins that would not be able take the hit.
The uncertainty has left importers concerned about meeting orders from grocers and restaurants, and threatens to disrupt supply chains as some Mexican farmers cancel seed orders for next year or put them on hold.
And if the tariffs become reality, importers are going to have to pass the taxes on to customers or risk going out of business.
Piled into 475,207 40,000-pound truckloads, the United States imported nearly $12 billion of fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico in 2017, the latest year such statistics are available. The goods were mostly brought in via Pharr, Texas and Nogales, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
""25% of $12 billion is $3 billion a year,"" said Lance Jungmeyer, President of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, adding the industry's already thin margins would crumble from such a blow, especially those of tomato importers. 
In early May, the Trump administration imposed a 17.5% tariff on Mexican tomatoes after the two countries were unable to renew a 2013 agreement that suspended a U.S. anti-dumping investigation). With an additional 25% tariff, tomato importers could be looking at 42.5% tariffs, Jungmeyer said. ""That's a lot for people to bear.""
Big buyers for tomatoes and Central Mexican lettuce include McDonald's, Burger King and Yum! Brands' Taco Bell, Jungmeyer said.
McDonald's, Burger King and Taco Bell did not respond to requests for comment.
Last week,  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) estimated a $15 million hit from the tariffs, saying it could cover the costs by raising burrito prices by around 5 cents.
Compounding importers' problems, entry-points were already busy due to the large U.S. appetite for Mexican goods, limiting options for truckers that might want to speed up shipments ahead of any potential tariffs, according to Peter Friedmann, executive director Agriculture Transportation Coalition.
""The ability to move a lot out of Mexico is limited,"" he said.
'ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING'
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's biggest retailer, said on Friday that it was concerned that fresh produce prices would rise if tariffs went ahead. Chief Executive Doug McMillon said Walmart would resist higher prices on fresh produce for as long as it could, adding: ""If the customer is focused on avocado prices, we will hold those prices for as long as we can and focus elsewhere,"" he said.
If other companies followed suit, it would be another big blow for fruit and vegetable brokers.
The produce import industry and supporting businesses account for more than 22% of jobs in Santa Cruz County, surrounding Nogales, according to a 2013 report by economists at the University of Arizona. Trade and support for factories across the border account for another 10% of the workforce.
""Hopefully, importers will be able to pass costs on to the retailer, whether it's Kroger (NYSE:KR) or Walmart, and the consumer will pay the added cost,"" said Jaime Chamberlain, who heads J-C Distributing Inc. ""We're going to try, but if there's no demand for our products at that price, it's going to be difficult.""
Kroger and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment. 
Chamberlain's family, based in Nogales, has imported Mexican fruits and vegetables for about 48 years for grocers including Walmart and  Kroger Co .
""If the 25% goes through, it will be absolutely devastating for the Nogales community. Over 4,000 jobs depend on produce,"" Chamberlain said.
""I understand why the president wants to do this. But this is very difficult, and will be detrimental to my community, my industry, and my state of Arizona.""

Sprint (NYSE:S) shares slumped 6.1% while T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) slipped 1.9%.
The suit against the proposed merger of the third- and fourth-largest wireless companies was filed on grounds that a tie-up would ""deprive consumers of the benefits of competition and drive up prices for cellphone services."" The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Sprint and T-Mobile agreed to team up in April last year in a deal worth $26 billion.
The prospect of a successful merger between the two wireless giants received a boost in May after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai backed the deal, claiming it would prove beneficial to consumers.
But many remained wary that approval from the Justice Department, which reportedly told the two companies in April that their merger was unlikely to be approved as structured, may prove a step too far.
Department of Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Pai met Friday to discuss the deal, with a decision expected as soon as the end of the week."

709,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 01:56PM ET</span>","StockBeat - Beyond Meat Takes Fight to Rival, but JPMorgan Warns Shares Overcooked","Investing.com - Beyond Meat took the fight to rival Impossible Foods with the launch of new, meatier plant-based patties, but that did little to drown out JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) downgrade on concerns the company's stock may be too well done.
The plant-based food company said its new version of its flagship vegan burgers would hit U.S. shelves this week, as it seeks to keep up the pace with privately held Impossible Foods, which also rolled out an improved version of its own burger patty in January.
But the outlook on Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) has been soured by a downgrade from JPMorgan to neutral from overweight, sending its share price down 21.7%.
The bank said that it believes that the vegan upstart's ""extraordinary revenue and profit potential"" has finally been priced in and that its shares will remain sensitive to any disappointing news.
Beyond Meat had surged 645.7% between its $25-a-share IPO in May to its Monday high of $186.43. That prompted the bank to warn that the stock's current valuation is difficult to justify.
In a further blow to the plant-based food company, competition continues to heat up. 
Nestle said Tuesday it could expand its plant-based burger sales partnership with fast food chain McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) beyond Germany or look to sign up other fast food chains.
""McDonald’s is an exciting and big customer, but it is not the only option and we have quite good capacity to cope with a (possible) extension beyond Germany,"" Marco Settembri, the chief executive of Nestle’s Europe, Middle East and North Africa business said."
710,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>",Uber chief executive laments U.S. trade policy for lackluster IPO,"By David Shepardson and Joshua Franklin
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday the company's initial public offering last month was hurt by U.S. trade tensions even as he downplayed recent volatility in the stock price.
The comments from Khosrowshahi continue the fallout from Uber's IPO, which was the most anticipated U.S. listing since  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) seven years ago but has struggled since going public.
Uber priced shares in its IPO toward the bottom of its target range at $45 and the stock ended its first day of trading on May 10 down 7.6% at $41.57, even as the S&P 500 reversed losses to end in positive territory.
""The timing of our IPO was very much aligned with our president's tariff wars, the same day,"" Khosrowshahi said at an event at the Economic Club of Washington. ""So I think we got caught up a bit in the market swirl. And there's nothing you can do about that.""
Uber shares fell as low as $36.08 but have since rebounded and were trading at $42.21 on Tuesday, down 0.9% on the day.
Employees ""have a six-month lockup so nobody in the company cares anyway what the stock prices is now - it’s a bunch of traders,"" said Khosrowshahi. ""It doesn't really affect us... We work on building a great enterprise - the market will take care of itself,"" he added. 
Khosrowshahi addressed the announcement last week of the planned departure of its chief operating officer (COO) and chief marketing officer and he said he will not replace the COO as he organizes Uber ""in a bit more of a business unit basis.""
He added they were ""tough changes but I think are absolutely the right changes for the next three to five years.""
Khosrowshahi also has the option to buy potentially hundreds of thousands of shares in the ride-hailing firm at a price well below where the company went public, according to a regulatory filing for Uber's IPO.
The options highlight how Khosrowshahi is at least partially protected from price swings in Uber's stock.
Khosrowshahi has options on 750,000 Uber shares that vest gradually and can be exercised at $33.65 per share. 
Uber first granted the options on Sept. 5, 2017 with an exercise price of $41.65 per share but this was changed on May 8, 2018, according to the filing. The details were reported earlier on Tuesday by The Information.
An Uber spokesman said the repricing of Khosrowshahi's option grants was made to shorten the timeline over which they were granted to seven years from 10 years in conjunction with a bonus plan dependent on the company being acquired for or trading at $120 billion. Uber went public at a valuation of $82.4 billion.. 
There was no material change in the grant's total value, according to the company's filing. 
""I believe in performance-based pay,"" Khosrowshahi said Tuesday when asked about his compensation. ""If I do very well for shareholders … that's a circumstance where I want to be rewarded.""
Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO. 

He was tasked with getting the company ready for its IPO, and convincing investors that he had successfully changed Uber's culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",High-yield junk market still attractive: top bond manager Margaret Patel,"By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The gains in high-yield junk bonds are not over, thanks to the Federal Reserve's supportive stance on monetary policy, Margaret Patel, one of the mutual-fund industry's longest tenured and most well-known bond managers, said on Tuesday.
""The risk-taker will be rewarded,"" Patel, a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management, said at the New York headquarters of Reuters. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) Merrill Lynch U.S. high-yield index has posted returns of 8.92% so far this year. Patel's Wells Fargo High Yield Bond fund is up 8.68% for the same period.
""I see a downward drift in yields in junk bonds,"" she said.
Patel, who has more than 40 years' experience in the business, said the Fed will not be cutting off liquidity and could, in fact, slash interest rates this year. The Fed's potential cuts will trigger another wave of gains and access to credit for high-yield companies, which issue debt with less-than-stellar credit ratings called junk bonds.
""Why should junk bond spreads be 450 basis points over Treasuries if defaults are a needle in a haystack? Makes no sense,"" Patel said.
The economy is slowing down but not to the point of recessionary levels, Patel said. She characterizes the economic backdrop as marked by ""low inflation, modest growth, low interest rates and low volatility.""
As a result, junk bond returns will continue to be modest for a number of years, Patel said. She favors the industrial, healthcare and technology sectors.
For their part, U.S. equities ""could definitely move higher,"" she added.

After starting as an equities analyst, Patel eventually became a portfolio manager where her reputation rose primarily on the bond side. Before joining Pioneer Investments in 1999, Patel had started a bond fund for Third Avenue's fund family. It was later acquired by the Boston asset manager.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Prosecutors investigate VW works council boss in pay inquiry,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Tuesday they were investigating the chairman of Volkswagen's powerful works council as part of a inquiry into whether some of its members were paid excessively, turning him from a witness into a suspect.
Bernd Osterloh is being investigated over an allegation that he ""contributed to the conclusion of the remuneration agreement that is suspected of being unlawful"", a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig said.
Osterloh has not yet been questioned and has requested, via his lawyer, access to relevant files and will respond to any allegations, a spokesman for the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) works council said, adding that its chairman was ""beyond reproach"".
Prosecutors have been investigating four people since 2016 on suspicion of preferential treatment of works council members and, on the basis of those investigations, prosecutors decided to investigate Osterloh, who had previously been a witness.
Volkswagen said in November 2017 it had obeyed the law in its payment of Osterloh, a day after prosecutors and tax authorities raided the offices of several senior officials at the carmaker in an inquiry into whether he had been overpaid.

A newspaper reported in May that prosecutors were investigating the chief executive of Volkswagen's Porsche business, Oliver Blume, over a possible breach of fiduciary trust linked to payments made to a Porsche works council member.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 12:33PM ET</span>",Boeing May deliveries fall 56% as 737 MAX grounding continues to weigh,"By Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday it handed over 56% fewer airplanes in May compared with a year earlier, as deliveries of its top-selling 737 MAX jet remained suspended following a deadly crash in March.
Total deliveries fell to 30 planes, compared with 68 in 2018. Net orders for the first five months remained in negative territory, with a total of minus 125 net orders.
The company has been facing its worst ever crisis after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX plane crashed, killing all 157 people on board, in the second fatal accident involving the jet in just five months.
This is the last order and delivery update from Boeing before the Paris Airshow, which kicks off next week. European rival Airbus SE and Boeing are battling for wide-body aircraft orders worth well over $10 billion at the air show.
Boeing will also be under scrutiny at the airshow, where the planemaker will face questions about the 737 MAX groundings, deliveries and orders.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration earlier this month disclosed a new problem involving Boeing's grounded 737 MAX, saying that more than 300 of that troubled plane and the prior generation 737 may contain improperly manufactured parts and that the agency will require these parts to be quickly replaced.
Boeing reiterated on Sunday it was working with global regulators to certify a software update for the jet as well as related training and education material to safely return the plane to service.
Global airlines that had rushed to buy the fuel-efficient, longer-range aircraft have since canceled flights and scrambled to cover routes that were previously flown by the MAX.
Airbus delivered 81 aircraft in May, up 59% from last year and 313 in the January-May period, a rise of 40%.

Boeing shares were down 1.3% at $348.99 in morning trade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global business consultancy Capgemini is launching its first-ever investment fund, with plans to invest up to 90 million euros ($102 million) in early-stage technology companies.
Capgemini, which advises global companies on their organizational and technology needs, said its consultancy business would help accelerate the growth of the firms backed by the fund, which would be managed by asset manager ISAI Gestion.
""In the digital age, our clients are increasingly embracing open innovation and actively engaging with start-ups,"" Capgemini Chief Operating Officer Thierry Delaporte said.
The fund, called ISAI Cap Venture, will target companies looking to raise money in Series A, B and C funding rounds, and will also have the option of holding investments until they list, Capgemini said in a statement on Tuesday.
It will have a particular focus on Europe and invest between 1 million euros and 5 million euros in 15-20 companies. The life of the fund will be up to 10 years.
The investments are expected to be mostly identified through Capgemini's employee and business network, focusing on firms which have an ""innovative solution"", are in ""sustainable IT"" or which could be future software market leaders.
ISAI, well known in France as a leading tech investment fund, would work with the consultancy's newly created Capgemini Ventures unit.
Capgemini Ventures Executive Director Lucia Sinapi-Thomas said partnering with ISAI would allow Capgemini to be ""immediately professional in something that is not our core business"".

But with Capgemini already working with a number of start-ups across the world and connecting them to clients, having an investment arm would allow it to have ""skin in the game"".

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 12:20PM ET</span>",Spooked public investors reach fork in risky road as asset growth slows,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Global public institutions including central banks, sovereign wealth funds and public sector pension funds are increasingly worried about a worldwide economic downturn and are taking divergent investment strategies to adapt.
An annual survey of 750 institutions from 183 countries with assets valued at $37.8 trillion, equivalent to 43% of the global economy, found that 43% had sought to raise their risk budget and move into higher-yielding assets, while 37% had simply accepted a lower return.
And some big investors, such as the Swiss National Bank and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), had a drop in assets for the first time since the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) began its survey in 2014.
Overall, growth in assets held by public sector institutions slowed to $1.4 trillion or 3.7% in 2018, down from 7.6% in 2017, as weak equity markets, which experienced one of the worst years since the 2008 financial crisis, took their toll.
""Despite a return to dovishness among the world's major central banks over the year, public investors are concerned about a potential global downturn and its impact on their portfolios,"" the survey seen by Reuters on Tuesday added.
A trade war between the United States and China has raised concerns that it might tip the global economy into recession, driving a sharp fall in U.S. Treasury and German bond yields in recent weeks as investors have sought out safer assets.
""This environment presents great challenges for public institutions,"" the report said, noting that 68% of central banks highlighted capital preservation as their most important goal, with a focus on safety and liquidity as investment objectives.
RISK FOR RETURNS
Despite such worries, many public sector investors plan to continue raising investments in riskier assets, with 23.5% intending to expand equity investments and 14.7% aiming to raise allocations to corporate bonds, infrastructure and real estate.
""Return remains important to reserve managers, especially where operations are particularly exposed to the public spotlight,"" the report said.
The best performers during 2018 were sovereign funds, whose assets posted the strongest growth of 7.9%, helped by higher oil prices. Assets of pension funds grew 4.8%, while those of central banks expanded by only 0.1%.
Around 28% of the $1.4 trillion rise in public sector institutions' assets was accounted for by four institutions: China Investment Corporation, Mubadala Investment, Kuwait Investment Authority and the U.S. Military Retirement Fund.
Mubadala's 79% rise resulted from its merger with fellow state-backed fund Abu Dhabi Investment Council during the year, while China Investment Corporation's assets rose 16% on returns from state-owned capital and Belt and Road overseas investments.

Morgan, downgraded it, saying the exponential growth expected from the plant-based burger was now priced in. 
Beyond Meat has surged over 69% in two days since it forecast overall sales in 2019 to more than double. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman cut the stock rating to 'neutral' from 'overweight' and said it was ""purely a valuation call"". 
The stock, which has quadrupled in value since debut in May, is ""beyond our price target"", he said. 
Shares of the company were down 19.8% at $134.9 in mid-day trading, but still well above every Wall Street analysts' price target on the stock. 
Goldman raised price target for the second time in three days to $121, after raising it by $23 last Friday on the upbeat forecast.
Beyond Meat's projections also prompted at least three brokerages, including J.P. Morgan's Goldman, to raise their price targets.
Goldman last week wrote that ""at some point, the extraordinary revenue and profit potential embedded in Beyond Meat… will be priced in.""
""We think this day has arrived,"" his latest note said.
Separately, Beyond Meat said on Tuesday it would start selling a new version of its flagship vegan burgers, which look and cook more like traditional beef, as it battles for space in the meat section of U.S. grocery stores. 
The launch of its meatier burger comes as it prepares to compete against new launches from Nestle,  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and Impossible Foods. 
The new burgers imitate the marbling effect, or the streaks of fat, seen in red meat, and also have a texture that mimics the chewiness and juiciness of beef.
The California-based company has been focused on getting more meat eaters to pick up its products, saying they are more sustainable and better for the environment. 

The new burgers are made with blended pea, mung bean and rice proteins that give a more fibrous texture, compared to the company's previous recipe which included pea protein, coconut and canola oil.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Land & Buildings on Tuesday warned that it may seek board seats at shopping mall operator Taubman Centers Inc next year unless performance improves.
Jonathan Litt, who runs the firm and is known for pushing for change at real estate companies, wrote to fellow Taubman shareholders, telling them that he plans to ""take any action that we deem necessary to hold this Board and Bobby Taubman accountable.""
Unless there is ""meaningful progress in the coming months,"" Litt wrote that he plans to wage a proxy contest and nominate directors next year. 
Specifically Litt wants Taubman Centers to sell assets in Asia and sell or spin-off ""Jewel Box"" assets which include properties like the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. 
Shares in the company, whose market capitalization is roughly $2.6 billion, have fallen 26% in the last 52 weeks as consumer appetites have shifted more to buying online.
""Their best defense against a proxy contest in 2020 is to drive material outperformance by maximizing value for all shareholders,"" Litt wrote in the letter.
Litt, whose firm had roughly $577 million in regulatory assets at the end of last year, has been pushing for changes at Taubman since 2016 and won a board seat two years later.
He wrote that he did not stand for re-election this year because ""it was clear that the Company did not intend to re-nominate me,"" and because he feels that one independent director was not enough to push for the changes he feels are needed.
Next year however shareholders will have a chance to cast ballots on all directors including Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Bobby Taubman. ""All directors and specifically, Bobby Taubman, can be held accountable by shareholders for the Company's atrocious absolute and relative performance for the first time since 2017 at the 2020 Annual Meeting,"" the letter said.
News of Litt's plans was first reported by Bloomberg.

Nestle may extend plant-based burger partnership with McDonald's,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle could expand its plant-based burger sales partnership with fast food chain McDonald's beyond Germany and is also looking for other partners, the Swiss food giant's head said on Tuesday.
""McDonald's is an exciting and big customer, but it is not the only option and we have quite good capacity to cope with a (possible) extension beyond Germany,"" Marco Settembri, the Chief Executive of Nestle's Europe, Middle East and North Africa business said.
The market for meat substitutes could soar to $140 billion over the next decade, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC), as many health- and climate-conscious consumers seek to reduce their meat consumption.
Nestle launched its plant-based Incredible Burger in April under the Garden Gourmet brand in several European countries. The same month, McDonald's started selling the patties as ""Big Vegan TS"" in its 1,500 restaurants in Germany.
Early results of the launch in Germany were promising, Settembri said, and Nestle and McDonald's were discussing next steps.
""For both (of us), if we do it, if we go ahead, we want to do it right. We have capacity of course, but we really need to plan it and we need to do it well,"" he told a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference. 
Nestle is also working with other operators to supply products to business customers but Settembri insisted that the company's retail channel, a ""historical strength"", was very important as well. 
He said he didn't see the meat alternatives as a threat to Nestle's existing business as it doesn't have many meat products and recently put its Herta meat and cold cuts unit on the block.
Switzerland-based Nestle has also announced plans to launch a plant-based burger in the U.S. later this year, where it will compete with products made by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.
In an interview with Reuters last week, the heads of Nestle's Sweet Earth brand, Kelly and Brian Swette, said their Awesome Burger would be available from retailers and at restaurants in the U.S. in September or October. 

They declined to comment on a possible launch with McDonald's.

The new law, due to come into effect in August, has been issued following the collapse of Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj, which had a DIFC-regulated entity Abraaj Capital.
The firm that had been the Middle East and North Africa's biggest buyout fund unravelled after a row with some investors over the use of money in a $1 billion healthcare fund.
The new law introduces a ""new debtor in possession bankruptcy regime"" for debtors that have filed for bankruptcy but still hold assets, according to a statement on the Dubai's ruler official website.
Abraaj, its founder Arif Naqvi and a former executive are being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on U.S. charges that they defrauded investors, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. [nL1N21T1QZ]

732,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>","Ex-Deutsche Bank banker helped game global financial system, Euribor trial told","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) managing director was part of a group that gamed the global financial system in a five-year plot to rig Euribor interest rates, a prosecutor alleged at the first day of his trial in London on Tuesday.
Andreas Hauschild, a German national, was among those who had sought a dishonest and unfair edge over counterparties in a zero sum game, prosecutor James Waddington alleged as he opened the seventh rate-rigging trial brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO).
The 54-year-old former senior rate submitter and trader, who denies any wrongdoing, sat impassively in the glass-surrounded dock as Waddington outlined the case against him.
""The criminal activity ... was tied up with the real and legitimate activity of persons who were good at...the job they were employed to do,"" Waddington told the jury at London's Southwark Crown Court, which is scheduled to last five weeks.
""You will see how some intelligent, competitive and ambitious people cheated a global financial system to give them an edge on what were otherwise their perfectly honest and lucrative business deals,"" he added.
Hauschild is charged with conspiracy to defraud over the alleged manipulation of Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate), a Brussels-based benchmark that helps determine rates on around $180 trillion of global financial contracts and loans.
Hauschild, who appeared in court wearing an open-necked, white shirt and spectacles, is accused of conspiring with others at Deutsche Bank,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and other banks between January 2005 and December 2009.
The jury heard that four others, including ex-Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar and one-time Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef had already been convicted over the conspiracy, along with Colin Bermingham, a former Barclays rate submitter, and Carlo Palombo, a former Barclays derivatives trader.
Waddington said the convictions proved a conspiracy had taken place and it was up to the jury to decide whether Hauschild was part of it.
Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average.
Prosecutors allege bankers rigged rates by nudging them up or down to benefit trading positions, deliberately and dishonestly ignoring rules that they should be set independently of commercial interests.
Waddington alleged that Frankfurt-based Hauschild had at times ignored London-based Bittar's requests for rates that would flatter his trading positions not because he disapproved of them but because they interfered with his own ""similarly dishonest money-making plans"".
He said Hauschild had told SFO investigators he had thought at the time it was acceptable for Euribor rates to accommodate the financial interests of the bank if rates were set with a reasonable range of figures available in the market.
But Waddington added: ""It is common ground in this case that a panel (rate submitting) bank is not permitted to submit rates that take into account a trading advantage.""

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Lloyds Tests U.K. Utility Industry Exposure as Corbyn Risk Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- The last time Labour politicians governed Britain, they took a swathe of the banking industry into public ownership to avoid its collapse. More than a decade later, banks are growing worried about the party’s latest promise to nationalize utility firms -- a policy that could trigger a fresh set of multibillion pound losses.
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY), one of the country’s largest business lenders, has multiple exposures to the utility sector through swaps, derivatives and revolving credit facilities, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
While Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour has promised to honor the debts of any businesses it takes into public hands, executives at Lloyds have worked on scenarios under which a future government nationalizes the utilities at less than market value, said the people, who asked not to be named. Representatives at the bank declined to comment.
“Banks have historically seen utility lending as pretty safe,” said Nigel Hawkins, utilities sector analyst at Hardman & Co in London. Utilities have been “pretty good borrowers on the whole and most of them have had very big capital expenditure and had to gear up, which the banks were financing.”
Quantifying the overall risk to the banks in a nationalization is difficult. In the last 10 years, Lloyds,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc have lent out nearly $50 billion to the British utilities companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, these loans include some firms that would not be affected by Labour’s policy, while the banks’ swaps and revolving credit facilities would not be included in the public total.
At Lloyds, senior staff have discussed the matter with the relevant companies, while the bank’s non-executive directors have questioned leaders including Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio and Chief Financial Officer George Culmer over the bank’s plans if the government changes, the people said.
“Unprecedented”
The next election isn’t scheduled until 2022, yet the resignation of Theresa May as prime minister last week stirred more uncertainty in the country, which is stuck in a draining Brexit gridlock that could require an election to resolve.
The water companies would be the first to be nationalized under Labour’s plans to take control of utilities, rail and postal services. The opposition party has said it would compensate equity investors with bonds issued by the U.K. Treasury at a value decided by the Parliament. However, there is little clarity on the consequences for lenders who finance those firms, with Labour vowing to refinance “over a period of time so that the costs of debts are reduced.”
Having Parliament decide the fair value of utility firms would create “a lot of uncertainty for investors. There could be a big discussion about what fair value means,” said Andrew Rose, chief executive of the Global Infrastructure Investor Association, a trade body. “It’s an issue for the owners but also for the reputation of the U.K. government. There is a lot of domestic and international capital sitting there.”
“Labour have been clear that existing debts of the operating companies will be carried over and honored in full,” said a spokesman for John McDonnell, the party’s shadow chancellor.
Utility providers use several methods to tap markets for their large maintenance and upgrade costs. As well as issuing shares and bonds, these firms agree revolving credit facilities to help manage their cash needs. Much of their funding would be almost entirely private and through swaps, one person said.
“It would be extreme and unprecedented for the British government to cause a default on those swaps and incredibly damaging for the U.K. as whole,’’ Dan Neidle, partner at Clifford Chance LLP, said in an interview.
In its annual report, Thames Water, the U.K.’s largest water company, said it has derivative financial instruments worth a nominal 5.5 billion pounds ($7 billion) in 2018, resulting in a net liability of 762 million pounds. In a sign that its lenders are increasingly worried about nationalization, Thames added a clause to its bonds to guarantee holders would be repaid immediately if the government takes over, Reuters reported in April. A spokesman at Thames Water declined to comment.
Still Safe?
Nationalizing these firms would not be cheap. The Centre for Policy Studies, a research group set up by the former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, last year gave an estimated cost of 55.4 billion pounds to buy  National Grid  (LON:NG) Plc and other energy distribution networks -- as Labour have pledged -- with the total rising to 185 billion pounds to take over the entire energy industry, including the Big Six companies that both produce power and sell it to consumers. It said buying the water industry would cost anywhere from 14.3 billion pounds to 100 billion pounds.
A Labour government would have wider implications for the British banks. Corbyn, who took over as a leader in 2015, has pledged to “transform” the financial system with reforms including “a new approach” to state-controlled RBS that could see it broken up into new local public banks, according to the 2017 election manifesto. However, a shadow minister told Reuters earlier this year any state involvement in the bank would depend on its willingness to increase lending to Britain’s regions and small businesses.
During a meeting between RBS’s top executives and Labour Party representatives last year, the bank’s officials made the point that RBS is the country’s biggest lender to small- and medium-sized businesses and that breaking up a bank has costs, according to one person who attended the meeting. A spokesman for RBS declined to comment.
“There are a lot of headwinds for the U.K. banks. Chances for them to come up with good news are very low,” said Eric Moore, a fund manager at Miton Group in London who owns shares of U.K. lenders including Lloyds. “Under a Corbyn government, you can not rely on market value. It’s going to be very challenging for banks to quantify their risk.”

Ryanair has been moving to a structure similar to that of British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) by operating an increasing number of subsidiaries, including Austrian and Polish airlines Laudamotion and Ryanair Buzz, as well as its main Dublin-based Ryanair.
After the Maltese government said it was in advanced talks with Ryanair about setting up the subsidiary, the Irish airline announced it would do so through the purchase of Maltese start up Malta Air, into which it will move its six aircraft currently based in the country.
""Malta Air will proudly fly the Maltese name and flag as we look to grow our Maltese based fleet, routes, traffic and jobs over the next three years,"" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Europe's largest low-cost airline said it planned to increase its fleet on the island to 10 aircraft within three years and rebrand them as Malta Air for Summer 2020.
Over 50 planes based in France, Italy and Germany will also be moved onto the Maltese register, allowing crews to pay income taxes locally instead of in Ireland where they are obliged to do so under current arrangements, Ryanair added.
Malta's Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post late on Monday that the airline would include a 'golden share', a mechanism which usually means a government's consent is required for disposals, share issues or takeovers.
The airline would also set up hangar facilities for repair and maintenance operations in Malta, he said, adding that there would not be an impact on state-owned Air Malta since the two airlines will offer different but complimentary services.
In a note earlier on Tuesday, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said Ryanair's move to add another brand would not come as a surprise and that doing so in Malta was likely due to the cost and/or tax benefits for Ryanair.

In a rare move, Goldin said in an exchange filing on Tuesday its board had decided to exit the tendering process for land use rights for a parcel in the Kai Tak area of Hong Kong due to ""recent social contradiction and economic instability"".
The firm, with interest in financial and property markets, did not explain what it meant by social contradiction. Company representatives could not immediately be reached by Reuters after regular business hours.
Hong Kong's economy expanded at its slowest pace in nearly 10 years in the first quarter due to weaker exports and as the former British colony was buffeted by the U.S.-China trade war, along with cooling property prices and volatile stock markets.
The government has maintained its forecast for Hong Kong's full-year 2019 growth at 2-3%, compared with 3% growth in 2018.
Despite economic weakness, home prices in one of the world's most expensive property markets rose for the fourth straight month in April, government data showed last month.
But analysts have said the rising price trend may not be sustainable, especially as trade tensions between China and the United States intensify again, leading to a plunge in transaction volume.
The trade tensions and its impact on the economy of Hong Kong could hit the rental business of the planned Kai Tak project, making the return period longer, said Thomas Lam, executive director of property consultancy Knight Frank.

736,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Swiss Stock Index Jumps to Record as SocGen Goes Long on Country,"(Bloomberg) -- Switzerland’s equity benchmark jumped to a record as the country’s political stability and steady dividend flow, from companies such as Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), lured investors seeking a haven amid trade-war worries and uncertainty in other parts of Europe.
The Swiss Market Index was up 1.1% as of 2:04 p.m. in Zurich, boosted by building materials giant LafargeHolcim Ltd., chemicals company Lonza Group AG and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. The SMI has advanced about 17% this year, beating indexes in countries including France, the U.K., Germany and Italy.
Investors have increasingly turned to Switzerland’s equities and currency as a haven in a market steeped in escalating trade tensions and as other countries in Europe are in turmoil. The SMI is considered less risky thanks to the heavy weightings of Roche, rival drugmaker Novartis AG and Nestle, with the Swiss food giant among the SMI’s top gainers this year.
“We are long Switzerland,” Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of Global Asset Allocation and Equity Strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, said in an interview in Geneva. “We like companies that have big, safe dividends, so typically recurring earnings. Volatility is very low, the local economy is doing fine and you don’t have a political risk the way you have” in other European countries such as Italy, he added.
“Absent alternatives and fearful of a slowdown and trade war,” investors are piling into defensives and liquid assets and “the Swiss market is full of these: defensively growing super caps, consumer, pharma, medtech, insurers,” Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss equities at Kepler Cheuvreux, wrote in an email.
Investors also tend to buy the country’s currency, the franc, at times of heightened risk aversion. The SMI index has gained for a fourth straight day and traded as high as 9,859.57.
To be sure, it’s not all plain sailing for Switzerland. The equity market is at risk of being cut off from EU investors after Brussels made any regulatory extension for the bourse contingent on progress on a wider political accord governing Switzerland’s relations with the bloc.
Still, Switzerland “in the pecking order of things, is at the bottom of my concerns when it comes to Europe’s fragmented political landscape,” according to Societe Generale’s de Boissezon.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is seeking to ban Deloitte Haskins Sells and KPMG affiliate BSR & Associates for five years, alleging lapses in their audits of a unit of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), which the government took control of last year.
India's corporate affairs ministry told a company law tribunal that the companies ""miserably failed"" to fulfill their duties as auditors for IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN), a filing seen by Reuters shows.
Both auditing firms denied any wrongdoing on Tuesday.
Deloitte said it ""is confident that it has been thorough and diligent in the performance of its duties as an auditor. The firm stands fully for its audit work which has been conducted in full compliance with the professional standards in India.""
It said it would cooperate fully with authorities.
BSR said that its ""audit of IFIN was performed in accordance with the applicable auditing standards and legal framework"", adding it would defend itself ""in accordance with the law"".
The Indian government took control of IL&FS in October after it defaulted on several debt obligations, saying it stepped in to insulate the financial system from contagion. The group has a debt of more than 910 billion rupees ($13.1 billion).
Last month government investigators filed fraud charges against IFIN, its former management as well as the auditors.
Deloitte audited IFIN from 2008-09 to 2017-18 and BSR started auditing it from 2017-18, the petition says. Both Deloitte and BSR audited IFIN in 2017-18.
Reuters reported in March that an interim report by Grant Thornton, appointed by a new IL&FS board to conduct a forensic audit, had found a third of the total outstanding loans by IFIN were either unsecured or had inadequate collateral.
Auditors have come under close scrutiny in India, where the capital market regulator last year barred all the Indian units of PwC, from auditing any listed companies for two years after a probe into a nearly decade-old accounting fraud case.
And India's central bank barred S.R. Batliboi & Co, an EY firm, from conducting statutory audit assignments in commercial banks until April 2020, citing lapses identified in its work.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>",France to uphold ban on sale of fossil fuel cars by 2040,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government's new law on mobility will uphold a planned ban on fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040, Transport Minister Elizabeth Borne said on Tuesday.
Former environment minister Nicolas Hulot said in July 2017 - at the beginning of President Emmanuel Macron's term - that France aimed to end the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2040 in a bid to become carbon neutral by 2050.
Hulot resigned in September 2018 in protest over Macron's lack of commitment to environmental causes and the government has since rarely mentioned the planned ban, partly because of the ""yellow vest"" protest movement against carbon taxes on fuel prices and the high cost of living.
Borne, who is a deputy to Hulot's successor Francois de Rugy, confirmed in an interview with BFM television that the objective set out by Hulot would be met.
""We have target for carbon neutrality by 2050 and we need a credible trajectory towards that, which includes a ban on the sale of vehicles that consume fossil fuels by 2040,"" she said.
She said France - which has a large car manufacturing industry led by PSA and  Renault  (PA:RENA) - would help its car makers switch to electricity, hydrogen and possibly biogas.
""Since the start of Emmanuel Macron's term, our target is the climate plan that Nicolas Hulot announced in the summer of 2017. We will now inscribe this target into law,"" Borne said.
The mobility law will also facilitate the rollout of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, notably by giving the residents of apartment buildings the right to ask for the installation of EV plugs in their parking lots.
The much-delayed law, which is currently being debated in parliament, is expected to be approved after the summer and will update a 1982 law on transportation.
The reform wants to favor alternatives to individual automobile usage, upgrade railway networks and create a legal framework for new mobility solutions such as free-floating bicycles, electric scooters and car-sharing.
It will also give companies the option to offer employees a tax-free 400 euro subsidy to come to work on bicycles or with car-sharing. Borne said companies would be obliged to discuss this subsidy in wage negotiations with unions, but the subsidy would not be mandatory for all companies.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares rallied on Tuesday to hold near one-month highs, with German carmakers outperforming and Wall Street looking to extend gains after the United States stepped back from imposing tariffs on Mexico.
With Frankfurt re-opening after a one-day holiday, German investors returned to shares after a U.S.-Mexico deal on Friday apparently averted tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.
Investors are also heartened by expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon start cutting rates, with markets pricing in a cut by July. Those hopes were re-ignited by Friday's disappointing jobs report, and could be boosted further if retail and inflation data this week also disappoint.
""We are in a situation where bad news is good news,"" said Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, noting the recent dovish signal from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and recent lackluster U.S. data.
""Equity markets are relying on loose monetary policy, but they are also taking Trump at face value so I expect more volatility ahead,"" Dall'Angelo said.
Frankfurt's DAX index rose 1.2%. BMW, Daimler and VW - considered sensitive to trade tariffs - all gained 1.8% to 2%, mirroring a 1.9% gain for the auto sector.
The pan-European STOXX 600 climbed 0.8%, on course for a sixth day of gains in the last seven. MSCI's index of global equities rose 0.3% for a seventh day of gains
The Mexico news and interest rate bets fueled a strong close on Wall Street on Monday, with the Dow Jones enjoying its longest winning streak in 13 months. It was preparing to build on those gains, according to equity futures, which were up 0.4%. S&P500 and Nasdaq futures rose 0.5% to 0.7%.
With fears easing that the United States would launch a trade war with Mexico, investors appeared to shrug off Trump's threat to impose more tariffs on China if no progress was made in talks with President Xi Jingping. They are expected to meet at a Group of 20 summit on June 28-29.
""It looks like we will have to wait to see at the end of the month, to see what the next move will be,"" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets. ""In that time, if nothing is said, stocks could press on higher.""
There are hopes also of stimulus from China, where shares climbed 2% after Beijing tweaked policy on major investment projects in to support its slowing economy.
DOLLAR AND YIELDS
The dollar held steady above a two-and-a-half-month low against a basket of currencies Rising expectations for a Fed rate cut were tempered by a reluctance to close positions before the G20.
The dollar index was flat after advancing 0.2% on Monday. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a one-week high as investors who had dashed for bonds last week started buying shares again.
The rally in long-dated euro zone government bonds also stalled. Germany's 10-year bond yield, a benchmark for European debt, was near last week's record lows and longer-dated bond yields rose around four basis points.
But investors are likely to stay positioned for more market turbulence through bond positions.
""You have to be long globally on fixed income,"" said Said Haidar, chief investment officer at Haidar Capital. ""That move is not done yet. The global data just keeps on going down.""

In commodities, oil prices rose, bolstered by firmer financial markets and expectations that producer group OPEC and its allies will keep withholding supply. Brent crude futures were at $62.67 at 0741 GMT, up 0.4%.

Finnish police have been reviewing the case since October, after Browder alleged that Nordea let $234 million in suspicious funds flow through its Finnish branch. But a preliminary inquiry by the National Bureau of Investigation in Helsinki found that the “allegedly suspicious acts” were committed in Estonia and Lithuania, where Finnish authorities have no jurisdiction, according to a statement on Tuesday. The bureau also said the transfers largely took place more than 10 years ago, putting them under the statutes of limitations.
In a tweet on Tuesday, Browder said he will appeal the decision. But police have said that appeals aren’t possible in this case. Instead, Browder can either bring a new charge against Nordea or complain to higher authorities.
“They claim the money never touched Finland and was beyond the 10 year statute of limitations. Both are untrue,” Browder wrote on Twitter. “If money laundering across the European Union is to be stopped, it requires serious and rigorous activity of law enforcement.”
Browder made similar filings to other Nordic prosecutors last year, and Swedish authorities have already decided against starting a probe, in part as the amounts alleged to have moved through Nordea’s branch there were relatively small. A Browder complaint against Danske Bank A/S was followed by multiple criminal investigations.
“Nordea doesn’t accept being used to launder money or as conduit to other financial crime,” Sakari Wuolijoki, head of legal matters in Finland, said in a statement on the bank’s website on Tuesday. “We don’t accept it now and we have not accepted it before. We have always reported suspicious activity to relevant authorities.”
Finnish police said there’s no reason to suspect that Nordea would have been aware of any suspicious operations in the Baltic countries.
“The request for investigation or attached documents do not reveal the facts supporting the claim that when receiving the payments, those acting on behalf of the Finnish seller companies and Nordea did know that the funds in question were gained from aggravated tax fraud or some other offences in Russia,” the police wrote in the document seen by Bloomberg and addressed to Browder’s Hermitage Capital Management. “There is no reason to suspect an offence.”

""The company will continue to charge the fee as the fund remains actively managed and we focus on repositioning the portfolio,"" a spokesman for Woodford Investment Management said.
Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, said earlier on Tuesday that he agreed with lawmaker calls for fees to be waived in the Neil Woodford fund that was suspended on June 3.
""He should consider his position,"" Bailey told BBC radio.
""From our point of view we need him now to manage these assets more than ever. His job now is to get this fund back into a position where there can be orderly trading. He has his work cut out now,"" Bailey said.
The European Union's rule on funds limits so-called unlisted or illiquid holdings to 10 percent.
""There is a way round that which he used, which is to take assets to another jurisdiction which can be deemed as eligible,"" Bailey said.
""Around about 20 percent of the Woodford Fund was in unquoted assets. A bit under 10 percent was held in the UK, and about 11 percent was moved to another jurisdiction. That was within the rules,"" Bailey said.
Four of the Woodford equity income fund's investments were listed in Guernsey in the last three years, allowing the fund to classify them as listed.

The contests include a fight for business at Philippines budget airline Cebu Air as Airbus seeks a new foothold for its slow-selling A330neo airliner in the face of competition from Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.
The budget carrier is leaning towards breaking its exclusive ties with Airbus by selecting the Boeing 787 for its requirement for up to 16 wide-body jets to be delivered in 2020 and 2021, but negotiations are set to go down to the wire, the sources said.
None of the parties agreed to comment on any confidential aircraft negotiations.
Airbus is urgently looking for at least two new buyers for the upgraded A330neo model, while wrestling with some glitches and delays in production for the 250-300-seat aircraft.
Cebu Air has eight older versions of the A330 wide-body and a fleet of smaller A320-family aircraft.
Airbus is close to signing a deal to sell A330neo jets to Virgin Atlantic, Reuters reported last week.
Asian carriers are looking to renew their long-haul fleets as passenger demand remains robust despite a decline in cargo traffic amid global trade tensions.
Boeing looks set to win an order for its upcoming 777X long-haul jet from Korean Air, industry sources said.
The South Korean flag carrier declined to comment.
Korean Air Chief Executive Walter Cho said last week a decision on the future of the carrier's wide-body fleet would be made ""imminently"", but declined further comment.
Airbus has meanwhile poached a senior air finance executive from a unit of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) to oversee the reorganisation of its sales financing operations in the latest evidence of a shake-up under new management, people familiar with the matter said.
Paul Meijers, until recently president of PK Air Finance, a debt financing unit of GE's aviation leasing arm GECAS, will be responsible for an enlarged operation combining the key areas of asset management and leasing market operations.

Airbus declined to comment. Meijers, who had previously worked for the European planemaker, could not be reached for comment.

748,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Apple's U.S. iPhones Can All Be Made Outside of China If Needed,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). has a backup plan if the U.S.-China trade war gets out of hand.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based company’s primary manufacturing partner has enough capacity to make all iPhones bound for the U.S. outside of China if necessary, according to a senior executive at Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The Taiwanese contract manufacturer now makes most of the smartphones in the Chinese mainland.
China is a crucial cog in Apple’s business, the origin of most of its iPhones and iPads as well as its largest international market. But President Donald Trump has threatened Beijing with new tariffs on about $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, an act that would escalate tensions dramatically while levying a punitive tax on Apple’s most profitable product.
Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, is the American giant’s most important manufacturing partner. It will fully support Apple if it needs to adjust its production as the U.S.-Chinese trade spat gets grimmer and more unpredictable, board nominee and semiconductor division chief Young Liu told an investor briefing in Taipei on Tuesday.
“Twenty-five percent of our production capacity is outside of China and we can help Apple respond to its needs in the U.S. market,” said Liu, adding that investments are now being made in India for Apple. “We have enough capacity to meet Apple’s demand.”
Apple has not given Hon Hai instructions to move production out of China, but it is capable of moving lines elsewhere according to customers’ needs, Liu added. The company will respond swiftly and rely on localized manufacturing in response to the trade war, just as it foresaw the need to build a base in the U.S. state of Wisconsin two years ago, he said.
It’s unclear if India will ever become a major production base for Apple’s marquee device. Foxconn is now running quality tests for the iPhone Xr series there and plans to begin mass production at a facility in the suburbs of Chennai. Older models are already assembled at a Wistron plant in Bangalore.
Foxconn has also agreed to build a 13,000-worker facility in Wisconsin in exchange for more than $4.5 billion in government incentives. But that project has since come under criticism for low-paying jobs, sudden dismissals and ever-changing goals. On Tuesday, executives reaffirmed that employment goal, saying construction remained on schedule and that it will hire as many as 2,000 Americans by the end of 2020.
It will also start making networking and server products for the U.S. market by the end of next year, on top of LCDs starting next year, Liu said.

Investing.com -- It’s time for round two of the three-way boxing match that is Fiat-Renault-Nissan.
As we noted two weeks ago, the underlying pressure for consolidation isn’t going away, so it’s best to view the sudden announcement of  Fiat  Chrysler's(MI:FCHA) original merger bid, and its equally sudden withdrawal, as just the opening salvoes in what is likely to be a drawn-out negotiating process, an attempt at jockeying for position by all three parties.
The first round served to illustrate that  Renault  (PA:RENA) is highly vulnerable to opportunist bids unless it repairs its damaged alliance with Nissan (T:7201). Renault’s market capitalization is currently 16 billion euros, but its 43% stake in Nissan is worth 10.5 billion and it has over six billion in cash, so that gives you an idea of what the market thinks its car business is worth.
Round one also proved that even if they don’t want to pursue a full merger, the French and Japanese can still both block each other’s plans, which is no-one's interest. Renault retaliated to Nissan’s abstention on the merger deal by abstaining a key vote on essential governance reforms at Nissan. And, as noted previously, it proved that the French state cannot hope to run a company spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia.
As those lessons are absorbed, positions are shifting, although whether they will move enough to end the current impasse is still far from clear. Nissan’s CEO Hiroto Saikawa told the Financial Times that Nissan “must make its peace” with the French company, while French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told AFP that he’s ready to cut the government stake in Renault if that’s what’s needed to solidify the alliance with Nissan. Interestingly, he said nothing about what it might take to revive the interest of Fiat.
As for Fiat, Italian newspapers are reporting this morning that it may now look at Hyundai in its quest to bulk up. The move would add a little scale and some distribution synergies, but little else – especially since Hyundai, like Fiat, is a late arrival the electric vehicle party. Renault-Nissan would remain the more attractive partner, but it risks becoming the junior partner in any deal if the Franco-Japanese alliance cements itself first.
What’s set to be a long-running drama is unfolding against a more positive backdrop on Tuesday morning, as European markets follow Asia higher on reports that Beijing has instructed local municipalities to open the spending taps again. That’s a form of economic support that’s less likely to antagonize the U.S. than letting the yuan slip, as was feared before the weekend. The Chinese currency has been stable so far this week.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 3.1 points or 0.8% at 381.40. The U.K. FTSE was lagging, up only 0.5%, after a mixed labor market report added to fears for the economy after a sharp drop in monthly GDP in April. Germany’s Dax was up 1.3% at a four-week high, catching up on Monday’s rally after a public holiday. France’s CAC 40 was up 0.7%."

Asked if talks between the two companies were over, Elisabeth Borne told BFM TV: ""I think it is not closed.""
Borne's comments follow similar remarks by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who also said he felt a merger between France's Renault and Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) remained a ""good opportunity.""
French budget minister Gerald Darmanin said last week as well that he hoped the door had not closed on a deal.
Last week, FCA pulled out of $35 billion merger talks with Renault, with both companies blaming the French government.
France has a 15% stake in Renault and the collapse of the talks deprived the companies of an opportunity to create the world's third-biggest carmaker with 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in promised annual synergies.

FCA and Renault are still looking for ways to resuscitate their merger plan and win the approval of Renault's alliance partner Nissan, sources close to the companies have told Reuters.

(Reuters) - A surge for Frankfurt's DAX drove European stock markets higher on Tuesday as German and Swiss investors returned from a holiday extended weekend and signs of more government stimulus in China bolstered commodities markets.
Optimism over President Donald Trump's decision late on Friday to hold off on imposing import tariffs on Mexico has lifted sentiment this week, but there were signs late on Monday that the administration will make more threats to further its agenda in talks with major trading partners.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the United States could still slap tariffs on Mexico if not enough progress was made on its commitment to stem illegal immigration. 
Europe's pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.6% by 0805 GMT, with miners and auto stocks raking in the biggest gains after reports that Beijing was opening the door to more spending by local governments.
""Germany back from holiday seems to be playing catch-up, with the tariff news helping sentiment,"" said Mike van Dulken Head of Research at Accendo Markets in London.
""Over all, it's the easing in trade tensions that's playing into markets."" 
The trade-sensitive DAX rose 1%, helped by gains in car makers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AS.
Worries about the impact of tensions between the United States and China on the pace of growth in the world's major economies drove a nearly 6% fall in European stock markets in May, their worst month in more than two years.
But the uncertainty in turn has spurred hopes that U.S. interest rates will be cut as early as next week, pulling more money back into riskier investments including stocks. 
Trump said on Monday he was ready to impose another round of punitive tariffs on Chinese imports if he cannot make progress in trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit. 
""Trump is a master of keeping us on our toes and we've had similar threats before but it has been deferred,"" van Dulken said.

753,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Trafigura Profit Doubles as Oil-Trading Rebound Offsets Metals,"(Bloomberg) -- Trafigura Group Ltd. racked up a 92% gain in profit in the first half of its financial year, taking advantage of price swings in the petroleum market and a dominant position exporting crude from the U.S.
Joining peers in a strong performance, the third-biggest independent oil trader’s net income jumped to $426 million in the six months to March 31, up from $222 million a year earlier. That’s the Singapore-based company’s first profit gain for the period since 2015.
A solid performance from Trafigura’s crude oil, gasoline, wet freight and liquefied natural gas trading desks offset a weaker outing from metals and minerals, where gross profit fell by about a third.
Trafigura joins competitors including Vitol Group, Gunvor Group Ltd. as well as energy majors  BP  (LON:BP) Plc and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and the oil trading divisions of some of Wall Street’s biggest banks in posting their best start in years. Crude and products traders took advantage of a steady upward trend in prices driven by output cuts from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
The rebound follows a dismal performance in the first half of the 2018 financial year, which prompted Trafigura to implement a “radical restructuring” of its oil-trading books. After four years of chasing volume growth it reduced storage commitments, exited unprofitable term positions and halted some blending activities. The surge in first-half oil trading profit came despite a decline in volumes of about 7% to an average 5.5 million barrels a day.
Sharp Reversal
“In commodity markets that remained fiercely competitive, Trafigura prioritized profitable business over further volume growth and maintained a very robust financial position with ample access to liquidity,” Christophe Salmon, Trafigura’s chief financial officer, said in a statement.
Gross profit margins increased to 1.7% from 1.13% a year earlier. While gross profit in oil trading spiked to $1.04 billion, almost 3 1/2 times higher than a year ago, metals and minerals gross profit fell to $437 million from $680 million. That’s a sharp reversal from the first half of 2018 when strong metals profits offset the weaker oil trading performance.
Still, total debt rose to $32.7 billion at the end of its first half compared to $32.2 billion on Sept. 30. Adjusted total debt rose to $7.6 billion in the first half from $6 billion as cash and cash equivalents fell, according to the report.
The results underscore the changing fortunes of the biggest oil trading houses. Smaller rival Gunvor disclosed last week that, after suffering its worst year ever and a $330 million loss in 2018 that forced a major overhaul, it rebounded to post one of its best first quarters ever.
Nyrstar Troubles
The decline in Trafigura’s metals and minerals division comes as it’s set to take control of financially troubled zinc smelter and miner Nyrstar NV, making it the biggest trader of the metal used to galvanize steel.
Following a restructuring of Nyrstar’s debt in deals with creditors to stave off bankruptcy, Trafigura will control 98% of the company’s shares. The process should be completed by the end of September.
As part of the restructuring Trafigura has provided $250 million in bridge financing as well as a $650 million trade finance facility. However, Nyrstar disclosed in its annual report that as of May 17 it has had available liquidity of 138 million euros ($156 million).
Last week, Nyrstar declared force majeure at its Port Pirie smelter in Australia and temporarily halted production in a move that will have a “material negative” impact on production and underlying earnings in the second quarter. Nyrstar reported its biggest ever annual loss last month.
In its 2019 first-half report, Trafigura, which is Nyrstar’s biggest supplier, customer and shareholder, said it recorded a $17.3 million impairment on related to its participation in a syndicated prepayment facility with the smelter. It also wrote down the value of its equity stake in the company from before the restructuring to zero -- taking a $35 million impairment.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - New Zealand on Tuesday said it had selected  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's C-130J Super Hercules as the preferred replacement for five aging C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft, a choice in line with its closest allies. 
The cabinet will seek detailed costing information through the U.S. foreign military sale process, New Zealand Defence Minister Ron Mark said, adding the government had previously estimated the cost at more than NZ$1 billion ($659.50 million).
""After considering the range of military air transport aircraft carefully, the Super Hercules has been selected as it offers the necessary range and payload capability as well as fully meeting NZDF's requirements,"" he said in a statement referencing the New Zealand Defence Force.
""We need a proven performer, and this aircraft is tried and tested. We cannot take risks with what is one of our most critical military capabilities,"" Mark said.
A Lockheed Martin spokeswoman said her company was excited to welcome New Zealand into the family of C130-J operators. The United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, close allies of New Zealand and fellow members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, all have the planes. 
Airbus SE had proposed its A400M and Embraer SA had pitched its KC-390 to replace the country's 1960s-era Hercules transports, industry sources with knowledge of the matter said. Airbus and Embraer did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Mark said no final contract decision has been made for the C-130J on numbers, detailed costs or funding and budget implications. A business case is expected to progress to cabinet next year, he said.
New Zealand last year agreed to buy four Boeing (NYSE:BA) P-8A Poseidon planes for NZ$2.34 billion including training costs to strengthen its maritime patrol capabilities.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese companies and investors are lining up in spades to take part in Shanghai's new Nasdaq-style tech board, with a groundswell of patriotic support surging further after the U.S. blacklisting of telecom firm Huawei inflamed trade tensions.
In the two months since the application period began, 120 firms - many in industries such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and biotech - have sought permission to list, aiming to raise a combined $16 billion.
By comparison, IPOs on Shanghai's main bourse last year raised $11.7 billion while those on the Shenzhen exchange raised $8 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
On the investment side, there's been a rush to launch tech-focused mutual funds, with about 100 currently seeking approval, data from the China Securities Regulatory Commission shows. Since late May, 12 such funds targeting the new board, each with a fundraising cap of 1 billion yuan ($145 million), have been launched.
The first mainland China exchange-run board to not make profitability a listing requirement, Shanghai's Sci-tech Innovation Board was announced suddenly by President Xi Jinping in November and is widely seen as Beijing's latest move to become self-sufficient in core technologies such as chips.
Those ambitions, highlighted by the government's ""Made in China 2025"" campaign launched four years ago, have now taken on added urgency as the trade war with Washington and anxiety about its impact escalate.
""The trade war is no longer simply about China importing more soybeans, or reducing trade deficits,"" Shi Donghui, director of the Shanghai Stock Exchange's Capital Market Institute told a financial forum last month after U.S-China trade talks collapsed. 
""It's essentially a tug of war around industry supply chains and core technologies,"" he said, adding that as the two economic powers vie for tech supremacy, exchange staff were working day and night seven days a week to make the new board a success.
PATRIOTIC ENTHUSIASM
Washington's ban in May on U.S. firms doing business with Huawei without government approval highlighted gaps in China's tech prowess and has fueled patriotic enthusiasm for the board.
If the new board can foster internationally competitive technologies, ""Trump will no longer be able to choke us,"" said Zhou Xiangyong, general manager of Guotai Asset Management, a Shanghai-based mutual fund house.
""China must turn external pressure into internal drive,"" said Pan Jiang, CEO at private fund manager Shanghai V-Invest Co, which recently launched eight funds targeting the new board.
China Galaxy Securities estimates domestic mutual fund houses alone could pump more than $40 billion into the board, with about a third of that coming from new funds launching over the next six months.
In addition to allowing loss-making firms to list, the new board is doing away with paternalistic guidance from regulators on IPO pricing and timing - developments that have some bankers and investors calling it China's boldest market reform yet.
A formal launch date has not been announced but investment bankers have said they expect it to start operating either late this month or in early July. 
For Yuan Guowei, founder and CEO of big data startup Shanghai HyperS Data Technology Inc, being able to list while still loss-making is an opportunity not to be missed.
""We see U.S. companies which keep expanding aggressively despite losses. We couldn't do that in the past, as we want to go public and struggled to balance expansion and making a profit,"" he said.
Compared to the United States, stock market investment in China's tech sector has been low, in part due to stricter listing requirements around profitability.
Tech companies account for roughly 11% of total market value in China's stock markets, which are heavily weighted toward the financial sector, according to China Securities Index Co. In contrast, IT firms account for nearly 30% of the S&P 500's market capitalization, Refinitiv data shows.
(GRAPHIC: Index constituents in China vs U.S. - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QYyink)
Channeling investor money into homegrown technologies via the tech board could also help defuse U.S. criticism over the opaque shareholding structure of some Chinese firms and massive state subsidies for the tech sector, analysts said. 
Foreign investors, however, are not expected to have much initial involvement in the new board. There are as yet no plans for it to be part of the cross-border Connect scheme, while overseas investors participating in the QFII investment scheme for mainland stocks tend to buy blue-chip shares due to their limited research capabilities in China.
VENTURE CAPITAL SCRAMBLE 
The big unknown, however, is just how successful the new board will be in the long term.
China's other startup boards have mostly languished despite a wellspring of excitement in their early days. Often speculation sent prices soaring, but those prices later collapsed spectacularly, souring investor sentiment to a point from which it never recovered.
The new tech board ""is being propelled directly by China's top decision-makers, so it has to succeed. It cannot afford to fail,"" said Fu Ziheng, economist at China Fortune Securities.
""But there's a lot of uncertainty ahead....and technology innovation does not happen overnight."" 
High-profile companies planning to list on the new board include Beijing Kingsoft Office Software Inc, China's biggest provider of officer software controlled by Xiaomi Corp founder Lei Jun, as well as chip sector firm Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc.
For a factbox on some of the companies planning to list please click.
Excitement surrounding prospective candidates is so high that venture capitalists interested in pre-IPO financing say they need to move quickly on due diligence or lose out to the competition, particularly in strategic industries such as chips.

""When companies conduct pre-IPO financing, you may have to make decisions in 1-2 weeks, which is very demanding for the investment team. Previously, such decisions were made over 1-2 months,"" said Feng Sicheng, an investment manager at private equity firm GP Capital who specializes in the chip sector.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd will need more time to become the world's largest smartphone maker, a goal it originally aimed to achieve in the fourth quarter of this year, a senior executive said on Tuesday.
""We would have become the largest in the fourth quarter (of this year) but now we feel that this process may take longer,"" said Shao Yang, chief strategy officer of Huawei Consumer Business Group, without elaborating on reasons.
Huawei currently sells 500,000 to 600,000 smartphones a day, he said in a speech at the CES Asia technology show in Shanghai.
The comments come after the United States put Huawei on a blacklist last month that barred it from doing business with U.S. companies on security grounds without government approval, prompting some global tech companies to cut ties with the world's largest telecommunication equipment maker.
The company in January said it could become the world's biggest-selling smartphone vendor this year even without the U.S. market. It was the second-biggest vendor in the first quarter, behind South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.

Analysts estimate the recent U.S. sanctions could push Huawei's smartphone shipments down as much as a quarter this year and cause its handsets to disappear from overseas markets.

763,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 11:10PM ET</span>",Maybe Carlos Ghosn Wasn't So Bad After All,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Is the Renault-Nissan Alliance stronger than the man who led it for two decades?
The omens don’t look good. The downfall of Carlos Ghosn over allegations of financial misconduct has opened up a Pandora’s Box of Franco-Japanese political hostility, grudges and pressure tactics – supposedly all in the name of “strengthening” the 20-year alliance. For all Ghosn’s flaws and delusions of grandeur, he did manage to balance the interests of two prickly G7 economies in the highly sensitive auto sector (at least until he came a cropper). His successors will do well to last a fraction as long.
On the French side,  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s chairman Jean-Dominique Senard was parachuted in to rescue relations with Nissan Motor Corp Ltd. after Ghosn’s arrest. But he’s failing to live up to his billing as a veteran captain of industry and diplomat’s son. First he tried to rush his Japanese counterparts into accepting a full Renault-Nissan merger. Then he tried and failed to get Nissan’s blessing for a tie-up with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, an embarrassment for the French president Emmanuel Macron. Not a great start.
Having failed to win the Japanese around with blandishments, an increasingly desperate-looking Senard has reached for the stick. He’s now threatening to use Renault’s 43% stake in Nissan to block the latter’s attempt to shake up its corporate governance. This looks like more of a tactical play than any genuine desire to stall much-needed reforms at the Japanese carmaker, which is only now waking up to the need for separate remuneration, audit and nomination committees. But that won’t make it any more palatable to Tokyo.
Optically, it looks a lot like a Renault attempt to get more control over the new committees. Even if it works in forcing Nissan to the negotiating table to sort out other issues, it’s a mightily clumsy about-turn for a chairman who said in April that the Japanese would not respond well to “humiliation” tactics.
Still, Ghosn’s replacement at Nissan, CEO Hiroto Saikawa, is hardly covering himself in glory. Like Senard, he seems incapable of wielding power without looking weak. Nissan owns just 15% of Renault, so it’s at a disadvantage in terms of shareholdings. But if Saikawa was trying to take back control with his ousting of Ghosn and the governance changes, the limits have been laid bare this week.
Nissan will have an incredibly tough time pushing these reforms through without Renault’s support, a painful reminder of Saikawa’s constraints. The Japanese carmaker’s poor financial performance isn’t helping. Former Nissan executive Greg Kelly is also ratcheting up the pressure by accusing Saikawa of approving Ghosn’s pay structure.
Only now do we realize Ghosn’s skill – and maybe his good fortune – when it came to balancing the needs of two countries with a history of national pride and state interference in industry. Renault has a very big stake in Nissan, yes, but not majority control. In retrospect it’s remarkable that Ghosn was able to push a sickly Nissan into adopting truly revolutionary changes after the creation of the alliance: An end to cozy deals with historical suppliers, massive job cuts, and the ceding of control to non-Japanese executives.
To be fair to Senard and Saikawa, Ghosn’s personal empire-building and his ability to hoover up all the top jobs probably helped – at one point he was running Renault and Nissan simultaneously, as well as their alliance. Arguably too much power was concentrated in the hands of one man. But he’s clearly left a void, which has been filled by squabbling. 
In response to Parisian meddling, Nissan has woken up to its own ability to pressure the French even with a smaller stake. These power games are very risky for both firms given the economic benefits offered by the alliance, something that’s doubly important now that the auto industry is facing the epochal challenge of the death of the combustion engine and the possible decline of car ownership.
Bankers are still confident that the partnership will survive. But the distrust that is setting in, as well as the lack of leadership, portends a long-term weakening."
764,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 10:38PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Rise, Chinese Markets Surge on Government Funding Support","Investing.com - Asian markets rose in morning trade on Tuesday, with Chinese stocks outperforming their regional peers on reports of government funding support for major investment projects.
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both jumped 1.9% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.8%.
The gains came after state-owned news agency Xinhua cited a cabinet document and said local governments should use proceeds from special bonds to invest in major projects including highways, gas and power supply and railways.
That would help “increase effective investment, improve economic structure, stabilise aggregate demand and maintain sustained and healthy economic development”, Xinhua said.
“On the basis of increasing the size of special bonds by a big margin, we should strengthen macro-policy coordination and maintain reasonable and sufficient market liquidity.”
China Railway (HK:0390) soared nearly 7% following the report, while  China Railway Construction  (HK:1186) and China Communications Construction (HK:1800) jumped 6% and 5% respectively.
On the Sino-U.S. trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump said China is “going to make a deal because they’re going to have to make a deal.”
“The China deal is going to work out. You know why? Because of tariffs,” Trump told CNBC in an interview. “Right now, China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don’t want to pay the tariffs.”
Separately, the President told reporters at the White House that Washington would slap more tariffs on Chinese goods if his Chinese counter Xi Jinping does not attend the upcoming G-20 meeting.
“We’ve never gotten 10 cents from China and now we’re getting a lot of money from China,” the President said.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 10:37PM ET</span>",Buyout firm Apollo Global agrees to acquire Shutterfly,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC said on Monday it had agreed to acquire U.S. digital imaging company Shutterfly Inc for $2.7 billion, including the company's $900 million debt.
The deal, first reported by Reuters on Monday, is the culmination of several years of private equity interest in Shutterfly, which allows customers to make photo books, cards and gifts from their photos. 
Its business has become increasingly commoditized and competitive, forcing it to explore a sale.
Apollo said it would pay $51 per share in cash for Shutterfly, a 13% premium to the company's value on Feb. 5, the last trading day before it announced it would explore a sale.
Apollo also announced it would acquire privately held Snapfish LLC, a small internet-based retailer of photography products, to merge it with Shutterfly.
Headquartered in Redwood City, California, Shutterfly makes personalized consumer photo products such as photo books, holiday cards, invitations and stationary. 
Founded in 1999, Shutterfly faces increasing competition from other online digital photography services companies such as Snapfish and Vistaprint, as well as brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT), that offer low-cost digital photography products and services.
Shutterfly was approached by several buyout firms over the years about a deal, including by Thomas H. Lee in 2016 and Silver Lake Partners LP in 2014, Reuters has previously reported.
In February, Shutterfly said its board had formed a committee to explore its options with the help of investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) after receiving acquisition interest from an undisclosed party. The company also announced that its Chief Executive Christopher North would leave the company in August.

Shutterfly last year acquired privately held Lifetouch, which helps schools and families shoot professional photos, for $825 million in cash.

766,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>","Foxconn Names iPhone Czar, CFO to Terry Gou's Inner Circle","(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. will appoint its group finance chief and the overseer of the world’s largest iPhone production base to a newly created operations committee, anointing potential successors to billionaire founder Terry Gou.
Hon Hai, the largest listed arm of Foxconn Technology Group, is establishing a body of nine executives who will represent its top decision-making unit after the board, the company said in exchange filings, confirming a previous report from Bloomberg News. They include Foxconn Chief Financial Officer Huang Chiu-lian and Lin Zheng-hui -- known also as Lin Cheng-hui -- who heads the company’s enormous iPhone-making facility in central China’s Zhengzhou. The group will rule on major business matters, a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the appointments aren’t public.
Lin and Huang are among a cadre of executives tipped to take the reins of the world’s largest contract manufacturer from Gou, who is trying to win a party nomination to compete in the 2020 Taiwanese presidential elections. Gou, who built the company from a maker of TV knobs into a global powerhouse in consumer electronics, is expected to step back from Foxconn’s day-to-day operations to focus on his political endeavors. Other committee members include Chiang Chih-siung, who oversees some of Foxconn’s non-iPhone Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) businesses, and semiconductor division chief Young Liu.
The 68-year-old billionaire, who has said he plans to quit as Hon Hai chairman after shareholders elect a new board in June, is shifting his focus just as his company grapples with the unprecedented uncertainty of U.S.-Chinese tensions.
That escalating trade spat is hurting consumer sentiment and raising fears about the impact on Foxconn’s plants, most of which are located in the world’s No. 2 economy. Washington is threatening to hit Beijing with new tariffs on about $300 billion worth of Chinese goods including phones and laptops, directly affecting the company’s business with a swathe of the world’s major electronics brands. Beijing has in turn shown a growing willingness to retaliate against American names.
Foxconn straddles the world’s two largest economies because it manufactures most of its devices in China, many of which then find their way to American consumers. In its exchange filings, the company said it will localize some of its manufacturing across production bases covering 16 countries from Japan and Mexico to the U.S. and India. It didn’t elaborate on specific plans.
Gou’s company wields unusual influence for an Asian company in the U.S. When President Donald Trump called for more investment in local manufacturing, Gou was among the first to heed the call, agreeing to build a 13,000-worker facility in Wisconsin in exchange for more than $4.5 billion in government incentives. Hailed by Trump as “one of the great deals ever,” the project has since come under criticism for low-paying jobs, sudden dismissals and ever-changing goals. Foxconn says the plant is on track to begin producing LCDs next year.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 08:05PM ET</span>","Uber's European rival Bolt enters London market, again","By Tarmo Virki
TALLINN (Reuters) - Estonia's Bolt, which until early 2019 was called Taxify, will on Tuesday re-enter the competitive London taxi market, promising cheaper rides to passengers and a better cut to drivers than its bigger global rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
The move comes a month after Uber drivers in London joined a series of strikes to protest the disparity between gig-economy conditions and the massive $82 billion valuation at Uber's stock market debut.
""Uber is basically a monopoly. At the same time, an average Uber driver makes less than minimum wage,"" Bolt founder Markus Villig told Reuters.
Uber takes around 25% cut from drivers using its app. Bolt promises to charge in London in first two months just 7.5% and later 15%, arguing happier drivers provide a better service. 
Bolt, which has grabbed business from Uber in Central and Eastern Europe and major African cities, counts more than 25 million clients in 30 countries where it operates.
Bolt's first attempt to enter the London market was stopped by transport regulators who denied it a license in 2017.
Bolt rebranded earlier in 2019 to ensure the ride-hailing service is not confused for taxis and to represent its widening offering - it has launched motorcycle services in Africa and scooter rentals in selected cities - but these are still small.
""The numbers, when compared to cars, are still negligible,"" Villig said. 

Bolt last year raised $175 million in funding from a group led by German automaker Daimler to help its battle against Uber.

768,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 07:00PM ET</span>",This Chinese Newspaper Editor Is Moving Markets With His Tweets,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for Next China, a weekly email on where the nation stands now and where it's going next.
Investors anxious to know how China’s opaque government is prosecuting the trade war are paying close attention to an unlikely source: the editor of one of the country’s most combative state-run newspapers.
In recent weeks, Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin has used his Twitter feed to accurately forecast several Chinese moves, from an investigation into FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).’s failure to deliver packages from Huawei Technologies Co. to the government’s warning to students studying in the U.S. Markets have taken notice, sending Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. to its lowest close in four months after one tweet.
Yet Hu acknowledges that he occupies an ambiguous space in the Communist Party’s efforts to communicate its plans to the world.
“I have access to some information for the nature of my job, but I’m not authorized by anyone to release it,” Hu said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Beijing last week. “I’m not sure if Chinese officials are deliberately passing on information to me. The officials and I have a tacit understanding.”
Hu’s emergence as a key policy oracle for the world’s second-largest economy highlights the gulf between the communication strategies used by President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Whereas the U.S. leader revels in spontaneous communication via Twitter -- using the platform to announce his latest tariff gambit last month -- Xi promulgates his plans through bureaucrats, white papers and jargon-laden speeches.
That’s boosted demand for someone like Hu, who’s among a handful of prominent Chinese figures who comment on topics usually handled with extreme sensitivity by state agencies and propaganda organs. Hu’s Twitter followers more than doubled to 48,400 over the past month as tensions escalated.
Larry McDonald, the founder of investment newsletter Bear Traps Report, described the feed as a “Chinese Communist version of Trump’s Twitter.”
“A lot of fund managers and investors we know are watching Hu’s Twitter account closely, as it provides key information about China’s stance on the trade war and other issues,” McDonald said. “Hu’s Twitter is seen as China’s way to fight back. It is a negotiation tactic by the Chinese Communist Party.”
Hu’s Twitter feed echoes the tone of the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the party’s People’s Daily that serves up English-language articles and commentary to counter the Western-dominated narrative about China. He has run the paper since 2005 and joined Twitter in 2014, a time when propaganda outlets were accelerating their use of social media including U.S.-based sites blocked in China.
Also like the pages of the Global Times, Hu’s tweets are peppered with defenses of China’s human rights practices and boasts about the country’s rise. He took a similar line in discussions with Bloomberg last Wednesday, saying the country’s economy would continue to grow despite the trade war: “The loss is bearable for China. Time is on our side.”
But it’s been Hu’s predictions about specific Chinese countermeasures that have drawn the most interest, especially after Trump’s May 5 tweet accusing Beijing of trying “to renegotiate” and threatening a new round of tariffs. Later that week, Hu tweeted that the chances of a deal by Trump’s deadline were zero, citing someone “from the China side who knows the trade talks well.”
Then, after the last round of talks failed to avert the tariff hike, Hu began to share ominous hints about China’s next moves. On May 13 -- just as U.S. markets were about to reopen after the weekend -- he tweeted that China might stop purchasing American agricultural products and energy supplies, saying local academics were also “discussing the possibility of dumping” some of the country’s $1.12 trillion stockpile of U.S. treasuries.
In the interview Wednesday, Hu said China “may take some measures” against imports of U.S. services, a growth area for the American side, if Trump goes ahead and levies tariffs on all imports of Chinese goods. He also warned about “collateral damage” to companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). or Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. if the trade conflict continues to escalate.
While some of Hu’s reports -- such as a May 11 tweet saying the two sides had agreed “to meet again in Beijing in the future” -- haven’t yet panned out, others have been quickly confirmed by official action. On June 3, he predicted that China would issue a warning about the risk of visa issues to its 360,000 students studying in the U.S. -- forecasting a statement issued hours later by the Education Ministry.
How closely Hu’s message conforms to the official point of view remains unclear, although he sometimes cites an “authoritative source” or people “close to the negotiations.” Hu suggested that he, like many in China’s heavily censored media environment, operates within boundaries that are defined largely by what you get away with.
“My background carries a certain amount of authority, but I also speak on issues that other state media keep quiet about,” Hu told Bloomberg. “I was appointed by the People’s Daily. The authorities have absolute control over me and can take me down easily.”
One detail to watch: Hu said tweets that are “based on what I know” are “definitely true.” He used that or similar phrases in his posts about FedEx, the student warnings and China’s move to create a blacklist of foreign companies.
China has distanced itself from Hu tweets when asked by reporters at the foreign ministry’s regular news briefings. “As a general rule, we do not respond to the opinions or comments of experts, scholars, media and think tanks,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said May 14 in response to a query about Hu’s Boeing tweet.
Chinese authorities likely view the editor as a useful conduit to an overseas audience, similar to English-language state media services such as the China Daily newspaper and the China Global Television Network. Tellingly, Hu doesn’t share his predictions of official action with his much bigger fan base of 19 million followers on the largely Chinese-language social media platform Weibo.
Hu said he wants to explain China’s intentions, not influence share prices.
“Now, since people said my tweet has moved the market, I will be more cautious,” he said. “If my tweets create collateral damage and cause losses for U.S. investors, that’s not what I want. My biggest hope is to express things more freely.”

He declined to name the companies involved. ""These companies are publicly traded, there are competition issues, we cannot announce them yet"", he said.
Brazil's Senate passed legislation on May 22 that would permanently open up Latin America's largest air travel market after years of debate. The measure still needs to be signed by Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro. 
Brazil's domestic air market is dominated by three main players who control over 90 percent of flights: Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, LATAM Airlines Group and Azul SA.

Spain's Air Europa, which was the first foreign airline to be granted a preliminary authorization to set up a domestic subsidiary in the country, is expected to launch domestic flights in late 2019, according to Freitas.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 05:46PM ET</span>",Salesforce bets on big data with $15.3 billion Tableau buy,"By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) agreed on Monday to buy big data firm Tableau Software Inc for $15.3 billion, adding muscle in its fight with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) for a bigger share of the market that helps businesses target customers with tools to analyze and visualize data.
The business of analyzing data is fast becoming a battleground, with tech behemoths Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) scaling up their presence in the market to take on established players like Microsoft and Tableau.
""The deal is transformative for the software industry, the most dramatic move yet by a cloud major to boost its analytics offerings,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said.
Salesforce's customer relationship management software will benefit from using Tableau's large data analytics in unraveling hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends and customer preferences.
Tableau's software is used to create interactive, visual dashboards and graphics used by businesses, universities and governments to analyze data ranging from corporate finances to baseball statistics.
Salesforce's biggest deal ever comes days after Google bought big-data analytics company Looker for $2.6 billion. It surpasses the $5.9 billion that Salesforce paid to buy U.S. software maker MuleSoft in 2018.
In 2016, Reuters had reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tableausoftware-m-a-salesforce/salesforce-target-tableau-explored-sale-earlier-this-year-sources-idUSKCN12J2HA that Seattle-based Tableau was one of the companies in a leaked list of potential acquisition targets for Salesforce and that Tableau was working with an investment bank to explore a sale.
Tableau has more than 86,000 customers, including tech heavyweights such as  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
""The acquisition accelerates Salesforce's roadmap for (its) Customer 360 initiative, which helps companies gain a complete view of their customers, and more broadly their analytics initiative,"" Koenig said.
Tableau shareholders will get 1.103 Salesforce shares for each Tableau share in the all-stock deal, valuing the offer at $177.88 per share as of Friday's close, a 42% percent premium as of that time.
Shares of Tableau jumped 38% to touch a record high of $173.09, while those of Salesforce fell nearly 6% in afternoon trading.
Brian White, analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co, said he believed the share drop would be short-lived, given Salesforce's capitalization on major tech trends of subscription and cloud services.
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, after which Tableau will operate independently, led by Chief Executive Officer Adam Selipsky and its current leadership team.
The San Francisco-based company said the deal is likely to add up to $400 million in its 2020 revenue, but would decrease adjusted profit by 37 cents to 39 cents per share.
Salesforce said it now expects 2020 adjusted profit in the range of $2.51 per share to $2.53 per share. Analysts were expecting $2.90 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) was the financial adviser to Salesforce and Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC advised Tableau.

Trump said his proposed 5% tariff on all Mexican imports, which were due to come into effect today, would not go ahead after both nations reached an agreement on ways to curb the influx of migrants trying to make it across the southern border and into the United States.
Shares of automakers rallied, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) rising 1.47%, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) up 0.61% and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) rising 1.70%.
The gains in autos helped pare some losses from a week earlier, when fears intensified that levies on Mexico would increase input costs and hurt margins as all cars, even those assembled in American plants, use parts imported from Mexico.
Macquarie last week warned that margins were so thin in the U.S. market that it was unlikely any automaker would not pass on these tariffs to their customers.
The Center For Automotive Research had predicted that if Trump had carried out his threat to gradually increase tariffs on Mexico 25%, the price of a new car assembled in the U.S. would rise by at least $1,100."

The S&P 500 finished up 0.47%. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.05% and the Dow was up 0.30%.
If there was a downside to the day's gains, it was that the major averages pulled back noticeably from their highs of the day. The S&P 500 had been up nearly 16 points before dropping back to a 13.3-point gain. The Nasdaq's 153-point gain slid to 81 points, and the Dow's 227-point gain fell nearly two thirds to just under 79 points.
Profit-taking was a part of the pullback. The S&P had been up as much as 7.6% at Monday's high from its June 3 close, the day before the uptick began. But there was probably some market unease that the Trump Administration's gaining Mexico's promise to limit illegal immigration wasn't quite as dramatic as claimed. In addition, the president complained on Monday that the Federal Reserve was too independent and that interest rates were too high.
Bond yields did rise slightly from Friday. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.143% from Friday's 2.084%. The yield is still, however, off more than 20% in 2019. And crude oil prices fell on worries that markets could see a glut this summer. WTI futures fell 73 cents to $53.26. Brent futures dropped $1 to $62.29.
Technology shares were among the day's biggest winners. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had solid days. Microsoft hit a 52-week high of $134.08 during the session, The shares finished up 0.91% and a market capitalization above $1 trillion for a second day in a row. (For those counting, it was $1.016 trillion.)
Only eight of the 30 Dow stocks were lower, with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) off 3.1% after agreeing to acquire Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) in an all-stock deal that would create the second-largest defense contractor after Boeing (NYSE:BA). Nearly 320 of the stocks in the S&P 500 were higher, along with 81 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index. The index was up 1.1% on the day.
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) shares tumbled after the company said it was buying Seattle-based  Tableau Software  (NYSE:DATA) in a $15.7 billion all-stock deal. Tableau, which makes visualization software, jumped 33.7%.

776,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 04:50PM ET</span>",Fiserv Sells $9 Billion of Bonds in First Data Deal's U.S. Leg,"(Bloomberg) --  Fiserv Inc  (NASDAQ:FISV). sold $9 billion of bonds as part of a cross-Atlantic sale to help finance its acquisition of First Data Corp.
The payment processing company’s dollar debt sale came in four parts. The longest portion, a 30-year security, yields 1.82 percentage points above Treasuries, after initial talk at around 2 percentage points, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.
Fiserv is looking at also selling bonds in euros and pounds, with total proceeds expected to be around $12 billion. The company is holding meetings with investors across Europe Tuesday through Thursday.
Such a split would resemble last month’s debt sale from Fidelity National Information Services Inc., a Fiserv competitor that borrowed $8.2 billion between euro, sterling and dollar portions. Fidelity National Information Services expressed a clear preference for European markets in the financing, which was used to help fund its acquisition of Worldpay Inc.
Fidelity National’s euro bonds have risen substantially in the secondary market since being sold on May 14, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

U.S. companies are leading euro non-financial corporate bond sales this year, as comparatively low borrowing costs lure issuers back across the Atlantic. Fidelity National, along with companies like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and medical-device makers Becton Dickinson & Co. have helped to lift total reverse Yankee issuance this year to about 40 billion euros ($45 billion) -- or more than all of 2018.
The primary market for corporate debt has come back to life in recent days, and the Fiserv deal could be the largest offering since International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp.’s $20 billion sale in May. Uncertainties around trade wars and how that might affect monetary policy still remain, but risk sentiment has improved, enticing borrowers.
“We think the bond deal will do well given strong secular trends, minimal exposure to US-China trade tensions, and improved conditions in the IG primary market,” CreditSights analyst Jordan Chalfin said in a report Monday.
Fiserv agreed to buy First Data in January for $22 billion, taking out a $17 billion bridge loan to help pay for the acquisition and refinance First Data’s debt. That will take the combined company’s total debt to around $24 billion, making it one of the top 10 technology issuers in the investment-grade market once the acquisition closes in the second half of this year, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Rob Schiffman and Mike Campellone said in a report last month.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. managed the bond sale."
777,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 04:44PM ET</span>",Pentagon gets 8.8% discount in $34 billion F-35 jet deal,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense has a ""handshake"" agreement with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co to cut 8.8 percent from the price of its latest order of F-35A fighter jet, shaving a year from the time frame in which each aircraft will cost less than $80 million, a Pentagon official said on Monday.
The Pentagon said over three years the agreement will be worth $34 billion for 478 F-35 fighter jets. It is preliminary and a final deal is expected to be sealed in August for the 12th batch of jets, one of the most expensive aircraft ever produced. 
The preliminary agreement details the first year, and lays out agreed upon options for two additional years. The options are there because official purchases cannot be made until the U.S. Congress approves an annual budget for those years.
This year's agreement will lower the cost of each F-35A, the most common version of the aircraft, to $81.35 million, Under Secretary of Defense Ellen Lord said, down from $89.2 million under a deal inked in August 2018.
Under the options covering the second and third years of the purchase, the price of each jet will drop below $80 million, Lord said. In those later years production would be around 160 jets per year.
The F-35 program has long aimed at growing the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bringing the unit price of the F-35A below $80 million through efficiencies gained by ordering larger quantifies.
""I am proud to state that this agreement has achieved an estimated 8.8% savings from Lot 11 to Lot 12 F-35A's, and an estimated average of 15%"" reduction across all variants from Lot 11 to Lot 14, Lord said in the statement. That savings exceeded expectations in a RAND Corp study.
""The unit price for all three F-35 variants was reduced and the agreement will include an F-35A unit cost below $80 million in Lot 13, exceeding the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin’s long-standing cost reduction commitment earlier than planned,"" the Lockheed Martin F-35 program general manager Greg Ulmer said in a statement. 
While being a major part of Lockheed's revenue, the F-35 has recently been holding competitions to find less expensive subcontractors to help control costs. 
The new pricing could encourage more foreign customers to join the F-35 program. Lockheed executives have said that any country with an F-16 jet, the predecessor to the F-35, is a potential customer. This could put the market size at about 4000 jets, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson recently told an investor conference. 
Vice Admiral Mathias Winter, the head of the Pentagon's F-35 office, has testified to Congress, that ""future potential foreign military sales customers include Singapore, Greece, Romania, Spain and Poland.""
Foreign military sales like those of the F-35 are considered government-to-government deals where the Pentagon acts as an intermediary between the defense contractor and a foreign government. 

Other U.S. allies have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 04:33PM ET</span>","U.S. senators target $1 billion a year coal subsidy, ask IRS for test results","By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators on Monday urged the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on a $1 billion-a-year subsidy for burning chemically treated refined coal, after a new study showed some power plants using the fuel produced surging amounts of mercury and smog instead of cutting pollution.
Scrutiny from Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse, as well as fellow U.S. Senate Democrats Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, comes after a Reuters special report in December revealed that many power plants burning refined coal pumped out more smog, not less. 
Companies can qualify for the subsidy by showing pollution cuts in lab tests. Pending legislation in the Senate would extend the coal subsidy program another decade, costing taxpayers at least $10 billion at current consumption levels. 
“We have evidence to show that Wall Street is raking in hundreds of millions in tax credits each year for pollution reductions they aren’t coming close to delivering in the real world,"" Whitehouse said in a statement. ""That's a massive boondoggle for taxpayers, a blow to air quality and Americans' health, and a setback for our climate.”
The refined coal subsidy was adopted by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, alongside credits for generating renewable energy from solar and wind. The legislation had broad bipartisan support and generated little public debate.
Beneficiaries of the subsidy include the energy unit of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, DTE Energy Co, Fidelity Investments,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) Inc and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) NV, U.S. regulatory filings show. The use of refined coal has increased in recent years, accounting for about 20 percent of U.S. coal consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The IRS, which oversees the tax credit program, allows large companies to qualify for the tax credits by burning relatively small amounts of refined coal during one-day tests in a laboratory in lieu of real-world testing at power plants. The agency did not return a message seeking comment. 
The senators have written a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig asking him to provide data by June 14 that shows burning refined coal under real-world conditions generates the pollution cuts required to qualify for the tax credit. They also are seeking evidence that lab results are a reliable measure of pollution at actual power plants, according the letter.
The senators cited a study by independent non-profit Resources for the Future, which found that power plants using refined coal were not reducing mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide pollution to levels required by the tax credit program. Those pollutants rose sharply at some power plants after they began burning refined coal, the study said. Others showed reductions, but not enough to meet the requirements for taxpayer subsidies, the study said.
The Washington, D.C. research institution became interested in the tax credit program after the Reuters three-part special report. 
""Using data on actual operations, we find that in practice plants achieve negligible reductions in (sulfur dioxide) emissions, and the reductions in NOx and (mercury) amount to about half (or less) of the reductions required,"" according to the nonprofit's study. ""We find no evidence that any particular plant is achieving the reduction targets required by the tax statute, and significant evidence that on average they are not.""
At one unnamed plant, the study said mercury and nitrogen oxide pollution climbed nearly 60 percent and 10 percent, respectively. 
To take advantage of the tax credit program, which expires in 2021, large companies have invested in small facilities that use chemicals to treat raw coal, which is then burned in power plants throughout the United States, U.S. regulatory filings show. 
""As the program is currently being run, we feel it is a waste of money,"" said Alan Krupnick, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future. He is co-author of the study with Brian Prest, an economist at the nonprofit. ""We were surprised that the standards for proving that you deserve the tax credit did not involve looking at emissions in the field. You could prove it by tests in a laboratory.""
IRS guidelines allow for field tests at power plants, but the duration can be as short as a few hours, and many tax credit investors opt for lab testing.
Meanwhile, lawmakers, including Republican Senator John Hoeven of coal-producing North Dakota, have introduced legislation to extend the tax credit another 10 years. They argue it helps the environment, extends the life of the ailing coal industry – a centerpiece of the Trump administration’s energy policy – and reduces power prices by giving utilities a cheap, subsidized source of coal.
The Reuters special report found that much of the lab testing happens in Hoeven's home state at the University of North Dakota's Energy and Environmental Research Center. In fiscal 2015-16, for example, the lab reported earning about $5 million performing tests that help companies qualify for the subsidy. 
The IRS requires certified results that show burning refined coal cuts either mercury and sulfur dioxide pollution by at least 40 percent and nitrogen oxide by at least 20 percent. Certified results from a lab unlock a tax credit of $7.17 for each ton of refined coal burned at a power plant. 
Global insurance brokerage Arthur J. Gallagher & Co has recognized several hundred million dollars in tax credits as the top developer of refined coal facilities, financial statements show.

779,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 04:21PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - The market finds itself in a rare position this week: everything seems to be settled.
Whether you believe President Donald Trump’s claims that an unprecedented deal on trade and migration enforcement was struck with Mexico or the published reports that all the terms of the deal were already agreed before Trump’s ultimatum, Mexican tariffs are now off the table.
There is a very light economic calendar, with the highlights being the latest numbers on wholesale and retail inflation. But those are highly unlikely to be far enough away from consensus to sway the thinking on interest rates.
Right now the fed funds futures market seems firmly convinced that the FOMC won’t cut after its June meeting, but there an 80% chance it will in July, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
And there are just a few companies on the earnings calendar this week.
That leaves the vagaries of what the president might say or tweet as the wild card and investors will be watching closely.
But don’t forget the oil market, also tied to geopolitics and currently immersed in a push and pull between Saudi Arabia and Russia on output cuts.
Here are the three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. Wholesale Inflation on Tap
Wholesale inflation figures arrive as traders continue to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut rates sooner rather later as inflation continues to lag the central bank's 2% target.
The Labor Department will issue the February producer price index (PPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). On average, economists expect that the PPI rose 0.1% last month with the core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rising 0.2%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would bring year-over-year PPI growth to 2% and core PPI growth up 2.3%.
The PPI is considered a leading indicator, measuring the input prices for goods sold at a retail level.
2. U.S. Crude Stockpiles to Continue to Build?
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data could add to crude's sluggish start to the week if investors have to contend with further signs that U.S. supply continues to outstrip demand.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last week that domestic crude inventories rose by 3.545 million barrels.
Crude prices fell on the day. Crude Oil WTI Futures settled down 73 to $53.26 a barrel on Monday, as investors weighed the prospect of OPEC and its allies extending their production-cut agreement against ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions that many fear could hurt oil demand.
Strategists at JBC Energy have suggested the backdrop for crude has turned slightly positive this week thanks to President Donald Trump calling off tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, Saudi officials hinting at an extension to OPEC's production cut and data last week showing a decline in the U.S. rig count.
3. Tesla to Regain Feel Good Factor as Musk Takes Center Stage?
It's no secret that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had a challenging start to the year. Its shares are about 35% down so far this year. But Tesla's rise of nearly 15% this month (including a 4.1% gain on Monday) suggests traders are betting that CEO Elon Musk can bring back the feel-good factor as he takes to the stage at the company's annual general meeting Tuesday.
Tesla’s annual meeting is scheduled for Tuesday in Mountain View, Calif. at 5:30 PM ET (21:30 GMT).
Ahead of the meeting, investor optimism is growing that deliveries are set to rebound in the second quarter following a leaked Musk email that hinted at the company potentially exceeding its record deliveries in Q4 2018, when it delivered more than 90,000 vehicles.
""Tesla appears to be on track to meet volume guidance (based on leaked delivery numbers) and we think shares will move higher if the company achieves its targets,"" Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in a note. “We continue to believe demand concerns are overblown, and we …remain buyers at current levels.”"

782,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 03:52PM ET</span>","Trump says United Tech, Raytheon deal may hurt competition","By Makini Brice and Doina Chiacu
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gave mixed signals Monday as to whether he believed the $121 billion merger of defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co and United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) should go forward, while the Pentagon indicated it would take a hard look at the deal.
The merger, announced Sunday and expected to close in the first half of 2020, would potentially upend the aerospace sector, creating a conglomerate spanning commercial aviation and defense procurement. The Pentagon would be one of the new company's largest customers. 
""I want to see that we don't hurt our competition,"" Trump said in an interview with CNBC. ""I hope the Raytheon deal, I hope it can happen. But I don't want to see where we have one less person that can compete for an order.""
""When I hear they're merging, does that take away more competition?"" Trump said. ""It becomes one big, fat, beautiful company, but I have to negotiate, meaning the United States has to buy things, and does that make it less competitive? Because ... it's already non-competitive.""
Shares of Raytheon were up 0.9% in late trading while United Technologies was down 2.7%.
Pentagon leadership has begun assessing the deal, a Defense Department official said.
""Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord is engaging with industry leadership to understand the implications and governance as a result of this acquisition,"" the statement said. Lord is the chief weapons buyer for the Pentagon.
The statement went on to say that it was working ""to provide the best capabilities our warfighters deserve, at the greatest value to the taxpayer.""
United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes said he saw very few regulatory hurdles for the proposed merger. Asked about Trump's views on the deal, he said he would talk to the president later on Monday.
The deal will be reviewed by either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that it complies with antitrust law.
The companies, despite their broad range of products, do not overlap in many markets. United Technologies provides plane makers with electronics, communications and other equipment, while Raytheon primarily supplies the U.S. government with military aircraft and missile equipment.
Because of this, they will likely propose a package of asset sales to resolve regulatory concerns about loss of direct competition in the few areas where they do overlap, according to two antitrust experts who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The Defense Department and big customers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) will have a lot of clout in the antitrust review, and may worry about over-reliance on one company for a big suite of products.
""One firm will now own the engine and the radar and some other capabilities on a platform like the F-35, and what the implications of that are for customers – that may be reviewed as well,"" said Jeff Bialos, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland LLP and a former deputy under secretary of defense for industrial affairs.
Executives at big defense contractors are analyzing how the deal would affect their costs, one executive said on condition of anonymity. Boeing has already said that it was looking at the proposed deal.
In Northrop Grumman's purchase of Orbital ATK last year, the FTC noted in a statement accompanying the approval that it worked closely with the Defense Department on the review, and had the department appoint someone to oversee compliance of the consent decree.
One potential snag is that Patrick Shanahan, a former  Boeing Co  executive, is now acting secretary of defense. He has recused himself from dealings involving Boeing, which uses United Technologies products such as engines from its Pratt & Whitney engines division.

This could complicate Boeing's position if it opposes the merger, the unidentified industry executive said, noting that lower level Department of Defense officials with potentially less clout would have to review the deal.

Microsoft announced that its new Xbox, dubbed ""Project Scarlett"" for the time being, would be powered by custom-designed processor made by AMD.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged nearly 5% and was just below session highs of $34.30. It's set for its highest close since May 2006.
The announcement comes as Wall Street continued to praise AMD, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lifting its price target on the chipmaker on expectations the upcoming console refresh would prove more profitable than the previous one.
The bank said the news implies ""solid"" 2020 estimates for the semi-custom and console businesses and the ""potential for better pricing and margins than prior (2013) console refresh.""
Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating on AMD and raised its price target on stock to $40 from $35.
Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said that while the news had been expected, it should still be considered a positive as it reinforces AMD's positioning in the high-end processor and graphics market for game consolers.
AMD's ongoing momentum, partly bolstered by rival Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) chip-shortage woes, has seen its share price jump 84% year to date, assuming today's gains hold. That's forced even some of naysayers on Wall Street to change their tunes on the stock. The chipmaker has been scooping up new business at the lower end of market, providing chips to manufacturers who haven't been able to source them from Intel.
Morgan Stanley last week upgraded AMD stock to equal weight and conceded that its previously cautious outlook on Advanced Micro Devices stock had been the ""wrong call."" They're not alone. The average 12-month target price on the stock among 34 AMD analysts polled by Investing.com was $29.97 Monday afternoon."

792,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: How the door slammed shut at British money manager Woodford's fund,"LONDON (Reuters) - British money manager Neil Woodford has barred investors from taking cash out of his flagship fund, sparking client anger and spurring the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to examine what is a highly unusual move for a UK retail-focused equity fund.
Since Woodford's 3.7 billion pound ($4.7 billion) LF Woodford Equity Income Fund suspended withdrawals on June 3, the share price of his listed fund has dropped, along with the value of shares of many of his biggest fund holdings.
WHAT CAN INVESTORS DO?
The short answer is nothing for now. Their money remains invested in the LF Woodford Equity Income Fund and can only be accessed when the suspension is lifted.
Woodford has posted a Q&A on his website detailing the process, explained his reasoning in a video and has pledged to reopen as soon as possible. https:// The fund's suspension must be reassessed at least every 28 days. While in theory it could re-open overnight, observers expect the closure to last a number of weeks. WHY DO SO MANY RETAIL INVESTORS FOLLOW WOODFORD? Woodford is among Britain's most famous fund managers. The 59-year-old made his name over more than two decades at Invesco Perpetual, before leaving to set up Woodford Investment Management in 2014, based in the university city of Oxford. He rose to prominence with his investment decision to avoid high-priced technology stocks, a move vindicated when the so-called 'tech bubble' burst and valuations fell sharply. He repeated the feat during the 2008-2009 financial crisis by avoiding banks, instead preferring stocks such as tobacco companies, which made strong gains. WHY DID WOODFORD SUSPEND THE FUND? Trading in the fund was suspended because Woodford could not raise cash quickly enough to give back to clients who were trying to leave, including one of its larger investors, the pension scheme of Kent County Council in southern England. Another contributing factor was a series of disappointing stock performances, culminating last week in a sharp fall in the share price of construction and services group Kier, in which Woodford's fund has a significant stake.  By suspending the fund, Woodford has created room to sell some of his holdings in a more measured way that might help him secure a better price, thereby protecting the value of his investments for those clients who wish to remain in the fund. Limiting his ability to act is the relatively large amount he has invested in private companies not listed on a major stock exchange, that are usually harder to offload quickly. IS THIS AN ISOLATED ISSUE? While any equity fund like Woodford's can theoretically invest up to 10% of their assets in private companies in the hope of securing better returns, not many do. Of those that do, most invest far less than Woodford. WHAT ARE REGULATORS DOING? As people have sought to exit his fund, the relative proportion of unlisted firms within it has risen, making it harder to avoid breaching a European Union rule that no more than 10% of assets are held in unlisted or ""illiquid"" stocks. One of the ways in which Woodford was able to keep below this cap was through some of the private companies in which he held stakes listing partially on the stock exchange in Guernsey. The FCA, which authorizes Woodford, said it will look at how the fund applied this EU cap and whether the rules on applying the cap need toughening up. ""Simply listing an unquoted company overseas does not in itself make the stock more liquid,"" FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey wrote in a column in the Financial Times.  Woodford's ""gating"" of the fund has also triggered a spat between regulators in Britain and Guernsey, with the latter saying it was up to the FCA to investigate Woodford, and that it saw no reason to examine the Guernsey exchange he used. WHY GUERNSEY?  By holding Guernsey-listed preference shares, Woodford's Authorized Corporate Director is able to class them as listed rather than unlisted assets, for the purpose of the EU rules.  Over the last three years, four of the firms in which Woodford invested have issued preference shares on a stock exchange in Guernsey, although none have traded.  Woodford's holdings that have Guernsey listed preference shares include a stake in medical data technology firm BenevolentAI, which was valued at nearly 200 million pounds at the end of April. INVESTMENT PLATFORMS IN SPOTLIGHT  In Britain, many retail investors pick where to invest by using an online platform, the biggest of which is run by Bristol-based  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). Hargreaves, like other platforms, charges clients a fee each year based on how much money they invest. It uses its financial muscle to negotiate a reduced fee with managers like Woodford and then makes a list of funds it thinks are the best picks. In the case of Woodford, Hargreaves has consistently championed his long-term performance track record and only removed his Equity Income Fund from its 'Wealth 50' list of top picks on the day it was suspended.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>","Employees sour on Tesla amid cost-cutting, layoffs","By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc’s rankings at two high-profile job websites have declined, suggesting that job dissatisfaction at the electric car company is intensifying amid layoffs, strategy shifts and executive turnover.
Tesla placed 16th on LinkedIn's annual ""Top Companies 2019"" list published in April, compiled from billions of actions taken by its over 600 million users that indicate job interest and demand. It held the fifth and sixth spots in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
At jobs site Glassdoor, Tesla's overall company rating fell to 3.2 out of 5.0 stars based on reviews written in the first quarter from a high of 3.6 in 2017, according to historical data compiled by Glassdoor at Reuters' request. The average rating of the nearly 1 million employers reviewed on the site is 3.4.
In the first quarter, Elon Musk's CEO approval rating dropped to 52% from 90% in 2017. 
Tesla's ""recommend to a friend"" rating fell to 49% in the first quarter from a high of 71% two years prior, the Glassdoor data showed. 
Similarly, Glassdoor ratings for culture and values, career opportunities, senior leadership and six-month positive business outlook all fell. Only ""work-life balance"" and ""compensation and benefits"" remained static. No metrics improved. 
The reviews are anonymous and Glassdoor says it does not verify identities or employment status. 
Told of the rankings, a Tesla spokeswoman said the company remains a highly sought after employer. Tesla received over half a million job applications in 2017 and again in 2018 and expects to exceed that figure in 2019, she said.
Tesla also made Forbes list of ""Most Innovative Companies"" last year. Employer branding specialist Universum ranked Tesla and sister company SpaceX as the most attractive employers for engineering students.
As Musk prepares to talk up future growth at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, the car maker is weathering a difficult period. Two years after the official launch of its Model 3 sedan, intended to catapult Musk's company to volume car producer status, Tesla is still struggling to reach its targets.
Tesla lost $700 million in the first quarter and saw a drop in vehicle deliveries, raising concerns about consumer demand and shipping logistics.
Wall Street is also souring on Tesla, with the company's shares falling 39% so far this year. Analysts have cut their ratings after the company announced lower deliveries and worries over the company's direction.
Of the two current and 16 former employees who spoke with Reuters since January, some praised Musk as a visionary but said his management style and the exodus of executives have left a void in leadership.
Tesla's chief financial officer retired in January and the company's top lawyer left in February after two months on the job. The head of communications is leaving this month. Those positions have been filled. 
Tesla had 48,817 full-time employees at the end of 2018, according to SEC filings, after a 9% headcount reduction throughout the company announced in June 2018. Tesla announced it would lay off another 7% of its workforce in January.
In a company-wide email last month, Musk said all expenses would be reviewed, including by him, adding that current spending could quickly eat up Tesla's recent capital raise. Tesla declined to comment on whether Musk was signing off on each new hire.
Tesla has 1,100 jobs posted on its website, down from 2,510 in January, according to statistics provided by job-post scraping site Thinknum. Many show vacancies since October. 
Tesla said job postings differ from jobs open, as one posting could represent multiple openings.
(This story corrects paragraph 14 to show Tesla has a global communications director.)

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>",Opioid manufacturer Insys files for bankruptcy after kickback probe,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Drugmaker Insys Therapeutics Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday amid mounting expenses driven by a U.S. Justice Department probe into claims it paid doctors bribes to prescribe a powerful opioid medication.
The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing marked a first for a drugmaker accused in lawsuits of helping fuel the deadly U.S. opioid endemic and came just days after Insys struck a $225 million settlement with the Justice Department.
The department is now Insys' largest unsecured creditor due to Wednesday's accord, which resulted in a subsidiary pleading guilty to fraud charges and the company entering into a deferred prosecution agreement.
The bankruptcy filing came after a federal jury in Boston in May found Insys founder John Kapoor and four other former executives guilty of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy centered on its fentanyl spray, Subsys.
Chandler, Arizona-based Insys said it filed for bankruptcy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware to facilitate a sale of its assets, including Subsys.
Insys listed $175.1 million in assets and $262.5 million in debt as of March 31. Shares of Insys fell 66% to 44 cents in premarket trading.
Subsys is an under-the-tongue spray the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in 2012 for treating pain in cancer patients. It contains fentanyl, an opioid 100 times stronger than morphine.
Prosecutors alleged that while Kapoor was its chairman, Insys from 2012 to 2015 used sham ""speaker programs"" as a means to pay doctors bribes to prescribe Subsys to patients, many of whom did not have cancer.
Subsys' net revenues during that time grew from $8.6 million in 2012 to $329 million in 2015.
The Justice Department probe led to multiple people being charged including Kapoor, Insys' majority shareholder, in October 2017 on the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.
Opioids were involved in a record 47,600 U.S. overdose deaths in 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.
In a bankruptcy court filing, Insys Chief Executive Andrew Long said sales of Subsys have declined substantially due to increased national scrutiny of opioid prescribing.
He said that sales decline was more than Insys could withstand when coupled with the investigation and more than 1,000 lawsuits by municipal governments seeking to hold it responsible for the epidemic.

Other opioid manufactures are facing similar lawsuits, including OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, which has considered filing for bankruptcy amid the litigation.

(Reuters) - United Sporting Cos, a large firearms distributor whose roots date to the Great Depression, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday and said it plans to liquidate, hurt by falling sales after President Donald Trump was elected and as Dick's Sporting Goods Inc began moving away from firearms.
The company, whose units including Ellett Brothers serve 20,000 retailers in all 50 states, said other reasons for its Chapter 11 filing were too much debt and discounting caused by excess inventory. It also cited ""significant"" disruptions in outdoor retailing such as Bass Pro Shops' 2017 purchase of Cabela's and Gander Mountain's bankruptcy.
It said hurricanes in the southeast United States, which generates a large portion of the Chapin, South Carolina-based company's sales, also reduced demand. USC carries such brands as Glock, Remington, Ruger and Smith & Wesson.
The firearms industry has faced pressure https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-sales/u-s-gun-sales-down-6-1-percent-in-2018-extending-trump-slump-idUSKCN1PN346 on sales after Trump's 2016 election eased gun control fears, even as a spate of U.S. mass shootings has prompted calls for more curbs on gun ownership.
In a court filing, Chief Executive Officer Bradley Johnson said USC boosted inventory before the 2016 White House race, expecting the higher sales that historically follow a Democrat's election.
But he said the Republican Trump's unexpected win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was a factor in net sales falling to $557 million in 2018 from an average $885.3 million from 2012 to 2016, with an accompanying glut of inventory.
Dick's, meanwhile, decided after 17 people died at the Feb. 2018 Parkland, Florida school shooting to stop selling guns to people under 21, a decision also made by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, and to remove assault-style rifles from its stores. In March, Dick's decided to end firearms sales at 125 stores.
Founded in 1933 as Ellett Brothers, USC said it operates five distribution centers and is majority-owned by New York-based private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management.
In its petition filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, USC said it had between $100 million and $500 million of liabilities. It plans to keep operating during the wind-down.
The case is In re SportCo Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 19-11299.

Trump said the merger would harm competition and make it more difficult for the U.S. government to negotiate defense contracts.
""I want to see that we don't hurt our competition,"" he said in an interview with CNBC.
The surprise deal, announced on Sunday, will create the world's second largest aero-and-defense company by sales behind Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and allow Raytheon to expand into commercial aviation while reducing United Technologies' dependence on aerospace.
""The proposed UTX-RTN merger looks like a good, but not transformative, fit with solid financials and modest regulatory risk. Investors should like the deal for RTN and may be neutral to slightly positive for UTX,"" Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note.
The two companies have some common customers, but have argued that their business overlap is limited as they face the prospect of U.S. antitrust regulators scrutiny.
Dismissing concerns over the antitrust scrutiny, United Technologies said it expects to secure approvals by early 2020. 
""The RTN-UTX merger is a surprise but we see real rationales on both sides in scale, diversification in the face of cyclical uncertainty, and financial benefits,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.
""UTX also gets to de-lever with Raytheon's balance sheet and Raytheon holders get compensated in return.""
Under the deal, Raytheon shareholders will receive 2.3348 shares in the new company Raytheon Technologies for each Raytheon share and the new company will assume about $26 billion in net debt.

United Tech's shares were down about 2% at $129.40, while Raytheon's stock was up 1.7% at $189.2 in morning trade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Corp's bid to avoid a lawsuit accusing it of violating federal law in making employee retirement plan investments that cost beneficiaries hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The justices will take up Intel's appeal of a lower court ruling that revived the proposed class action lawsuit, initiated by a former employee in 2015, after a judge earlier agreed with the technology company that the litigation was filed too late.
The lawsuit accused the company committees managing the retirement contribution and 401(k) savings plans of breaching their fiduciary duty to the participants by placing an overly heavy emphasis on alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity, in contrast to peer retirement funds. 
The lawsuit was brought by former Intel engineer Christopher Sulyma in San Jose, California federal court. 

The dispute centers on the time period that retirement plan participants have to file suit for alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a federal law that requires plan managers to invest prudently.

The Dow Jones gained 164 points, or 0.6%, to 26,170.5 points by 9:35 AM ET (13:35 GMT), while the S&P 500 rose 19 points, or 0.7%, 2,794.30 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 83 points, or 1.1%, at 7,502.38 points.
Trump cancelled the planned implementation of 5% tariffs on all Mexican goods that was due to go in effect Monday as he claimed that “there is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico and the USA”.
The fact the president was willing to remove tariffs caused some speculation that a similar deal could be made with China.
“The assumption here is that this move demonstrates the pragmatic nature of U.S. trade policy and raises expectations that Presidents Trump and Xi could find some room for accommodation when they meet at the G20 summit on June 28-29,” Chris Turner, global head of strategy at ING, said, warning that markets would likely still need to see “clear signs of improvement”.
Trump made clear on Monday that he could return to tariff threats if the Mexican Congress did not approve the deal reached last week.
The president also insisted that the deal on immigration with Mexico was made precisely because he had threatened tariffs, although other published reports over the weekend said that there was little new in the deal and that Mexico and the U.S. had agreed to many of the terms months ago.
“If we didn’t have tariffs, we wouldn’t have a deal with Mexico,” Trump said in a phone interview with CNBC.
Trump also claimed that the tariff tactic would ultimately work with China. Beijing is “going to make a deal because they’re going to have to make a deal,” he said, claiming that “China is getting absolutely decimated” by companies leaving the world’s second-largest economy in order to avoid tariffs.
Risk assets have been roiled by fears that escalating trade tensions could potentially lead to a global recession. G20 finance leaders who met over the weekend warned that intensifying trade and geopolitical tensions were still the biggest risk to the stabilization of global growth.
But increasing bets that the Federal Reserve will be required to step in as promised to support the U.S. economic expansion have led to a renewed bout of risk appetite. Worse-than-expected job creation and easing wage inflation boosted those expectations last Friday, leading to Wall Street’s best weekly performance since the end of last year.
On a thinly-filled economic calendar, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) for April will be released at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), providing further information on the state of the American labor market.
Overnight, Chinese data showed some mixed readings as exports unexpectedly returned to growth. Some analysts suggested, however, that manufacturers may have increased shipments to avoid the most recent round of U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods. In a clearly negative sign, Chinese imports registered their largest decline in nearly three years, providing another indication of weak domestic demand.
In company news, a wave of M&A activity buoyed bullish sentiment in stocks.
United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) agreed to a merger that would create an aerospace and defense giant worth around $121 billion, the sector’s largest-deal ever.
 Tableau Software  (NYSE:DATA) agreed to be acquired by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in a deal valued at $15.7 billion.
In the auto sector, buoyed by news of the tariff cancellation, Reuters reported that Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) had renewed discussions over a possible merger as they searched for ways to secure the approval of Nissan (T:7201) for the deal. That may include a reduction of the French carmaker’s stake in the Japanese company, according to sources cited.
Reuters also reported that Apollo Global Management was leading in offers to acquire  Shutterfly  (NASDAQ:SFLY) in a deal that would value the digital imaging company at about $2 billion.
Lastly, Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced that it would buy biopharma Tilos Therapeutics for about $773 million.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, advanced 0.3% at 96.74 by 9:36 AM ET (13:36 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 2.13%.

805,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street Game Plans the Market Reaction to a Fed Rate Cut,"(Bloomberg) -- With expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts increasing among investors and economists alike, some of the biggest U.S. banks are mapping out the implications for financial markets.
Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are among those mining history and running models to divine the potential path for different asset classes.
Here’s what the market watchers are saying so far:
“We favor the optimistic view but conviction is not high.”
Mid-cycle easing by the Fed can renew bull markets, but cuts prior to recessions simply extend bear trends. JPMorgan’s recession-risk model suggests the upcoming Fed cycle may be a bad one for risky markets, but underlying leverage dynamics suggest that these cuts should support markets.
Bonds don’t tend to rally sustainably during mid-cycle easing because the Fed reverses those insurance cuts eventually. Recessions tend to generate bond rallies until about nine months after the first easing; that’s approximately when activity data are reviving. Equity markets appear to be pricing in a pre-emptive Fed that is set to provide insurance; if the Fed ends up being reactive, equities could follow a weak trajectory.
History shows that Treasury yields continued to rally and the curve continued to steepen for up to six months on average after the first rate cut. Credit spreads widened on average during the first six months. The dollar was on average on an upward trajectory for up to three months.
“The S&P 500 index has typically generated strong returns at the beginning of Fed cutting cycles.”
Goldman analyzed equity returns during the past 35 years following the start of seven Fed cutting cycles. The index climbed by a median of 2% and 14% during the 3- and 12-month periods following the start of a Fed cutting cycle, respectively.
If the Fed doesn’t plan to cut, it will need to walk back market expectations, and the few previous instances suggest that the S&P 500 would fall in that case. If the Fed does cut, Health Care and Consumer Staples tend to outperform and Information Technology consistently lags. Momentum and low volatility factors also outperform.
“Few precedents exist during the past 30 years where futures discounted an interest rate cut 30 days prior to a scheduled FOMC meeting but the Fed did not cut.” There were episodes in 1990 and 1992, but unlike today, both occurred in the middle of easing cycles.
The Fed rate-cut cycles since 1995 can be divided into two types: pre-euro and post-euro.
The pre-euro cuts -- in 1995, 1998 and 2001 -- resulted in the dollar rallying over the six months following the cut. The greenback’s performance before the rate cut had little significance for how it performed after the rate cut.
Following the post-euro cuts -- in 2002 and 2007 -- the dollar weakened significantly, around 10%. The currency’s realized and implied volatility picked up.
The bank’s cross-asset team expects the Fed to stay on hold until financial conditions tighten, by which time action will be too late to avoid cyclical impacts. They are underweight equities and credit and overweight high-quality bonds.
“Although stocks have rallied with lower rates, they may start to sell off (or at least have limited upside) if rates keep declining.”
At some point the upside from “bad is good” is limited. An “insurance cut” scenario is already priced in, and would likely be positive for stocks; the Fed cutting more than one or two times by the end of the year would probably mean that the economy has significantly slowed and/or the trade war has escalated.
Chintawongvanich sees volatility elevated and potentially limited upside for stocks before the G-20 meeting. He says consider selling June VIX puts as VIX settlement is right before the Federal Open Market Committee decision. That VIX settlement will be based on 30-day option prices that “contain” the upcoming FOMC and G-20 meetings, and may keep a bid. Investors could sell the June puts to fund July puts, he adds.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>",Woodford investors vote with their feet after fund suspension,"By Huw Jones, Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Neil Woodford's listed fund hit record lows on Monday and clients continued to pull money from his only other remaining open product following the suspension of his main fund last week.
Woodford Investment Management suspended its equity income fund on June 3, a rare move for a product aimed at retail equity investors, after a run of redemption requests.
Morningstar data showed assets under management at the fund, which still provides daily pricing data based on underlying market movements, fell 4% to 3.55 billion pounds ($4.50 billion) on June 6 from May 31, shortly before the suspension.
Investors do not know when it will reopen, and the freezing of the assets has led to a war of words between regulators in Britain and Guernsey, where some of its assets are listed.
With the main fund suspended, investors have voted with their feet in withdrawing from Woodford's other two funds.
Woodford Patient Capital Trust's shares fell by about 20% last week after the equity income fund was suspended.
WPCT sought to reassure investors on Monday, saying it was pleased with the progress of its portfolio companies, which it said have the potential to deliver attractive returns.
""The operational performance of these businesses is not impacted by recent events,"" it said, adding that its board was ""closely monitoring"" the situation.
Despite its attempt to calm jittery investors, shares in the fund slid further after markets opened on Monday and were down 4.8% by 1102 GMT after briefly hitting record lows, making it the biggest faller on Britain's FTSE mid-cap index.
Elsewhere, the Woodford Income Focus fund fell 14% between May 31 and June 6 to 425.2 million pounds, according to Morningstar.
Woodford last week lost separate mandates to manage money from wealth managers St James's Place and Openwork totaling nearly 4 billion pounds.
Woodford, one of Britain's best known fund managers among retail investors, has been cutting his stakes in at least 21 companies as he frees up cash to meet a rush of redemption requests that forced him to suspend his main fund.
This raises ""important questions"" about how illiquid investments should be regulated, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, said on Sunday.
Limits on the share of illiquid investments held in collective investment schemes already exist under British and European Union rules, Bailey said.
""The Woodford fund's inability to meet investor withdrawals raises a challenge as to whether the rules requiring assets to be liquid are working as they should be,"" Bailey said in an opinion column published in the Financial Times.
LEARNING LESSONS
After property funds were suspended in the aftermath of Britain's vote in 2016 to leave the EU, the FCA consulted last year on tougher rules for funds that invest in property and other illiquid assets.
It is due to announce final changes later this year.
""We will take into account the lessons of the Woodford fund when finalizing these rules,"" Bailey said.
Some of the companies in which Woodford invested are listed on an exchange in Guernsey and are not traded.
Bailey said that listing an unquoted company overseas does not in itself make the stock more liquid, and investors have a right to choose the jurisdiction in which they invest and for it to be maintained.
Bailey said that investment platforms also have responsibilities when it comes to recommending ""best buys"".
 Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), Britain's biggest fund supermarket, picks out a number of funds it considers to be among the best value for its 'Wealth 50' list, and had been a major backer of Woodwork's suspended fund up until last week.
Many retail investors would likely have chosen to invest in Woodford's fund in part because of the support of Hargreaves, which charges fees to use its platform.
Hargreaves customers accounted for more than 30% of the fund at the end of 2018. 

Shares in Hargreaves were down 4.4%, making it the second-biggest faller on the FTSE 100.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>","Renault rift with Nissan widens over governance, casts shadow on alliance","By Naomi Tajitsu and Laurence Frost
TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - The two-decade-old partnership of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Nissan Motor Co was plunged into fresh crisis on Monday, as the French automaker's demand for a greater say in Nissan's new governance system drew rare public censure by the Japanese firm.
Renault, which owns 43.4% of the Japanese firm, signaled it would block Nissan from formally adopting an overhauled governance structure at a June 25 shareholder meeting - unless Renault received representation on new Nissan committees. 
The demand, conveyed in a letter from Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard just weeks before the meeting, could scuttle the new structure, created after months of deliberation by an outside committee and previously supported by Senard. Nissan responded in some of its frankest language yet against its top shareholder, calling the demand ""most regrettable"".
""Nissan has received a letter from Renault indicating intention to abstain from voting,"" Nissan said in a statement.
""Nissan finds Renault's new stance on this matter most regrettable, as such a stance runs counter to the company’s efforts to improve its corporate governance.""
The rift lays bare the deep strain between the two automakers, whose alliance has been under pressure since the arrest of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn in November. What's at stake now may be even bigger than their vast alliance, which includes Mitsubishi Motors.
Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are looking for ways to resuscitate their collapsed merger plan and secure Nissan's approval for that deal, Reuters reported on Monday. Nissan is, therefore, poised to urge Renault to significantly cut the 43.4% stake, two people told Reuters.
By abstaining from the governance vote, Renault would effectively block the new governance system - which includes three committees - as adoption requires two-thirds approval. Nissan recently said it would abstain from voting on the FCA-Renault merger, although both FCA and Renault later blamed the failure of that deal squarely on the French government. 
""Renault's rights as 43.4% shareholder of Nissan need to be fully recognized and, at a minimum, one or two directors proposed by Renault should be members of each of the three committees,"" Renault said in its letter, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters.
""As currently proposed, this does not seem to be the case.""
CONFLICT OF INTEREST?
A Renault source said Senard's letter was motivated by concern about Renault's under-representation on the new Nissan board committees being introduced following the arrest of Ghosn, who is now awaiting trial and denies the financial misconduct charges against him.
""It's not a final abstention, and Renault's position can still change,"" the source said. ""As things stand, Renault has not been assured of appropriate committee representation as Nissan's main shareholder.""
Renault had yet to receive specific details on the proposed composition of each of the committees, another source with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.
A Nissan source said Renault CEO Thierry Bollore had expressed a desire to sit on new Nissan committees to oversee executive nominations and compensation, and a planned corporate governance auditing committee.
But such a move would raise concerns about a possible conflict of interest, as it would give Renault a say in Nissan salaries and corporate governance, the Nissan source said.
""It's shocking behavior from a shareholder that has been saying for months that it supports us in strengthening our corporate governance,"" the Nissan source said.
The source added that even if Renault blocked the committees, Nissan would still try and go ahead and set up similar governance structures, and try to make them as binding as possible.
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, in Tokyo after a G20 meeting at the weekend, told reporters it was up to the management of both companies to solve their problems. The French government owns 15 percent in Renault.
The rift could put further pressure on Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, who looks increasingly at odds with Renault.
Japan's Jiji news agency earlier quoted Saikawa as saying: ""We are preparing for the shareholder meeting and will discuss necessary issues at the appropriate time. If there are differences of opinion (with Renault), then I'd like for those to be discussed"".
In March a Nissan-appointed outside team recommended the formation of the three committees to improve its corporate governance. Under the proposal, Renault directors would be free to serve on the nominations committee, but would be barred from the compensation and audit committees. 
The two companies have struggled to repair their relationship after Ghosn's arrest exposed simmering tensions, including Nissan's long-held concerns about the alliance's capital structure.

Nissan also appears to have been largely left in the dark on the merger discussions between Renault and Fiat Chrysler, which had attempted to join forces to create the world's third-largest automaker before talks fell apart last week.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares followed Asian stocks higher on Monday after the United States shelved plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and as investors anticipated lower U.S. interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets next week on the back of poor jobs data.
Investors had fretted that opening up another trade conflict, while still battling with China, could push the United States and other major economies into recession. The Mexican peso rallied as much as more than 2% on Monday.
But in China, the yuan slipped to its weakest this year after the country's imports fell the most in nearly three years and as talks to end the Sino-U.S. dispute remained deadlocked.
The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 0.1% in early trade, with Britain's FTSE 100 up 0.5%, while S&P500 mini futures were up 0.4% after rising as much as 0.8%.
Liquidity was lower than usual with markets in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland shut for national holidays.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield was at 2.1431 percent, after hitting a 21-month low of 2.053 percent on Friday on soft U.S. jobs data.
In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei closed up 1.2%, while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 1%.
""Markets are blowing small celebratory bubbles,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.
""There will be relief that the [Mexican] tariffs have been avoided and perhaps some might believe it shows Trump's propensity to strike deals after brinkmanship. As such there may be those thinking that a similar thing might happen with the China trade situation.""
CARS MOVE AHEAD
The European auto sector was boosted by signs that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) were looking for ways to revive their collapsed merger plan and secure the approval of Nissan Motor Co. Fiat Chrysler was up 1.9%, while Renault's shares were up 2.5%.
In London, Thomas Cook's shares rose as much 20% after a report that Hong Kong-listed Fosun Tourism was in talks to buy its tour operating business as the British group faces breakup after issuing three profit warnings in the past year.
Investors were also digesting Chinese data showing imports in May contracted 8.5% from a year earlier, a much worse than expected outcome that signaled weak domestic consumption.
Exports, however, unexpectedly rose 1.1% last month, though many suspect the uptick is linked to front-loading of shipments by firms to avoid higher U.S. tariffs. 
""Mexico is not China and investors will want to see some clear signs of improvement in U.S.-China relations before increasing exposure to risk assets. Before then the market is left focusing on poor Chinese import figures for May.....as speculation builds over whether the PBOC [the People's Bank of China] allows yuan to trade through 7 per dollar,"" said Chris Turner head of FX strategy at ING Bank.
With the Mexico spat seemingly resolved, investors will now focus on whether U.S. President Donald Trump can reach a similar deal with China.
""With Trump looking to win votes to secure a second term, an agreement with China will go some way to smoothing the path and he'll be focusing on that,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum. ""There'll be a lot of fudging and saber-rattling but when that happens there'll be an aggressive spike-up in stocks.""
EYES ON THE FED
In the United States, expectations the Federal Reserve will cut rates kept the dollar on the defensive after a weak jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 75,000 jobs last month, much smaller than the 185,000 additions estimated by economists in a Reuters poll.
Fed funds rate futures prices, down on Monday after the Mexico deal, were still pricing in more than two 25-basis point rate cuts by the end of this year, with one almost fully priced in by July.
The Federal Reserve's next policy meeting is set for next week, on June 18-19.
The euro pulled back from 2-1/2 month highs as the dollar strengthened and after sources said European Central Bank policymakers were open to cutting the ECB's policy rate should economic growth worsen.
The euro fell 0.2% to $1.1306 after hitting $1.1348 last week, its highest since March.
Euro zone government bond yields remained close to all-time lows. Core bond yields in the bloc were still at all-time lows, despite the two basis point move higher in the German bund in early trade to -0.24%, as expectations of easier monetary policy fuel bond buying.
The euro was down almost 0.3% against the dollar at $1.1301 EUR= near a 2-1/2-month high of $1.1347 touched on Friday.
China's yuan touched its lowest since late November after weak import data reignited worries about slowing domestic demand. The offshore rate was slightly lower at 6.9532 yuan per dollar but held above Friday's 2019 low.
Gold slipped almost 1%, having hit a 14-month high of $1,348.1 per ounce on Friday, near a major resistance around $1,350.
Many investors are still clinging to hopes that Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders' meeting late this month to seek a compromise on trade and other economic issues.

Oil prices rose on Monday after Saudi Arabia said producer club OPEC and Russia should restrict supplies to current levels, with front-month Brent crude futures at $63.39, 0.2%, above Friday's close.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 07:14AM ET</span>",UBS looks to Sumitomo Mitsui tie-up to crack Japanese wealth,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Takashi Umekawa
ZURICH/TOKYO (Reuters) - UBS signed a joint venture deal with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust on Friday, aiming to crack a Japanese wealth management market where it has struggled to grow over the last 15 years.
The deal, signed by the banks' CEOs in Zurich, will create a venture majority-owned by UBS that will expand the services both firms can offer their wealthy and ultra-wealthy customers.
It makes the Swiss bank the latest foreign asset manager to target Japan's roughly $17 trillion in household assets.
Looking to make further inroads in the country, where it holds a securities but not a banking license, limiting the services it can offer, the world's largest wealth manager said partnering with an established local bank would help grow its flagship business in one of the biggest wealth markets.
""We would rather own 51 percent of something that is big than 100 percent of something that is smaller,"" UBS Global Wealth Management Co-President Martin Blessing told Reuters.
""We expect this business to grow and to grow faster than if we did it alone.""
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has long been a target for foreign asset managers, given its relatively high savings rate and number of wealthy individuals. At the end of 2018, personal financial assets totaled 1,830 trillion yen ($17 trillion), according to the Bank of Japan.
But foreign banks have struggled to establish a foothold, with several large international players pulling out of the business for lack of scale.
UBS currently manages over $20 billion for wealthy clients in Japan, Blessing said, a small fraction of the market. Its chief executive believes the business can be doubled over the next five years through the deal, he told newspaper Handelszeitung.
A substantial portion of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust's 285 trillion yen of assets under custody hail from wealthy customers who will be referred to the new company, UBS' Japanese country head said in a memo on Thursday.
RECIPE FOR SUCCESS?
UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, has recently faced stalled earnings in its core business managing more than $2.4 trillion for the world's rich as clients stock up on cash and shy away from trading amid geopolitical uncertainty.
It is now looking to tie-ups with local players to support the business' global growth, using the Japanese venture as a ""testing ground"" for other possible partnerships.
""(We want to see) whether this kind of setup can help us to succeed in markets where we have a certain presence but where our domestic share compared to the local competitors is still relatively small,"" Blessing said.
The deal between UBS and the Japanese trust bank should help both boost business with existing clients and attract new customers, they said, with UBS clients gaining access to the Japanese bank's real estate and trust services, while Sumitomo Trust clients gain access to UBS' wealth management services.

The two firms will begin referring clients to each other by the end of the year and aim to establish the new company by 2021, they said in a joint statement.

Kelly's comments may raise questions about Saikawa's push for improved corporate governance as he prepares to face shareholders at an annual meeting this month, amid a plunge in profit that has underscored his struggle to lead Nissan following the arrest and ouster of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.
Kelly has been charged with helping Ghosn hide around 9 billion yen in compensation. Both men deny wrongdoing.
Ghosn also faces charges that he enriched himself at the expense of Nissan, and Saikawa has said the Japanese automaker may claim damages from his former mentor.
Kelly in the interview did not say how he was aware of the exception or who authorized it. He did not claim any illegality on the part of Saikawa or Nissan, nor discuss the possible prevalence of such practices in corporate Japan.
Since taking the lead at Nissan, Saikawa has worked to improve governance while navigating fraught relations with French majority shareholder  Renault  SA (PA:RENA). Ghosn, as chairman of both automakers, had favored a merger before his ouster, while Saikawa had opposed, sources have told Reuters.
On Monday, Renault signaled it would block Nissan's planned governance reforms unless it gets more say in them, a demand which Nissan called ""most regrettable"" and which one source derided as a potential conflict of interest.
In his interview, Bungei Shunju quoted Kelly as saying Saikawa helped create an agreement to pay Ghosn millions of dollars in income after he retired to retain him as an advisor and keep him from working at one of Nissan's competitors.
Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan have been charged for understating Ghosn's salary in agreeing to post-employment payments.
""We didn't violate the law, we were trying to protect Nissan in a way that was lawful, which was to retain a talented top executive,"" Bungei Shunju quoted Kelly as saying. ""Saikawa signed the document, he was the only one. He signed it and gave it to me and I gave it to Mr. Ghosn.""
Kelly, who has lived in Tokyo since his Christmas Day release on bail, is expected to go to trial early next year alongside Ghosn.
Ghosn, who has been detained and bailed twice, also faces charges related to a $5 million payment received from a Middle East Nissan dealership, and for temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books.

813,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 06:37AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Rise as Trump Cancels Tariffs on Mexico,"Investing.com - Wall Street pointed to a higher open on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would refrain from placing tariffs on Mexico thanks to a deal for more cooperation on controlling illegal immigration across the border.
The blue-chip Dow futures gained 107 points, or 0.4% by 6:32 AM ET (10:32 GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 10 points, or 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 27 points, or 0.4%.
Trump cancelled the planned implementation of 5% tariffs on all Mexican goods that was due to go in effect Monday as he touted that “there is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico and the USA”.



“Now with our new deal, Mexico is doing more for the USA on illegal immigration than the Democrats,” Trump tweeted early Monday.
The fact the president was willing to reach an agreement with Mexico and remove tariffs caused some speculation that a similar deal could be made with China.
“The assumption here is that this move demonstrates the pragmatic nature of US trade policy and raises expectations that Presidents Trump and Xi could find some room for accommodation when they meet at the G20 summit on June 28-29,” Chris Turner, global head of strategy at ING, said.
“However, Mexico is not China and investors will want to see some clear signs of improvement in U.S.-China relations before increasing exposure to risk assets,” he added.
G20 finance leaders who met over the weekend warned that intensifying trade and geopolitical tensions were still the biggest risk to the stabilization of global growth, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made clear that Trump will decide on the next move with China after the G20 summit.
Mnuchin stated that the president was “perfectly happy” to hit Beijing with new tariffs if the meeting doesn’t go well.
On the economic front, China’s exports unexpectedly returned to growth, although some analysts suspect that manufacturers may have increased shipments to avoid the most recent round of U.S. tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods. Chinese imports, however, registered their largest decline in nearly three years, providing another sign of weak domestic demand.
In the U.S., the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) for April will be released at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), providing further information on the state of the American labor market.
A worst-than-expected reading of job creation in last Friday’s employment  report, coupled with easing wage inflation, was seen as “good news” for stocks as it spurred speculation that the  Federal Reserve will be forced to ease policy this year. Wall Street registered its strongest weekly performance this year as fed fund futures price in a rate cut as soon as the July meeting.
In company news, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) agreed to a merger that would create an aerospace and defense giant worth around $121 billion, the sector’s largest deal ever.
The auto sector also received a boost from a Reuters’ report that Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) had renewed discussions over a possible merger as they searched for ways to secure the approval of Nissan (T:7201) for the deal. That may include a reduction of the French carmaker’s stake in the Japanese company, according to sources cited.
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, rose 0.3% to 96.74 by 6:36 AM ET (10:36 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped 5.9 basis points to 2.14%.
In commodities, gold futures slid $13.95, or 1.0%, at $1,332.15 a troy ounce, while crude oil traded up 9 cents, or 0.2%, to $54.08 a barrel."
814,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 06:35AM ET</span>",China's Fosun holds talks to buy Thomas Cook's main holiday business,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's oldest travel company Thomas Cook edged closer to a break up on Monday after its biggest shareholder, China's Fosun Tourism, made a preliminary approach for the British group's core holiday operations. 
The 178-year-old company, battered by fading demand for its package holidays, high debt and a hot 2018 summer in Europe which deterred bookings, is also weighing approaches for its airline business and Nordic operations as it seeks to raise cash.
Shares in Thomas Cook rose more than 13 percent to give the company a market valuation of around 280 million pounds ($355 million). 
Hong Kong-listed Fosun Tourism already has a presence in the European market through its ownership of the Club Med holiday business, and has an 18 percent stake in Thomas Cook.
Were it to succeed in buying the British company's hotel and resort business it would mark one of the most significant purchases of a British company by a Chinese group in years. 
The Tour Operator business of Thomas Cook had 11 million customers in 2018, producing 7.4 billion pounds in revenue. That compared with revenue of 3.5 billion pounds for the airline business, although the airline has a higher margin.
Thomas Cook has been forced to act after it stumbled badly last year when a heatwave in northern Europe deterred holiday makers from booking lucrative last minute deals, leading to three major profit warnings in less than a year and talk of a need to raise funds.
It said in February it was willing to sell its airline business, which includes German holiday carrier Condor, to enable it to focus on its tour operations which include owning its own hotels and resorts and securing capacity in others. 
Thomas Cook said there was no certainty the Fosun approach would lead to a formal offer, and it would consider any bid alongside the other strategic options that it has, to raise as much value as possible for stakeholders.
Fosun Tourism has been purchasing tourism assets including France's Club Med, as the industry is viewed as key to China's shift toward a more consumption-driven model of economic growth from an investment and export-led one. 
But like its domestic peers including HNA Group, Fosun, China's largest privately held conglomerate, has faced increasing scrutiny from Beijing for debt-fueled, big-ticket foreign deals in recent years.
It said earlier this year that it will adopt an asset-light strategy and run under management contracts the Club Med resorts it plans to launch in China and other countries.
In 2015 Thomas Cook and Club Med said they would look at sharing European flights to destinations while Thomas Cook and Fosun have a joint venture in China.

Fosun could not buy the airlines business because it must be majority owned by European Union nationals to operate flights within the bloc.

(Reuters) - Asian equity markets saw heavy outflows in May as a sudden escalation in the U.S.-China trade war threatened to put more pressure on export-reliant regional economies and companies which are highly reliant on Chinese sales. 
Asian equities received solid cross-border inflows in the first four months of this year on expectations that the world's two biggest economies were closing in on a trade deal. But confidence quickly soured after the United States raised levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened even more.
Outside investors sold $6.4 billion worth of Asian equities last month, their biggest sales since October 2018, data from stock exchanges in South Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam showed.
(GRAPHIC: Foreign investments in Asian equities - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KlWXkx)
Taiwan and South Korea, which have extensive ties with tech companies in China and are part of their supply chains, led the regional outflows. Taiwan and South Korean markets witnessed combined foreign sales of over $7 billion last month.
Indonesian and Philippine equities also faced outflows of $411 million and $271 million, respectively.
On the other hand, Indian equities received $1.15 billion of inflows, as a landslide victory for incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi provided hopes for more progressive reforms ahead. 
""In our view, Modi 2.0 has the potential to deepen reforms further, which would contribute to India being able to reap its growth potential and to remain the fastest growing emerging giant,"" Arjen van Dijkhuizen, senior economist at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) said in a report.
While trade uncertainties are expected to be front and center for most regional investors in coming months, Asian markets are expected to draw some support from expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates this year if U.S. growth weakens.
China is also expected to ease policy further and roll out more stimulus measures.
""While foreign flows into Asia equities had moderated in the month of May against the backdrop of escalating trade concerns and worries of the impact on global growth, the dovish pivot seen of the Federal Reserve could provide some relief ahead,"" said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist with financial services firm IG. 
Fed Funds rate futures are pricing in more than two 25- basis point cuts by the end of this year, with one almost fully priced in by July. 

""The significant slide in G3 bond yields, occurring in a context of modest financial volatility, is supportive of capital flows into Asia,"" said Chang Wei Liang, forex strategist at Mizuho Bank.

(Reuters) - Strong Chinese export data and the U.S.-Mexico deal to avoid new import tariffs bolstered the mood on European stock markets on Monday, while car company shares also got a lift from signs of moves to revive Fiat-Chrysler and Renault's merger.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% by 0805 GMT, with trading volumes thinned out by the Whit Monday holiday in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and most Nordic countries.
The auto sector gained 0.5% on signs that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) were looking for ways to resuscitate their collapsed merger plan and secure the approval of Nissan Motor Co.
Fiat Chrysler and Renault's shares were both up about 2% after sources close to the companies told Reuters they were back in discussions on ways to revive the deal. 
""We believe it is too early to talk about negotiations being re-opened,"" Equita analyst Emanuele Gallazzi wrote in a note.
""Today's news together with the hypotheses discussed in various press sources relating to alternative scenarios for FCA, including GM, Hyundai and Geely, keep high the speculative appeal of the stock.""
President Donald Trump on Friday retreated on last month's shock threat of a 5% import tariff on all Mexican goods in exchange for moves on immigration, providing relief to investors worried that a second major U.S. trade dispute would drive the global economy into recession.
""Markets are blowing small celebratory bubbles this morning,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note. 
Trade tensions between the U.S. and China still lingered, with Group of 20 finance leaders saying that trade and geopolitical tensions have raised risks to improving global growth while stopping short of calling for a resolution of the conflict.
Adding to gains was some residual buying after weak U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday that spurred hopes of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.
Concerns over the pace of growth in the world's major economies drove a nearly 6% fall in European stock markets in May, their worst month in more than two years, but have been countered since by hopes of new stimulus from central banks to head off the threat.
Among other stocks, BAE Systems (LON:BAES) gained 1% on hopes of further deal making in the aerospace and defense space after United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) agreed on Sunday to combine its aerospace business with U.S. contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co, in what would be the sector's biggest ever merger.
Thomas Cook's shares jumped 15% after a report that Hong Kong's Fosun Tourism was in talks to buy its tour operating business as the British group faces breakup after issuing three profit warnings in the past year.

Ferguson Plc fell 4% after the British plumbing products distributor's third quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates.

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 03:20AM ET</span>",Europe Banks Are ‘Hostage’ to ECB’s Dovish Stance,"(Bloomberg) -- With Europe’s economic growth showing more cracks and inflation not moving in the desired direction, the ECB once again opened the door to further easing last week. Investors are worried it will continue to suck out any brightness from the banking sector’s outlook like a black hole.
After a disappointing May that saw bank stocks retreat to the levels of early January, the ECB’s commentary on Thursday -- that rates will stay lower for longer -- put pressure on the lenders’ stocks once again. What’s more, a new round of cheap funding for banks might not change the big picture.
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) led by Kian Abouhossein see the sector as a “hostage” to the central bank’s dovish stance and expect a 2% negative earnings per share impact with every 25 basis points additional rate cut. And don’t forget the ever flattening yield curve in the second quarter, implying another 2% to 3% of earnings per share are gone, according to JPMorgan.
The central bank didn’t provide clear guidance on the chances of introducing so-called tiering, or the exemption of some lenders’ deposits at the ECB from the impact of negative rates. The message was that it remains possible, but not at present, analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) concluded. Bloomberg economist Maeva Cousin wrote that the re-calibrated rates guidance “increases the likelihood of the ECB unveiling some form of reserve tiering system soon.”
Yet, the idea that tiering will be the game changer for banks remains debatable. JPMorgan argues that a shift to even lower rates would be bad for valuations, even with tiering. They calculate a 5% positive impact on the system if all of banks’ excess reserves are exempt from negative rates, thereby merely offsetting the impact of lower rates. That said, the effects may vary from country to country and could be relatively good for German banks.
While the terms of the ECB’s new TLTRO program, designed to ensure credit flows to the economy, is considered favorable for lenders it does “not change the outlook for European banks materially,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts led by Jan Wolter said. Still, some companies like Santander (MC:SAN), UniCredit, BBVA (MC:BBVA) or CaixaBank may benefit from continued low funding costs.
The broader sector is seen as likely to continue trading in a range, BNP Paribas said. It recommends investors look at option skews as the market is underpricing the downside risks to the banking sector.
In the meantime, Euro Stoxx 50 futures are trading 0.5% higher ahead of the open today.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>","Roche's $4.3 billion Spark bid delayed again amid U.S., UK scrutiny","By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche's $4.3 billion takeover of U.S. gene therapy specialist Spark Therapeutics has been pushed back again, possibly beyond the first half, as regulators continue to scrutinize the deal for its effect on competition.
Roche said on Monday that both companies received a request for more information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in connection with the FTC's review of the deal. 
Roche also said that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has opened an investigation.
Roche wants to buy Spark to, among other things, get ahold of U.S. firm's experimental gene therapy for hemophilia A as well as its platform to develop other treatments for genetic diseases. But Roche has been forced to push back completion repeatedly, this time giving itself to July 31, beyond its self-imposed first-half deadline, to wrap things up.
""The parties remain committed to the transaction and are working cooperatively and expeditiously with the FTC in connection with its review,"" Roche said in a statement.
The FTC has said it does not comment on cases it is reviewing.
The British regulator's separate inquiry is aimed at determining whether the CMA considers it has jurisdiction over Roche's acquisition, and if so, whether it could hurt competition in Britain. 

""Pending the outcome of its investigation, the CMA has issued an Interim Enforcement Order that would become effective upon closing of the transaction and would require Roche to hold separate the Spark business,"" Roche said. ""The parties are working cooperatively with the CMA and will continue to do so.""

Some New Zealanders with indigenous Māori heritage wear tattoos on their face or arms that represent their genealogy and are culturally sacred. But uniform rules at the national carrier restrict them from applying for roles such as flight attendant.
Many culture and rights advocates said the policy was discriminatory and noted that Air New Zealand draws on the Māori language in its marketing campaigns and uses a fern-like symbol known as a 'koru' in its logo and on the tail of its planes.
Air New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon said the policy was being dropped and non-offensive tattoos would be allowed.
""In conversations we've had with customers and our own people domestically and overseas in the past five months, it's clear that there is growing acceptance of tattoos in New Zealand, particularly as a means of cultural and individual expression,"" Luxon said in an emailed statement.
Tania Te Whenua, head of Te Whenua Law and Consulting which provides Māori cultural advice to organizations, said New Zealand companies, particularly those that profit from using Māori culture in international marketing campaigns, should respect the cultural rights of their staff.
""That's a shortcoming of the embracing of Māori culture and other cultures by organizations only so far as it's profit-making ... that makes it particularly egregious for Māori,"" she told Reuters.
The tattoos, known as 'Tā Moko' are a deeply sacred expression of cultural identity, Te Whenua added.

""When there are policies which seek to extinguish the visual representation of that practice it's quite hard-hitting,"" she said.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 1.0% and 0.9% higher respectively by 10:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.2%.
The gains in Chinese shares came after official data showed China’s overall trade surplus in May was significantly more than expected despite fears of an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade dispute. The surplus was $41.65 billion, compared with the forecasted $20.5 billion.
Despite the positive data, traders remained concerned of the impact of a worsening trade relationship between the U.S. and China, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC over the weekend that President Donald Trump is “perfectly happy” to impose more tariffs on China if future negotiations do not go well.
“If China wants to move forward with the deal, we’re prepared to move forward on the terms we’ve done. If China doesn’t want to move forward, then President Trump is perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs to re-balance the relationship,” Mnuchin said.
“We’re going to need to see action, and President Trump is going to need to make sure he’s clear that we’re moving in the right direction to a deal,” he added.
Trump and his China counterpart Xi Jinping are reportedly going to meet at the G-20 meeting in Japan later this month to discuss trade-related issues.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 1.1% after Cabinet Office data showed that the country’s revised GDP grew an annualized 2.2% in January-March, stronger than expectations of a 2.1% annualized growth and the preliminary reading of the same rate of expansion.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2019 10:02PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Some big tech firms cut employees' access to Huawei, muddying 5G rollout","By Paresh Dave and Chris Prentice
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest tech companies have told their employees to stop talking about technology and technical standards with counterparts at Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in response to the recent U.S. blacklisting of the Chinese tech firm, according to people familiar with the matter.
Chipmakers  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, mobile research firm InterDigital Wireless Inc and South Korean carrier LG Uplus have restricted employees from informal conversations with Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, the sources said. 
Such discussions are a routine part of international meetings where engineers gather to set technical standards for communications technologies, including the next generation of mobile networks known as 5G.
The U.S. Department of Commerce has not banned contact between companies and Huawei. On May 16, the agency put Huawei on a blacklist, barring it from doing business with U.S. companies without government approval, then a few days later it authorized U.S. companies to interact with Huawei in standards bodies through August ""as necessary for the development of 5G standards."" The Commerce Department reiterated that position on Friday in response to a question from Reuters. 
Nevertheless, at least a handful of major U.S. and overseas tech companies are telling their employees to limit some forms of direct interaction, the people said, as they seek to avoid any potential issues with the U.S. government. 
Intel and Qualcomm said they have provided compliance instructions to employees, but declined to comment on them further. 
A spokesman for InterDigital said it has provided guidance to engineers to ensure the company is in compliance with U.S. regulations. 
An official with LG Uplus said the company is ""voluntarily refraining from interacting with Huawei workers, other than meeting for network equipment installation or maintenance issues.""
Huawei did not provide comment. 
5G SLOWDOWN
The new restrictions could slow the rollout of 5G, which is expected to power everything from high-speed video transmissions to self-driving cars, according to several industry experts.
At a 5G standards meeting last week in Newport Beach, California, participants privately expressed alarm to Reuters that the long-standing cooperation among engineers that is needed for phones and networks to connect globally could fall victim to what one participant described as a ""tech war"" between the U.S. and China. 
A representative of a European company that has instituted rules against interaction with Huawei described people involved in 5G development as ""shaken."" ""This could push everyone to their own corners, and we need cooperation to get to 5G. It should be a global market,"" the person said. 
To be sure, several workers at smaller telecoms firms said they had not been told to avoid discussions with Huawei at standards meetings, and many vendors continue to support existing deals with Huawei. It is unclear how much further communications with Huawei have been curtailed in the tech industry, if at all. 
""There’s been a lot of misunderstanding from what I’m seeing and hearing from clients and colleagues, as far as what the (Commerce Department) restrictions actually entail,"" said Doug Jacobson, a Washington-based export controls lawyer.
He said that companies prohibiting their employees contacting Huawei was ""excessive, because the restrictions don’t preclude communication, only the transfer of technology."" 
Huawei, whose equipment the U.S. has alleged could be used by China to spy, has emerged as a central figure in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services.
China, U.S, and European companies have split before on standards for Wi-Fi, cell networks and other technologies, and the tit-for-tat over tariffs between Beijing and Washington has increased fears of another bifurcation.
Huawei is a top player at various global organizations that set technical specifications. As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of devices like smartphones, and the vital parts of networks such as routers and switches, Huawei will need to be at the standards-setting table to ensure a seamless customer experience when 5G networks become prevalent, engineers and experts said.
NO MORE INFORMAL CHATS
Engineers and system architects representing their employers at meetings of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global consortium of industry associations that aims to set 5G specifications by March 2020, often take formal, general discussions into smaller, less documented sessions as they try to find agreement with rivals. 
But at 3GPP's meeting last week in California, one of the group's three chairmen, Balazs Bertenyi of Nokia (HE:NOKIA), told attendees that more of those so-called ""offline"" conversations than usual would be documented by the standards body with notes and other publicly available records.
It was the ""practical implication"" of the new U.S. Commerce Department rules given industry-wide caution despite the exemption for 5G talks, he said.
Companies want to limit informal exchanges, in which their engineers feel more comfortable discussing proprietary technology with rivals to persuade them why their research or innovations are more sound, the sources said. 
A separate standards body, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), put restrictions on Huawei engineers' ability to participate in peer reviews for its publications, drawing criticism from some in China's industry and elsewhere. 
The organization, which declined to comment beyond generic statements on its website, then backtracked days later after saying it had received the all-clear from the U.S. Commerce Department with respect to the peer review issue. It did not respond to requests for comment on this story. 
""Huawei isn't just some company. They, by many accounts, are the leader in 5G technology. Excluding them is very hard to work around, so it does stand to disrupt the entire project,"" said Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah and an IEEE member. 

""If the idea is to create a non-Chinese 5G, I'm not sure that’s possible. Even if it is, would it be as good?""

PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) are looking for ways to resuscitate their collapsed merger plan and secure the approval of the French carmaker's alliance partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd , according to several sources close to the companies.
Nissan is poised to urge Renault to significantly reduce its 43.4% stake in the Japanese company in return for supporting a FCA-Renault tie-up, two people with knowledge of its thinking also told Reuters.
It is still far from clear whether any concerted effort to revive the complex and politically fraught deal can succeed. FCA Chairman John Elkann abruptly withdrew his $35 billion merger offer in the early hours of June 6 after the French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, blocked a vote by its board and demanded more time to win Nissan's backing. Nissan representatives had said they would abstain.
The failure, which FCA and Renault blamed squarely on the French government, deprived both companies of an opportunity to create the world's third-biggest carmaker with 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in promised annual synergies.
It also shone a harsh light on Renault's relations with Nissan, which have gone from frayed to fried since the November arrest of former alliance Chairman Carlos Ghosn, now awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.
REVIVAL TALKS
Italian-American FCA - whose brand stable encompasses Fiat runabouts, Jeep SUVs, RAM pickups and Maserati sports cars - has so far turned a deaf ear to suggestions by French officials that its merger proposal could be revisited.
But since the breakdown, Elkann and his French counterpart Jean-Dominique Senard have had talks about reviving the plan that left the Renault chairman and his Chief Executive Thierry Bollore upbeat about that prospect, three alliance sources said.
Renault and a spokesman for FCA declined to comment.
One of Elkann's senior advisors on the Renault merger bid, Toby Myerson, was expected at Nissan headquarters in Yokohama on Monday for exploratory discussions with top management, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa is likely to attend. Myerson did not respond to a message from Reuters seeking comment.
The meeting comes amid mounting strains that may preclude compromise, after Senard warned Saikawa that Renault was prepared to block key Nissan governance reforms in a dispute over board committees.
Alternatively, the escalating tensions and negotiating positions could give way to a breakthrough, as FCA-Renault's industrial logic and savings prove hard to ignore.
REBALANCING ACT
Saikawa, who has argued consistently that alliance shareholdings need ""rebalancing"" to reflect Nissan's superior size, would press for a substantial reduction to Renault's stake as part of any agreement, according to the same people. Nissan's 15% stake in Renault carries no voting rights.
""If FCA are expecting some sort of negotiation, they must be anticipating that request,"" said one.
The FCA-Renault deal that Elkann whipped off the table – at least for now – would have seen both companies acquired by a listed Dutch holding company owned 50-50 by current FCA and Renault shareholders, after payment of a 2.5 billion euro special dividend to FCA shareholders.
Paris had secured stronger job guarantees and terms including a cash payment to Renault shareholders, following public criticism that the bid undervalued Renault.
For Nissan, however, the merger would ""swap out one small 43% shareholder for a bigger 43% shareholder it doesn't know,"" said a source familiar with top management thinking. Nissan could back the FCA-Renault deal only with a ""substantial reduction"" in the French carmaker's holding, they said.
France may not automatically oppose a reduction to the Nissan holding if it secured Renault's place at the heart of a consolidated group. The government has also said it could reduce its own 15% Renault holding, to the same end.
""All options can be considered,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Le Figaro after the deal collapsed, when asked about Japanese pressure for Renault to reduce its Nissan stake.
But a senior ministry official declined to elaborate on that possibility. ""The proposal is gone,"" he said.
FCA may also be prepared to compromise for a tie-up that promises to plug the technology gaps threatening its ability to keep pace with vehicle electrification and emissions compliance.
It has few other potential partners, after talks with Peugeot maker PSA ended inconclusively earlier this year. Estimated FCA-PSA synergies were closer to 3 billion euros, according to one person briefed on the matter.
FCA has already floated a call option that would allow Nissan to increase its 7.5% voting stake in the combined FCA-Renault, another person involved in the talks said.
Nonetheless, anything beyond a token reduction of Renault's Nissan stake would likely upset the deal valuations and prove unpalatable to its prospective merger partner.
""It's not something FCA would want to reduce,"" the same person said. ""It's an intrinsic part of the value of Renault.""
Elkann and Senard had planned to press ahead with a merger agreement and formal talks over Nissan's abstention, in the belief that the deal economics would compel it to follow and cooperate, sources close to the Renault board have said.
By blocking that strategy at the eleventh hour, the French state may have handed the Japanese company a new negotiating opportunity. One thing Renault and Nissan can agree on is that any window to revive the merger is likely to be short.

""If there's going to be a deal it will probably be in weeks rather than months,"" one alliance executive said.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2019 09:12PM ET</span>","United Technologies, Raytheon to create $120 billion aerospace and defense giant","By Harry Brumpton and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) agreed on Sunday to combine its aerospace business with U.S. contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co and create a new company worth about $121 billion, in what would be the sector's biggest ever merger.
The deal would reshape the competitive landscape by forming a conglomerate which spans commercial aviation and defense procurement. United Technologies provides primarily commercial plane makers with electronics, communications and other equipment, whereas Raytheon mainly supplies the U.S. government with military aircraft and missile equipment.
While United Technologies and Raytheon have some common customers, their business overlap is limited, an argument the companies plan to make once U.S. antitrust regulators start scrutinizing the merger. 
However, the two major commercial aircraft makers, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE, as well as the Pentagon, have been known to use their significant purchasing power to seek concessions from their suppliers and may not welcome a potential lessening in competition among them.
When United Technologies rebuffed an acquisition offer from Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) in 2016, United Technologies chief executive Greg Hayes justified the decision partly by predicting that Boeing and Airbus would never accept having a supplier that would ""build the plane from tip to tail.""
United Technologies has said it is on track to separate its Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevator businesses, leaving the company focused on its aerospace business through its $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), which was completed in 2018, and the Pratt & Whitney engines business.
Chinese authorities scrutinized the acquisition of airplane parts maker Rockwell Collins closely, given the companies' footprint in that country's market. This resulted in the deal closing in November 2018, as opposed to the targeted third quarter.
Trade tensions between the United States and China were blamed at least partly by analysts for that delay, but a source close to the deal said the companies did not expect this to be repeated because Raytheon does not do business in China.
Under the deal announced on Sunday, Raytheon shareholders will receive 2.3348 shares in the combined company for each Raytheon share. The merger is expected to result in more than $1 billion in cost synergies by the end of the fourth year, the companies said.
United Technologies shareholders will own about 57% of the combined business, called Raytheon Technologies Corporation, which will be led by Hayes. Raytheon shareholders will own the remaining stake, and Raytheon CEO Tom Kennedy will be named executive chairman. The companies negotiated the terms over several months, according to the source, who requested anonymity discussing the confidential deliberations.
The deal has been structured so that no shareholder of either company will receive a premium. United Technologies and Raytheon have market capitalizations of $114 billion and $52 billion, respectively.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020.
The newly created company is expected to return between $18 billion and $20 billion of capital to shareholders in the first three years after the deal's completion, the companies said. The new company will also assume about $26 billion in net debt, they added.
DEFENSE SPENDING RISE
Raytheon, maker of the Tomahawk and the Patriot missile systems, and other U.S. military contractors are expected to benefit from strong global demand for fighter jets and munitions as well as higher U.S. defense spending in fiscal 2020, much of it driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
However, Pentagon spending is projected to slow down after an initial boost under Trump. A deal with United Technologies would allow Raytheon to expand into commercial aviation.
Conversely, United Technologies could benefit from reducing its exposure to commercial aerospace clients amid concerns that the rise of international trade protectionism will suppress economic growth and weigh on the flow of goods through air traffic.
The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 290 carriers accounting for more than 80% of global air traffic, cited these concerns earlier this month, when it said the industry is expected to post a $28 billion profit in 2019, down from a December forecast of $35.5 billion.
The deal with Raytheon could put pressure on  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, which competes with United Technologies for commercial aerospace clients, to seek scale. It could also push other defense contractors, such as  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), to explore expanding their commercial businesses.
Last year, military communication equipment providers Harris Corp (NYSE:HRS) and L3 Technologies Inc announced an all-stock merger that, once completed, will create the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Evercore Inc and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) were financial advisers to United Technologies, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was its legal adviser.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) was financial adviser to Raytheon, and RBC Capital Markets LLC provided a fairness opinion. Shearman & Sterling LLP was legal adviser to Raytheon.

826,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Futures Rise as Mexico Strikes Deal to Avert Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock-index futures rose after President Donald Trump announced late Friday that he would drop plans for tariffs on Mexico.
S&P 500 Index contracts gained 0.2% as of 10:03 a.m. in Tokyo, paring an earlier jump of as much as 0.8%, after Trump said that plans for a 5% tariff on Mexican goods had been “indefinitely suspended.” Dow Jones Industrial Average contracts advanced 0.2%, while those on the Nasdaq 100 added 0.3%. A retreat from haven assets weighed on the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
“The news of the deal with Mexico is likely to power global equities higher,” said Ben Emons, managing director for global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. “Averting tariffs on Mexican goods is a relief for the U.S. economy because it reduces uncertainty. It is positive for auto companies and other corporations that are highly leveraged to the Mexican border supply chain.”
U.S. stocks rallied for a fourth day on Friday amid speculation the Federal Reserve will move to cut interest rates to shore up the economy after a report showed employers added the fewest workers in three months and wage gains cooled.
“If there is one constant that keeps the S&P ticking, it’s the Federal Reserve cheap money,” Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy at SPI Asset Management, wrote in a note on Sunday.
The world’s largest stock market posted a monthly drop in May, snapping four months of gains, as concerns over corporate earnings accelerated on technology stocks and Trump threatened to more more than double tariffs on Chinese goods. The month ended with the U.S. president turning his tariff gun to Mexico.
Among U.S. equities, the automotive sector is the most at risk in the absence of a clear resolution to trade negotiations with Mexico. Retail, transportation, materials and industrial companies are also vulnerable.
As traders cheered the trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico, the wild card is still Trump. In a series of tweets on Sunday, he hinted at additional measure between both countries:
Yet, three Mexican officials said Saturday they were not aware of any side accord in the works, and that agricultural trade hadn’t been discussed during three days of negotiations in Washington that culminated in a joint communique late Friday.
“The deal is conditional upon farm purchases. Those were already agreed under the USMCA. So long as Mexico commits to cooperate in the asylum policy and uses additional forces and resources at the border to stem the migrant flow, markets will judge the deal as credible. That is what is playing out now,” Medley Global’s Emons said.

827,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",What the Market Rebound Really Means,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors heavily exposed to U.S. stocks just had their best week of the year. But the rebound also raised several questions related to market behavior, policy and economics. How they are answered will prove consequential not only for market prospects but for the global economy. And, notwithstanding the lack of decisive answers at this stage, there are already implications for investment portfolios.
Last week’s strong U.S. equity performance stood in stark contrast to two other market developments.
First, yields on government bonds fell across the board, driving the benchmark 10-year to below 2.10% and that on its German counterpart to minus 26 basis points. The moves are good news for stock investors if they foresee more dovish central bank policies -- but less so if they signal a lower global growth picture.
There is also uncertainty as to the repercussions of such low interest rates. Will they fuel “Japanification” in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. as households hold back on consumption and worry about shrinking access to long-term financial protection products, while companies hold back on investing? And how deep will the resulting damage be to the longer-term functioning of financial markets?
Another issue is the flood of investor money going into bond funds at such low interest rates. Is it a sign of appropriate, forward-looking risk-management or, instead, a backward-looking, pro-cyclical reaction that increases the vulnerability of investors to future losses?
The second big market anomaly relates to the performance of the higher risk asset classes known as “high beta.” It was notable that, given the sharp rise in U.S. stocks, quite a few of them, including important segments of emerging markets and high-yield corporate bonds, did not rally by as much as would be expected based on historical experience. Was this just a temporary phenomenon or the result of spreading concerns about the global economy? 
Turning to policies, there is a disconnect between the cuts now priced in by markets and the consensus justification for such an aggressive policy move by the Federal Reserve.
With the fall in yields, investors are pricing in interest rate cuts of 75-100 basis points over the next two quarters. That goes well beyond anything the Fed has signaled, or is likely to signal in the short-term. An “insurance cut” in interest rates is the most popular market justification for such a further dovish shift by the Fed. That is, rather than reacting to convincing evidence of a significant economic slowdown, the central bank would be building a buffer to counter the effects of trade tensions and weakness elsewhere, particularly in Europe.
Yet the 75-100 basis points priced in by markets goes well beyond an insurance cut, placing the Fed in a lose-lose situation: Either it fails to validate what markets expect or it ends up being forced to react to convincing evidence of a downturn. Neither would encourage market stability.
As I argued last week, the effectiveness of monetary policy is also an issue. The forces holding back growth, here and elsewhere, are not related to financial conditions (that is, the cost of borrowing and the availability of funding). Rather they reflect a series of structural and demand impediments to growth that lie outside the purview of monetary policy.
Continuing to rely on monetary policy to buy time, both for the economy and for other policymakers, is not without cost. While renewed central bank dovishness could succeed in elevating asset prices, that would only decouple them further from their underlying economic and corporate fundamentals. That hardly bodes well for the longer-term durability of investment gains or for financial stability.
Finally, the more the Fed cuts now, the smaller the ability of this policy instrument to counter future economic downturns. Policy rates are currently about half the average level of the cumulative reductions that have been required historically to counter economic weakness. The Fed balance sheet is also still large right now, while fiscally, the government is facing relatively high deficits and debt.
As regards trade, the other policy issue that attracts a lot of market attention, investors will be relieved by Friday night’s agreement between Mexico and U.S. negotiators. But the deal leaves an important residual uncertainty that could dampen corporates’ appetite to invest. After all, the US tariff threat against Mexico came on the heels of a recently renegotiated trade deal and it represents a clear case of weaponizing an economic tool.
These policy questions and, before them, those related to markets are amplified by two sets of numbers released last week.
The latest monthly data showed imports and exports both falling, raising questions about the health of global trade. Meanwhile, the politically sensitive trade deficit with China rose by 30% as U.S. exports to China fell 24% and imports grew by 12%. It remains to be seen whether this will aggravate already complicated and protracted China-U.S. negotiations, whose underlying drivers now extend beyond economics to national security issues.
Friday’s jobs report also surprised markets. This widely watched data release disappointed on account of shortfalls in both job creation, which was widespread among economic sectors, and wage growth. Moreover, there was no pickup in labor force participation.
Having said that, the report also looks less worrisome when viewed through a multi-month prism. As such, there is genuine uncertainty whether its weakness is a one-off phenomenon or, instead, reflective of more durable challenges to the impressive labor market performance that has underpinned household consumption and encouraged companies to invest.
Inability to answer all these questions with conviction at this stage is reflective of the clouds of uncertainty hanging over markets, policies and the economy. But that doesn’t mean there are no immediate implications for investment portfolios. Instead, there is enough unusual economic and financial fluidity to support the strategy of exploiting the recent rally by going up in quality while reducing overall risk exposures.
To the extent that the answers bode less well for the U.S. economy, too, they are likely to imply even larger challenges for the rest of the world. As such, it may not yet be time for investors to give up the multi-year bond and equity positioning that, in relative terms, has favored U.S. securities.

""The Woodford fund's inability to meet investor withdrawals raises a challenge as to whether the rules requiring assets to be liquid are working as they should"", Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, wrote in the Financial Times.
The FCA would look at the problems with Woodford's fund as it finalizes new rules on investment funds that let investors withdraw their money at any time, he said.
Woodford was forced to freeze his equity income fund as he could not sell some of its more illiquid assets quickly enough to meet a stream of redemption requests.
Open-ended investment funds like Woodford's are required to limit their holdings of unlisted assets to 10% of their overall portfolio. Woodford put some unlisted assets his fund held into vehicles and then listed them in Guernsey, raising questions as to whether he was flouting the spirit of such rules.
""Simply listing an unquoted company overseas does not in itself make the stock more liquid,"" Bailey wrote.
The FCA already was drawing up new rules on open-ended investment funds after a number of UK property funds suspended withdrawals after the 2016 Brexit referendum.
""We will take into account the lessons of the Woodford fund when finalizing these new rules,"" Bailey said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Eros International has taken steps to rectify delays in loan payments, Chief Executive Officer Kishore Lulla said on Sunday, as pressure builds on the Indian media company, with another short-seller report flagging potential issues at the company.
""All the steps have been taken to rectify the issues (around delayed loan payments),"" said Lulla, in a phone interview. ""And we have no loans, or debt due in the short-term.""
The company has seen its New York-listed shares plunge more than 55% last week, while those of its Indian subsidiary Eros International Media have sunk more than 30%, after an Indian rating agency categorized debt of Eros's Indian unit at ""default"" levels due to delays in loan payments.
CARE Ratings said on Wednesday it cut its rating ""on account of ongoing delays/default in debt servicing due to slowdown in collection from debtors, leading to cash flow issues.""
Eros' shares plunged despite assurances from the firm it was working to sort out the delayed payments. Even as it sought to calm investor concerns, Hindenburg Research - a short-seller, published a note on Friday, alleging potential wrongdoing at the company.
Lulla dismissed the allegations in the report and noted that this isn't the first time that the company is being targeted by a short-seller.

(Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc said Sunday it is extending cancellations of about 115 daily flights into September due to the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.
The largest U.S. airline had previously said it was cancelling flights Aug. 19 after the  Boeing Co  plane was grounded worldwide in March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. 
American Airlines said Sunday it is extending those cancellations through Sept. 3. Boeing has yet to complete a certification test flight and formally submit its software upgrade and training changes to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for approval.
Boeing said Sunday it is continuing ""to work with global regulators to provide them the information they need to certify the MAX update and related training and education material and safely return the fleet to service.""
The world's largest airplane manufacturer said it is ""partnering with our airline customers to maintain their planes in storage and will provide ‘entry into service’ type support once they are cleared to resume commercial operation.""
The FAA declined to comment on Sunday.
The FAA's acting chief, Dan Elwell, told reporters last month he does not have a specific timetable to unground the 737 MAX.
The plane was grounded in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash just months after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which together killed 346 people.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and United Airlines have canceled flights into August because of the grounding of the 737 MAX.
Asked last month it is realistic that the 737 MAX could be flying again by August, Elwell declined to be specific.
""If you said October I wouldn’t even say that, only because we haven’t finished determining exactly what the training requirements will be,"" Elwell said. “If it takes a year to find everything we need to give us the confidence to lift the (grounding) order so be it.""
Global airlines that had rushed to buy the fuel-efficient, longer-range aircraft have since canceled flights and scrambled to cover routes that were previously flown by the MAX.
Boeing hopes the software upgrade and associated pilot training will add layers of protection to prevent erroneous data from triggering a system called MCAS, which was activated in both the planes before they crashed.

The Regulatory Authority of Qatar Financial Center (QFC) said on Sunday it was prohibiting First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) from undertaking any new business for customers of its Doha branch. 
It has barred FAB from providing services for new customers since March but had allowed the bank to continue working with existing customers. QFC said in March that FAB had failed to produce documents relevant to the currency manipulation investigation. 
In a statement on Sunday, QFC said the new bar was ""because FAB continues to fail to satisfy the Regulatory Authority of its fitness and propriety in respect of its conduct in the QFC"".
A FAB spokeswoman said the bank had no immediate comment.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt started a trade and diplomatic boycott of Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies.
Qatar keeps its currency, the riyal, pegged at a fixed rate to the U.S. dollar, but saw it trade several percent weaker than its usual rate in offshore markets just after the dispute began.
Last year Qatar asked U.S. regulators to investigate the U.S. unit of FAB, accusing it of ""bogus"" foreign exchange deals designed to harm Qatar's economy. FAB denied the charge.

FUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - French finance minister Bruno Le Maire on Sunday said it was vital that  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan Motor strengthen their alliance as the auto industry undergoes rapid change in the areas of electric and connected vehicles.
Speaking after a meeting of G20 finance ministers in the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, Le Maire noted the synergies Renault has enjoyed with its Japanese partner which could help them take the lead in 21st century technologies.
""Looking at the past 20 years, we see that this quality of Renault has been reinforced by its partnership with Nissan,"" he told reporters.
""Therefore it is essential not only to preserve, but to strengthen this alliance. That has always been the strategy of the state and it remains the strategy of the state as shareholder.""
Le Maire said the previous day in an interview with Agence France Presse that the French government was ready to reduce its 15% stake in Renault in the interest of bolstering the automaker's alliance with Nissan Motor.
That comment came just days after Fiat Chrysler (FCA) withdrew its $35 billion merger offer for Renault blaming ""political conditions in France.""
The French government had welcomed the merger plan but went too far by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that exhausted the patience of FCA, sources told Reuters.
Le Maire did not answer directly when asked if he would discuss the topic of the government's Renault stake with his Japanese counterparts on a visit to Tokyo the next day.
""It's a long-term horizon. I think for now, it's wise to stick to the short and medium term,"" he said, reiterating the importance of beefing up the alliance.
Le Maire's visit to Japan comes amid a period of strained relations between Renault and Nissan, after the arrest of former boss and alliance architect Carlos Ghosn in November.
But the unequal relationship between them - smaller Renault has the bigger stake in Nissan - has long been a source of friction. Renault owns 43% of Nissan, while Nissan has a 15% stake in its French partner.

Le Maire will visit Tokyo on Monday to meet with business leaders and government officials including Finance Minister Taro Aso.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China summoned global technology companies for talks last week following last month's U.S. ban on selling technology to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
The blacklisting of Huawei, the world's largest maker of telecoms network equipment, bars U.S. companies from supplying it with many goods and services due to what Washington said were national security issues, a potentially crippling blow that sharply escalated U.S.-China trade tensions.
Huawei denies that its equipment poses a security threat.
Soon afterwards, Beijing announced it would release its own list of ""unreliable"" foreign entities. It also has hinted that it will limit its supply of rare earths to the United States.
A person at U.S. software giant  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said the company's session with Chinese officials was not a direct warning but it was made clear to the firm that complying with U.S. bans would likely lead to further complications for all sector participants.
The company was asked not to make hasty or ill-considered moves before the situation was fully understood, the person said, adding that the tone was conciliatory.
Microsoft declined to comment.
The New York Times first reported on the meetings led by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), saying major foreign tech firms were warned against complying with a U.S. ban on selling American technology to Chinese firms or potentially face what the newspaper described as dire consequences.
The NDRC did not immediately reply to a faxed request for comment from Reuters.
It is not unusual for China to summon representatives of foreign and domestic companies, sometimes in groups, to make its views heard.
One person with another U.S. tech company in China who was briefed by colleagues on the company's meeting told Reuters that the tone was ""much softer"" than expected.
""No mentioning of Huawei. No ultimatums. Just asked to stay in the country, contribute to the win-win negotiation,"" the person said, declining to be identified by name or company given the sensitivity of the matter. 
""I think they realize they still need U.S. tech and products for now; self-sufficiency will take a long time, and only after then they can kick us out,"" the person said.
The New York Times reported that other companies summoned for meetings last Tuesday and Wednesday included U.S. computer maker Dell Technologies Inc, South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inc, and British chip designer ARM, which last month halted supplies to Huawei. 
Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. Dell did not immediately respond on Sunday to an emailed request for comment and a spokesperson for ARM could not immediately be reached.
Separately, the editor of China's Global Times tabloid said on Saturday that Beijing was preparing to curb some tech exports to the United States. In a tweet, Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin said that China ""is building a management mechanism to protect China's key technologies.""
""This is a major step to improve its system and also a move to counter U.S. crackdown,"" he added. ""Once taking effect, some technology exports to the U.S. will be subject to the control.""
Hu did not cite any named sources in his tweet. The Global Times is a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.
Also on Saturday, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported that the NDRC would organize a study to establish a ""national technological security management list system"".

Last week, Reuters reported that  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) was no longer allowing pre-installation of its apps on Huawei smartphones.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",How much does lithium cost? The industry can't seem to agree,"By Ernest Scheyder
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Opaque pricing for lithium, the powerhouse metal fueling the electric vehicle revolution, is expected to be top of mind this week as the industry's leaders gather in Santiago, with calls rising for more transparency to attract much-needed expansion funding.
Unlike for copper or other metals used to make electric cars, there is no traded price for lithium. The London Metal Exchange is working to develop a tradable price for the white metal, but until then, the industry's investors, customers, analysts and executives are left without a full sense of the global market.
""The fact that there isn't a benchmark price means that some of the banks haven't been keen to get involved because they can't hedge their price risk,"" said William Adams, an analyst at Fastmarkets, which is hosting the Santiago conference and vying to be a pricing provider for the LME contract.
For now, the industry grabs on to whatever scuttlebutt it can find, with data swirling on prices for spodumene, a hard rock containing lithium; prices for hydroxide or carbonate, the two main types of lithium used in batteries; or prices paid by battery manufacturers across China, Japan and South Korea.
""You're almost forced to just take the average of the price estimates that are out there,"" said James Calaway, chairman of ioneer Ltd, which is developing a lithium project in Nevada.
While spot prices in China have dropped double digits since January due to uncertainty around the country's electric vehicle subsidies, such prices reflect only a portion of global demand. 
Some companies, including global leader Albemarle Corp, sell nearly all of their lithium on long-term contracts and are not influenced by Chinese spot prices, a distinction many on Wall Street do not seem to make. 
Albemarle's stock is down 12 percent since January.
""The China spot price is what the market is watching and until it picks up in a meaningful way, the sentiment will be negative,"" said Howard Klein, a lithium analyst and partner with New York-based advisory firm RK Equity. ""But the demand is there.""
SQM, which eschews long-term contracts, said its first-quarter lithium prices slipped 11 percent, leading it to pause expansion plans in Chile's Atacama desert.
Livent Corp, which operates in Argentina, cut its 2019 forecast and warned that demand was slipping for a version of lithium it produces in China, and would sell product elsewhere.
Since January, SQM's shares are down 19 percent and Livent's shares have lost 53 percent. 
“Investors are valuing the industry based on the worst they’re hearing from only a handful of companies, because they don't have a benchmark price to base analysis around,"" said Ernie Ortiz, president of Lithium Royalty Corp, an affiliate of Waratah Capital Advisors, which buys lithium royalty rights.
Many long-term supply contracts are already referencing an LME price, an anticipatory step designed to set future deal parameters, Ortiz said.
""The LME is continuing to pursue the launch of a lithium contract, in close partnership with industry users,"" said LME spokeswoman Bianca Blake. In addition to Fastmarkets, Argus and Benchmark Minerals are vying to supply lithium pricing data, and a decision is expected ""shortly,"" Blake said.
DEALS
Even with the price uncertainty, though, demand is spiking. Toyota Motor Corp, for example, plans to have half of its global sales come from electric vehicles by 2025.
The lithium industry's largest players are inking fresh expansion deals as a result. Albemarle last fall signed a $1.15 billion joint venture agreement with Mineral Resource Ltd to own and operate the Wodgina lithium mine in Western Australia, a deal that expands Albemarle's prowess with Asian customers. 
Ganfeng Lithium Co, which already has several Australian ventures, spent $160 million to boost its stake in an Argentina lithium project with Lithium Americas Corp. 
Tianqi Lithium Corp, in the world's largest lithium deal ever, paid $4.1 billion last year for a near-quarter stake in SQM, part of a push by Chinese companies for more lithium access.
But smaller and mid-tier players are finding it difficult to procure funding as potential financiers balk without a tradable lithium price, which would let them hedge their investment.
Neo Lithium Corp, ioneer, Standard Lithium Ltd, Sigma Lithium Resources Corp and other prospective lithium projects have all struggled to attract investors largely due to that price uncertainty.
""Greater transparency is severely needed,"" said Jake Fraser, a metals analyst with Roskill.
A traded lithium price would make conversations with potential customers or financiers much easier, said Carlos Vicens, finance chief at Neo Lithium, which is developing an Argentine lithium deposit.
""Our main focus is to get a financier, a strategic partner, to get this project into construction as soon as possible,"" Vicens said.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2019 10:26PM ET</span>",United Technologies nears deal to merge aerospace unit with Raytheon: source,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) is nearing a deal to merge its aerospace business with U.S. defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co and form a new company worth well over $100 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Saturday.
United Technologies and Raytheon are seeking to pool resources through what would be the biggest merger in the aerospace and defense sectors. 
United Technologies provides primarily commercial plane makers with equipment such as electronics and communications equipment, whereas Raytheon is a vendor mainly to the U.S. government for equipment in military aircraft and missiles.
The deal would be structured as an all-stock merger of equals because United Technologies would separately spin off its Carrier air conditioning business and Otis elevator division, as it has previously announced it would do, the source said.
If the negotiations between United Technologies and Raytheon are completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as Monday, the source added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
United Technologies declined to comment, while Raytheon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
United Technologies has a market capitalization of $114 billion, but without Carrier and Otis, its value could be less than $60 billion, bringing it closer to Raytheon's market capitalization of $52 billion.
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential deal, stating that United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes is expected to lead the newly created company, while Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy would be chairman.
Raytheon, maker of the Tomahawk and the Patriot missile systems, and other U.S. military contractors are expected to benefit from strong global demand for fighter jets and munitions as well as higher U.S. defense spending in fiscal 2020, a lot of it driven by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
However, Pentagon spending is projected to slow down after an initial boost under Trump. A deal with United Technologies would allow Raytheon to expand into commercial aviation, which does not rely on government spending like the defense sector.
Conversely, United Technologies could benefit from reducing its exposure to commercial aerospace clients amid concerns over the rise of protectionism in international trade. The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 290 carriers accounting for more than 80% of global air traffic, cited these concerns earlier this month, when it said that the industry is expected to post a $28 billion profit in 2019, down from a December forecast of $35.5 billion.
United Technologies has said it is on track to separate Carrier and Otis in the first half of 2020, leaving the company focused on its aerospace business through its $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), which was completed in 2018, and the Pratt & Whitney engines business.
CHINESE SCRUTINY
Chinese authorities scrutinized United Technologies' Rockwell Collins acquisition heavily, given its footprint in that country's market. This resulted in the deal closing in November 2018, as opposed to the third quarter of that year, which the companies initially targeted. 
Trade tensions between the United States and China were blamed at least partly by analysts for that delay, and it is not clear whether the deteriorating relations between the world's two largest economies could also weigh on the Raytheon deal.
United Technologies and Raytheon appear to have little overlap in their businesses, an argument the companies could make once U.S. antitrust regulators start scrutinizing their merger. However, major commercial aerospace companies, such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense, have been known to use their significant purchasing power to seek concessions from their suppliers. 
The deal with Raytheon could put pressure on  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, which also competes with United Technologies for commercial aerospace clients, to seek scale. It could also push other defense contractors, such as  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), to explore expanding their commercial businesses.
Last year, military communication equipment providers Harris Corp (NYSE:HRS) and L3 Technologies Inc announced an all-stock merger that, once completed this summer, will create the sixth-largest U.S. defense contractor.

United Technologies was previously a bigger player in the defense sector. But in 2015, it agreed to sell Sikorsky, the maker of military helicopter Black Hawk, to Lockheed Martin for $9 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will launch a new scheme to pay households producing energy from renewable sources, such as solar panels, for their surplus electricity, the government said on Sunday.
Around 800,000 homes in Britain have solar panels installed and the scheme will replace a feed-in-tariff system which ended in April. 
""The new smart export guarantee will ensure households that choose to become green energy generators will be guaranteed a payment for electricity supplied to the grid,"" Energy and Clean Growth minister Chris Skidmore said.
Monthly installation of new solar panels in Britain fell to a 9-year low in April, following the end of the feed-in-tariff scheme, provisional government data shows.
Under the new scheme, households will be paid for the power they produce by their energy supplier, which sets the prices offered.
""If households with panels and batteries can store electricity and sell it back to the grid when it is most needed we could see some homes with negative power bills,"" said Greg Jackson, CEO of British energy supplier Octopus, which is one of a small number of suppliers already offering an export tariff.
The new guarantee will apply to homes with up to 5 megawatts of renewable power capacity installed, with generation tracked by smart meters.
The government will set legislation for the scheme to become mandatory for any energy supplier with more than 150,000 customers from January 1 2020, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.

Challenger energy brand Bulb and E.ON also currently offer some customers export tariffs.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2019 04:58PM ET</span>",G20 agrees to push ahead with digital tax: communique,"By Stanley White and Jan Strupczewski
FUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - Group of 20 finance ministers agreed on Saturday to compile common rules to close loopholes used by global tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to reduce their corporate taxes, a copy of the bloc's draft communique obtained by Reuters showed. 
Facebook, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and other large technology firms face criticism for cutting their tax bills by booking profits in low-tax countries regardless of the location of the end customer. Such practices are seen by many as unfair. 
The new rules would mean higher tax burdens for large multinational firms but would also make it harder for countries like Ireland to attract foreign direct investment with the promise of ultra-low corporate tax rates.
""We welcome the recent progress on addressing the tax challenges arising from digitization and endorse the ambitious program that consists of a two-pillar approach,"" the draft communique said. ""We will redouble our efforts for a consensus-based solution with a final report by 2020.""
Britain and France have been among the most vocal proponents of proposals to tax big tech companies that focus on making it more difficult to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, and to introduce a minimum corporate tax.
This has put the two countries at loggerheads with the United States, which has expressed concern that U.S. Internet companies are being unfairly targeted in a broad push to update the global corporate tax code.
""The United States has significant concerns with the two corporate taxes proposed by France and the UK,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday at a two-day meeting of G20 finance ministers in the Japanese city of Fukuoka.
""It sounds like we have a strong consensus"" about the goals of tax reform, Mnuchin later said. 
""So now we need to just take the consensus across here and deal with technicalities of how we turn this into an agreement.""
Mnuchin spoke at a panel on global taxation at the G20 after the French and British finance ministers voiced sympathy with his concerns that new tax rules do not discriminate against particular firms.
Big Internet companies say they follow tax rules but have paid little tax in Europe, typically by channeling sales via countries such as Ireland and Luxembourg, which have light-touch tax regimes.
The G20's debate on changes to the tax code focus on two pillars that could be a double whammy for some companies.
The first pillar is dividing up the rights to tax a company where its goods or services are sold even if it does not have a physical presence in that country.
If companies are still able to find a way to book profits in low tax or offshore havens, countries could then apply a global minimum tax rate to be agreed under the second pillar.
The path to a final agreement is still fraught with difficulty because of disagreement on a common definition of a digital business and on how to distribute tax authority among different countries.
""There are differences between the United States and United Kingdom over pillar one. As for pillar two, there are also differences in views within the Group of 7,"" said a senior Japanese finance ministry official present at the G20.
The G7 likely will not issue any communique at a meeting of the world's leading economic powers next month, according to the official. Still, several finance ministers at the G20 said on Saturday they needed to act quickly to correct unfair corporate tax codes or risk being punished by voters.
""We cannot explain to a population that they should pay their taxes when certain companies do not because they shift their profits to low-tax jurisdictions,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said during the panel discussion.
The U.S. government has voiced concern in the past that the European campaign for a ""digital tax"" unfairly targets U.S. tech giants.
After listening to presentations by Le Maire and British finance minister Philip Hammond, Mnuchin said on Saturday G20 countries should issue ""marching orders"" to their respective finance ministries to negotiate the technical aspects of a deal.

Earlier this year, countries and territories agreed a roadmap aimed at overhauling international tax rules that have been overtaken by the development of digital commerce.

In a ruling over jurisdiction between PG&E and counterparties to the agreements, Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco said on Friday that the interpretation of bankruptcy law and decree by the FERC was unauthorized and ""continues to have the effect of undermining the function of the bankruptcy court in its role of ensuring that the goals and purposes of bankruptcy law and policy are properly served and properly executed.""
Montali ruled that the FERC has no ""concurrent jurisdiction"" over determining whether Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation can reject power contracts, and added that they did not need approval from the FERC to reject their purchase power contracts.
 NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE), a party to eight power purchase agreements through subsidiaries, had argued the contracts are also subject to FERC's jurisdiction. 
According to NextEra, legal disputes over the agreements belong in district court because nonbankruptcy federal laws regulating interstate commerce must be considered.
San Francisco-based PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January in the face of liabilities it estimated at more than $30 billion in the aftermath of November's Camp Fire, California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire in modern times.
PG&E and NextEra did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2019 04:05AM ET</span>",Wall St. Week Ahead: Top U.S. bond managers betting bond market still has room to run,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. bond fund managers are betting that the steep gains in Treasuries over the last month are here to stay. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rate have dropped to near 2.10% after rising as high as 2.55% as recently as May 2 as fears of escalating trade wars and slowing global economic growth have spooked equity markets and sent investors to the safety of bonds. Bonds yields fall as security prices rise, leaving investors with capital appreciation gains.
But instead of seeing the recent rally as just a fear trade, fund managers from firms including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management and Sierra Investment Management say they are still buying Treasuries in anticipation of additional interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve to try to revive inflation amid a slowing economy.
The near $16-trillion sector produced a total return of 2.35% in May, its strongest monthly showing since August 2011, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg and  Barclays  (LON:BARC). Long-dated Treasuries generated a stellar 6.7% return, their juiciest performance since January 2015.
""We haven't gotten the inflation engine going and I don't think we will,"" said Margie Patel, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management. ""It's a horrible outcome for fixed-income investors who have been spoiled for 30 years and now they're facing a complete yield drought that will probably get worse,"" she said, adding that a fall in the yield of the 10-year Treasury to 1.5% over the next year ""would not be out of the question."" 
The core consumer price index increased at an annual rate of 1.6% in April, well below the Fed's target rate of 2%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the central bank is watching the fallout from the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China and will react as ""appropriate.""
Bob Miller, a portfolio manager and head of U.S. multi-sector fixed income at BlackRock, said he expects the Fed to cut interest rates by 50 basis points by the end of this year because of slowing global economic growth. 
""The challenge is that the rest of the world is doing worse than expectations from six months ago, with Europe being particularly soggy over the last year. With the rest of the world proving disappointing and U.S. growth already decelerating, I think you will see the Fed respond,"" he said. 
As a result, Miller said he still sees value in the benchmark 10-year Treasury, as well as intermediate notes that mature in three to seven years. If the Fed does cut rates, that could lead to opportunities in higher-quality emerging market debt in countries with good structural fundamentals, he said.
A prolonged rally in bonds could mean the end of the bull market in equities, which had sent the benchmark S&P 500 index up as much as 16% for the year-to-date in April and continued to push Treasury yields lower. 
“The growth backdrop is deteriorating. The U.S. economy was expected to slow, but the risk is that it will slow more than previously expected,” and eat into corporate earnings, Miller said.
After its strong start for the year, the S&P 500 is down nearly 4% since the start of May as the United States and China remain at an impasse over trade and tariffs. Further declines in the U.S. equity market could bring more waves of buyers into the bond market, further pushing yields lower, said Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Sierra Investment Management. 
""There's a perception with U.S. stocks that they can go quickly from flawless to hopeless, and since May 1 it's been more hopeless for stocks,"" she said. 
Spath said she is continuing to put assets into long-term Treasury bonds and has zero of her portfolio in cash, after having as much as 80 percent in cash during the steep selloffs in both the equity and fixed-income markets in November. 

""I'm not hiding under my desk yet because of a fear of a recession,"" she said, ""but I think there's room for yields to go even lower."" 
 
"
845,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 08, 2019 03:02AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. China in Danger of a Double Dip in Growth?
While much of the focus has been on the U.S. economy and the possibility the Federal Reserve will dive in with interest rate cuts to keep growth going, investors shouldn’t ignore the other side of the big trade dispute.
China is in danger of a double dip in slowing growth, Morgan Stanley said this week.
Citing trade tensions Morgan Stanley has already cut its fourth-quarter China GDP forecast by 20 basis points to an annual rate of 6.4% from 6.6%. It also cut its full-year 2019 forecast to 6.4% from 6.5%.
The country posted a surprise first-quarter growth rate of 6.4%, holding steady from the fourth quarter of 2018 and topping forecasts for GDP growth of 6.3%. That followed third-quarter 2018 growth of 6.5% and second-quarter growth of 6.7%.
But with the trade war, there’s the possibility of growth dipping down again.
“The time window for China and the U.S. to address trade tensions is narrowing,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. “If trade talks stall post G20, we see further downside risks to growth.”
“If the US imposes 25% tariffs on the remaining (approximately) US$300 billion of imports from China, China’s GDP growth could decelerate to 6.0% in 2019 despite more aggressive stimulus, with quarterly growth dropping below 6.0% (annually) by 2H19.”
With regard to the new tariffs, President Donald Trump said Thursday he “will make that decision in the next two weeks after the G20.”
“I will be meeting with President Xi (Jinping) and we’ll see what happens, we’re probably planning it sometime after G20,” Trump said.
2. Powell Pivot Not the Only Reason Stocks Will Remain in Vogue
Friday's rally in stocks on a weak U.S. jobs report marked a throwback to the post-crisis era, when signs of economic woes were met with cheers amid expectations the Fed would show up and ease, ease, ease.
But even if the Fed fails to deliver a rate cut, stocks will likely remain hot as the plunge in Treasury yields leaves investors with little choice to go elsewhere, analysts say.
The 10-year Treasury yield slumped to a 21-month low of 2.065% on Friday, falling below the average dividend return of an S&P 500 stock at 2.078%. More than 44% of S&P 500 stocks yield more than 10-year government bonds, according to FactSet.
Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, told MarketWatch that it was ""unusual"" that the 10-year yield is so close to the S&P 500.
""With yields this low, you don’t even have to be particularly optimistic about the economy” to buy equities, he added.
The spread between the 3-month bill yield and the 10-year note yield stood at about negative 17 basis points, continuing an inversion of the yield curve that resurfaced weeks ago.
""They’ve been driven largely by trade, (and) maybe some other risk-off factors,"" said Michael Schumacher, managing director and global head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.
""But it’s really that deviation between the Fed on the very front end and risk-off concerns on the back end. That’s why the curve is inverted in our view, and that’s why we think it’s not really a recession predictor at this point.""
3. Monopoly Pricing Doesn’t Equal Inflation
The issue of market competition came to the fore recently with signs that the government may move to curb the dominance of tech powerhouses like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
This week the Richmond Fed issued a report on whether markets were less competitive. As with most complex, hot-button issues, a definitive conclusion wasn’t reached, with the Richmond Fed saying the explanations of market concentration and price markups don’t all “point to a commensurate increase in market power.”
But also in the report was a good explanation for rate watchers on how monopolistic companies boosting markups (the ratio between price and cost) wouldn’t necessarily raise inflation concerns at the central bank.
“Inflation is a measure of rising prices generally, but markups measure how much individual firms set prices above their costs,” the Richmond Fed said. “Thus, it is possible for markups to rise because firms facing little competition are able to set prices high or because efficient firms have found ways to reduce their costs while keeping prices stable.”
“It also may be difficult to discern a connection between markups and inflation if the Fed is pursuing monetary policy that offsets inflationary pressure from markups,” it added.
Still a “recent study found that ‘the welfare costs of markups are large,’ primarily because they act as a tax on output,” the Richmond Fed said."
846,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2019 02:29AM ET</span>",France prepared to cut Renault stake to bolster deal with Nissan: AFP,"(Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France is ready to cut its stake in  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) in order to consolidate Renault's partnership with Nissan Motor Co, Agence France Press (AFP) reported on Saturday.
Le Maire said Paris, which has a 15% stake in Renault, might consider reducing its stake, if it led to a ""more solid"" alliance between the Japanese and French firms, the French news agency reported, citing an interview with the minister.
""We can reduce the state's stake in Renault's capital. This is not a problem as long as, at the end of the process, we have a more solid auto sector and a more solid alliance between the two great car manufacturers Nissan and Renault,"" he told AFP.
Le Maire had earlier said the French government was open to tie-ups involving Renault as long as French industrial interests were protected, and would consider any Renault deal with Fiat Chrysler that respected the French firm's alliance with its Japanese partner Nissan.
Fiat on Thursday abandoned its $35 billion merger offer for Renault, blaming French politics for scuttling what would have been a landmark deal to create the world's third-biggest automaker behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
The French government had welcomed the merger plan, but overplayed its hand by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that eventually exhausted the patience of FCA, sources told Reuters.

Renault and Nissan were not immediately available to respond to a request seeking comment.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 09:38PM ET</span>","Under tariff threat, Mexico less attractive to companies avoiding China trade war","By Anthony Esposito
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A flood of companies eyeing Mexico as a safe haven from the U.S. trade war with China risks evaporating after President Donald Trump last week threatened to unleash tariffs on Mexico too. 
News of Trump's tariff plan has battered the Mexican peso and cast doubt over the future ratification of a new North American trade agreement, a treaty overhauled during months of agonizing talks previously demanded by the U.S. president.
Just when companies thought that trade deal had made Mexico a tempting manufacturing alternative to China, Washington's new threats have thrown several off balance again.
Take the recent experience of outsourcing firm Tecma Group, which saw a surge in interest from companies mulling a move to Mexico as Trump raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
Tecma, which manages some 75 factories in Mexico, had been approached ""every week"" by companies selling items from furniture to ink pens seeking a pathway out of China and into Mexico, according to Alan Russell, its chief executive and chairman.
Now, after Trump vowed to introduce escalating tariffs of 5% on all Mexican exports to the United States from Monday if Mexico does not contain a surge in migrants to the U.S. border, those hoped-for investments are at risk of being frozen, Russell says. 
""A board of directors is not going to say, 'Yeah let's do this' in the face of a 25% tariff,"" Russell said.
There are few available numbers to gauge how widespread the shift to Mexico from China has been. But data showing Mexico emerging as the top U.S. trading partner as China exports less to the United States, combined with anecdotal evidence, suggest a significant trend. 
Fuling Global Inc, a specialized plastic and paper producer, that is starting up a manufacturing operation in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, has suffered from similar whiplash.
The company said in an April letter that the planned plant would ""help reduce much of the impact of the China-U.S. trade changes.""
That now sounds outdated, but the company downplayed concerns about Trump's latest shift.
""Whatever we are doing in Mexico is for our company's long-term strategic growth ... If we produce in Mexico we'll a save a lot on freight and it will reduce the time for delivery. It's a huge advantage,"" said CFO Gilbert Lee.
If Trump makes good on his tariff threat, Lee said Fuling and its customers would initially bear the burden of the costs, but eventually ""consumers are going to have to pay for this.""
Similarly, camera maker GoPro Inc decided in early May to move most of its U.S.-bound production to Mexico from China to ""insulate us against possible tariffs,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian McGee told investors at the time.
A GoPro spokesman said the company is now ""watching closely"" as talks to strike an immigration deal continue. 
In a sign that such cases were part of a wider surge of interest in Mexico manufacturing, the bi-national industrial Southwest Maquila Association said it had heard in the last six months from around 10 firms expressing interest in investing in Mexico, up from only 3 or 4 the prior six months, according to Gustavo Gonzalez, the organization's president.
""AMERICA'S BACKYARD""
In fact, Mexico overtook both China and Canada in the first quarter of 2019 to become the U.S.'s top trading partner in goods, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Shipments from Mexico to the United States grew 5.4% in the first quarter while those from China contracted 13.9%, it showed.
Bank UBS said Mexico had taken market share from China by selling products from a September 2018 U.S. tariff list. 
Firms already established in Mexico are worried but say it is too early to gauge the impact of the new spat.
Among them are manufacturers like LG Electronics, which migrated years ago to build TVs in Mexico using imported parts and ship them to the United States tariff-free under NAFTA.
The potential for U.S. tariffs on all imports from Mexico could jolt that supply chain and others like it.
The tariff uncertainty could prompt companies to put their Mexican investment decisions on hold, said Gabriela Soni, UBS Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer for Mexico. 

""But if it's only a 5% tariff instead of 25% it might not be a game changer because the peso has also depreciated,"" she said.

Last month, the company said it would restate financial reports for a near three-year period to fix errors that resulted from lapses in procurement practices by some of its employees.
Kraft Heinz said it expects to report its delayed first-quarter results on or before July 31. 
The company's shares, which have fallen nearly 33% so far this year, rose about 3% in after hours trading. 
The packaged foods company, in a long overdue annual regulatory filing on Friday, said a United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois is reviewing this matter. 
Kraft Heinz had disclosed a SEC subpoena in February. Thereafter, the company initiated an investigation into the procurement practices. 
As a result of the internal investigation and material weaknesses spotted, Kraft Heinz said it is taking steps to improve internal policies and would strengthen internal control in financial reporting.
""We are pleased that Kraft Heinz is returning to a path of normalization,"" Kraft Heinz Chairman Alex Behring said.
Kraft Heinz also said it has elected Joao Castro-Neves, a former Anheuser-Busch InBev executive, to its board. 

In April, the company named Miguel Patricio, a former marketing executive at AB InBev, as its chief executive officer.

The executives were arrested in November 2017 after being called into a meeting at the Caracas office of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, which owns Citgo. They were accused of crimes including embezzlement and money laundering in connection with a never-concluded refinancing agreement.
A Caracas-based court ruled that the six will remain in jail during trial, Venezuela's supreme court said on its website.
Family members of Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Zambrano, Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell, Gustavo Cardenas and Jose Pereira have asked the U.S. government to intervene, citing health concerns for the men.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and two senators have called for their release
Venezuelan Nicolas President Maduro in 2017 began a corruption crackdown at PDVSA that led to dozens of executives being jailed, including former Citgo and PDVSA President Nelson Martinez. Martinez died in custody in December.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",U.S. retail employment slides to a three-year low in May,"By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A disappointing U.S. jobs report for May was particularly bleak for one sector in particular: American retailers.
U.S. retail employment in May fell for the fourth straight month to a three-year low, the Labor Department said on Friday. The industry got hit with store closures and job cuts, and traditional chains faced increased competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The weakness of retail sector numbers stood out in a monthly U.S. employment report that fell well short of expectations overall, reflecting a broad-based cooling off in hiring by U.S. companies even as the national unemployment rate sits near a 50-year low.
While economists were hopeful that overall hiring might recover in the months ahead, the situation in the retail space is not expected to improve any time soon.
""I think that (the decline in retail jobs) has less to do with the broader economy and more to do with what's happening with technology and how people's shopping behavior has changed,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis' chief economist for the Americas.
(GRAPHIC-U.S. retail employment stalls link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QVzEPE).
LaVorgna said the general merchandise category, which includes department stores, experienced the biggest drop in retail employment over the last 12 months. Employment at department stores fell by 29,000 to a record low between May 2018 and May 2019. 
A handful of major, once-storied U.S. retail names have collapsed in the past several years from Toys 'R' Us to Sears Holdings Corp, and others have slashed jobs and closed hundreds of stores in hopes of reinventing themselves and adapting to changing consumer tastes.
Last week, Abercrombie & Fitch Co said it would close three flagship stores, including a Hollister store in New York's SoHo.
Department store operator J.C. Penney Company Inc announced this year it would close 27 stores in 2019. Seven years ago Penney employed nearly 160,000 people, according to its annual reports; today fewer than 100,000 work at the chain.
(GRAPHIC-Vanishing U.S. department store jobs link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTIIdm).
""It's important to note that BLS data does not accurately reflect the changing retail workforce and only counts store jobs, missing jobs that are added in warehousing, call centers and distribution centers to meet the rise of ecommerce,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said. 
Reflecting that trend, so-called non-store retail jobs - many at online outlets like Amazon - have risen by 12,000 in the year through May and are now at a record high.
Job recruitment site and marketplace ZipRecruiter's labor economist, Julia Pollak, said she has seen the average number of monthly retail postings fall about 15 percent and the average monthly number of clicks on retail job postings fall nearly 45 percent since the start of the year.
""You don't see many kids coming out of university saying 'I want to go into retail,' said Allen Adamson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.
""People are lined up to put on a hoodie and go into technology,"" he said.

Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $7.24 a share, above expectations from Investing.com for earnings of $7.09 a share. Revenue of $958 million was just below expectations for $959 million. Its shares rallied 8.7%.
Lift revenue, a closely watched metric, rose 16.4%, thanks to stronger pass sales coming into the season and greater attendance by visitors without passes.
The company reported a 14.3% increase in visitation for the quarter, underpinned by a long ski season that helped drive extra traffic to the company's resorts.
""Our Colorado, Utah, and Tahoe resorts experienced strong local and destination visitation throughout the third fiscal quarter,"" CEO Robert Katz said in a statement.
That was driven by ""favorable conditions across the western U.S., which also allowed for an extension of the ski season for select resorts in Colorado and Tahoe,"" Katz added.
Following the strong end to the skiing season, Vail touted optimism for the coming quarter, raising its profit expectations.
For fiscal 2019, the mountain resort operator expects net income of $277 million to $297 million, against $268 million to $300 million previously. That is above Capital IQ estimates for net profit of $290 million for the year. Earnings (EBITDA) for the full fiscal year are expected to be between $700 million to $710 million."
857,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 04:49PM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Rallies on Hopes for Lower Rates, Easing Trade Tensions","Investing.com - Stocks soared to their highest levels in the last four weeks, in part because of perceived bad news about the economy that could lead to lower interest rates and hopes that Mexico and the United States can strike a deal over border security.
The result was that the S&P 500 closed up 1%, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.66%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1%, led by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Microsoft, up 2.8%, finished with a market capitalization of about $1 trillion, tops among U.S. stocks. Today was Microsoft's second close with a $1-trillion market cap this year. The first was in April when the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 all hit record highs.
The major averages finished with the biggest one-week gains since November, with the S&P 500 up 4.5%, the Nasdaq up 4% and the Dow up 4.8%. The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% from its April peak. The Nasdaq is still off 5.22% from its April high. The Dow is still off 3.48% from its October 2018 all-time high,
The rally, pushed along by heavy computerized trading, was fueled by bad news. May nonfarm payrolls grew by only 75,000 while the national unemployment rate held at 3.6%, same as in April. Growth in payrolls has slowed slowly but surely since last summer, with economists suggesting the cause is the fading effects of the Trump tax bills.
The weak report increased speculation the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to help the economy. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool suggests an 80% chance of lower rates by September. The Fed's key rate is 2.25% to 2.5%. Interest rates moved lower. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.084%, the lowest level since November 2016, ahd the dollar fell against major currencies.
There was good news, too, in the possibility of some sort of deal so the Trump administration won't impose new tariffs on goods shipped to the US from Mexico.



Oil prices also moved higher by more than 2% in part because Saudi Arabia was pushing for production cuts among OPEC members and their allies for the rest of the year. Crude oil WTI futures finished up 2.66% to $53.99 barrel. Brent, the global benchmark, was up 2.63% to $63.29 a barrel.
The rally was big and especially broad among tech stocks. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were responsible for about 55% of the Nasdaq-100's 1.94% gain.
The week ahead doesn't have a lot of market-moving events on schedule. The biggest earnings report is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), due after Thursday's close and the May report on retail sales, due before Friday's open.
That said, the ongoing battles over trade and tariffs will be front and center next week and could well induce more volatility."

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co learned that a cockpit warning light on its 737 MAX jetliner was defective in 2017 but decided to defer fixing it until 2020, U.S. lawmakers said on Friday.
The defective warning light alerts pilots when two sensors that measure the angle between the airflow and the wing disagree. Faulty ""angle of attack"" data is suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes involving Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia in March.
Those crashes, which killed 346 people, have triggered investigations by aviation regulators and U.S. lawmakers and left Chicago-based Boeing facing one of the biggest crises in its more than 100-year history.
Boeing decided in November 2017 to defer a software update to correct the so-called AOA Disagree alert defect until 2020, three years after discovering the flaw, U.S. Congressmen Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen said in a press release on Friday. Boeing only accelerated this schedule after the Lion Air accident in Indonesia, they added.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said by email that a company safety review found the absence of the AOA Disagree alert did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation.
""Based on the safety review, the update was scheduled for the MAX 10 entry into service in 2020,"" Johndroe said. ""We fell short in the implementation of the AoA Disagree alert and are taking steps to address these issues so they do not occur again.""
Boeing has said it discovered the problem in 2017, soon after it began delivering its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft to customers. But it did not inform the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about the defect until after the Lion Air crash more than one year later, the lawmakers said.
The House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure sent letters to Boeing, supplier United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) and the FAA requesting further details on the AoA Disagree alert, the lawmakers said.

The letter was the second such records request sent by the committee to Boeing and the FAA related to its investigation into the MAX aircraft.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 04:35PM ET</span>","Wall St. rallies on hopes of U.S. rate cut, trade progress","By Sinéad Carew
New York (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes charged higher on Friday, as sharply slowing U.S. job growth boosted hopes for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts while optimism about potential progress in U.S. trade fights with China and Mexico added to risk appetites. 
Investors bet that labor market weakness would give the Fed a reason to provide the economy with more support, pushing the S&P 500 and the Dow to their biggest weekly gains since the end of November, right before a massive year-end sell-off. 
A Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 75,000 jobs last month, much smaller than the 185,000 additions estimated by economists in a Reuters poll, suggesting the loss of momentum in economic activity was spreading to the labor market.
As a result traders raised bets for a rate cut in July followed by two more rate cuts by year-end. 
""The jobs report indicates there's some weakness but the economy does remain relatively robust at this point,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
Investors are putting weak jobs ""in the context that it might result in a more timely Fed action which would be more supportive than if they wait too long,"" he said.
But others noted that investors appeared to give more weight to Fed policy than economic data. 
""Right now the market is willing to accept disappointing growth in exchange for the prospect of lower rates,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago. ""We're addicted to low rates and we're willing to forsake our economic growth in exchange for those low rates.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 263.28 points, or 1.02%, to 25,983.94, the S&P 500 gained 29.85 points, or 1.05%, to 2,873.34 and the Nasdaq Composite added 126.55 points, or 1.66%, to 7,742.10.
Also adding to investor enthusiasm on Friday was a notice from U.S. officials granting Chinese exporters two more weeks to get their products to the United States before raising tariffs on those items. U.S. and Chinese leaders are expected to meet late in June at the G20 meeting.
But while U.S. President Donald Trump said there was a ""good chance"" of a US-Mexico trade deal, if the two countries failed to make an agreement he plans to impose a 5% tariff on Mexican imports on Monday.
Mexican sources told Reuters late Friday that negotiators are battling to reach agreement over a U.S. demand that Mexico accept more asylum seekers.
""An interest rate cut is being priced into the market, but in order to go higher you do need to get progress on the trade front because in the longer term that is the bigger issue for markets,"" said Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James in Baltimore, Maryland.
The S&P's biggest boosts on the day were  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Technology stocks, among the hardest hit due to the recent escalation in trade tensions, rose 2% and provided the biggest boost of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors. Chipmakers, which get a major portion of their revenue from China, also gained, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.2%.
However, tariff-sensitive industrials underperformed slightly with a 0.9% gain. 
Interest-rate sensitive bank stocks dropped 0.98%. The only major S&P sectors in the red were the broader financial index, down 0.19%, and a defensive favorite, utilities, which fell 0.77%.
""If people are thinking the Fed action is going to support the economy you don't have the safe haven mission for utilities coming into play,"" said Oakbrook's Jankovskis. 
Beyond Meat Inc shares closed up 39.4% at $138.65 after the maker of plant-based burgers said it expects to more than double its revenue and report breakeven EBITDA this year. It went public at $25 on May 2. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.93-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 116 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 99 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 6.48 billion shares changed hands compared with the 7.04 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on Friday the retailer was concerned that fresh produce prices would rise if tariffs are placed on imports from Mexico. 
""We are concerned about that category ... We don't want prices going up on those fresh items for customers and we will resist it as long as we can but we can't tell when those prices have to go up,"" McMillon told reporters at Walmart's shareholders' meeting. 
""If the customer is focused on avocado prices, we will hold those prices for as long as we can and focus elsewhere.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose levies starting at 5% on June 10 if the Mexican government does not agree to do more to tackle an increase in mostly Central American migrants crossing Mexico to enter the United States. 
On Friday, Trump said there was a ""good chance"" the United States would be able to reach a deal with Mexico over migration, although his administration was still pushing ahead with a plan to slap import tariffs on its southern neighbor next week. 
McMillon comments come as retailers are preparing for an increase in prices after the Trump tariffs on imports from China.
Walmart will change sourcing bases on products when possible, he said.
""Where we can change sourcing, whether it's Mexico, it's China, we will but where we can't we just have to deal with it and find places where we can cut costs in the near term,"" he said.
McMillon did not give details on how much Walmart procures from China or Mexico.
On Thursday, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran told Reuters the impact from tariffs on imports from Mexico will be ""significant"" for Walmart. He declined to share additional details.
HOPING FOR RESOLUTION WITH CHINA
Walmart also said it hopes the United States and China find a way to work together. It is in the best U.S. interest to do so because China offers a ""tremendous business opportunity,"" McMillon said.
Last month the retailer said prices would rise for shoppers due to tariffs on Chinese imports.
""Trade overall has been good for Americans, good for consumers ... and I realize it gets criticized at times,"" said McMillon, urging a focus on how trade helps a broad number of people in the country and ""not just those it harms.""
Walmart has spent time talking to both governments and is trying to encourage things to work out ""in ways we can but we don’t control that,"" he added.

The retailer also said it has so far seen no impact from trade wars on businesses in China and Mexico. Mexico is Walmart's largest international market in terms of stores and revenue outside the United States.

On Thursday, Fitch cut the credit rating of Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, from investment grade to speculative grade, or ""junk,"" with a negative outlook, a day after it downgraded Mexico's sovereign debt.
(See graphic on Pemex's massive debt. https://graphics.reuters.com/MEXICO-PEMEX/010091NG2K0/index.html)
Moody's rates the company's bonds one notch above junk. If the agency also downgrades Pemex's debt, it could result in as much as $16 billion of forced selling by investors whose mandates stipulate they must hold bonds of investment-grade quality.
Fitch's downgrade highlighted Pemex's ailing finances and dealt a blow to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's ambitions to revive the world's most indebted oil company, with $106 billion in financial debt.
""A downgrade by Moody's is a high probability, absent a change in policy by the Mexican government which results in lowering the taxes they get from Pemex,"" said Shamaila Khan, director at asset manager AllianceBernstein's emerging market debt strategies. 
Several Pemex bonds claimed the top spots on the most-actively traded list among emerging market issues, according to MarketAxess.
Spreads on Pemex bonds, a measure of the premium investors demand for holding its debt relative to safer assets like U.S. Treasuries, gapped out to their widest in five months on Friday. 
Pemex dollar-denominated bonds due in January 2024 dropped more than 2.5 points in price and its yield climbed nearly 65 basis points to 5.68%, according to Refinitiv data.
In the two days since Fitch cut Mexico's sovereign rating, largely reflecting concerns about Pemex, the yield on the 2024 bonds has climbed 96.5 basis points, the biggest two-day rise on record for the $1.5 billion bond. 
Pemex said in a statement the downgrade would pose no risk to its debt refinancing plan and that it continued to gain support from international financial institutions for refinancing.
Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, accused ratings agencies of ignoring Pemex's woes during past administrations. 
""We respect their point of view, but feel they weren't professional, they weren't objective,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at his daily morning news conference. 
Lopez Obrador has blamed the Pemex problems on the ""neoliberal"" policies of previous governments. A Reuters analysis of Pemex accounts from the past 10 years showed the firm's financial debt surged by 75% during the six-year term of Lopez Obrador's predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Mexico's government in May unveiled measures to help Pemex with its debts and gradually reduce its tax burden, but investors are largely skeptical the government will be able to engineer a complete turnaround without more drastic measures.
The company's total obligations, including pensions, today exceed its assets by more than $70 billion.
""We would say there are even odds for a second downgrade in 2020,"" said James Barrineau, head of emerging markets debt relative at asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR).

The reason: the last trade dispute with the U.S.
When the U.S. imposed anti-dumping penalties on solar panels imported from China under President Barack Obama, Trina built factories in Thailand and Vietnam to serve American customers, said Steven Zhu, Trina’s president for the Americas region. Hence, none of the modules Trina sends to the U.S. come from China. Other solar companies, he said, have developed similar workarounds, limiting the current trade spat’s effects.
“The impact on U.S. solar -- you won’t see that much,” Zhu said in an interview Friday. “What happens has already happened.”
Output from Trina’s Thailand and Vietnam factories are subject to a 20% U.S. tariff that President Donald Trump has already imposed on solar imports. But it’s not big enough to move manufacturing to the U.S., Zhu said.
“We did the calculation before, and still keep evaluating,” he said. “The operation cost is still a little bit higher, in terms comparing with Thailand, Vietnam and even Mexico.”
Despite uncertainty over trade, Zhu said he expects solar sales to continue to grow, including in the U.S. Texas, he said, is now the hottest domestic market for large-scale solar installations, eclipsing California."

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co will pay customers at least $386 million to settle class-action claims that the bank signed them up for auto insurance they did not want or need when they took out car loans.
The proposed settlement was disclosed in filings on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, California, and requires a judge's approval.
National General Insurance Co, an underwriter, will pay an additional $7.5 million, making the total customer payout at least $393.5 million, according to the filings.
Wells Fargo denied wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid the risks, cost and distraction of litigation, and has set aside enough money for the payout. The defendants will also pay up to $36.5 million for the customers' legal costs, court papers showed.
In an email, Wells Fargo called the settlement ""an important step in making things right for customers.""
""We will continue sending individualized letters to customers that clearly set out the remediation amount due to them, as well as a check for that amount,"" it added.
Lawyers for the customers did not immediately respond to requsets for comment.
Wells Fargo is trying to rebuild trust after being beset since September 2016 by a series of scandals over how it treats customers, including by wrongly charging an estimated 600,000 auto loan borrowers for insurance. [nL2N1X51T4}
In April 2018, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $1 billion to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to settle U.S. probes of the San Francisco-based bank's auto insurance and mortgage practices.
Wells Fargo remains unable to expand under restrictions imposed in February 2018 by the Federal Reserve until the bank, the nation's fourth-largest by assets, cleans up its culture and oversight.
Thursday's settlement covers Wells Fargo customers charged for ""collateral protection insurance"" between Oct. 15, 2005 and Sept. 30, 2016.
The complaint said Wells Fargo's wrongful practices caused nearly 275,000 customers to become delinquent and nearly 25,000 vehicles to be illegally repossessed.
Through Thursday, Wells Fargo's share price had been little changed since the scandals broke, while the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index had risen 33 percent.

The case is In re Wells Fargo Collateral Protection Insurance Litigation, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 17-ml-02797.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock indexes jumped and U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on Friday after a slowdown in U.S. job growth fueled hopes of a U.S. interest rate cut, while Washington's move to delay tariffs on Chinese goods added to equity market optimism.
The U.S. dollar index also dropped and gold prices rallied to their highest levels since April 2018 following the U.S. Labor Department's monthly report, which also showed wages rose less than expected in May. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes hit their lowest since September 2017. 
The jobs data suggested the loss of momentum in economic activity was spreading to the labor market, which could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates this year.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index was more than 1% higher in afternoon trading and on track for its biggest weekly percentage gain since November 2018. 
""This is the type of read the doves will really take to, as it supports the argument for cutting rates beyond politics or trade issues, which were never part of the Fed's mandate to begin with,"" said Mike Loewengart, vice-president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial in New York. 
Hopes that the Fed would turn more accommodative to blunt the impact of escalating trade tensions have helped support stocks in recent days.
The U.S. government on Friday said it was granting Chinese exporters two more weeks to get their products into the United States before increasing tariffs on those items. Also, U.S. President Donald Trump said there was a ""good chance"" the United States would make a trade deal with Mexico.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 290.73 points, or 1.13%, to 26,011.39, the S&P 500 gained 34.65 points, or 1.22%, to 2,878.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 135.72 points, or 1.78%, to 7,751.27.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.93% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.10%.
In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to yield 2.0827%. The yield touched 2.053% shortly after the May payrolls report, which was its lowest since September 2017.
With trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners still brewing, investors have been assessing how global central banks will respond to signs of a downturn.
Traders now are betting on multiple rate cuts by the Fed over the next 12 months.
But a cut is not guaranteed. And the potential for central banks to disappoint markets was highlighted on Thursday, when the European Central Bank declined to hint it would cut rates soon.
The dollar index fell 0.51%, with the euro up 0.56% to $1.1337.
In the oil market, crude prices gained amid signs that OPEC and other producers could extend their output reduction deal.
Gold prices jumped to their highest levels since April 2018 as the jobs report sent the dollar lower. Spot gold was 0.6% higher to $1,343.07 per ounce, having earlier hit its intra-day high of $1,348.08.
U.S. crude rose 1.81% to $53.54 per barrel.

868,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",India's central bank relaxes stressed asset guidelines for lenders,"By Swati Bhat and Promit Mukherjee
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India diluted its guidelines on stressed assets and has now mandated banks to undertake a review of a borrower's accounts within 30 days of default, according to a circular issued on Friday.
A circular issued in February last year required banks to initiate a resolution process as soon as a default took place. Banks unable to agree upon a resolution plan with the defaulter within 180 days were mandated to force them into a time-bound insolvency process.
But that instruction was struck down by the Supreme Court of India in April after several companies challenged the guidelines in court, arguing that the time given by the regulator was insufficient to tackle bad debt issues.
In Friday's circular, the RBI said lenders should work on a resolution plan based on the financial health of borrowers even before a default. In the case of a default by a borrower with even a single lender, all lenders should review the borrower's accounts within 30 days.
""This now puts more responsibility on the bankers. They are now supposed to take timely decisions,"" said Ramnath Pradeep, the former chairman of Corporation Bank.
Lenders are expected to devise a resolution plan within the 30-day period and also enter into an Inter-Creditor Agreement during this period.
The resolution plan should be implemented by the lenders within 180 days after the initial review period, the central bank said.
""The new circular is more pragmatic,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings.
""This is more reasonable as defaults could happen due to unpredictable events and things generally don't change within just one day. On balance, the new circular appears to be more practical without diluting the ""spirit"" of the earlier circular"".
The central bank said now approval of lenders representing 75% of outstanding loans and 60% of number of lenders would be required for the sake of resolution, versus 100% earlier which is expected to speed up the process, Nitsure said.
However, in case of delays in implementing a resolution plan, the RBI has instituted additional provisioning norms.
Failure to implement the resolution plan within 180 days of the end of the review period will require banks to make additional provisioning of 20%, while banks would need to set aside an additional 15% on top of this after one year.
""That I think creates the right environment for finding a resolution. There is some balance and counter balance for all stakeholders,"" said L. Viswanathan, Partner at legal firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.
SUPREME COURT CONCERNS
Some had challenged the validity of the RBI's February directive in the apex court saying its ""one-size-fits-all"" did not account for external factors.
The new circular gives borrowers additional time for the resolution process, but the RBI can still direct banks on a case-by-case basis to take defaulters through an insolvency process.
The Supreme Court ruling had provided relief to some major corporate defaulters, but at the same time threw the country's still-nascent bankruptcy regime into question.
Foreign investors have often complained about the slow pace of bad debt resolution in India, which has held back billions of dollars of investment in the country.
Indian banks and financial institutions currently hold combined bad debts of more than 10 trillion rupees ($146 billion) and this has also affected their ability to lend and spur economic growth.
Asia's third-largest economy grew at a much slower-than-expected 5.8% in the March quarter.
The new guidelines are not industry specific and hence do not benefit any particular sector, but they would help most small borrowers, the chief executive of an asset reconstruction company said.
The revised guidelines take effect immediately for borrowers who have defaulted on loans worth 20 billion rupees or more, the RBI said, while for those with loans of 15 to 20 billion they will take effect next January. The RBI did not give a date for those with less than 15 billion rupees in defaulted loans.
This essentially gives small borrowers more time to resolve or pay back loans, said industry experts.

""Some large power companies and a few infrastructure companies will fall under the gamut of the 20 billion rupee and above soured loans,"" the chief executive said, adding that several power companies fall into the small borrower category.

The vegan upstart brought in the buyers as it forecast that sales would top $210 million this year, a more than 100% increase from the $88 million seen last year. That was also above analysts' estimates for about $205 million.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) surged 35%.
The rosier outlook was accompanied by sizzling first-quarter results, drawing a bullish call from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Bank of America raised its price target on the stock to $101 from $85. It currently has a neutral rating on the stock.
The company reported a fiscal first-quarter loss of 14 cents a share, a penny narrower than the 15 cents a share analysts were expecting, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The company has rode on the coattails of a surge in demand for plant-based foods, particular among the millennials and Gen Zers.
Americans in Gen Z -- an age group that ranges roughly from 7 to 22 -- are more than twice as likely to classify themselves as vegetarians, vegans or pescatarians than their Gen X or Boomer parents, according to a survey by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult.
With demand more likely to swing higher, some have raised questions about possible supply shortages.
But Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown, in a call with analysts, said that the company had learned from product shortages in 2017 and 2018. He added that Beyond Meat now had the capacity to take on the big ticket of a large, national fast-food client."

Shares rose as much as 3.5% to $132.25, reaching a record intraday high in New York trading Friday. The rally pushed Microsoft’s market capitalization to $1.01 trillion, the first time it’s climbed above the 13-digit mark since briefly touching that level in April.
Microsoft has fared better than most of its largest tech peers this week, as the possibility of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). facing antitrust reviews from U.S. agencies and renewed concerns over trade disputes spooked traders. Microsoft has gained almost 7% in the past five sessions, while Google parent Alphabet fell 3.5% and Facebook lost 2.9%. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., which also initially fell on antitrust concerns Monday, recovered to gain nearly 9% this week.
“Management noted Microsoft is better positioned than ever to maintain wallet share of customers through an economic downturn, given the broader budget exposure beyond IT,” Piper Jaffray analyst Alex J. Zukin wrote in a June 5 note. “However, they indicated they were not seeing any signs of an economic slowdown nor any weakness in the economy.”
Zukin is among the 36 analysts with a buy-equivalent rating on Microsoft’s stock, while one rates it a hold and two recommend selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average price target of $143 suggests another 8.7% in upside returns from the stock’s current price.
“We continue to very much have a ‘buy it and forget it’ mentality on the stock right now as the company appears to be in midst of secular fundamental growth,” Zukin wrote.

881,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 10:46AM ET</span>",Huawei CFO's ‘Complex’ Extradition Request Is Just 33 Pages Long,"(Bloomberg) -- For months, Canadian defense lawyers for Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer have been gearing up to battle a U.S. extradition request they’d said would be ""exceptionally"" complex involving reams of documents. It turns out it’s just 33 pages long.
The Canadian proceedings, in other words, are unlikely to shed much more light on what kind of evidence exactly the U.S. has amassed against Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei and is sought by the U.S. on fraud charges.
In a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Supreme Court of British Columbia laid out a road map for Meng’s case, ordering the start of extradition hearings on Jan. 20 -- the day when crown prosecutors will also present for the first time the full U.S. request, known as the record of the case.
""It would be helpful to have them well in advance,"" Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes told the crown prosecutors. ""I understand they’re quite complex.""
Not as complicated as her defense describes them, responded crown lawyer John Gibb-Carsley. When asked how long the request was, he said, ""The record of the case is 25 pages and supplement is eight pages."" Just a tad more than the 25-page U.S. indictment already filed in January.
The U.S. accuses Meng of tricking banks into conducting transactions for Huawei that may have violated U.S. sanctions on Iran. The main pillar of the U.S. case appears, so far, to be a PowerPoint she presented at a huddle in a Hong Kong teahouse with an  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) banker about six years ago.
Since her arrest last December, Meng has been living under house arrest in Vancouver. Another round of preliminary hearings is set to start on Sept. 23.

884,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",France's Sanofi bets on new CEO to drive sluggish drug sales,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - In veteran drug salesman Paul Hudson, Sanofi's 100,000-plus employees are getting a new chief executive who relishes a good commercial fight.
The French firm said on Friday it had poached 51-year-old Hudson from Novartis, betting on him to rejuvenate a business hit by sluggish cholesterol drug sales and a diabetes unit facing growing competition for its top seller. 
Hudson, the latest of several Novartis executives to exit the Swiss firm, has nearly 30 years of industry experience, including a stint as AstraZeneca's top U.S. manager.
The Englishman, a skilled public speaker and fan of his hometown soccer team Manchester United, will replace Olivier Brandicourt, 63, who is retiring in September.
At Novartis, Hudson kick-started sales of heart failure medicine Entresto that the firm expected to generate $5 billion but whose sales began at a glacial pace after its 2015 launch.
After heavy marketing investment and a sales push, Hudson turned the drug into a Novartis blockbuster.
""We're now starting to see the fruits of all the effort we put in,"" Hudson told analysts on a Novartis call in April. ""Will it continue? We believe it does continue.""
At Sanofi (PA:SASY), one of Hudson's challenges will be to turn around the fortunes of Praluent, a cholesterol medicine that has failed to meet original expectations due to concerns about its price and a bitter patent dispute with rival Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).
""The departure of Paul Hudson is regrettable for Novartis, due to his industry experience in the United States,"" said Michael Nawrath from Zuercher Kantonalbank.
But his knowledge of the world's biggest drugs market will be Sanofi's gain. 
Hudson, awarded an honorary doctorate at his alma mater Manchester Metropolitan University, also has to defend Sanofi's patent-expired insulin Lantus, a top earner at 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) even after a 20 percent drop in sales.
Competition will come from Mylan's generics and even Novartis, which in 2018 signed a deal with China's Gan & Lee to make Lantus copies.
Hudson has proved a tenacious salesman at Novartis, winning approval for the world's costliest medicine, gene therapy Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy, at $2.1 million per patient.
Novartis said Hudson's replacement would be Marie-France Tschudin, 48, who has led the Swiss firm's European cancer unit after joining the company in 2017. She previously worked at Celgene's cancer business.
It marks another change at the top of Novartis, where most of its executive committee was appointed in the last two years.
""The turn-over at the Novartis executive committee continues at high speed,"" Bank Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider said.
This week, Samit Hirawat, head of oncology drug development, left for Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), while Novartis's cancer chief, Susanne Schaffert, has only been in her post since January. In March, the Swiss firm hired a new generics head, Richard Saynor, from GlaxoSmithKline.

A Novartis spokesman said Novartis had a deep bench of global experts to fill talent gaps left by Hudson and others.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 09:48AM ET</span>",World bonds wave recession flags as future inflation evaporates,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - After almost three years of successfully predicting a global economic revival, world bond markets are furiously flagging the risk of yet another recession, as well as low inflation for a generation. 
Spooked by the escalating U.S.-China trade war, long-term interest rates embedded in government bond markets - widely seen as the most accurate predictors of future economic activity and inflation - have relapsed into deep troughs. 
U.S. Treasury yields have plunged 50 basis points in seven weeks, while sub-zero German 10-year bond yields are at record lows. In Japan, Britain, Switzerland and France, borrowing costs are at their lowest since 2016 - when financial markets were hit by a combination of blows including Britain's shock decision to leave the European Union and an economic slowdown in China. 
Recession is not a given. Bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators, such as equity markets, are not as bearish. However trade tensions, also including a recent U.S. plan to impose tariffs on Mexico, may be what's making the present slide in bond yields different. 
""We have to pay attention,"" said Franck Dixmier, global head of fixed income for Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global, which manages more than $560 billion in assets. 
""We know from experience that bond markets are quite good at predicting future economic developments and what's being priced in more and more is the consequence of a clear escalation of trade tensions.""
Expectations for future inflation globally have tumbled as a result of fears about slowing growth, or recession, at a time when major central banks have limited ammunition following years of ultra-easy monetary policy. Britain is an exception because of Brexit.
The most prominent bearish signal for economic growth is coming from the U.S. bond curve where the 3-month/10-year yield curve is near its most inverted since 2007 - the months leading up to the global financial crisis.
An inverted curve, where long-dated yields are below short-dated ones, has proved a powerful recessionary indicator.
In a strong sign that markets are bracing for rate cuts, most of the U.S. curve is below the target range for the Federal funds rate of 2.25–2.50%. 
Short-term interest rate futures imply the U.S. Federal Reserve could start cutting rates as soon as next month.
""The yield curve is still a very good indicator because when you look at the curve and the correlation between this and macro economic variables, this hasn't changed for 20 years,"" said Pictet Asset Management chief strategist Luca Paolini, adding that a recession, but not a deep one, was likely.
Share of negative-yielding debt: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QPpLTD
Most U.S. yields fall below Fed's target range: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WRJWFS
Euro zone inflation expectations hit record low: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QR6vVW 
TRUST ME?
But reading the bond market tea leaves is not easy.
The predictive power of the U.S. bond curve has been hurt by the prolonged easy monetary policy and demand for bonds from institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds. That's played a part in suppressing long-dated yields, making it easier for the curve to invert.
U.S. unemployment has always risen before recessions but is currently near 50-year lows. Equities are holding up well, as are the riskier sections of the corporate bond market.
Economic data too, while disappointing, has not been dire in the United States; the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing activity index is at its lowest level since 2016, but above the 50 mark consistent with expansion.
BlueBay Asset Management's chief investment officer Mark Dowding notes that in 2016 - when fears about weak global growth and inflation last gripped markets - the ISM plunged to 48 and oil prices slumped to around $30. Now oil prices, while at 4-month lows, are double the levels three years ago.
TRADE WAR = WEAK ECONOMY
But the deep trade tensions at play today could make this situation different, according to analysts and investors.
U.S. two-year Treasury yields last week notched up their biggest weekly fall since 2009 just as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose tariffs on Mexico.
While markets had, until last month, broadly expected a constructive outcome, Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, said that ""now, investors see the dispute as part of a larger, more complex, long-term hegemonic battle and for markets that is more dangerous and uncertain"". 
Investment banks have changed their views on growth and central bank policy.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) now projects global growth will stagnate at current levels for the rest of 2019, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) expects two U.S. rate cuts this year and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) says its ""downside risk scenario"" for German Bund yields is -50 basis points versus the current -0.25 bps.
The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, cut its world growth forecasts this week and Germany's central bank also slashed predictions for the country's economy, expecting it grow this year by just 0.6%.
Some central banks have moved to easing mode already - New Zealand, Australia and India have cut rates and even Fed officials have raised that possibility.
""Against that backdrop (of rate-cut bets) we have to ask, is that consistent with investors thinking the Fed is fine tuning policy or is there a fundamental economic backdrop that's far worse than we had thought?"" said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors. 
""Some of the buying interest in Treasuries is taking the more pessimistic view.""
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi this week sought to reassure investors the bank was ready to act if needed, even holding out the prospect of more rate cuts or resuming bond-buying stimulus
Nervous investors plowed a record $12.3 billion into higher-quality ""investment grade"" bonds in the week to Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said.
And the pool of negative-yielding bonds globally has swelled to over $10 trillion, banks estimate.
ABSENT INFLATION 
For central banks, especially the ECB, perhaps the most worrying bond market signal is that inflation will remain below target for years. Market pricing of inflation expectations in the euro area suggest inflation could remain below target for at least two decades. 
A key market gauge of euro area inflation expectations is at record lows below 1.25%. The ECB targets an inflation rate of just below 2%, but it has undershot this since 2013. And that's after unprecedented stimulus.
""It seems to be very difficult to see inflation going above target on a 5-10 year view,"" said BlueBay's Dowding. 
And even if trade tensions, and with it global recession fears ebb, other uncertainties - Brexit, Italy's budget clash with the EU - suggest bonds will hold their cachet for some time, said Dixmier at Allianz.

""There is one thing I know,"" he added. ""And that's that I don't want to be short of German Bunds at this stage.""

Expectations were high heading into Beyond Meat's report on Thursday, with its shares having jumped about 400% since its initial public offering a month ago. The better-than-expected results and forecast led the stock to soar nearly 21% in extended trade on Thursday.
At least three brokerages raised their price targets, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) being the most bullish, upping its target by $55 to $125. The Street's median is $96.
The company is now set to be worth a whopping $7.36 billion, if current gains hold, after having started out with a $2.75 billion valuation on debut.
Beyond Meat expects 2019 revenue to more than double to $210 million. Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown, on a post-earnings conference call with analysts, said the forecast was ""very conservative"" and views it ""as a floor.""
Its forecast did not include the current trials Beyond Meat is undertaking with fast-food chains such as Canada's Tim Hortons, Del Taco and Carl's Jr.
""Post-trial adoption would offer upside to guidance,"" Jefferies' Kevin Grundy said. He also upped the price target to $105 from $85.
With McDonald's and Yum Brands' KFC restaurants likely to test plant-based meat products this year, the Beyond Meat's revenue outlook is highly likely to tick higher.
""We now expect $750 million of sales to McDonald's alone by 2030,"" Credit Suisse's Robert Moskow said.
Beyond Meat's imitation meat patties and sausages made from ingredients like pea protein, coconut and canola oil, while a great alternative for consumers conscious of the environment, still needs to put in the work to get more takers as they cost much more than beef burgers. 
""When skeptical investors ask how Beyond Meat plans on attacking approaching competition, we think they may overlook the flexibility the company has to invest in price,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said. 
Goldman raised his price target to $120 from $97.
Six out of eight brokerages have a ""hold"" rating, while the other two have a ""buy"" or higher rating. 

""As long as Street forecasts fail to properly reflect Beyond Meat's remarkable potential, we remain 'overweight',"" Goldman said.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",Traders pile into bets on Fed interest-rate cuts this year,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is just about done being patient. 
That was the view of traders in short-term interest rate futures Friday, after a government report showed U.S. employers sharply slowed hiring in May.
Traders jumped on the report as a sign of a cooling labor market that would force the Fed to start cutting its policy rate in July and reduce it twice more by the end of the year. 
Bets for two rate cuts had been priced into the market, mostly in reaction to mounting trade tensions that are expected to slow economic growth.
The U.S. central bank, which raised interest rates four times last year, signaled earlier this year it is on hold for the rest of 2019, saying it will be patient in assessing economic data. 
""Today's report certainly supports the case for the Fed to cut interest rates sooner rather than later,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services in Troy, Michigan. ""It shows both that the pace of economic growth may be slowing and yet serious wage inflation pressure seem to remain elusive.""
Traders now see a 65% chance that short-term interest rates will end the year at between 1.5% and 1.75%, down from 2.25% to 2.5% now, according to a Reuters analysis of the rate contracts.

ZURICH/MILAN (Reuters) - UBS looks set to agree a 100 million euro ($113 million) settlement of a money laundering and tax case in Italy within the next few weeks, according to people familiar with the matter, in contrast to a similar case in France.
Switzerland's biggest bank is battling a number of court cases in Europe over claims it enabled cross-border tax cheats to hide assets in Switzerland.
In France it opted to challenge a charge of tax evasion, with a resulting penalty of 4.5 billion euros awarded against the bank in February. UBS has denied wrongdoing and is appealing the decision.
Its handling of that case led to a rare rebuke of the bank's management by shareholders, angry that they could have settled for as little as 40-100 million euros.
In Italy, sources are saying it is close to clinching a settlement with the country's tax authority, which could help the Swiss bank receive lighter treatment from local prosecutors.
The investigation is on standby pending settlement.
Prosecutors in Milan opened their investigation in early 2018 into alleged money laundering and failure to file tax returns after receiving documents from Germany's customs agency about the Swiss bank's Italian clients, an investigative source told Reuters.
UBS flagged the matter in its 2018 annual report, saying tax authorities and a prosecutor's office in Italy had asserted it might be liable for taxes and penalties as a result of its activities from 2012 to 2017.
But prosecutors had gathered scant evidence when contact between UBS lawyers and the Milanese authority began following a news conference in November 2018 during which Milan's chief prosecutor mentioned investigations into Swiss banks, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The bank offered to work toward a settlement with Italy's tax authority and provide prosecutors with information which would exclude the identity of its Italian clients, the sources said.
Switzerland's biggest bank declined comment on the expected settlement, which resembles an agreement struck by Swiss rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in 2016.
Unlike in France, filing for settlement does not imply an admission of guilt under Italian law.
UBS has also denied recent charges in Germany, where prosecutors in Mannheim are seeking an 83 million euro fine. A trial opened last month.
Belgian authorities are also investigating the world's largest wealth manager. UBS has declined to say whether it would be open to settling there.
LASTING LEGACY
Although Switzerland today exchanges bank account data on its current clients with dozens of countries to crack down on cross-border tax cheats, fresh tax litigation has brought legacy matters to the fore.
A Swiss court is soon set to decide whether UBS must hand over historical client data to French tax authorities, potentially opening the door to fresh claims against Swiss banks.
Italian authorities already this year asked Swiss banks to provide information about their Italian business, and in 2017 asked their Swiss counterparts for information regarding thousands of Italian citizens with accounts held in Switzerland.

Thousands had already been identified through an amnesty scheme encouraging tax dodgers to come clean on funds held abroad in return for immunity from prosecution.

Pulling the deal marks a setback for T-Systems CEO Adel Al-Saleh, who since being hired at he start of 2018 has reduced staff, closed offices and sought to hive off business lines that are not expected to generate profitable growth.
""According to our preliminary assessment IBM holds a dominant position here in the European Economic Area which would have been further strengthened by acquiring personnel and essential infrastructure from its competitor, T-Systems,"" said Cartel Office chief Andreas Mundt in a statement on Friday.
The firms said in January they would team up to provide computing services at on-site servers, a traditional strength of IBM that has been challenged in recent years by the explosion of 'cloud' computing hosted at remote datacenters.
The companies did not disclose terms, but reports at the time said IBM would pay 860 million euros ($962 million) to T-Systems as part of the deal to take on the business that employs 400 staff.
Al-Saleh of T-Systems said IBM's withdrawal of its filing to the cartel office was by mutual agreement and he would explore further options.
""The mainframe services partnership with IBM would have been beneficial for all parties,"" he said in a statement. ""Given the Federal Cartel Office position, we have decided to pursue other alternatives to drive value to our clients.""
Al-Saleh added that mainframes would continue to be an important part of the T-Systems portfolio. ""We are exploring other alternatives how we get latest technology and solutions to our clients.""

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc will restart a service that offers the delivery of groceries directly to shoppers' refrigerators - part of its attempts to find unconventional ways to offer cheap and rapid delivery of online orders.
Walmart had started testing the service in 2017 with smart security company August Home and third-party courier firm Deliv, which used gig workers to make the deliveries. It ended the test a year later. 
This time, Walmart will use its own workers, who have been with the retailer for at least a year, and use its own vehicles. Walmart will also use smart entry technology and a proprietary, wearable camera to access shoppers' homes, the company's head of U.S. ecommerce, Marc Lore, said, letting customers control access into their home and watch a delivery remotely.
Starting this fall, the service will be available to over 1 million customers across three cities – Kansas City, Missouri; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Vero Beach, Florida.
Walmart recently launched one-day delivery without a shipping fee, weeks after Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a similar offer. It has also been using several third-party courier firms to make such deliveries.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 05:20AM ET</span>",Germany's Opel town shows struggle for Europe to plug in electric cars,"By Vera Eckert
RUESSELSHEIM, Germany (Reuters) - Carmakers and policymakers in Europe are staking their futures on a race to electric vehicles. But the vast charging network needed to sustain their vision is patchy, and it's not clear who'll pay for it. 
The central German city of Ruesselsheim, home to carmaker Opel, wants to build 1,300 electric car charging points by 2020, plans that would make it a frontrunner on the continent.
It has advantages enjoyed by few in Europe, including a powerful local car industry player and wealthy national economy. In Germany itself the city has an edge, having won a government grant of 12.8 million euros ($14.4 million) to fund the rollout.
Yet, even here, red tape, shortages of qualified staff and the requisite hardware are likely to delay the installation by around two years, local officials told Reuters. 
The project will also need more money, said the officials who are running up against the complexity of civil engineering, potential power grid overloads and unwieldy payment processes, illustrating some of the difficulties facing cities and nations across Europe.
""We are not doing this for profit,"" said Marianne Floersheimer, Ruesselsheim council's mobility chief. ""But we cannot afford to top up the government money.""
The number of electric cars on German roads grew fivefold between 2015 and 2018, and have risen strongly across Europe. However the growth in electric cars is outpacing the charging infrastructure.
The ratio of electric cars to each charging point in Europe deteriorated to 7.0 from 6.1 in the same period, consultants AlixPartners found, although Europe is still better equipped than the United States at 19.7 per car, and China's 7.6. 
Some analysts say a lag in infrastructure could drag on sales as customers hold off until electric becomes a convenient option. 
Any logjam could prove a problem for carmakers which, faced with emissions penalties, are pumping tens of billions of euros into electric technology in an industry-wide charge. German champion Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), for example, aims for electric vehicles to account for about a quarter of its sales by 2025.
Obstacles to electrification could also strain the European Union's plan to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2050 to combat climate change. A quarter of climate-harming emissions come from transport and, within that, most from passenger cars. 
However some campaigners, including Transport & Environment, a group that promotes clean transport, say good progress is being made in rolling out charging points in many countries of western and northern Europe, although central and eastern Europe are further behind.
They say limited infrastructure is not having a significant effect on Europe's electric car sales, which still represent a fraction of the vehicle market, and the ratio of cars to points is within the EU recommendation of 10. Given most charging will be done at home, they add, a lack of off-street parking in some areas could deter drivers from switching to electric.
'NO OVERLOAD'
Like other German cities, Ruesselsheim is under pressure to roll out charging stations as environmental activists have started suing those municipalities that fail to comply with EU-wide rules for nitrogen dioxide emissions.
With just 67,000 people, it has only a few charging points at the moment, some way behind the likes of wealthy and populous Hamburg on about 880 and Berlin with some 780.
It is however aiming to provide one charging point per 72 people, the highest level in Europe, with the help of carmaker Opel, which will build around half of the points, plus the technical know-how of the local RheinMain University. Opel is owned by France's PSA Group.
Ruesselsheim's electric plan won one of the highest grants under the German transport ministry's clean air program. But local officials described some of the complications in implementation.
The installation of every charging point needs to be agreed with authorities such as those in charge of water, monument protection and civil engineering, for example. Charging equipment makers, meanwhile, have long lead times.
""We are chasing the same charging points, employees and supply technology as all the other cities,"" said city spokesman Asswin Zabel.
Hooking up inner-city charging points on low voltage lines will be relatively easy although some local people may object, said Matthias Schweitzer, head of technology at the local utility, Stadtwerke Ruesselsheim.
But laying 2 km of medium voltage lines and ordering new transformer substations could take up to nine months, he said.
The university aims to accompany the rollout with storage facilities to absorb green power and offer supply on demand. But it must measure whether inverters, which turn alternating current power from the grid into direct current used by car batteries, cause too much stress on the network.
""We must ensure there is no overload,"" Schweitzer added.
Yet more snags await: There is still a hodge-podge of charging and paying processes across the country as vendors are not in sync with each other, meaning Ruesselsheimers may encounter payment difficulties on longer journeys.
""There is no obligation to provide free roaming. People have to carry around far too many different customer cards,"" said Hanns Koenig of research firm Aurora, which has studied commercial car charging opportunities. 
VICIOUS CIRCLE
Germany is doing relatively well in Europe in terms of public charging points, with 17,400 countrywide, according to data from energy industry association BDEW. That would roughly equate to a point for every five of its 83,000 electric cars, about 1 percent of the vehicles on its roads. 
To keep up with sales, BDEW says thousands more public charging points are needed in coming years, as well as hundreds of thousands of private points at homes and workplaces. 
However funding could be a central problem in Germany, as well as in Europe and beyond, particularly along motorways which do not fall under any particular municipality. 
Carmakers are largely pouring much of their money into the development of electric vehicles, while energy providers hesitate to take on responsibility for the rollout as long as car sales remain too low to provide a profitable customer base.
In Germany, many of the roughly 1,500 local utility players simply cannot shoulder huge infrastructure costs, especially while commercial success is not assured.
The situation could become a vicious circle, some industry experts say, since without a large number of charging stations, customers may be reluctant to make the leap to electric.
""Today it is still largely unclear who will make the necessary investment in the charging infrastructure in cities, housing and along the motorways in the short term, and how these can refinance themselves in the medium and long term,"" said Jens Haas, managing director automotive at AlixPartners.

""This results in lasting scepticism among German car customers and, in turn, hesitant buying.""

(Reuters) - European stocks were on course to notch their best weekly performance in two months on Friday as a jump in shares of French pharma giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) added to the positive mood created by expectations of more moves by central banks to stir growth.
France's CAC 40 outperformed its peers with a 1.2% rise, helped by a 4.5% jump in Sanofi after the company appointed Swiss rival Novartis' executive Paul Hudson as its new boss.
The stock was on track to post its best day in more than seven months, helping the healthcare sector rise 0.5%.
""Hudson's immediate challenges will be working with the new CFO to improve cost efficiency in the business,"" analysts at Liberum Capital said in a note. ""As an external, and non-French hire Hudson will be seen as a step in the right direction."" 
Investors have largely favored defensive sectors such as utilities and healthcare in a week that has seen stock markets globally gain despite uncertainties over trade and monetary policy.
Signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that interest rate cuts are on the cards have been at the heart of those moves, and monthly U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday are likely to set the tone for the next week. 
European stocks, however, were hit by a stronger euro on Thursday after the European Central Bank refrained from providing as dovish an outlook as hoped.
""Major central banks are prepared to do what is necessary, should the situation warrant it. That reassurance is what has been holding equities up this week,"" said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at London-based City Index.

Boeing MAX jets have been grounded worldwide and airlines are cancelling multimillion contracts following crashes in October and March that killed nearly 350 people.
""At Qatar Airways we do not operate any MAX airplanes – it affected our investment into Air Italy. Air Italy has three MAX operated in its fleet and they were grounded so it affected us – we had to take extra routing from outside,"" al-Baker said. 
In 2017, Qatar purchased 49% of Air Italy, Italy's second largest carrier behind Alitalia, which, in turn, is partly owned by Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways. 
""Boeing has to compensate us for grounding,"" al-Baker said, but did not elaborate on the potential cost. 
In Russia, Qatar Airways is in talks to buy a 20% stake in Vnukovo airport, Moscow's third largest by passenger traffic. 
Al-Baker said Qatar Airways was looking to close the deal ""sometime before the end of the year."" 
Last year, Vnukovo's handled around 21 million passengers, compared with 29 million at Domodedovo and almost 46 million at Sheremetyevo, Russia's biggest airport and one of the busiest in Europe. 
""Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo are already congested and the only airport that has an expansion opportunity is Vnukovo,"" Al-Baker said. 
""We see a huge potential to grow the airport to bring more traffic, to intensify traffic, to grow there, to increase the duty free footprint."" 
Asked if Qatar Airways could consider acquiring a stake in Sheremetyevo, 30% of which may be on offer by the airport's private shareholders, Al-Baker said: ""We cannot do more than one airport at the same place.""
At home, at Hamad International Airport in Doha, passenger traffic was at around 35 million people last year. 
""This year we hope that we will exceed 42 million passengers but during the blockade we did lose nearly 10% of the traffic because it was all of a sudden. But we have recovered now,"" Al-Baker said. 

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on Qatar in 2017 over allegations that Qatar supports terrorism and is aligning itself with regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the allegations.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) has appointed Novartis executive Paul Hudson to replace CEO Olivier Brandicourt who will retire in September, France's biggest drugmaker said on Friday.
Hudson will take over on Sept. 1, Sanofi said, confirming a Reuters report published on Thursday and marking the latest transfer of a Novartis executive to a competitor.
UK-born Hudson, 51, has been CEO of the Novartis Pharmaceuticals, one of the Swiss company's three main divisions, since 2016.
Earlier, he worked at Schering Plough and AstraZeneca. 
Novartis named Marie-France Tschudin, president of Novartis unit Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA), to replace Hudson with immediate effect.
""Hudson has been chosen because of his reputation. He is known as a solid manager and has digital expertise relating to pharmaceuticals,"" a Sanofi source said on Thursday.
Brandicourt was hired in 2015 to help to revive the fortunes of Sanofi and has been actively reshaping the business.
Under his tenure, the company swapped its animal health unit with Boehringer Ingelheim for the German company's consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal. Sanofi also sold its European generics arm for 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) to private equity firm Advent International.
New launches such as eczema treatment Dupixent, cost-cutting measures and new priorities in research and development enabled Sanofi to return to profit in the second half of last year after a series of disappointing quarters.
Brandicourt's teams, however, failed to land two strategic acquisitions, losing out to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation in 2016 and failing to acquire Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2017.
NEW MEDICINES
At Novartis, Tschudin takes over a main drugs business with $35 billion in annual sales and a stable of medicines including newly approved $2.1 million-per-patient gene therapy Zolgensma, the world's most expensive one-time therapy, for children with spinal muscular atrophy.
Hudson's departure follows the exit of Samit Hirawat, head of oncology drug development, who is to become chief medical officer at Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) in a move announced on Wednesday.
Novartis is being watched for how successfully it can roll out Zolgensma as well as several other new medicines including Mayzent in a crowded multiple sclerosis field.
Tschudin, a Swiss citizen who speaks six languages, joined Novartis in 2017 after working at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) where she ran its Hematology-Oncology business for Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Answering to Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, Tschudin's brief will be continuing the Swiss drugmakers' push into cell and gene therapy for rare diseases, while also building out a diverse portfolio of medicines for heart disease, immunology, liver disease, neuroscience and respiratory ailments.
""Marie-France has a strong record of accomplishments in driving commercial excellence and a culture of inclusiveness and integrity,"" Narasimhan said.

Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets opened higher on Friday after data showing that German economic weakness continued into the second quarter encouraged speculation that the European Central Bank may have to follow through on its hints of resuming its bond-buying program to keep the economy on track.
Germany’s statistics office Destatis said exports fell by 3.7% on the month in April, while industrial production fell 1.9% - the most in over two years - and manufacturing output fell 2.5%.
At 03:20 AM ET (0720 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 2.1 points, or 0.6% at a two-week high of 376.12.
“This is a horrible start to the second quarter for German industry, as global trade tensions as well as temporary problems in the automotive sector and chemical industry have left their marks,” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING in Frankfurt.
Separately, the Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, slashed its growth forecast for 2019 to 0.6% from 1.6%.
Germany’s automakers, in particular, are bracing for further trouble ahead as the U.S. prepares to levy its first import tariffs on Mexico over its perceived unwillingness to stop illegal immigration into the U.S. All of the big three names have either assembly plants on Mexico, or vital suppliers to their factories in the U.S.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said overnight that the U.S. still intends to impose a tariff of 5% on Mexican goods on Monday, despite an offer from Mexico to assign 6,000 police to the issue. The proposed tariffs, which have taken some 3% off the peso in little more than a week, also have negative implications for Spain’s largest banks,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), which have large operations there.
Elsewhere, French pharma giant Sanofi (PA:SASY) rose 3.8% on news that it has chosen Novartis’ Paul Hudson to replace Olivier Brandicourt. Hudson has been CEO of  Novartis  '(SIX:NOVN) pharmaceuticals unit since 2016. That helped the CAC 40 to outperform with a 0.9% rise, while Germany’s Dax and the U.K. FTSE both gained 0.6%."

Google's move comes as the world's two top economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China's unfair trade practices.
While the sanctions are expected to hurt Huawei in the short term, industry experts say it could force the company - and other Chinese firms - to become self-reliant by developing more home-grown technologies, hurting the dominance of American companies such as Google in the longer term.
Google in particular is concerned it would not be allowed to update its Android operating system on Huawei smartphones, which it argues would prompt the Chinese company to develop its own version of the software, FT reported, citing people briefed on Google's lobbying efforts. 
The search giant argued a Huawei-modified version of Android would be more susceptible to being hacked, the newspaper said.
The U.S. administration in May added Huawei to a trade blacklist. The move put Huawei and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries on the Commerce Department's so-called Entity List.

Google and the U.S. Department of Commerce were not immediately available for comment on the report.

The Japanese automaker will sign a memorandum of understanding on a ""strategic partnership"" with the Chinese company, the Nikkei said, without citing sources.
Toyota, which was due to have a media briefing on its electrification strategy on Friday, did not comment on details when contacted by Reuters.
While Toyota had set a target to raise its annual sales of electrified vehicles to at least 5.5 million by 2030, the deal would enable it to achieve that goal by 2025, the Nikkei said.

CATL has built relationships with other Japanese automakers, including Honda Motor and Nissan Motor. It also signed a multi-billion dollar battery supply deal with Volvo Car Group in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. Senate Democrats is urging the Federal Reserve to investigate  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG's relationship with President Donald Trump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.
The lawmakers, led by Senators Chris Van Hollen and Sherrod Brown, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said news reports of potentially suspicious transactions at the bank involving Trump business entities merit further examination.
The New York Times reported on May 19 that anti-money laundering specialists at the bank were overruled by executives after recommending several transactions involving entities controlled by Trump or his family be reported to the government as suspicious. The bank denied the report at the time, as did Trump in a tweet.
The bank declined to comment on Thursday's letter, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Republican Trump is a New York businessman-turned-politician whose first elected office is the presidency.
The senators ask the Fed if any of their staff met with bank whistleblowers identified in the Times story or uncovered other information related to the accusations. The Fed said it had received the letter and planned to respond.
Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank has been a focal point for Democratic Party investigators in Congress, as the bank has served as a principle lender for Trump's real estate business. 

Democrats in the House have subpoenaed the bank for financial records involving Trump, his family and his businesses. That investigatory effort is on hold while Trump's lawyers challenge the subpoena in court.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said on Thursday it would buy Looker, a privately held big-data analytics company, for $2.6 billion in cash, in the first major acquisition for new Google Cloud Chief Executive Thomas Kurian.
Google's cloud computing division is a distant third globally to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in terms of revenue from renting infrastructure and other computing tools to businesses.
But Google Cloud's BigQuery, a tool for managing large datasets, has been among bright spots in attracting customers, according to cloud industry analysts. 
Kurian told Reuters in an interview that doubling down on analytics made sense as he looked to fill gaps in his unit. Looker and Google Cloud have similar cultures and share more than 350 customers including Blue Apron Holdings Inc, and Hearst Communications Inc, he said. 
""When we looked at how do we broaden our portfolio, [data and analytics] is a segment where we have strength,"" Kurian said. Looker is ""complementary and completes our analytics foundation.""
The deal also reflects Kurian's plan to win customers with specialized software, as rivals focus on more general tools.
Santa Cruz, California-based Looker, which was founded in 2012, employs about 800 people, has raised $281 million in venture capital and was valued at $1.6 billion in a funding round last year. 
Its tool enables analysts and other workers to define calculations for items such as revenue or high-value customers and then visualize trends in their data without writing complicated scripts. It competes with Tableau Software Inc , Domo Inc and Microsoft's Power BI.
Tableau shares fell 3.7%, and Domo dropped 0.4%. Microsoft rose 1.6%, and Alphabet increased 0.3%. 
Analysts said Looker is among the best business intelligence tools developed in the cloud era and that it would benefit from Google's resources. Equity research firm Cowen estimated Looker's 2019 revenue would be about $140 million.
Kurian said integrating Looker would result in new features, without elaborating.
Boris Evelson, who follows data analytics for Forrester Research, called buying Looker ""a smart choice.""
Looker Chief Executive Frank Bien is expected to stay with Google and report to Kurian.
Kurian, who joined Google last November, said he did not expect the deal to face antitrust scrutiny because the company is buying software, not data, and is committed to allowing the software to connect to Amazon.com and other competing cloud services.
The companies said they expect approval this year for the deal, which is Google's biggest since buying Nest for $3.2 billion in 2014.

Alphabet's private equity fund CapitalG previously invested in Looker.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn is planning to overhaul its management structure to get more senior executives involved in the running of its daily operations, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The move to appoint a new ""operations committee"" comes as Chairman and Founder Terry Gou is seeking to run in Taiwan's 2020 presidential election. He also told Reuters in April that he planned to step down from Foxconn to pave the way for younger talent to move up the ranks.
The overhaul will mark a major shift in Foxconn's corporate leadership that has seen 68-year-old Gou hold a tight grip on the firm's daily operations and strategic decisions.
""The good thing is it will no longer be a company ruled by one man and the decisions won't be as dogmatic as they used to be,"" the source said. ""It will be a co-management model."" 
Investors are keen for any insight into succession plans at the world's largest contract manufacturer, whose business ranges from smartphone assembling to panel manufacturing, and what it means for plans laid out by Gou such as a $10 billion investment to create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin and an $8.8 billion display factory in southern China. 
Foxconn is already under the spotlight for having failed so far to meet job-creation targets in Wisconsin, a plan cited by U.S. President Donald Trump as proof he was reviving American manufacturing. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Foxconn has moved more than 150 U.S. jobs to Mexico.
Foxconn is set to reveal next week the new ""operations committee"" that will give senior executives from its units greater control, according to the person, who declined to be named as the news had not yet been made public. 
The committee, which would be involved in running the daily operations of various Foxconn units - from Sharp Corp to Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd (FIH) - would include Sharp Chairman Tai Jeng-wu, Foxconn CFO Huang Chiu-lien, and FIH chairman Lu Sung-Ching, the source said.
Foxconn declined to comment until the conference on Tuesday.
A Sharp spokesman declined to comment, saying the firm does not comment on Foxconn or its management as Sharp and Foxconn are independent companies.
INVESTOR CONFERENCE
While the size of the new committee has not been finalised, an internal proposal is to include up to 10-11 senior executives from Foxconn units, the person said, adding the committee would report to Foxconn's proposed new board. 
Reuters reported in May that the firm's chip unit boss, Liu Young, was poised to replace Gou as chairman.
The source said Gou will not sit on the committee. Foxconn has previously said Gou would be a member of the new board.
At Tuesday's conference, Foxconn is also set to announce a plan to hold investor conferences regularly, a move the source said aims to address concerns about Gou's approach to transparency, including a lack of precise detail on matters from investment decisions to succession plans. 
""Foxconn plans to begin regular engagements with its investors, stakeholders, and the general public on areas of mutual interest,"" the company said. 
In the conference, to be led by Liu, Foxconn aims to address concerns about an escalating China-U.S. trade war, with plans to use its ""globalized"" production lines from Southeast Asia to India to cut its risks in China, the source said. 
Foxconn will also pledge to use new technologies including 5G telecoms infrastructure and artificial intelligence to revamp its manufacturing capability, the person said.

Shares in Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, have dropped around 24% since Gou announced in April his plans to run for president. They closed up 0.1% on Thursday, versus a 0.5% decline in the broader market.

The deal would help protect GrainCorp from the effects of crop-damaging hot dry weather, which has wilted its earnings. 
Last month, the company posted a larger-than-expected half-yearly loss and also cut its dividend as severe drought withered crops.
Under the deal, GrainCorp will receive a payment of A$15 per tonne of east coast winter crop production when production falls below a set threshold, and will pay the same amount when production goes above a set level.
The size of the payments will be limited over the 10-year term.
""The contract will smooth GrainCorp's cash flow and allow for longer term capital allocation and business planning through the cycle,"" Chief Executive Mark Palmquist said.
Excluding the production payments the contract is likely to cost Graincorp less than A$10 million ($7.0 million) pre-tax each year, the company said.

(Reuters) - Beyond Meat Inc, a maker of plant-based burgers and sausages, said it expects to more than double its revenue and report breakeven EBITDA this year, sending the its shares up over 21 percent.
The company said it expects to record revenue of $210 million in 2019, with break-even earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
Analysts on average forecast full-year sales of $205 million, and a loss, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, of $10.28 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company has captured a wide audience for its imitation meat patties and sausages made from ingredients like pea protein, coconut and canola oil.
The burgers, a hit with consumers switching to a ""flexitarian"" diet, feel, smell and taste like real meat.
Beyond Meat's sales have increased five-fold since it began selling its flagship Beyond Burger in 2016.

""We are very conservative and view this as a floor,"" Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said on a conference call when asked about the revenue forecast. The company does not count customers who are using its products as a part of a testing project.
""As we are entering into additional test and distribution channels and take on new customers, those will be additive to our numbers,"" Brown said.
The company is also working on making its plant-based products cheaper than animal protein to capture more market share.
Beyond Meat, whose rivals include U.S.-based Impossible Foods, is likely to face increasing competition in the niche market as companies like Nestlé and  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) ready their own line of products.
""Beyond Meat, right now, does have the first mover advantage,"" said Megan Brantley, vice president of research at LikeFolio.
The California-based company said net loss widened to $6.6 million in the three months ended March 30, from $5.7 million a year earlier.
First-quarter net revenue came in at $40.2 million, an increase of 215%, the company said. Analysts had expected revenue of $38.9 million.

PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi (PA:SASY) is poised to appoint Paul Hudson, a top executive with Switzerland's Novartis, to become the French drugmaker's next CEO from Sept. 1, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters on Thursday.
Current Sanofi SA CEO Olivier Brandicourt will leave the company to retire, said the source, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""Hudson has been chosen because of his reputation. He is known as a solid manager and has an expertise in digital relating to pharmaceuticals,"" the source said.
A spokeswoman with Sanofi had no comment. 
Officials at Novartis AG could not be reached for comment.
Reuters had reported on March 18 Sanofi was working to find a successor to Brandicourt.
Hudson, born in 1967 according to Novartis' website, has been CEO of Novartis Pharmaceuticals unit since 2016. He is a member of Novartis' executive committee. 
According to his corporate biography, Hudson joined Novartis from AstraZeneca Plc where he held several senior positions in Japan and the United States.
Back in March, sources had told Reuters talks over the future of Sanofi's management were intensifying. The group has an age limit of 65 for its CEO and Brandicourt will be 65 in February 2021.
Brandicourt was hired in 2015 to help revive the fortunes of France's biggest drugmaker and has been actively reshaping the business since.
Under his tenure, the company swapped its animal health unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm’s consumer healthcare operations in a $20 billion deal. It has also sold its European generics arm for 1.9 billion euros ($2.14 billion) to private equity firm Advent International.
New launches such as eczema treatment Dupixent, cost cutting and new priorities setting in research and development have also enabled Sanofi to return to profits in the second half of last year after a series of disappointing quarters due to falling diabetes sales. 
Brandicourt's teams, however, failed to land two strategic acquisitions, losing out on buying California-based cancer specialist Medivation to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) in 2016, and failing to snatch up Swiss biotech company Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2017. 
But Sanofi regained some momentum last year with the purchase of Belgian biotech company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros. That followed the acquisition of U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years.
Brandicourt said he hoped the two transactions will help Sanofi build a strong franchise in rare blood disorders.
In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ablynx's most promising asset, the experimental drug caplacizumab for treating the blood disease acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Sanofi has made rare diseases a top priority since it bought Massachusetts biotech firm Genzyme in 2011.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of major automakers on Thursday backed a compromise on vehicle emissions aimed at heading off a confrontation between California and the Trump administration over requirements through 2026, warning that the lack of a deal could lead to ""an extended period of litigation and instability.""
In a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom signed by 17 major automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG, the companies urged a compromise ""midway"" between the Obama era standards that require annual decreases of about 5% in emissions and the Trump administration's proposal that would freeze vehicle emissions requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.
The automakers are making a last-ditch appeal to try to revive talks in order to avoid years of uncertainty over what rules they will face.
In a separate letter to President Donald Trump on Thursday, they urged ""both the federal government and California to resume discussions and to remain open to regulatory adjustments.""
The letters were also signed by  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Hyundai Motor Co and Honda Motor Co Ltd. The companies said a final deal should ""also include flexibilities that promote advanced technology for the sake of long-term environmental gains and U.S. global competitiveness."" The letters were not signed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
In February, the Trump administration ended talks with California over federal plans to roll back fuel economy rules, setting the stage for what could be a lengthy legal fight over the state’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
White House spokesman Judd Deere said on Thursday that California had ""failed to put forward a productive alternative, and we are moving forward to finalize a rule with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles.""
California did not immediately comment on Thursday.
The automakers told Trump a deal ""would provide regulatory certainty and enhance our ability to invest and innovate by avoiding an extended period of litigation and instability, which could prove as untenable as the current program.""
Automakers previously said they opposed a freeze but wanted the rules revised to account for changes in oil prices and consumer demand. 
LAWSUIT THREATENED 
California's rules have been adopted by more than a dozen states. Eighteen states, including California, have vowed to sue the administration if it finalizes the freeze. In August 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a joint proposal called for stripping California of the right to impose stricter emissions rules or to require a rising number of zero-emissions vehicles.
California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols in draft remarks last month released by the agency warned that the increasing need to fight climate change ""might lead to an outright ban on internal combustion engines."" She later told California news website Calmatters.org that no ban was imminent. ""The message here was intended to be heard by the auto industry,"" she told the site.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is planing to call Trump administration officials to testify at a hearing on the vehicle emissions proposal the week of June 17, two people briefed on the matter said.
In April, Reuters reported that the EPA was expected to require a small increase in the yearly fuel efficiency gains but said the precise figure had not been finalized. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler in April told Reuters that ""our final regulation is not going to be the same as our proposal.""
California has been allowed to set state standards that are stricter than federal rules under an exemption granted by the EPA.
EPA and NHTSA have not yet submitted their proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review, a necessary step before the final regulation can be published. 
The Trump plan would increase U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day by the 2030s but reduce automakers' regulatory costs by more than $300 billion, the agencies said.

920,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 05:24PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Trade took the spotlight back from the Federal Reserve as some encouraging, although vague, comments about progress from Mexico’s trade team visiting Washington helped bring in late-afternoon stock buyers.
Those comments also helped shake oil traders out of their completely bearish funk on Thursday, leading to a rise in crude prices.
But barring an actual concrete delay on President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs, tomorrow’s premarket activity will be back focusing on rates.
Non-farm payrolls will set the tone for early trading, with a lower-than-expected number likely to help stocks by bolstering the case for a rate cut.
Cooler-than-expected wage growth would also be welcomed by equity bulls.
But whether the Fed cuts or not no longer seems to be the big question if you look at fed funds futures.
The market is pricing in almost a 70% chance rates are a quarter point lower after the FOMC’s July meeting and a more-than-50% chance that rates will be a half point lower following the September meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The question now may be whether the Fed goes for a big statement and cuts by 50 basis points.
Right now, the market is pricing in a 15% chance rates will be 100 basis points or more lower by the end of the year. The Fed's key federal funds rate is now 2.25% to 2.5%.
Here are the 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. It's Jobs Friday!
The Labor Department's non-farm payrolls numbers on Friday will help investors assess the strength of the economy and likely provide the dollar, Treasuries and gold with fresh direction.
Analysts forecast that the U.S. economy created about 185,000 jobs in May, while the unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.
There are some, however, who are expect that the economy created far more jobs in May.
""Total non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by 270,000 in May. The wild card is the number of hires by the Census Bureau, which typically spike in April or May prior to the official census year,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Wage growth, which the Fed, in its Beige Book report, described as ""modest,"" is expected to rise 0.3% for the month, and 3.2% year on year.
2. U.S. Rig Count Data Eyed
The weekly installment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday will provide investors with clues on U.S. oil production.
Data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 3 to 800.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures settled 91 cents higher at $52.59 a barrel.
Inventories rose to their highest level since July 2017, according to EIA data on Wednesday, as U.S. oil producers upped output to 12.4 million barrels a day, a record high. The build in inventories arrived despite the start of the summer driving season, which is associated with an uptick in gasoline demand.
""Another ugly week as crude inventories climbed 6.8M bbls ... reaching highest level since July 2017,"" analysts at Houston-based Tudor Pickering say.
""Concerning to see counter seasonal crude builds continue despite net imports down about 1.4M bpd year/year and refiners out of maintenance mode.""
3. Loonie on Watch as Canada Readies Jobs Data 
While the U.S. jobs data will take top billing, the release of Canada's employment change data at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) will also be in focus as it could support the Bank of Canada's expectations that the economy will improve following a recent patch of weakness seen in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.
The Canadian economy is expected to add 8,000 jobs in May after the gain of 106,500 in April, with the unemployment rate anticipated at 5.7%, unchanged from a month earlier.
The jobs data will likely also trigger a reaction in USD/CAD. The pair has been well supported thanks largely to a plunge in oil prices and expectations the Bank of Canada will remain patient on rate hikes for some time."
921,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 05:11PM ET</span>","Zoom Video Tops Guidance, Earnings Estimates; Shares Rally","Investing.com -  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) rallied in postmarket hours as the video platform company beat guidance and earnings expectations following a surge in customer additions.
In its maiden report as a public company, Zoom Video generated earnings of $0.03 a share on revenue of $122 million, beating expectations from Capital IQ for earnings of 1 cent a share on revenue of $111.7 million, sending its shares soaring 9.2% to $86.73 in after-hours trading.
The better-than-expected results were driven by an 86% increase in customers to 58,500 with 405 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, up 120% from the same quarter last year.
Looking ahead, the company issued upside guidance for the second quarter. It sees earnings in the range of $0.01 to $0.02 a share, in line with estimates, while revenue estimates of $129 million to $130 million were above expectations of $122.06 million.
For the full year, meanwhile, the company sees earnings in the range of $0.02-$0.03, compared with expectations for a loss of $0.01. Revenues guidance of $535 million to $540 million was well ahead of estimates of $520.25 million.
Zoom, which went public in April, has drawn praise from analysts as it is one of the few debut companies to generate a profit. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), all of which also have gone public over the past few months, are in the red.
Analysts have touted Zoom as a potential leader in video conferencing over rivals like LogMeIn.
Zoom closed the regular session at $79.43, up 1.28%, and remains well above its IPO price of $36."

923,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P 500 Makes a Late Surge as Trade Tensions Ease,"Investing.com - Stocks jumped for a third session Thursday in part because of news that the Trump Administration might hold back on imposing new tariffs on goods shipped into the United States from Mexico.
In addition, there was continued speculation the Federal Reserve might cut rates when it meets in mid-June.
The news on Mexico abruptly turned U.S. financial markets around. Crude oil moved higher, interest rates moved up slightly and so did most of the major sectors of the market.
The S&P 500 jumped 0.61%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.53%, and the Dow jumped 0.71%. The Dow just missed its third-straight day of plus-200-point gains.
The strength of the rally has set the Dow and the S&P 500 up for their best weekly performances in 2019, with the Dow up 3.65% for the week after Thursday's close and the S&P 500 up 3.3%. The Nasdaq is up 2.2%. Its best week was the week of March 11, when it gained 3.78%.
But one aspect to Thursday's rally is worth watching.
The Dow Jones Transportation index fell 0.92%, with railroads the laggards. Kansas City Southern Railroad (NYSE:KSU) and  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) are big players in the business of shipping goods north from Mexico. Kansas City Southern fell 1.64% and Union Pacific was off 1%.
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Utility index hit a 52-week high as investors bet interest rates are headed lower. Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool sees little chance of a rate cut in June. But fed funds futures are pricing in a rate cut by July and almost certainly by September. The Fed's key federal fund rate is now 2.25% to 2.5%. Most bond yields are lower than that.
Financial markets have been driven in recent weeks by the reports or rumors of where U.S. trade policy is headed. The reports that the U.S. will delay tariffs on Mexico depend on whether Mexico can somehow curb illegal immigration into the U.S., the main point of contention, and whether President Donald Trump, traveling in Europe, will agree to the move. Late Thursday, Reuters tweeted the White House still plans to impose a 5% on Mexican shipments on Monday.
Friday's market will start with investor reaction to the May jobs report, due for release at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists polled by Investing.com expect the Labor Department to show the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6%. And estimates are that nonfarm payrolls, a key measure investors watch, will grow by 185,000, down from April's 263,000 job gains.
In the meantime, investors in big stocks were happy, especially with energy stocks.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were among the top-performing Dow stocks as Crude oil WTI futures moved up 1.8% to $52.29. Brent oil ,the global benchmark, rose 1.72% to $61.67. Only a day earlier, Brent briefly fell below $60 for the first time since late January.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), vulnerable to trade politics, also were higher and contributed about 32 points to the Dow''s gain.
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) led the Nasdaq 100 0.76% higher. The index is dominated by big tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Winners and lowers among S&P 500 stocks
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) and TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) were among the top S&P 500 performers on the day.
L Brands (NYSE:LB), Macerich (NYSE:MAC) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) were among the weakest S&P 500 performers on the day."

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Thursday that it had appointed Deutsche Bank's Kate Clifford-Toomey to be chief operating officer for corporate risk.
Clifford-Toomey joins the risk management team, led by Chief Risk Officer Mandy Norton, at a time when the bank is working to overhaul its risk management procedures to satisfy regulator demands.
Regulators have held the San Francisco-based bank under a microscope since 2016 when whistleblowers revealed Wells Fargo had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. The scandal led the bank to uncover issues in each of its primary business segments, and has resulted in billions of dollars in fines and penalties. 
The appointment is effective Sept. 3. 
Prior to Wells Fargo, Clifford-Toomey was chief operating officer of the Americas and head of Americas regulatory transformation at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). She has also worked at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
Deutsche Bank has also had to overhaul its risk management processes in recent years to satisfy U.S. regulators after failing to prove that its business could withstand an economic downturn during the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests.
Wells Fargo is currently operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 04:38PM ET</span>",Wall Street rises with hopes of Mexican tariffs delay,"By Sinéad Carew
New York (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed higher after a choppy session on Thursday as investors grew more optimistic on trade after reports that the United States is considering a delay in imposing tariffs on Mexican imports.
The market added to gains after a Bloomberg report cited unidentified sources saying that U.S. President Donald Trump could delay the tariffs he had threatened to put on Mexican goods as soon as Monday. 
The Washington Post reported that under a possible immigration deal, Mexico would deploy 6,000 troops to the Guatemalan border.
But strategists urged caution until a final U.S.-Mexico deal is reached and followed by a U.S.-China trade deal. 
""You have to take all of this with a huge grain of salt,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, adding that even if the Mexico report is true, ""it would be a short-term positive."" 
""It's not giving that long-term clarity businesses and investors and consumers need to make decisions,"" he said. 
Earlier in the day Trump said he would decide on more tariffs ""probably right after the G20"" meeting later this month, which followed his warning overnight that he would levy duties on at least another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 181.09 points, or 0.71%, to 25,720.66, the S&P 500 gained 17.34 points, or 0.61%, to 2,843.49 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.08 points, or 0.53%, to 7,615.55.
It was the first time since mid-May that the three major indexes gained ground for three sessions in a row.
The energy sector, which was the hardest-hit last month by heightening trade tensions, rose 1.7% as crude prices made some gains late in the day, making it the biggest percentage gainer of the S&P's 11 major sectors. [O/R]
The trade-sensitive industrial sector regained some ground late in the session and ended the day up 0.01% after falling as much as 0.86% earlier. 
While investors are hopeful that the U.S. Federal Reserve could be open to cutting interest rates if needed, they were cautious before the U.S. jobs report due on Friday morning after private data was weaker than expected on Wednesday. 
""There's a recognition that easier monetary policy is likely to prolong this economic cycle and is likely to support higher- than-normal valuation,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
""But for the market to move materially higher, there's a feeling that trade agreements need to be reached in order to push economic growth higher."" 
Federal Reserve policymakers have hinted they would be ready to cut rates if the U.S.-China trade spat threatens a decade-long expansion. Since early May, Trump has slapped tariffs on Chinese imports and warned of U.S. levies on Mexico.
""People are positioning for weaker jobs data. If there's not a trade deal by the end of June and payrolls weaken, you could see the Fed consider a cut by the July meeting,"" said Wells Fargo's Samana. 
Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank also underscored the threat to global economic expansion from the trade disputes by trimming the region's growth forecasts for the next two years. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 84 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 154 new lows. 

On U.S. exchanges 6.72 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 7.12 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

927,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>","As Trade Troubles Brew, Defense Stocks Guard Industrial Fort","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. aerospace and defense stocks kicked off this year under a cloud of uncertainty, amid concerns around a possible peak in spending and a prolonged government shutdown, yet nearly half way through, they are raking in the biggest returns among industrial companies.
The S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Industry Index has risen over 20% so far in 2019, exceeding the 16% gain in the broader industrials sector group. The biggest gainers on the defense index this year include L3 Technologies Inc. and Harris Corp (NYSE:HRS)., each up more than 46%, as well as TransDigm Group Inc., with its 38% advance.
“Defense stocks have been winners this year with geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and a renewed focus by the Trump administration to prioritize defense spending,” said Rohan Reddy, an analyst at Global X ETFs. The analyst via email said that he expected the strength in defense stocks and domestically focused industrial companies to continue if trade negotiations keep getting dragged out.
The back and forth on trade has continued, with latest reports suggesting the U.S. was considering delaying the threatened Mexico tariffs as talks over the flow of undocumented migrants and illegal drugs from Central America were ongoing.
While the U.S. government has opened trade wars on multiple fronts, impacting companies across industries such as automotive, manufacturing and transportation, it has also worked on a major arms deal with Taiwan, and stepped up its involvement regarding Iran. Last month, President Donald Trump agreed to send more troops to the region after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on Saudi oil installations as well as four ships.
In a note published earlier this week, Buckingham analyst Richard  Safran  (PA:SAF) said the market might be ignoring macro factors that favor the defense sector, which include a continued demand for defense products that is driving government spending beyond expectations, a declining 10-year yield making corporate dividends seem more attractive, and lastly, tariff-related fears sparking a flight-to-safety trade.
Meanwhile, transports have languished. Airlines have been beaten down the most, amid rapidly fluctuating oil prices, slowing domestic demand and the fallout from the twin fatal crashes that led to the grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.’s 737 Max jets. However, railroad companies and truckers have not been spared either, with demand softening and the possibility of a Mexico tariff creating further uncertainties.
“Transport stocks are a high risk/reward investment in today’s environment,” Global X’s Reddy said, adding that such companies will continue to be volatile as trade negotiations take place. “Airlines are likely to face challenges in the near term” as margins keep compressing, “although lower commodity prices may provide temporary relief,” Reddy added.
The S&P 500 Airlines Industry Index has risen just 4% this year, with American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings lagging the most.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 04:22PM ET</span>",AIG to reach out to shareholders over executive pay: CEO,"By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault said on Thursday the insurer is reaching out to shareholders, per its usual custom, who last month gave his $21 million compensation only narrow approval.
Asked to comment on the recent nonbinding vote by shareholders to approve his compensation package, Duperrault said, ""I have to earn my living."" He added, ""As the performance improves, then we’ll see how the vote is next year."" He spoke on the sidelines of an S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings insurance conference in New York. 
Duperreault, known in the insurance industry as a turnaround expert, joined AIG in May 2017 to boost the company's performance.
The nonbinding resolution to endorse the firm’s executive compensation received support from just 55% of votes cast, according to a May 21 securities filing by the company. That was far below the norm of 90% or more for U.S. stock issuers.
Influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to vote against compensation packages for the insurer’s top executives, arguing in recent reports that AIG’s top executives get paid too much compared with the company's performance.
In the first quarter, AIG showed signs of improvement after years of losses. It beat Wall Street expectations, with its general insurance business posting an underwriting profit for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
As of Wednesday's close AIG shares had climbed 14% since the company announced first-quarter results on May 6. 
AIG said in an April proxy filing that it undertook a ""robust review"" of its compensation program after its 2018 annual meeting. At that meeting, just 62% of shareholders approved a $43.1 million pay package that the board gave Duperreault when he joined the company in 2017. 
The company had said it increased transparency about compensation and revised its incentive compensation program, among other changes, in response to investors' concerns.

Duperreault said that engagement with shareholders is normal for the company. ""We're always talking to our shareholders,"" he said. ""We're not increasing it because of this and we're not decreasing it.""

Anticipation is running hot. Anticipation of what, is a separate question. Will a weak report boost rate-cut odds? Or maybe the cuts are priced in and the sight of a tanking economy will sow terror. Maybe solid data will douse recession fears. Or maybe just stiffen resolve against easing.
Good may be good, or good may be bad. Wall Street is decidedly undecided.
Mixed economic data isn’t helping. A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity fell in May to the lowest level since October 2016. But U.S. household wealth hit a record in the first quarter and different measures of confidence have soared. Then again, a preview of private sector hiring wasn’t just ominous -- it was downright doomy. Data from ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute showed companies in May added the fewest U.S. workers in any month since 2010.
Economists are expecting an increase of 175,000 in payrolls on Friday, according to Bloomberg’s survey, with the unemployment rate staying at 3.6%. Here are four views from market watchers on the differing scenarios:
“That’s the crazy thing right now -- we’re back in this environment where a bad jobs report may actually help the markets because they look at that and they say ‘Well, now the Fed’s really going to come in with some more stimulus.’ It’s a case of if we get a really bad number, you could actually see stocks rebound somewhat.
We’ve seen some of that already. Valuations are decent right now, stocks aren’t as expensive as they were. And again, the U.S. economy is holding up fairly well. I think that a bad report, depending on just how bad it is and where we see it end up, if we see jobs decreasing that’s one thing, but wages are an important factor. If we see wages start to slip again, which I don’t expect, that could really come in and hurt the market because consumers are still fairly confident.”
“If we see a really bad number, the market’s going to go down. If it’s anything close to the ADP number, and if it’s supported by the data -- pickup in unemployment and a really weak payroll number -- I think the market falls quite a bit. And the bond yield, more importantly, probably drops below 2% on the 10-year. That would be spooky. We’re not that far. It probably won’t happen, but I do think there’s a risk.”
“If we get a jump in claims and a bad report on Friday with jobs, I think the stock market will be back below 2,700 and the bond yield could be below 2%. There’s a risk of having a series of bad reports given where the market is right now. That’s why I do think the Fed needs to act -- or, they’ll be reacting on Friday after the fact, which won’t be as good.”
If the report is strong, “then the case is that maybe the economy is not sinking as quickly and maybe the Fed is right to say, ‘Hey, we’ve got policy about right at this point, so bond market, you have probably overreacted and maybe that inverted yield curve needs to become less inverted.’ In that case, it might be good for stocks but bad for bonds. I personally would take comfort from a stronger report than a weaker report.”
“It should attract outsize attention because of the current context. U.S. economic growth looks like it lost momentum in the second quarter. We’ve had a string of disappointing economic data and with the trade tensions escalating and the trade war looking like it could be with us for a while, the odds for a deal seem to have declined pretty significantly over the past month. That’s something that could sour business and consumer confidence going forward. The U.S. labor market so far has been a pillar of strength despite clear signs of manufacturing slowdown.”
“You need to see multiple months of either a low print or a high print to get conviction on a trend. We’re not going to be too worried about it, but it [ADP] does show that business are cautious right now because of the uncertainty. The surprise part of that ADP was small businesses are actually seeing a contraction. That was a bit of a surprise and worth paying attention to. But again, you need to see several months to gain any type of confidence that a trend is being established.”
“If we get a strong jobs report, probably equities will decline slightly because the probability of a rate cut would decline. And a good part of this recent rally was due to more rate cuts priced. It also depends what average hourly earnings are.”

CARACAS (Reuters) - Citibank and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have taken control of around $1.4 billion of Venezuelan government gold, which they received as guarantees for loans, as a result of U.S. sanctions on the Venezuelan Central Bank, according to five sources.
Between 2014 and 2016 the central bank (BCV) used a portion of its foreign gold reserves to guarantee financial operations with banks to boost liquidity, with the intention of repaying the loans to avoid losing the gold.
Five sources with knowledge of the deals said the BCV had agreed with Citibank and Deutsche Bank to buy back the gold in 2020 and 2021, but since the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the BCV in April the banks had invoked a condition of the contracts to retain ownership of the bars.
Both banks had resolved that an ""event of default"" had occurred due to the sanctions, as established in agreements underpinning the gold swap deals, the sources said.
Citibank took control of gold for around $400 million BCV was supposed to repay in 2020. For a separate guarantee Deutsch Bank took $1 billion, the sources said.
Citibank and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and the BCV did not respond to a request to comment.
Reuters has not been able to review the gold swap contracts the BCV signed with the banks and it is not clear if the central bank could initiate legal proceedings to seek to regain control of the gold.
Since 2017, the BCV has partially recovered some gold bars it used to guarantee the loans, at the same time as it began to sell dozens of tonnes of gold to Turkey and other Middle Eastern allies to earn vital foreign currency, according to the sources and official data.
The BCV in 2018 had paid $172 million to Citibank to recover part of the gold it had put up as guarantee in a swap operation.
In March of this year, the BCV was unable to pay $1.1 billion to Citibank via a repurchase agreement to recover part of the gold it gave to Citibank for a $1.6 billion loan, sources told Reuters at the time. The BCV was supposed to pay another $400 million in 2020 to Citibank under the agreement, but Citibank has now taken the gold instead. 
Both banks can now sell the Venezuelan gold to recover the value of the loans, and any money left over would be returned to Venezuela, the sources said. But under U.S. sanctions banks are restricted from carrying out any transactions with the BCV.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido's team has approached Citibank and Deutsche Bank to ask the banks to deposit a portion of the gold in accounts that President Nicolas Maduro's government can not access, three sources said.
Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as illegitimate after he secured re-election last year in a vote widely considered fraudulent.

Most Western nations recognize Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader, while Maduro calls Guaido a coup-mongering U.S. puppet.

932,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FedEx to hire 700 flexible rural and residential drivers,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said it plans to hire about 700 flexible, part-time Express drivers in 160 U.S. residential and rural markets as customer-turned-competitor Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) puts pressure on established delivery firms. 
FedEx, like global rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), is investing billions of dollars to cope with the boom in low-margin residential deliveries, which account for just over half of total package volume versus 20 percent in 2000.
Taking small numbers of packages the ""last mile"" to shoppers' doorsteps and far-flung homes is more costly than delivering scads of envelopes and packages to office buildings - the latter of which has been the Memphis-based company's bread and butter.
A typical residential delivery costs FedEx and UPS $1.60 more than a commercial delivery. They have surcharges to help cover the extra expense, but retailers are pushing back as they work to lower the cost of ever-faster - and still free - shipping, said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix.
The lower-cost, part-time drivers will use company vehicles, receive no benefits, work no more than four weekly shifts, and be paid $17.10 per hour in most markets - including Paducah, Kentucky; Roswell, New Mexico; and Jacksonville, Florida. Pay was highest, $19.66 per hour, in Kodiak, Alaska, according to a Reuters review of help wanted ads targeting 139 small to midsize cities in 31 states.
FedEx declined to give details on pay for the new employees or existing Express drivers. 
FedEx and UPS traditionally have offered some of the industry's most desirable jobs. 
FedEx Express employs more than 40,000 U.S. couriers. One person familiar with the hiring push said Express' non-union drivers make about $24 per hour and receive full benefits. Glassdoor.com put the average hourly pay at $18-$32.
UPS' unionized drivers make $20.50-$37.45, and the average total compensation for UPS small package drivers is $145,000 a year, a spokesman said.
FedEx said the part-time job category creates a group of flexible employees to supplement its existing workforce.
""This will allow us to handle fluctuations in volume by day of the week or hour of the day,"" FedEx said in an email.  
Some experts called the effort a response to Amazon, which uses an army of on-demand ""Flex"" delivery drivers who make $18-25 per hour, get no benefits, and use their own cars to drop off packages. Those low-cost gig workers help open up Amazon's delivery markets. They also handle overflow and re-deliveries from the independent van owners that Amazon hires for daily routes.
""It sounds to me like they're moving toward the gig economy,"" John Haber, chief executive of consultancy Spend Management Experts, said of FedEx Express.
The project comes as Don Colleran - who was appointed CEO of FedEx Express in March - works to turn around the division now grappling with higher-than-expected costs related to integrating its European TNT Express business, a cooling global economy, and margin-squeezing e-commerce growth. 
Haber and other consultants said the new part-time drivers could support FedEx Express' ""Extra Hours"" service that allows retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc to fulfill online orders into the evening for next-day local delivery. 
""They've got a ton of Walmart business. If these drivers are rural, this fits the Walmart model,"" Haber said.
Others said the move takes FedEx in the wrong direction.
""They should be downsizing the Express network, not expanding it,"" said Jindel, who is advocating for FedEx to merge Express with its more efficient North American Ground operation that outsources delivery to a network of independent providers. 
""Why don't they use their Ground contractors to deliver (those packages) for them?"" said Jindel, who helped found Roadway Package System (RPS), which was rebranded as FedEx Ground in 2000 - two years after FedEx bought its parent company.
Meanwhile, FedEx Ground is working to ring out more residential profits by shifting the delivery of nearly 2 million SmartPost packages from and the U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to its own drivers. That should lower costs by increasing the number of parcels dropped at every stop. 
Atlanta-based UPS operates one network in the United States and is more profitable than FedEx - even though residential deliveries make up 47% of its volume versus 25% at FedEx, according to ShipMatrix.
Shares in UPS slipped 0.4% in afternoon trading, while FedEx was down 1.3%. 
UPS is not likely to replicate FedEx Express' strategy any time soon.
""We do not use part-time drivers outside of the period specified in our contract with the Teamsters, which includes periods around the peak holiday season,"" UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said.

933,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 02:40PM ET</span>",Mexico Cites Advances in U.S. Talks to Avert Trump's Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said negotiators looking to avert Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs over illegal migration had made unspecified advances, but a Trump aide predicted the duties will take effect next week.
“Talks will continue this afternoon -- they’re not over yet -- I think they are advancing,” Ebrard told reporters in Spanish at the State Department, where he met with unspecified U.S. officials Thursday. “In the afternoon, I’ll be able to give you a more concrete update.”
Earlier, though, White House aide Mercedes Schlapp said that Mexico hadn’t offered to do enough to curb migration to the U.S.
“It looks like we’re moving towards this path of tariffs, because what we’ve seen so far is that the Mexicans, what they’re proposing, is simply not enough,” Schlapp said in a Fox News interview.
Staff-level meetings are scheduled to start at 2 p.m. at the White House, a U.S. official said. A meeting between Ebrard, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday ended without a deal, both sides said there was progress.
Pence and Trump are both traveling today, and it’s not clear if a deal can be closed without them. The president urged Mexico to make more concessions.
“We’ve told Mexico the tariffs go on” if no deal is made, Trump told reporters in France, where he spoke at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day. “They have to step up to the plate.”
Trump said progress was made during the 90-minute meeting at the White House on Wednesday and that “something pretty dramatic could happen” in the coming days. But he continued to hold out the threat that the U.S. will follow through with tariffs on Monday.
“If no agreement is reached, Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday, with monthly increases as per schedule,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “The higher the Tariffs go, the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!”
The peso was trading at 19.7456 per dollar, down 0.8%, at 1:02 p.m. in New York, as the currency reeled from the U.S. tariff threats and more pessimistic assessments from ratings companies. Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday cut Mexico’s outlook to negative from stable, and then Fitch lowered the nation’s sovereign rating to BBB from BBB+.
But Ebrard, after the meeting, said he was optimistic the two sides could reach a deal.
“We are optimistic because we had a good meeting with respectful positions from both parts,” Ebrard said during a press conference Wednesday at the Mexican Embassy in Washington. “We had an opportunity to explain our point of view.”
Ebrard said they didn’t discuss the tariffs during the meeting with the U.S. delegation, which also included Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.
Trump last month announced a 5% tariff on all imports from Mexico unless the country takes “decisive measures” -- as judged by his administration -- to stem migrants entering the U.S. He said the tariffs would begin June 10 and scale up incrementally until they reach 25% on Oct. 1. Mexico is the second largest source of U.S. imports after China.
Trump isn’t only threatening Mexico trade with tariffs. He reiterated on Thursday that the U.S. is prepared to place levies on another $300 billion of imports from China if necessary and asserted that Beijing “wants to make a deal badly.”
“A lot of interesting things are happening,” he added.
Trump said earlier in the day he thought Mexico also wants to reach an agreement. “I think they want to make a deal and they sent their top people to try to do it,” he said Wednesday in Ireland.
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut called Trump’s deal-making skills “a con job” on Twitter Thursday. “Trump says everybody wants to make a deal and we’re way past the halfway point of his presidency and no one has made a deal,” he wrote. “Not China. Not Iran. Not North Korea. And the one deal he did do, with Mexico and Canada, he’s in the process of destroying.”
On Wednesday, Ebrard highlighted some differences. While the U.S. is looking for measures to take effect “immediately,” Mexico wants to take steps that are longer term and “not just punitive.”
The White House has so far been vague about what Trump, the self-avowed “Tariff Man,” expects Mexico to do to avoid the duties. But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro offered what appeared to be an opening salvo in negotiations earlier Wednesday, saying tariffs may not have to take effect if Mexico could meet three conditions, including keeping U.S. asylum seekers in that country.
“The most important thing is for the Mexican government to take the asylum seekers,” Navarro said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg TV in Washington.
The number of apprehensions and people denied entry along the U.S.-Mexico border has been rising steadily. More than 144,000 people were apprehended after illegally crossing the southern border in May or were refused entry to the U.S., Customs and Border Protection announced on Wednesday. That’s the the most in a single month in at least five years; the number has grown every month since January.
Most of the apprehensions are families or children traveling alone, pressuring a U.S. immigration system that has struggled to humanely detain and care for them.
The White House has said there’s an emergency at the border and demanded that Mexico accept the asylum seekers, step up patrols of its own southern border and strengthen checkpoints along the route migrants travel.
Ebrard acknowledged the influx.
“The starting points for both parties is that we recognize that the current situation can’t remain as it is,” Ebrard said during the press conference. “Because the numbers reported, the flow of people, effectively, are growing far too much.”
Republican lawmakers have warned against the Mexico tariffs and are pushing for a deal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told administration officials that Trump should hold off on any tariffs until he can personally make his case to lawmakers.
In the Democratic-led House of Representatives, Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said he will introduce a resolution of disapproval to cancel any national emergency declaration that would be needed to give Trump the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs.
“Commandeering U.S. trade policy to influence border security is an abuse of power,” Neal said in a statement. “If the president does declare a national emergency and attempt to put these tariffs into place, I will introduce a resolution of disapproval to stop his overreach.”
A similar resolution to cancel a previous national emergency Trump declared in February was adopted in both chambers, but House Republicans halted an effort to override Trump’s veto. If Neal introduces another resolution, it would likely meet the same fate.
The tariff threat also cast doubt on the future of Trump’s update of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a key accomplishment of his first term. The new trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, was already at risk of stalling in Congress. The Trump administration wants it passed by summer.

LONDON (Reuters) - The collapse of merger talks between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles(FCA) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) marks a setback for a tight network of current and former Goldman Sachs' bankers who tried to convince the French political establishment to back the deal.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) had elbowed out FCA's house bank UBS, which was close to FCA's late Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, to lead on the deal for the Italian-U.S. carmaker.
Helping Renault was New York-based Ardea Partners, a boutique advisory firm launched in 2016 by Chris Cole who had spent 30 years at Goldman Sachs including co-chairing the investment banking business.
""This deal was cooked up among friends who have known each other for years,"" said a source involved in the talks. ""But despite their relationship and banking experience, it all fell apart.""
Cole was directly involved in the negotiations on behalf of Renault and had Goldman's chairman of investment banking, FX de Mallmann, as his counterpart representing FCA.
The pair worked closely with another former Goldman banker, Laurent Clarenbach, who spent 10 years at the Wall Street bank between 2001 and 2011 and is now a partner at French boutique bank d'Angelin & Co.
London-based d'Angelin, launched by French banker Benoit d'Angelin in 2017, was brought in by FCA to help market the 33 billion euro ($37 billion) deal to the French government given his founder's close ties with French President Emmanuel Macron.
The French government owns 15% of Renault and was immediately seen as a major obstacle to getting a deal done.
But advisers at both sides of the negotiating table were bullish about finding an agreement.
""Their long-lasting friendship and mutual trust played a role in keeping them upbeat, even when Paris starting demanding more control over the merged entity,"" one source close to the deal said.
TACTICS ""BACKFIRED""
Ardea Partners and Goldman often help each other on business and share work for high profile clients. They are currently advising advertising giant WPP (LON:WPP) on its ongoing sale of data analytics unit Kantar. Ardea's executive team mainly consists of former Goldman bankers including James Del Favero, who spent 26 years at the Wall Street bank.
The Goldman network had been expected to secure the backing of Macron's government before the deal became public, several sources said, adding Goldman deployed staff from its New York, Paris and London offices in a bid to win France's blessing.
But, this time, Goldman and its allies failed to deliver, amid demands for more control by the French state and resistance from Renault's alliance partner Nissan, which decided to abstain from a Renault board vote on the deal.
""They couldn't navigate the complexity of this deal and their plan of sidelining Nissan backfired,"" the first source said.
Goldman declined to comment on this report, while Ardea Partners was not immediately available for comment.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire demanded that, as one of the main conditions for talks to progress, the deal needed the backing of Nissan.
But FCA and its banks did not lay the groundwork to secure Nissan's endorsement, having kept the Japanese carmaker in the dark about the merger plan to avoid leaks. 

""It was an ill-conceived deal from the start,"" said a source close to Nissan. ""FCA's advisers thought they could corner Nissan and secure France's approval in a couple of days. They clearly minimized the risks.""

Canopy rose about 1% in early afternoon trading. The largest marijuana company on the globe was bucking the trend largely due to an endorsement by Stifel analyst Andrew Carter, who initiated coverage of the Ontario-based marijuana company yesterday with a buy rating that came with a target price of C$64 (US$47.77).

Looker will be integrated into Google Cloud after the deal closes later this year and will play a key role in the tech giant's efforts to analyze data across the cloud, according to Google. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 0.60% in afternoon trading.
The deal will build on a partnership that the two companies currently share with more than 350 joint customers, including Buzzfeed, Hearst, Sunrun, WPP (LON:WPP) and Yahoo.
At its core, Lookers' secret sauce essentially cuts down the heavy lifting involved in analyzing large datasets. This may boost Google's cloud offering, as its clients will be better equipped to take advantage of the various analytics available on the tech giant's platform.
Alphabet doesn't yet disclose revenue that Google's cloud business. In December, ZD Net estimated it at roughly $4 billion a year, well behind the cloud businesses of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). The latter's Amazon Web Services reported $7.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter alone. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment generated $9.7 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter.
In a world where every byte counts and the speed by which data is turned into action can be the difference between a dollar gained or lost, Looker's ability to parse data, unsurprisingly, has not gone unnoticed.
""The combination of Google Cloud and Looker will enable customers to harness data in new ways to drive their digital transformation,"" Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said.

938,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>",Prosecutors suspect 70 Deutsche Bank managers in dividend tax probe: paper,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors have extended an investigation into a tax-stripping scheme, with around 70 current and former executives of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) now being treated as suspects, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Thursday, citing unnamed sources. 
No comment was immediately available outside office hours from the Cologne prosecutor's office.
In a statement, Deutsche Bank confirmed that further current and former managers were under investigation, but did not say who they were. It also said they were not involved in the tax scheme.
Investigators suspect managers at Deutsche and other banks of exploiting a loophole to allow two parties to claim ownership of the same shares, making it possible to claim fraudulent dividend tax rebates running to billions of euros.
This scam, known as 'cum-ex', is being investigated by several prosecutors' offices, casting one of many shadows over Deutsche Bank as CEO Christian Sewing strives to map a path to sustainable profitability after years of losses at Deutsche.
Deutsche Bank said that the Cologne prosecutor had been investigating two former employees since 2017 in connection with cum-ex transactions on behalf of former clients.
""Recently, the prosecutor has initiated investigations against further former and current employees and management board members,"" it said in a statement.
It added the change in approach by the Cologne prosecutor was linked to procedural issues related to the statute of limitations, and did not imply that the prosecutor had changed its view on the facts of the case.
""This has also not changed the Bank's assessment of the facts of the case. Deutsche Bank did not participate in an organized cum-ex market, neither as short seller nor as Cum-Ex purchaser,"" Deutsche said.
The Sueddeutsche said that fraudulent tax claims related to the 2009 business year, running to more than a billion euros, would expire soon unless prosecutors press criminal charges.

Reuters reported in January that investigators had found indications that senior managers had discussed the reputational risks related to the cum-ex scheme, which sparked Germany's biggest post-war fraud probe.

Now, he’s advising investors take profits and close out the trade.
In early May, the co-founder and chief investment officer of DoubleLine Capital LP said interest-rate volatility could not possibly remain as low as it’s been the past eight years. To turn a profit, he recommended investors employ a put-call straddle on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT) ETF, known by its ticker TLT. In a tweet late Wednesday, he said it’s time to cash out.
Bond yields plummeted and interest-rate volatility spiked last month after trade talks between the U.S. and China fell apart. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch’s MOVE Index, which tracks Treasury volatility, rose nearly 50% in May and currently sits at the highest level in 2 1/2 years.
Gundlach weighed in on the swift bond rally last week, too, tweeting that longer-dated Treasury price-action appeared to be consistent with a “blowoff momentum top.” The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell from 2.9% to 2.57% in May, the biggest monthly drop in three years. As of 1:01 p.m. in New York, 30-year Treasury yields stood at 2.59%.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>",U.S. yield curve flattens after ECB move; stocks inch up,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened on Thursday as the European Central Bank committed to leaving interest rates steady into the first half of 2020, while major world stock indexes mostly edged higher.
The ECB's move was less aggressive than what some traders had expected and led to selling of shorter-dated German government debt, which in turn spilled over to shorter U.S. Treasury maturities, traders and analysts said.
Much of the Treasury yield curve flattened, coming off its steepest level in seven months the day before. The gap between two-year and 10-year yields narrowed by 2.6 basis points to 25.10 basis points.
German 10-year yields tumbled to record low of -0.240% before retracing to -0.232%. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.1019%, from 2.123% late on Wednesday.
""In Europe, the selling came with some pricing in of an ECB rate cut,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at SG Corporate & Investment Banking in New York.
U.S. stocks were higher in early afternoon trading, with continued hopes of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve helping to support the market.
Limiting the day's gains were escalating trade tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would decide on more China tariffs ""probably right after the G20,"" on June 28 and 29. That followed his overnight threat to put tariffs on ""at least"" another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. 
The latest flare-up in tensions follows mixed economic data that rekindled worries about the health of the world's top economies but also spurred expectations that central banks could ride to the rescue.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.77 points, or 0.29%, to 25,613.34, the S&P 500 gained 6.18 points, or 0.22%, to 2,832.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.66 points, or 0.05%, to 7,571.81.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.02% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12%.
Mexico's peso suffered a double whammy of trade woes with the United States and the downgrade of the country's credit rating. 
The Mexican peso fell 0.81% versus the U.S. dollar to 19.75.
The dollar index fell 0.46%, with the euro up 0.66% to $1.1293.
Oil futures were largely steady, after falling to near five-month lows in the previous session.

U.S. crude fell 0.23% to $51.56 per barrel.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>","Japanese lender SMFG eyes Philippines, India in Asia growth push","By Takashi Umekawa and Taro Fuse
TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) aims to expand its business in Asia and is looking at the Philippines, India and Myanmar for possible future investment, the CEO of Japan's second-largest bank by assets said.
SMFG, like other Japanese lenders, has been stepping up overseas investments in the past few years as it continues to face razor-thin margins at home amid an aging population and massive central bank stimulus. Now, signs of another economic downturn are threatening to weigh on banks in the country.
""We are looking at Asian countries with growing economy and population as well as nations that have built good relations with Japan,"" Jun Ota said, adding he plans to raise SMFG's actual profit by more than 20% during his tenure as CEO - a job he took up in April. 
Ota's predecessor, Takeshi Kunibe, had said in December that the lender was weighing acquiring Asian commercial banks, using some of the up to $12 billion in surplus capital that the group expects to build up over the next five years.
Among Japanese banks, SMFG has led the foray into Asian markets, spending about 150 billion yen ($1.39 billion) in 2013 and 2014 to buy 40 percent of Indonesia's mid-sized lender PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk (BTPN). It completed the deal in February this year.
CEO Ota identified Philippines and India as its next targets, adding Myanmar could possibly be a target too.
SMFG's bigger rival Mitusbishi UFJ Financial Group has since 2013 invested in Philippine Security Bank Corp, Thailand's Bank of Ayudhya Pcl and Bank Danamon Indonesia.
Ota also told Reuters that he would raise the group's actual profit to 800 billion yen during his tenure, from 650 billion yen reached over the past two years, referring to a metric that excludes certain factors including credit costs.
He did not give a specific timeframe, but analysts expect he will serve as CEO for about six years.
Japan's three largest banks all reported lower profits for the year ended March, highlighting the challenges faced by the banking industry as the world's No.3 economy looks to be headed for another downturn. SMFG has cautioned its net earnings will drop 4% in the current financial year.

By an 8-3 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said there was enough in common among vehicle drivers to let them settle as a group.
The appeals court also said there was no evidence of collusion between the drivers' lawyers and the automakers.

The litigation began after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found flaws in Hyundai's and Kia's testing procedures, and the automakers lowered fuel efficiency estimates for about 900,000 vehicles in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 model years.

950,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>",The Deal That Ran Out of Road: How the Fiat-Renault Merger Died,"(Bloomberg) -- Shortly after 9 p.m., as the sun began to set on the rotund glass facade housing  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s headquarters on the outskirts of Paris, the board called a break. The group had gathered for the second time in as many days to sign off on a proposed merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. As the talks dragged on, a delegate for the state asked to liaise with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who was having dinner back in town at his hulking ministry protruding into the River Seine.
Le Maire laid down a red line for Martin Vial, his representative at the table and the voice of Renault’s biggest and most powerful shareholder. France wanted a commitment from Renault partner Nissan Motor Co. to back the combination. Abstention -- as signaled earlier by the Japanese side -- wasn’t good enough, Le Maire said, fearing that Nissan might begin undermining the alliance if it couldn’t be held accountable with a firm vote.
Back in the conference room, the servings of sushi and pizza sourced by security guards had lost their appeal by the time the group reconvened around 11 p.m. The mood, too, was drab. It quickly became clear that Nissan would, in fact, abstain in a vote. When the turn came to Vial to speak, he presented the panel with the government’s game plan.
The minister saw an opening to get Nissan on board: over the weekend, G-20 finance ministers are gathering in Fukuoka, Japan, and Le Maire wanted to use his persuasive powers to win over the Japanese partner. Then, to everyone’s surprise and some annoyance, Vial suggested they postpone the vote and reconvene the following week after Le Maire had returned.
No More Patience
Over in Italy, meanwhile, John Elkann’s patience was wearing thin. The scion of the Agnelli family and disciple of the late Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne was also getting updates on the meeting back in Paris, and to him, this latest government curve ball was one too many. Elkann had spent weeks stitching together the deal with Renault CEO Jean-Dominique Senard, keeping the French government closely informed, and felt that he had met their demands at every turn. An hours-long board meeting on Tuesday had ended without a vote because representatives wanted more time, and now Elkann’s appetite for further delays was exhausted.
After a brief phone conversation with Senard back in Paris, the 43 year-old orchestrated a stunning maneuver. He gathered the Fiat Chrysler board members for a quick meeting, where the group decided to withdraw its proposal to merge. Shortly after 1 a.m., the company sent a terse release, all but blaming the French government for the decision by saying the country lacked the “political conditions” to support the accord.
And so imploded one of the most ambitious global mergers in recent years, less than two weeks after it was first disclosed, an audacious plan to emulsify diverse car brands from France, the U.S., and Italy into the world’s No. 3 -- with the promise of reaching the pinnacle if Japan could later be brought into the fold.
This account of the final days of the negotiations leading up to the midnight breakdown is based on accounts from people close to the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The carmakers and the government declined to comment on the meetings.
Good Relationship
In the run-up to the shocking collapse, all sides had appeared on a path to get the deal through. Elkann and Senard had built a close rapport in recent weeks, frequently meeting in Paris or Turin for informal gatherings to hammer out the finer points. The two European companies also made sure to keep the door open for Nissan should the Japanese partner want to join the group at a later stage.
The French government, with its 15% stake in Renault that comes with powerful double voting rights, also showed support, albeit with some strings attached: the merger should function within the Renault-Nissan framework and not jeopardize the successful partnership; jobs and production sites in France needed to be protected; governance should be maintained; and the group should participate in a project to create a European battery champion.
Nissan’s role in particular was an important sticking point for the government. Senard traveled to Japan in the week after the deal was disclosed for an alliance board meeting, where he took the opportunity to lay out the virtues of the combination with Fiat. France wanted Nissan firmly behind the deal, fearing that any opposition -- or even just lukewarm support -- would risk alienating a cherished industrial partner over time.
But as the Renault board prepared to meet on June 4 at the headquarters, Nissan’s position became increasingly precarious. CEO Hiroto Saikawa said the Japanese company needed to review the future of the alliance, including contractual relationships, culminating in Nissan’s decision to abstain from a vote. In the end, the first gathering wrapped up without any firm outcome, the group having spent an hour instead poring over the latest findings linked to disgraced former CEO Carlos Ghosn. They agreed to reconvene the next day.
Weary Heads
By the time the panel regrouped at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, the weariness of the inconclusive meeting had blown over, and optimism set in that the second attempt would push things along. A press conference had been tentatively arranged in Paris for the following day, the release all but prepared and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley flying in from the U.S. for the occasion. The French CGT labor union was the only negative voice at the table, but one that could be easily drowned out from the overwhelming chorus of support.
Then the great plan came crashing down, with Bloomberg News reporting in the small hours of Thursday that Fiat had withdrawn its offer.
The French government, for its part, was stunned by Elkann’s move, and needed a few hours to regain its footing. When it did, the blame game didn’t take long to erupt. Unwilling to be seen as the disrupting factor, the government said it hadn’t closed any doors, and that all it had asked for was another five days to win over Nissan. Topics like valuation, governance and jobs had been agreed upon, a French official told reporters during a briefing.
Renault, too, lamented the breakdown of the negotiations, thanking Nissan for its “constructive approach” to the deliberations and Fiat for its efforts. Fiat, on the other hand, saw the French state as the culprit, saying the government repeatedly attempted to change conditions for its support and leaving Elkann with the impression that the state was clamoring for full control of the combined entity, a demand that was unacceptable to Fiat.
“When it becomes clear that the discussions have been taken as far as they can reasonably go, it is necessary to be equally decisive in drawing matters to a close,” Elkann said in a letter to employees.
In doing so, Elkann took a page from the deal book of his mentor Marchionne, who died last year following an illness and who had been a tireless champion of consolidation in the automotive industry.
“It’s as important to walk away from the table as it is to sit down,” Marchionne said in 2014.

PARIS (Reuters) - Louis Vuitton, LVMH's biggest sales driver, has beefed up stocks of its handbags and other luxury wares to feed its growing online business in mainland China, as Chinese consumers spend more at home, its management told analysts. 
Chinese shoppers are increasingly splurging on high-end fashion and accessories locally rather than overseas, encouraged by a leveling out of prices as import tariffs drop, although that has penalized some brands struggling to capture the shift. 
Vuitton is benefiting thanks in part to a Chinese e-commerce push, according to analysts who attended a two-day closed-door briefing with the brand and LVMH.
More broadly, demand for Vuitton products within mainland China was still at ""unheard of"" levels, its CEO Michael Burke was quoted as saying. LVMH had no immediate comment. 
""Although only a third of spend on Louis Vuitton is currently local, this is growing twice as fast and a 50:50 split is now on the cards,"" Citi analyst Flavio Cereda wrote in a note. 
Over the past nine months, Vuitton shifted inventories from neighboring countries to its e-commerce site in China, which now accounted for 8 percent of the brand's sales there, Cereda added. 
Vuitton launched its online business in China in mid-2017 - just after Kering-owned rival Gucci - with Prada and Hermes following suit. 
Jeweller Tiffany, which has suffered from sharply lower spending among Chinese tourists in the United States, said this week it also planned to invest in e-commerce operations in China.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have soured amid a trade war, adding to a tougher backdrop for luxury firms in their biggest markets.
But Vuitton gave a rosy view of its U.S. business and told analysts it had opened its third U.S. handbag manufacturing site, in Texas. 
""Investors should be reassured by Louis Vuitton's 'healthy' trends in Asia and the United States,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Rogerio Fujimori wrote.
LVMH shares were flat at the close of trading on Thursday, after rising more than 2 percent earlier in the day and hitting record highs of 357.10 euros ($403.27). 
Vuitton, with annual sales around the 10.5 billion-euro mark, aims to make 1 billion euros in revenues from its watches and jewellery in the coming years, RBC's Fujimori added. 
It has already passed that threshold in its women's and men's clothing ranges, Fujimori's said. 
Asked by analysts whether LVMH might buy Chanel - after the French label sparked speculation it was on the block when it published earnings for the first time last June - the group's CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said its size would be a challenge for any buyer.
Guiony said Chanel was worth closer to 100 billion euros than the 50 billion euros often cited in media reports, Jefferies' Cereda wrote. 

Chanel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a bid to directly compete with ground beef and pork sausage, Beyond Meat Inc bills itself the world's first plant-based burger sold in the meat case of U.S. grocery stores. 
But interviews with nine U.S. grocery chains show that retailers are still figuring out Beyond Meat's best fit in their shopping aisles - and it may be closer to the vegan section than the refrigerated meat department so desired by Beyond Meat.
The stakes are high in the battle over supermarket real estate, as upstart Beyond Meat seeks to quickly carve out its place in the meat section in the face of pushback from meat producers before more plant-based rivals from Impossible Foods and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) hit the market. 
Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage Inc, which owns some 150 stores in 19 states, told Reuters it places Beyond Meat in a refrigerated section with other alternative proteins like tofu, and not the meat case, to avoid confusion among shoppers, its co-president, Kemper Isely, said.
At the 35 Kings Food Markets and Balducci's Food Lover's Markets across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and the Washington D.C. area, Beyond Meat products are sold both in the dairy and meat section.
""Sales in both spaces have been great and customers generally view this as a new food category,"" said Stephen Corradini, chief merchandising officer at KB US Holdings Inc, the investment firm owning the stores. 
Other retail chains across the United States, including Town & Country Markets Inc in the Pacific Northwest, New York-based Morton Williams (NYSE:WMB) Supermarkets and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in the Midwest, echoed Corradini, saying they see high demand among customers regardless of where Beyond Meat products are placed.
Beyond Meat and its new meatless burger rivals are counting on going head to head with meat inside stores. They avoid terms such as vegan or vegetarian, and request stores do not place their products in the supermarket vegan aisle where non-meat eaters traditionally buy tofu, tempeh and other plant-based alternatives. 
Marketing its burger as one designed to look, cook and taste like traditional ground beef, Beyond Meat targets mainstream consumers who want to reduce their meat consumption amid growing concerns over health risks, animal welfare and environmental hazards of industrial animal farming.
""Find it in the meat aisle,"" the company's website says of its sausages and burger patties, which are made of yellow pea protein, coconut and canola oil.
Beyond Meat declined to comment ahead of its first earnings report scheduled for Thursday afternoon.
The company has warned in regulatory filings that changes to retail placement could hamper growth by failing to attract new customers and effectively compete with animal-based protein. Analysts consider Beyond Meat's strategic placement a ""strong advantage"" over competitors and a differentiating factor in reaching the broadest possible U.S. market which they estimate to be $100 billion by 2035. 
Investors are bullish on the business model, boosting Beyond Meat's valuation to more than $6 billion from $1.5 billion when it went public on May 2, even though the California-based company said it may never turn a profit. 
But while Beyond Meat requests stores sell its products next to real meat, there are no contractual obligations on product placement, according to interviews with nine retail chains. Some grocers, such as The Fresh Market Inc, which operates some 160 stores across 22 states, place Beyond Meat in the freezer with other veggie burgers or even the dairy section as they evaluate sales and decide on a long-term placement strategy.
""The freezer section is our initial go-to destination as our guests otherwise wouldn't intuitively know where to find the product,"" said Dwight Richmond, Fresh Market's director of grocery. 
Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Whole Foods, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Ahold Delhaize, Shop Rite, Stater Brothers and Wegmans, which all sell Beyond Meat, did not respond or declined to comment on their placement strategy. 
Sean Saenz, senior director of meat and seafood operations at Gelson's, which owns 28 stores across Southern (NYSE:SO) California, said the retailer did not see strong sales when it initially placed Beyond Meat in the freezer. 
Since moving the burger out of the freezer, Beyond Meat sales are up 60 percent, Saenz said, while sales in the overall vegan section grew 20 percent.
    ""We're still heavily weighted on probably 60 to 70 percent of the Beyond Meat being sold from the vegan location,"" Saenz said, calling purchases out of the fresh meat case ""more of an impulse buy.""
    ""I don't think it will ever be as big as meat, but it's definitely adding growing sales which is something every retailer is looking for,"" he said.
CONSUMER CONFUSION? 
The fresh meat case is one of the most restricted areas in a supermarket because space is limited and perishable items need to be chilled, according to Rick Stein, vice president of fresh foods at the Food Marketing Institute, the retail trade association.
He sees retailers carving out space for plant-based meat alternatives in the packaged meat section, next to bacon, sausages and ham, a placement aimed at adding sales.
The move has drawn the ire of the U.S. Cattlemen's Association, which wants the meat case reserved exclusively for real meat and says the new products create confusion and erode the trust consumers place in the meat case. 
""These plant-based companies are riding on the coattails of the beef industry, which has spent decades building up a healthy brand consumers trust,"" said Lia Biondo, USCA's director of policy and outreach.
COMPETITION COMING 
The debate is about to get more noisy as Beyond Meat, which began selling its burger patties to retailers about three years ago, begins to face more plant-based competitors in stores. 
""Competition over placement is clearly heating up as everyone vies for a spot in the meat case,"" said Phil Lempert, an expert on retail food trends who advises companies on food branding and consumer behavior.
Canadian packaged meat producer Maple Leaf Foods Inc, which sells plant-based meat alternatives such as vegan ground beef under its LightLife brand, expects its products in the meat case of U.S. retailers by this summer.
Impossible Foods, which has so far focused on supplying restaurants, plans to sell its Impossible Burger in supermarkets' meat cases by the end of the year.
Nestle, the world's biggest packaged foods group, seeks to sell a pea-based veggie patty called Awesome Burger under its U.S. plant-based Sweet Earth brand. Kelly Swette, who founded Sweet Earth in 2012 together with her husband, told Reuters in an interview Wednesday that Awesome Burger will be available in supermarkets and restaurants in September or October.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), the largest U.S. meat processor, is also working on its own line of alternative protein products after it sold its stake in Beyond Meat in April.
John Beretta, group vice president for meat and seafood merchandising at Albertsons Companies Inc, which owns Safeway Inc, Lucky and Randalls stores, said the meat case will change based on consumer demand, with plant-based items potentially replacing some meat products. 

""We're at a point where plant-based meats have become a segment of their own, and by the end of the year we'll have a section solely dedicated to these products inside the meat department,"" said Beretta.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Britain's John Lewis poaches boss of telecoms regulator to be new chairman,"(Reuters) - Britain's John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned retailer, has poached Sharon White, the head of UK telecoms and media regulator Ofcom, to be its new 1 million pound ($1.3 million) a year chairman.
White will step down from Ofcom around the turn of the year after more than four years in the job and succeed Charlie Mayfield at the retail group that runs John Lewis department stores and upmarket grocery chain Waitrose in early 2020.
White, a trained economist who had been seen as an outside contender to succeed Mark Carney as Bank of England Governor, will be John Lewis' sixth chairman and the first woman to hold the high-profile position in the retailer's 155-year history.
Before joining Ofcom, White was a senior government official in Britain's finance, justice and international development departments. 
She has also worked as an adviser at the UK Prime Minister's Policy Unit and in Washington DC as a senior economist at the World Bank.
""I readily recognize that Sharon is not the conventional retail choice. But these are not conventional retail times, nor is the partnership a conventional company,"" said Mayfield, chairman since 2007.
Mayfield said White had had a stellar career in a number of senior strategic and executive roles, and had stood out as an exceptional candidate.
""I believe she has the vision, leadership, drive and flair to steer the partnership through its next phase,"" he said.
In March the partnership reported a 45% drop in full-year profit and cut its staff bonus to the lowest in 66 years, as it dealt with weak demand and rising costs as well as the approach of Britain's exit from the European Union. 
Mayfield said at the time that a no-deal Brexit would be ""extremely unfortunate and damaging"" to it and other companies.
""PASSIONATE BELIEVER""
White said she was a ""passionate believer"" in the John Lewis co-ownership model, which has been lauded by government and sees profits shared out among its 83,900 staff, which it calls partners.
""John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners are not merely British retail icons, but also a model of a better way to do business,"" she said.
""In my current role, my vision has been to ensure that consumers in fast-moving markets get high quality, reliable services at fair prices, from thriving businesses they can trust."" 
White is the third leader of Ofcom, an independent regulator set up in 2003 to bring together the duties of five organizations across broadcasting and telecommunications.
She forced Britain's former telecoms monopoly provider BT to separate the national broadband network into a different unit, stopping short of a complete split, to improve customer service and drive investment in fiber connections. 
She also sold the airwaves for 5G mobile services, and started regulating the publicly-funded BBC.
Ofcom said it had begun the search for White's successor.

Her basic pay at John Lewis will be 990,000 pounds, though she will also be eligible for the annual partnership bonus.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",Trade tensions may dent defensive armor of consumer staples stocks,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of consumer staples companies are commonly seen as a safe harbor among U.S. equities but may be more susceptible to the fallout from tensions between the United States and its trading partners than other defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate.
Persistent trade disputes could raise the cost of goods for consumer staples companies and squeeze their margins, which would hamper their performance in the months to come, market watchers say. U.S. tariffs have also weighed on China's economy and could have a similar impact on other targeted countries, which would hurt the performance of companies that sell to those countries.
Stocks dived in May after U.S. President Donald Trump stated he intended to hike tariffs on goods from China. Those increases, to 25% from 10% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, went into effect on Saturday.
The S&P 500 has risen some 2.8% so far in June as expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates have for the moment superseded trade worries.
But Trump has also vowed to levy import taxes on goods from Mexico in an attempt to pressure Mexican authorities to stem illegal immigration into the United States, though Mexico has held talks with the United States in an effort to avoid such tariffs.
Over the past month, investors have turned to less risky assets such as U.S. government bonds. Among stocks, utilities, real estate and consumer staples shares, which are considered bond proxies because of their high dividend yields, outperformed the S&P 500, which fell 6.6% in May.
According to a Reuters analysis based on data from Yardeni Research, consumer staples outperformed the S&P 500 in four of the five times since 2009 that the benchmark index has dropped more than 10% and led performance among bond proxies once. 
But they have lagged utilities and real estate recently. Among the bond proxy group in May, the S&P 500 real estate index eked out a 0.05% gain, and the S&P 500 utilities index fell 0.6%, both holding up better than the S&P 500 consumer staples index, which dropped 3.5%. 
""Because trade and tariffs are starting to heat up again, there's not as much of a safe-haven in consumer staples as much as something like utilities,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""You can get some benefit in being more selective among defensive sectors.""
Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York, recently revised his allocation of consumer staples shares to underweight from overweight. He has maintained overweight exposure to utilities.
""Their margins are so thin already, so when they get hit with tariffs, it becomes exponentially more problematic,"" he said of consumer staples companies.
Campbell Soup Co has said tariffs on Mexican goods would raise its costs, and such levies are also expected to have a significant impact on Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) and Brown-Forman Corp, which import beer and tequila, respectively, from Mexico.
It's not just a matter of costs. Eleven U.S.-listed consumer staples companies - including  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) - are estimated to generate at least a tenth of their sales in China, and six companies in the sector are estimated to get at least 5 percent of their sales in Mexico. The utilities and real estate sectors, which are domestically focused, lack such exposure. 
Indeed, though Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York, has an ""overweight"" rating for consumer staples, in her view the sector has high risk exposure to a potential trade conflict with Mexico and moderate exposure to the trade war with China.
""The trade war disadvantages them a little bit, compared to utilities and real estate,"" she said.
The sector has long faced profit margin pressures, said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston, and an escalated global trade conflict would only exacerbate that issue. If trade conflicts were to weigh on the U.S. economy, the sector's rising leverage ratios could also pose trouble, in his view.
""It's a sector more leveraged than normal, and it has more risk of margin decay, and those are issues it's had in the past,"" he said.
To be sure, some strategists find advantages in consumer staples. Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston, favors the sector as a defensive play based upon its return on equity and 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio.
""From a valuation standpoint, it's reasonable,"" she said. ""Utilities and REITs have become more expensive.""
Even those who favor consumer staples shares, however, acknowledge that as long as trade tensions remain prominent among investors' concerns, the sector's defensive properties are likely to be tested.

""We're starting to run out of places to hide,"" RBC's Calvasina said. ""Almost every sector has some political issues out there.""

957,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 11:01AM ET</span>",France seeks to fend off blame for FCA-Renault deal collapse,"By Laurence Frost and Giulio Piovaccari
PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - France was battling to defend its business strategy on Thursday after being blamed for scuppering a $35 billion-plus merger between carmakers Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) only 10 days after the plan was officially announced.
Shares in Italian-American FCA and France's Renault fell sharply in early trade after FCA pulled out of talks, saying ""the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully.""
The collapse of the deal, which would have created the world's third-biggest carmaker behind Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), revives questions about how both FCA and Renault will meet the challenges of costly investments in electric and self-driving cars on their own. 
The French government, which has a 15% stake in Renault, had welcomed the merger plan, but overplayed its hand by pushing for a series of guarantees and concessions that eventually exhausted the patience of FCA, sources familiar with the talks said. 
Wrong-footed by FCA's decision to withdraw its merger proposal late on Wednesday, a French official called FCA Chairman John Elkann early on Thursday to see if he might reconsider, but was rebuffed, one of the sources said. 
While France has a long history of government interference in business, President Emmanuel Macron came to power promising a broadly market-friendly agenda. The failure of the FCA deal risks leaving Renault locked into Europe's stagnant mass-market for cars, and deterring other potential suitors, analysts said.
NISSAN FACTOR
French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday the government had engaged constructively, but had not been prepared to back a deal without the endorsement of Renault's current alliance partner Nissan.
Nissan had said it would abstain at a Renault board meeting to vote on the merger proposal.
The merger had aimed to achieve 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in annual synergies, with FCA gaining access to Renault's superior electric drive technology and the French firm getting a share of FCA's lucrative Jeep and RAM brands. 
Achieving the planned 5 billion euros in FCA-Renault synergies would depend partly on access to technology jointly owned by Nissan, executives had said.
However, a source close to FCA played down the significance of Nissan's stance in the discussions and blamed the French government for succumbing to political pressure at home. 
The FCA-Renault talks were conducted against the backdrop of a French public outcry over 1,044 layoffs at a  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) factory. The U.S. company had promised to safeguard jobs there when it acquired France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in 2015.
FCA has long been looking for a merger partner, and some analysts say its search for a deal is becoming more urgent as it is ill-prepared for tougher new regulations on emissions. It previously held unsuccessful talks with Peugeot maker PSA Group, in which the French state also owns a stake.
""We remain open to any industrial consolidation opportunity, but without rushing in order to guarantee the industrial interests of Renault and the French nation,"" Le Maire told the Senate in a weekly government questions session.
However, Evercore ISI analysts said the chances of a deal with FCA had ""materially fallen.""
Renault said in a statement it was disappointed not to be able to pursue the merger, but that FCA's interest highlighted the attractiveness of the company and its alliance with Nissan. 
BLAME GAME
The collapse of the deal could further fray relations between Renault and Nissan, already strained by the arrest and ouster of alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is now facing trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.
Nissan, which is 43% owned by Renault and has recently rebuffed a full merger proposal from its French partner, was blindsided by the FCA-Renault tie-up plan and said it would require a fundamental review of its relationship with Renault.
""How can we support the deal?"" said a Nissan management source soon before the talks collapsed. ""We weren’t at the table, so we haven’t had time to evaluate its impact on Nissan and the alliance.""
The deal's failure could also add to financial markets' frustration with France. 
""With FCA pulling its merger offer, one has to wonder how much the French state is set on limiting Renault’s strategic and valuation opportunities despite having only a 15% stake,"" analysts at brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note to clients.
At 1450 GMT, Renault shares were down 7.1% at 52.19 euros, while FCA shares in Milan had recovered most of their early losses to trade down 0.1% at 11.61 euros. Nissan shares had earlier closed down 1.7% 
PSA shares, meanwhile, were up 1.9%, as some analysts speculated it could again be targeted by FCA. 
But one banker who has worked on several FCA and car industry deals in the past said: ""There are few alternatives available for FCA, I think they’ll try again with Renault.""
The collapse of the FCA-Renault deal also followed days of bickering between France and Italy over Paris's demands. 

""When politicians try to intervene in economic matters, it doesn't always help. I won't comment further, if FCA withdrew its offer it's because it didn't see an economic advantage, or other type of advantage,"" Deputy Prime Minister and 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio told Italian state radio on Thursday.

SAN LUIS POTOSI, Mexico (Reuters) - BMW sells cars around the world even though most countries impose tariffs on imported vehicles, a board member of the German carmaker said on Thursday, in the wake of threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to slap duties on imports from Mexico.
BMW sees no reason to change the firm's plans for Mexico at the moment or its investment plans for the North American region, said Oliver Zipse, BMW board member in charge of production. 
Zipse was in the central Mexican city of San Luis Potosi for the inauguration of a $1 billion BMW plant.
Still, other automakers have warned that the imposition of punitive duties on Mexican imports could be damaging to the industry, with Toyota Motor Corp saying on Tuesday the proposal could cost its major suppliers $1 billion.

Last week, Trump said Mexico must take a harder line on stopping the flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border or face 5% tariffs on all its exports to the United States from June 10, rising to as much as 25% later this year.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 10:41AM ET</span>","EU reviews Deutsche Bank, SocGen in screening of past money-laundering cases","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is reviewing past money-laundering cases at EU banks to assess what went wrong and decide possible tweaks to rules, an EU official said, citing  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Societe General as among the screened lenders.
The review is part of a broader plan to improve the European Union's approach to combating money laundering after a string of the bloc's banks across Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Cyprus were embroiled in scandals.
Under the plan, the European Commission is assessing cases between 2012 and 2018 with the aim of producing a report this summer that identifies the factors that contributed to the banks' failure in preventing financial crime.
While it is normal for the EU to examine industrial practices before deciding possible rule changes, the assessment of money-laundering cases shows the scale of the problem and the questions facing regulators, given many of the cases erupted after a series of legislative reforms.
Missions to EU states are under way, the official said, without clarifying whether reviews are conducted at the banks themselves or only with their national supervisors. The Commission declined to comment on this point.
The review is meant ""to better inform possible additional actions"" by the EU in strengthening its anti-money laundering tools, according to the plan published last year.
""We cannot at this stage disclose more on the scope or contents of the report,"" a spokesman for the European Commission said, declining to comment on the criteria used to select the cases under scrutiny.
The EU has no power to impose penalties on banks over failures to prevent money-laundering.
FROM ABLV TO SOCGEN
An EU official told Reuters that the review includes cases of lenders that have collapsed after money-laundering allegations, like Latvia's ABLV and Malta's Pilatus.
The official said it also includes banks that have been at the center of large scandals such as Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest bank, which has admitted to having handled through its Estonian branch 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2015.
The official added major lenders Deutsche Bank and France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) were being reviewed, without elaborating on the specific cases involved.
Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Deutsche Bank had to pay a fine of $425 million in 2017 in the United States over a ""mirror trading"" scheme that moved $10 billion out of Russia between 2011 and 2015.
Societe Generale agreed in November to pay $95 million to close a dispute in the U.S. over violations of anti-money laundering regulations. The settlement was part of a wider case in which the French bank agreed to pay $1.34 billion to end U.S. investigations over possible sanctions breaches.
EBA TOLD OFF OVER DANSKE
The plan to enhance the bloc's defenses against money laundering was adopted in December by EU finance ministers. It lists non-legislative measures that need to be carried out by 2020, although the official said there ""could be delays"".
Under the plan, EU supervisors have to clarify existing rules for assessing whether bank managers are fit for their job and on revoking banking licenses for serious breaches of anti- money-laundering rules.
National authorities are also requested to cooperate more closely.
The EU has largely left supervision of anti-money laundering activities in the hands of national authorities, who have been heavily criticized by lawmakers for failing to cooperate against a crime that is mostly carried out across borders.
France and Italy are among EU states pushing for the creation of an EU agency that would take over supervision powers currently held by national authorities, officials said.
The idea is backed by the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the EU Parliament's resolutions, but many states oppose it.
National resistance to cede power on the matter is so strong that when the European Banking Authority in April recommended action against the Danish and Estonian supervisors for oversight failures in the Danske case, fellow regulators from other EU countries blocked the move..
In a meeting this week, EU governments' representatives discussed that case and told the EBA to ""improve its communication to avoid reputational risk for itself and for the EU banking system,"" the EU official said.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India plans to order taxi aggregators like Uber, Ola to go electric - documents","By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to order taxi aggregators like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Ola to convert 40% of their fleet of cars to electric by April 2026, according to a source and records of government meetings to discuss new rules for clean mobility.
Uber and Ola, both backed by Softbank Group, would need to start converting their fleet as early as next year to achieve 2.5% electrification by 2021, 5% by 2022, 10% by 2023 before hiking it to 40%, according to the person and the records reviewed by Reuters.
Some taxi players, like Ola, have previously attempted to operate electric cars in the country, but with little success given inadequate infrastructure and high costs. 
New Delhi, however, is looking to push the new policy to boost the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as it tries to bring down its oil imports and curb pollution so it can meet its commitment as part of the 2015 Paris climate change treaty.
Indian think-tank Niti Aayog, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and which plays a crucial role in policymaking, is working with several ministries on the EV policy. 
The recommendations will eventually become a formal policy, with or without changes, subject to approval by the federal government, the source said, adding the idea is to ""push electrification through public transport."" 
Neighboring China, home to the world's top auto market, is already leading the world in electrification by setting tough EV sales targets for car makers and offering incentives to taxi operators to increase their fleet of clean-fuel cars.
EV sales in India grew three-fold to 3,600 in the year ended March but still account for about 0.1% of the 3.3 million diesel and gasoline cars sold in the country over the period, industry data showed. China's electric car sales, meanwhile, rose 62% in 2018 to 1.3 million vehicles.
In a meeting in New Delhi on May 28, Niti Aayog officials and the ministries of road transport, power, renewable energy and steel, as well as the departments of heavy industries and trade, were among those recommending taxi operators in India gradually convert to electric.
They also recommended that all new cars sold for commercial use should only be electric from April 2026, a change that would also apply to Uber and Ola, said the person who has direct knowledge of the matter but spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Motorcycles and scooters sold for commercial purposes, like food delivery or for use by e-commerce companies, will also need to be electric from April 2023, the person added.
India has seen a boom in food delivery apps like Zomato and Swiggy, which counts Naspers and Tencent as investors. Sales by e-commerce firms like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart-owned Flipkart are also rising. 
The committee has also suggested a plan to gradually introduce electric buses within cities, with 5% of the fleet electric by 2023, rising to 30% by 2026. Thereafter all new city buses would need to be electric.
Companies like Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland manufacture buses for intracity travel in India. 
MOTORBIKES TOO
The EV proposal comes weeks after the inter-ministerial committee recommended electrifying most motorbikes and scooters for private use and all three-wheeled autorickshaws within the next six to eight years.
While there are several electric scooter manufacturers in the country including Ather Energy, Hero Electric and Okinawa, there are only two car makers that build and sell electric cars - Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors.
Some taxi operators have so far had little success operating electric cars in India. Ola launched a pilot project in the central Indian city of Nagpur in 2017 but a year later drivers, unhappy with long wait times at charging stations and high operating expenses, wanted to return to gasoline cars.
Ola, however, is not giving up yet. 
Its Ola Electric Mobility unit in March raised 4 billion rupees ($58 million) from investors including venture capital funds Tiger Global and Matrix Partners.
It also raised $300 million from Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors and formed a strategic partnership with the South Korean duo to help build India-specific EVs.
Modi's government in 2017 had set an ambitious target to electrify new cars and utility vehicles by 2030 but resistance from the industry forced it to scale back the plan.

961,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 10:14AM ET</span>",Ford to close engine plant in Wales in latest blow to UK car sector,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Ford said it would close its plant in Bridgend, south Wales next year because of falling demand for some of its engines, putting 1,700 jobs at risk in a further blow to Britain's once booming car industry.
Ford, which will take a roughly $650-million pre-tax charge to cover the cost of closing the plant, is making cuts in several countries to turn around loss-making operations in a stagnating European car market.
The U.S. automaker has also repeatedly warned the UK government that it needs free trade to be maintained with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc, but said Thursday's announcement ""has nothing to do with Brexit"".
Production of Ford's 1.5-litre petrol engine, which has seen lower demand, will end in February, whilst a contract to supply Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) finishes in September 2020. 
Britain's once thriving car sector, rebuilt since the 1980s mainly by foreign carmakers, has suffered slumps in sales, output and investment over the past two years.
""Changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead,"" said Ford Europe President Stuart Rowley.
The Bridgend plant, which opened in 1977, built around 20 percent of Britain's 2.7 million automotive engines last year.
Ford said it was committed to its other British engine factory in Dagenham, east London. The firm builds a total of 1.3 million engines in Britain which are exported for fitting in vehicles in Germany, Turkey, the United States and elsewhere.
Britain's biggest trade union vowed to fight the factory closure. 
""We will resist this closure with all our might, and call upon the governments at the Welsh Assembly and Westminster to join us to save this plant,"" said Len McCluskey, head of the Unite union. 
Ford said in January a turnaround of its European operations would involve cutting thousands of jobs, possible plant closures and discontinuing loss-making vehicle lines.
It is axing more than 5,000 jobs in Germany and more than 500 white-collar roles in Britain. 
Workers have long pushed for Bridgend to produce hybrid technology and electric vehicle components alongside a new third-party manufacturer to fill any surplus space but such investment has not been forthcoming. 
""Significant efforts to identify new opportunities have not been successful,"" said Ford. 
The Ford plant closure is the latest blow to the sector this year. JLR has said around 4,500 mainly British jobs would go and Honda has said up to 3,500 roles would be axed when it closes its British plant in 2021. 
A series of investment decisions are also pending as sales continue to slide, including whether Peugeot parent PSA will keep its Ellesmere Port plant open and if JLR will choose to make electric cars in Britain. 
British car sales are down 3.1 percent so far this year, after falling in 2017 and 2018. 
Ford is among many major carmakers which are opposed to a no-deal Brexit, fearing it could add tariffs and customs checks to their vehicles, engines and components, raising costs.

Thursday's announcement, a day after the U.S. President left Britain and as the governing Conservatives pick a new leader, comes as French politicians are scrambling to fend off blame for the collapse of a proposed merger of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler.

The S&P 500 inched up 2 points or 0.1% by 9:46 AM ET (13:46 GMT), while the Dow gained 38 points or 0.2% and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was down 5 points or 0.1%.
""We’ll see what happens ... I could go up another at least $300 billion and I’ll do that at the right time,” Reuters reported Trump as saying as he headed to France to observe the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War 2.
Separate meetings between the U.S. and Mexican officials over trade and immigration have also made little progress. A 5% tariff on all Mexican goods is set to kick in on Monday.
""It feels like an escalation of tension and may be an elongated trade war and we might have to recalibrate lower,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.
""We're up significantly in two days, at that place it doesn't take much to roll markets over.""
Wall Street had rallied for two days after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank could cut rates if low inflation and a weakening economy warranted it.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank pushed back the date for its first interest rate hike until the middle of next year at the earliest, while President Mario Draghi indicated that a number of his fellow policy-makers had already argued for a resumption of quantitative easing.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 4.1% on reports that the electric car maker was on track for record sales numbers in North America, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 0.6% and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 4% on a stock upgrade.
At Home Group (NYSE:HOME) slumped 43.2% after the home decor retailer missed earnings estimates and its guidance was below forecasts, due to adverse weather.
In commodities, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,338.85 a troy ounce, while crude inched up 0.3% to $51.81. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.2% to 97.088.

JPMorgan plans to fold the existing Finn accounts into its Chase mobile app and said credentials such as account numbers and passwords would remain the same.
The move comes at a time financial institutions across the United States have been looking to grow their consumer banking businesses by roping in younger customers though smartphone banking, aiming to cross-sell other financial products to them as their earnings increase.

“It seems like this very loose monetary policy is going to continue for the next couple of years and in that case we have to respond by acting on what we can really control,” Chief Financial Officer Jose Garcia Cantera said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “What we control is costs but it’s also responding to customer needs.”
The European Central Bank will decide on Thursday whether the euro zone needs more stimulus as its global peers move to shore up a recession-threatened global economy. Investors and economists are increasingly calling for action or for a signal that President Mario Draghi will deliver a last burst of monetary support before his term ends in October.
Cantera said that while Santander’s business would be affected by an economic slowdown triggered by a trade war, the global spread of the bank’s business mitigates the threat from an escalation in tensions. In Mexico, against whom U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to impose tariffs if it doesn’t curb illegal migration, Cantera said the Santander is positive about its long-term prospects.
“We are a bank so we are highly correlated with the economies where we operate, so to the extent that trade wars affect the economy we are going to be affected,” Cantera said. “However, we have a very well diversified portfolio of businesses, we operate in many different countries, and the economies, particularly in emerging markets are doing extremely well so we think the effect is going to be really minor at this stage.”
The lender’s plan to buy back the remaining stake in its Mexican unit it doesn’t already own is on track to be completed in September, Cantera said.

French representatives for Muddy Waters had no immediate comment on the report. Casino declined comment.
""Inquiries have been opened, looking at both the stock price movements and the release of financial information. Procedures are under way and the AMF will not comment on either the content, nor the state of progress, of these matters,"" an AMF spokeswoman said.
In 2015, Muddy Waters criticized Casino’s complex structure and accounting practices, saying it had high leverage and was managed for the short-term.
The AMF launched a probe into this criticism in early 2016 and a conclusion is expected this year.
Casino has consistently refuted Muddy Waters' accusations.
Casino parent Rallye was placed under protection from creditors last month.
Muddy Waters said this action was ""a resounding vindication of the warnings we sounded.""
Criticizing France as ""an unwelcoming place for investors who are also whistleblowers"", it added: ""We encourage the AMF to redirect its focus from skeptics and focus instead on their warnings.""
Casino has been grappling with large debts and a tough business environment, and has suffered credit ratings downgrades from Standard & Poor's and Moody's.
Casino is Rallye's main asset. Rallye is controlled by Fonciere Euris, Finatis and Euris, which are all in the hands of Casino chairman and CEO Jean-Charles Naouri.

Equity investments only account for 4% of the bank's investments at present, Xu Xueming, vice president of Postal Savings Bank of China, told a weekly briefing held by China's banking and insurance regulator.
The bank, which embraces the largest network of branches in China, was sitting on outstanding wealth management funds of 843.3 billion yuan by the end of May, the lender said. It also has 8 trillion yuan worth of savings due to its massive client base in rural areas.
Xu said no specific target for the investment increase has been set, but the lender will look into opportunities in pre-IPO deals, private equity investments, as well as direct investment into mainland's stock market.
""Banks have been investing in bonds for a long time, which is our advantage,"" Xu said. ""But now the stand-alone wealth management units will allow us to participate in the secondary market, and gradually, become a massive and stable funding source to help building China a healthy, dynamic and resilient capital market.""
The giant lender will also look into investing in funds that support emerging industries such as high-end manufacturers, 5G technology, and biotechnology firms, according to Xu.
Six major state-owned banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications, have all been approved by the regulator to establish such units.
The regulator unveiled in late 2018 long-awaited rules governing commercial banks' asset management subsidiaries, relaxing the investment criteria of wealth management funds for banks.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bahn is reviewing consultancy contracts granted to former managers without the knowledge of the state-owned railway operator's supervisory board, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The German company is auditing more than 20 contracts awarded to the former managers, the people said, declining to be identified because the matter was still under internal investigation.
In some cases, former managers were granted consultancy contracts after leaving the firm but did not do any work for Deutsche Bahn, the people said.
They said the value of the contracts ran into millions of euros but gave no specific figure.
Deutsche Bahn's supervisory board would hold a conference call to discuss the matter, they added.
Germany's Federal Audit Office confirmed it was aware of the case. ""We are in the process of conducting an audit related to the issue,"" a spokesman for the office said, declining to give more details.
Deutsche Bahn declined to comment when asked by Reuters.
The issue may add to pressure on Deutsche Bahn, which is facing public complaints about poor service and delays.

The company is also dealing with a debt mountain of 20 billion euros ($22.5 billion), while its financing deficit is expected to hit 5 billion euros by 2023.

968,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>",Germany to Explore Commerzbank-ING Deal With Netherlands,"(Bloomberg) -- The German government is probing the possibility of a tie-up between  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV as one option to forge a European financial heavyweight, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra and German Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Kukies discussed the matter earlier in May in Berlin, said the people who asked not to be named because the talks were private. Among the issues discussed was Berlin’s intent that any new bank be headquartered in Germany.
Commerzbank jumped 4% after Bloomberg published news of the talks. ING gained as much as 2%. Both banks declined to comment.
The German government owns about 15.5% in Commerzbank, making it the lender’s biggest shareholder by far. The German finance ministry declined to comment and a spokeswoman for the Dutch government wasn’t immediately able to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.
ING and UniCredit SpA have already shown interest in the lender, lining up advisers to explore a potential takeover.
Following the collapse of merger talks between  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz changed his message from supporting a national champion to backing a cross-border merger.
""We need large European banks operating in Germany,"" he said on April 30 in Erfurt, only days after the talks between Deutsche and Commerzbank failed.
While Germany is sounding out investor appetite for Commerzbank, it has ruled out a merger this year because it first wants to see improved European banking regulations and integration, according to a person with knowledge of the government’s strategy. There are no talks under way yet, only preliminary reconnaissance, the people said.
ING chairman Ralph Hamers was at the economic council linked to Angela Merkel’s ruling party this week, showcasing the bank’s ambitions and its digital platform, one of the weaknesses of some of Germany’s leading banks.
ING -- whose CEO has been buffeted by a money laundering scandal and disputes over his pay -- recently held its investor day in Frankfurt, further highlighting the country’s importance for the bank. It offered to relocate its headquarters to the German city from Amsterdam and pledged to cut fewer jobs than the Commerzbank-Deutsche Bank deal would have required, according to Manager Magazin.
UniCredit Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier has sought to downplay any interest in Commerzbank in recent weeks, saying in a Bloomberg Television interview that there are too many hurdles to European banking consolidation. At the same time, the bank has cleaned up its balance sheet and pledged to bring down its holdings of Italian sovereign debt, reducing risk and making itself more attractive as a potential acquirer.

The private equity firm took just over six months to secure the money for its ninth fund, named GPE IX. It raised $13 billion for its previous global investment vehicle in 2016.
The strong fundraising underscores how investors are brushing aside concerns over the private equity sector overheating, as they search for returns that beat the stock market by a wide margin.
Advent's fund will focus on business and financial services, healthcare, industrial, retail and consumer, and technology, media and telecommunications, areas where Advent has considerable ""experience and knowledge,"" the statement said.
In April, Blackstone (NYSE:BX), the world largest alternative asset manager, raised over $22 billion in its latest buyout fund, setting it on course to be the private equity industry's biggest ever.
In 2018, 1,175 private equity funds raised a combined $426 billion with the $18.5 billion Caryle Partners VIII fund being the largest. At the beginning of 2019 there were 3,750 private equity funds in market seeking a total of $977 billion, according to industry tracker Preqin.
Advent, founded in 1984, said its ninth global private equity fund saw significant demand from existing investors and over 90% of the fund's commitments came from limited partners in prior Advent funds.
The fund's recent global fund investments include Aimbridge Hospitality, BioDuro, Deutsche Fachpflege Gruppe, INNIO, Laird, Manjushree Technopack, Prisma Medios de Pago, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Brazil and Zentiva.

Russia and some other non-OPEC members along with OPEC countries plan to meet in June or July to discuss whether to extend or change the deal, under which Moscow has pledged to cut its oil production by 228,000 barrels per day (bpd). 
""I believe that the level of 228,000 bpd is a relatively small amount and we saw the effect we got,"" Alekperov said, referring to an increase in oil prices.
""So I will propose maintaining the deal and monitoring (global oil) inventories, excluding Iran."" 
He said the global oil industry, which produces around 100 million bpd, is still exploiting investments made before a sharp fall in oil prices several years ago, with no major oil discoveries globally in the recent past. 
Given falling production in Venezuela and restrictions on Iranian oil exports, the global oil industry should be very cautious and safeguard oil price stability, Alekperov said, including via the production pact. 
Alekperov said Lukoil plans to spend $2-3 billion on upstream purchases, mainly outside Russia. 

Lukoil's oil production, inside and outside Russia, is seen at around 85-86 million tonnes (1.71-1.73 million bpd) this year, he said.

""The performance in Q2 and Q1 of our investment bank was not dissimilar to the rest of the industry,"" Ermotti said, adding that the unit's new co-heads, appointed to lead the business after long-time boss Andrea Orcel quit the bank in September, were leading the business successfully.

""I think Rob Karofsky and Piero Novelli are doing a fantastic job,"" he said of the co-heads. ""People understand that [the recent performance] has nothing to do with management changes. It has to do with the environment.""

The Swiss fines come on top of 1.07 billion euros ($1.20 billion) of fines handed out last month by the European Union.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) were all punished by the Swiss authority, known as WEKO. It said it found ""several anti-competitive arrangements between banks in foreign exchange spot trading"".
Also punished was Japan's MUFG Bank for its part in the scam which involved traders coordinating their activities through internet chatrooms.
Traders from Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS participated in the so-called 'Three way banana split' cartel from 2007 to 2013, WEKO said. Participants in the 'Essex express' cartel which ran from 2009 to 2012 were traders from Barclays, MUFG Bank, RBS and UBS.
Barclays was fined 27 million francs, Citigroup 28.5 million francs, JPMorgan 9.5 million francs, MUFG Bank 1.5 million francs and RBS 22.5 million francs.
UBS was not punished because it revealed the cartels to the competition authorities first, while an investigation is still underway into  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). WEKO said it had closed its investigation into Julius Baer and Zuercher Kantonalbank.
""Credit Suisse is continuing to cooperate fully with WEKO's investigation process and intends to vigorously contest the substance of the allegations,"" a spokesman for the Swiss bank said.

JP Morgan, Barclays and RBS declined to comment, while Citi was not available for comment.

(Reuters) - European shares rose more than half a percent on Thursday, bolstered by expectations of stimulus from the European Central Bank and a rise for Fiat-Chrysler shares after the shock collapse of its merger with Renault-Nissan.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6% by 0816 GMT, with bank-heavy indexes in Milan and Madrid both up nearly 1% on the prospect the ECB will drive more cash into the economy through the financial sector. 
Gains, however, in defensive plays - including a more than 1% rise for utilities sector - underlined the fear of a slide into recession that lie behind the expectations of central bank action. 
In a well-flagged move, ECB President Mario Draghi is expected to offer to pay banks if they borrow cash from the central bank and pass it on to households and firms. Draghi's news conference is at 1230 GMT.
The bank may also set the stage for more action later this year as the trade tensions unravel the benefits of years of stimulus for a consistently-sluggish euro zone economy. 
Milan's banking index was up 0.8% while the Europe-wide financials index gained 0.2%.
""Current ECB growth forecasts look too high so markets will be interested in whether the growth forecasts are revised down in light of the ongoing trade concerns,"" said Michael Bell, global market strategist with JP Morgan.
""Markets also want to know whether the ECB will tier the deposit rate to reduce the impact of negative rates on bank earnings. I would expect they will keep that option open but probably won't announce tiering today.""
Shares of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) slumped about 7% after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles MV abandoned its $35 billion offer the French carmaker. Fiat, however, recouped early losses to trade up 0.5% and the auto sector, also under pressure earlier, gained 0.2%. 
The biggest decliner among the major subsectors was real estate stocks, down 1%. Shares of German property companies Vonovia and Deutsche Wohnen fell 2.1% and 5.1%, respectively, following reports that Berlin authorities were planning to impose a cap on rents.
The Copenhagen index rose almost 2% after Denmark's Liberal Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen conceded victory in the country's general election, paving the way for Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen to take power.

Frederiksen is in line to be Denmark's youngest prime minister and only the second woman to lead the country's government.

Investing.com - A successful, global car alliance cannot be run by French politicians and bureaucrats.
That seems to be the message that Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) has sent with the sudden withdrawal of its offer to merge with Groupe  Renault  (PA:RENA).
“It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully,” FCA said in a stinging press release, after the French government representatives on Renault’s board asked to delay a vote on accepting the merger terms.
The government delegates and a French labor representatives were the only board members opposed to the deal, according to the Financial Times. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire had already pushed the envelope by seeking more guarantees on keeping as much as possible of the company’s future activity in France, despite initially signalling its approval for the deal.
The Wall Street Journal reported people close to the U.S.-Italian company as seeking to “move the goalposts” and wanting the last word on everything.
The collapse of the talks leaves everyone worse off, but hits Renault worst. It’s down 7.0% as of 4.30 AM (0830 GMT), while FCA is up 0.6%.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 meanwhile, was up 0.6% at 376.30, on growing signs of support for markets from central banks (India’s cut interest rates earlier Thursday, while many expect the ECB to loosen its stance further later). The CAC 40 was up 0.7% and the FTSE MIB up 1.0%.
Not only has FCA called it out publicly for being stuck in a nationalist-dirigiste time warp, but it has done so after Renault’s management offended long-time alliance partner Nissan by not telling it about the FCA talks. (Nissan’s complaints about a breach of trust will meet with wry smiles in France after Japan’s treatment of Carlos Ghosn in the last few months.)
Le Maire told BFMTV Wednesday that it‘s worth taking time to get things right. He’s due in Japan for a G20 meeting at the weekend and will no doubt take the opportunity to press the case for Renault’s merger offer to Nissan that the Japanese rejected.
Sequencing is all: a formal combination of the French and Japanese companies would give them the whip hand in any subsequent talks with FCA. By contrast, Nissan would have lost bargaining power with its European partner, had the FCA-Renault merger gone ahead.
One thing is certain: the strategic rationale for combining has not gone away, as the costs of transitioning to an electric and autonomous car future are not getting any less (witness BMW’s announcement yesterday on cooperating with Jaguar Land Rover on electric engines and powertrains).
The talks will almost certainly be revived in one form or another. The issue for both companies in the meantime is how they can strengthen their own positions in the meantime, in a global market that is stuttering badly."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said on Thursday it plans to bring its satellite launch system to Japan in partnership with airline operator ANA Holdings Inc, which will provide maintenance and possibly aircraft.
Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne system is undergoing testing with the aim of launching rockets bearing small satellites into space from a modified jumbo jet. The company said it will conduct its first orbital test flight later this year. 
Branson's space ventures, however, have a history of delays, with his space tourism company Virgin Galactic running more than a decade behind the schedule originally promised by the British billionaire.
Virgin Orbit and ANA Holdings, parent of All Nippon Airways (ANA), in a joint statement said they will identify a launch site together with Space Port Japan, an industry-backed body which aims to turn Japan into a space business hub.
The space venture has already announced launch sites in the United States, Guam, Britain and Italy. 
Japan's space industry spans large scale government-backed rocket launches by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd - which launched the Michibiki satellite navigation system - to Interstellar Technologies, a startup backed by internet entrepreneur Takafumi Horie that last month launched its first rocket to reach space.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 01:22AM ET</span>","U.S. must have access to U.S.-listed Chinese firms' audit documents, lawmakers say","By David Alexander and Alun John
WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits or face delisting.
Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to allow overseas regulators to inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks - citing national security concerns.
In spite of a 2013 agreement that ended a stalemate over the issue and allowed U.S. regulators to request audit working papers in China, there have been difficulties in actually gaining access.
At least two Hong Kong-based audit firms have been barred from auditing U.S.-listed companies because they could not produce the papers U.S. regulators asked for.
""Beijing should no longer be allowed to shield U.S.-listed Chinese companies from complying with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement. 
Last year the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a warning to investors about the difficulties U.S. regulators faced in inspecting the audit work and practices of auditing firms in China that examine U.S.-listed Chinese companies. 
There are currently 156 U.S.-listed Chinese companies with a combined market capitalization of $1.2 trillion, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, and oil and gas giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec). 
Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, who joined in sponsoring the bill, said on Tuesday: ""It's time for China's government to play by the same rules as American companies in our financial markets.""
Paul Gillis, professor of practice at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, said in a blog post he thought the bill had a good chance of passing and start a three-year countdown for negotiations or for the companies to find another listing home.
""I expect most of them will move their listings to Hong Kong. Mainland exchanges are not ready for most of these companies,"" he said.
Many U.S.-listed Chinese firms have complex governance structures such as weighted voting rights (WVR) which are currently not allowed for firms listed on mainland exchanges.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd changed its rules last year to allow listings by companies with weighted voting rights, though its rules differ markedly from those in the U.S.
Alibaba is considering a second listing in Hong Kong, which could raise as much as $20 billion, Reuters reported last week.
Advisers and others close to the potential Alibaba deal downplayed any Sino-U.S. trade war reasoning for the move, but analysts at the time said the context and geography could not be ignored.

Eight Chinese companies have listed in the U.S. so far this year, raising $1.2 billion, according to Dealogic data.

The maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors, which has invested nearly $900 million in Russia since 1991, remains committed to the Russian market even though relations between Moscow and Washington have soured over Russia's annexation of Crimea and alleged U.S. election meddling.
""Russia was, is and will always be a key market,"" Sotirios Marinidis, P&G's head for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, told Reuters in an interview. ""We're here to stay, we're here to keep investing.""
The threat of tougher U.S. sanctions on Russia last year that could have hindered P&G's operations have not materialized. 
""At the moment, you have what I would call a relatively stable environment,"" Marinidis said. 
He said between 2016 and 2018, P&G invested 9 billion rubles to expand and modernize its two plants in Russia - one in St Petersburg and the other in Novomoskovsk, an industrial city some 200 km south of Moscow.
The latest investment will boost the capacity of P&G's Russian distribution center, modernize its Tide and baby care manufacturing and localize feminine care product production.
Marinidis said that the production of four out of five categories of P&G products was already localized in Russia - 
He said that the remaining product category, hair care, could also be localized in the future, without providing a possible timeline.
""It's not a race about how much (we can localize),"" he said. ""We need to look at a lot of things, including raw materials, sustainability, quality, cost.""
Last year, Marinidis had said that half of everything P&G sold in Russia was locally produced.
Russia is one of P&G's 10 focus markets, which are part of a new global restructuring. Others include the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom. 
These 10 markets account for 80% of P&G's sales and 90% of profit after taxes, the company said.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.7% and 0.8% by 10:26 PM ET (02:26 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed at 26,910.50.
The IMF said it expects China’s growth to slow to 6% next year, and to 5.5% by 2024 after Sino-U.S. trade negotiations took a turn for the worse last month.
U.S.-China tariffs, that have been both implemented and proposed, could cut global economic output by 0.5% in 2020 and would cause some $455 billion in gross domestic product to evaporate, the IMF warned.
“There are growing concerns over the impact of the current trade tensions. The risk is that the most recent U.S.-China tariffs could further reduce investment, productivity, and growth. The just proposed U.S. tariffs on Mexico are also of concern,” said Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director.
“Indeed, there is strong evidence that the United States, China, and the world economy are the losers from the current trade tensions,” she added.
The IMF lowered its 2019 growth forecast for the world’s second-largest economy to 6.2% from 6.3%.
Separately, the People’s Bank of China lent CNY 500 billion ($72.32 billion) to financial institutions via its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF), while keeping the interest rate unchanged, it said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' U.S. sales chief Reid Bigland sued the Italian-American automaker claiming the company opted to withhold 90% of his 2018 compensation because he has cooperated with a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, court documents filed on Wednesday show.
The SEC has been investigating the company's sales reporting practices before the company changed them in July 2016, the automaker has said. 
The suit said Bigland's candor with U.S. investigators and ""unwillingness to act as a scapegoat for defendants' 30-year practice which predated him"" resulted in the company retaliating ""less than two months later by withholding his compensation.""
Fiat Chrysler said in a statement Bigland's incentive pay was subject to a board committee determination and his ""eligibility for his award remains subject to that determination and completion of a board-level evaluation of issues that are the subject to governmental investigations.""
The company said it would be inappropriate to comment further.
Fiat Chrysler in July 2016 revised more than five years of monthly U.S. vehicle sales figures to reflect a new reporting method and disclosed that the U.S. Justice Department and SEC were investigating. 
The company had boasted of carving out year-over-year sales gains every month since April 2010, for a 75-month streak through June 2016. But it said that winning streak would have ended in 2013 under the revised reporting methodology.
The company said in its 2018 annual report it continued to cooperate but the investigations' ""outcome is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time."" In April, Fiat Chrysler settled a sales reporting lawsuit by an Illinois dealership group.
Bigland in January 2019 submitted a white paper to the SEC on Fiat Chrysler's monthly sales reporting method before July 2016 and gave a draft to Fiat Chrysler.
Bigland, who has been head of Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales since 2011 and also is head of the Ram brand and its Canada operations, said in his suit he ""did not invent or manipulate (Fiat Chrysler's) monthly sales reporting methodology"" and that the ""monthly sales reports had no appreciable impact on investors.""
His white paper said the methodology had been in place since the late 1980s and widely known throughout the company including by Sergio Marchionne, who was chief executive until his death in July 2018, and other executives.
Deborah Gordon, a lawyer for Bigland, said her client's performance at Fiat Chrysler ""has been outstanding"" and he remains on the job.
Bigland's suit also said Fiat Chrysler was angry that Bigland sold shares in the company. The suit said Fiat Chrysler has refused to award him shares in May and special dividends on those shares would amount to $1.8 million.

Bigland's suit was filed in late May in a state court in Michigan and moved by Fiat Chrysler to U.S. District Court in Detroit on Wednesday.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 09:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Scottish guarantee of metals tycoon’s plant worth half a billion pounds,"By Tom Bergin
FORT WILLIAM, Scotland (Reuters) - A Scottish government guarantee related to a loss-making aluminum plant owned by commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta is worth more than half a billion pounds, nearly twice the amount previously known, according to people familiar with the matter.
While Scotland disclosed the existence of the guarantee in 2016, neither the government nor Gupta’s GFG Alliance has made public its full value of about 575 million pounds. Ratings agency Moody’s had publicly said it assessed 295 million pounds worth of bonds underpinned by the guarantee, without specifying whether that was the full amount or part of it.
The Scottish government – which has publicly said it provided the guarantee to safeguard jobs at Britain's last-remaining aluminum smelter -- has also told the company it could provide additional support worth hundreds of millions of pounds subject to further investment, the people familiar with the matter say. The smelter employs about 100 people, according to GFG Alliance.
The size of the guarantee and the promise of additional support indicate that the risk to taxpayers, who are on the hook if Gupta’s GFG Alliance doesn’t repay the debt underpinned by the guarantee, is greater than previously known.
The Scottish government said it carried out appropriate due diligence with the help of accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP. The government declined to comment on the size of the guarantee or the possibility of further support, citing commercial confidentiality. UK government bodies are not required to publish information on the size of contingent liabilities such as guarantees, although some do.
It added that it has “obtained appropriate protections in support of the guarantee” and that the deal was approved by Scotland’s cross-party finance committee.
Ernst & Young declined to comment.
When asked about the size of the guarantee during a February interview, Gupta said the Reuters figure “sounds about right.”
An Indian-born British national, Gupta is executive chairman of GFG Alliance, which manages the industrial, finance and metals investments of the Gupta family. “All debt has been and is being serviced,” GFG said of the bonds the guarantee underpins. It declined further comment.
“WEATHERING THE STORM”
Margaret Hodge, a British lawmaker and former head of the UK parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, when presented with Reuters’ findings said taxpayers didn’t appear to be getting good value for money because they were taking on a large financial risk to protect a modest number of jobs.
Providing a guarantee of that size to protect so few jobs “is bonkers,” said Hodge, a UK lawmaker for the Labour Party. “There should be a really rigorous evaluation of the current liability and whether it makes any sense to incur any future liabilities.” In Scotland, Labour is a rival to the governing Scottish Nationalist Party.
The guarantee relates to payments from the aluminum smelter - located in the West Highlands town of Fort William - to an adjacent hydro power plant that supplies its electricity, both purchased by GFG in 2016. The government guaranteed 80 percent of the value of a 25-year power supply contract between the power plant and the smelter.
Gupta used the government-backed income stream to borrow money from investors via a bond sale. Bond holders are due to receive the roughly 575 million pounds by 2042, according people familiar with the matter and public filings. Annual repayments to bondholders are currently about 15 million pounds and are due to double over the next decade, the people familiar with the matter said.
The smelter has been loss-making, but when combined with the
adjacent power plant the joint operations are profitable – generating at least a few million pounds annually according to the most recent public accounts available.
GFG has said it plans to boost profitability at the aluminum smelter by building an alloy wheels plant.
“It’s weathering the storm until where the wheels plant is generating revenue,” said general manager Kerry McDonald at the site one morning in March.
SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES
The government said any payments related to these bonds in the event of default would come from its Westminster-funded capital budget, which is used to build schools and hospitals. It said the risk to taxpayers was mitigated because GFG had pledged the smelter and adjacent power operation as security.
GFG purchased those two facilities along with another Scottish power plant from metals group  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) for 330 million pounds – far less than the amount guaranteed by the government.
The government said it also has commitments from GFG companies that would enable it to seek repayment if Edinburgh did need to step in to pay bond holders.
However, GFG’s two main operating units --- Singapore-registered commodity trader Liberty House Group PTE Ltd and Hong-Kong registered power generator Simec Group Ltd. – have significant other liabilities.
The units have a combined debt of about seven times their operating profit, including guarantees, according to Reuters analysis of publicly available accounts for the companies and their subsidiaries.

According to published guidelines from ratings agency Moody’s, this level of indebtedness is commensurate with a “high credit risk” rating, which means there is an above average risk of loss for bond holders.

992,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 08:30PM ET</span>",Trump Plays Good Cop on Huawei After Pompeo's Threats,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump adopted a conciliatory tone this week toward Europe’s approach to Huawei Technologies Co., the Chinese telecom giant the U.S. has demanded its allies abandon over security concerns.
The Trump administration has engaged in a combative global campaign for months to keep Huawei products out of future 5G broadband networks, including threats to curb intelligence-sharing with allies if they don’t comply. The U.S. alleges that China could use Huawei equipment for spying, a charge the company’s executives have repeatedly denied.
Trump had the opportunity during meetings with leaders of the U.K. and Ireland this week to badger them about Huawei and amplify his administration’s threats. He’s instead taken a more cooperative approach.
“We deal very closely with -- as you know -- with your intelligence and your security and we’re working on that together. And I know you’re concerned like we’re concerned, we’re all concerned about it,” Trump told Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Wednesday at Shannon Airport. “We’re working on it together very much with not only Europe but with Ireland.”
After a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May a day earlier, he dismissed the idea of cutting Britain off from U.S. intelligence-gathering.
‘No Limitations’
“We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences,” Trump said in a joint news conference with May. “I see absolutely no limitations. We’ve never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner, and we’ll have no problem with that.”
Asked directly whether he was prepared to curb information sharing if Britain placed no restrictions on Huawei, Trump answered: “no.”
“Because we’re going to have, absolutely, an agreement on Hauwei and everything else,” he added.
Trump is expected to meet with French President Emanuel Macron on Thursday.
‘Bad Cop’ Pompeo
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who joined Trump in the U.K., has essentially played “bad cop” in Europe. Prior to Trump’s trip, Pompeo said during a visit to Germany that the U.S. may have to change its “behavior” regarding intelligence sharing.
It echoed a warning Pompeo made in April to NATO allies.
“We’ve made clear that if the risk exceeds the threshold for the United States, we simply won’t be able to share that information any longer,” he told reporters after meeting with counterparts from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Washington.
May’s spokeswoman told reporters earlier Tuesday that the government is still reviewing its policy on Huawei and will make a decision based on “hard-headed technical assessments.”
Trump has been less understanding toward China and Huawei itself. His administration is seeking to choke off company’s access to vital U.S. components, requiring its American vendors to seek U.S. government permission to do business with the company.
The issue has become entangled in Trump’s trade war with China, particularly after the U.S. president suggested the company’s fate could be addressed in a deal to resolve economic disputes.
China has recently taken recent punitive actions toward U.S. companies including FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. that analysts have regarded as retribution for Trump’s trade policy and his administration’s moves against Huawei.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 08:23PM ET</span>","Singapore Exchange to boost derivatives, target Southeast Asia unicorns","By Anshuman Daga and Joe Brock
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) aims to add products to its lucrative derivatives business and offer Southeast Asian unicorns a platform to list shares and bonds, in a multi-asset strategy aimed at sustaining growth, its chief executive said.
""There's always the focus around IPOs and associated capital markets but today, participants on our exchange look beyond just the stock market,"" said Loh Boon Chye in an interview.
""They think about us as a derivatives, foreign exchange, commodities and freight market and also increasingly a fixed income market,"" Loh told Reuters.
SGX's multi-asset strategy comes as the bourse is overshadowed by Chinese-led multi-billion-dollar fundraising at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) while bourses such as Thailand emerge as strong rivals.
Average daily securities turnover at SGX was $791 million in May while the figure was $1.8 billion for the Thai exchange, and $12.4 billion for HKEX, data from Refinitiv shows.
SGX has seen trading volume drop after a penny stocks crash in 2013 battered investor confidence, while weak valuations have led to a spate of delistings.
""IPO is not a destination, it's only a process. Our secondary fundraising typically is three to four times of the IPO market,"" said Loh.
Bond listings are also a key part of SGX's offerings, said Loh, a veteran banker who joined SGX four years ago.
SGX's revenue from the trading of equities, commodities and foreign exchange derivatives jumped 30% in June-March, making up 50% of the total. Revenue from its equities and fixed income segment fell 16% and accounted for 39%.
Growing demand from international investors to hedge exposure to iron ore, coal, Indian stocks and other asset classes pushed SGX's revenue to a record-high last year.
""We will be looking to launch single stock futures. We have that on India and will look to launch more, not just on our Singapore market but we can launch it on other equity markets,"" said Loh, 55, a former SGX director.
In recent years, SGX has improved its market liquidity, strengthened its regulatory framework and introduced a dual-class share system with an eye on potential IPOs from Southeast Asian startups with billion-dollar valuations such as ride-hailing firms Grab and Go-Jek and e-commerce company Tokopedia.
Even so, analysts said the exchange will have difficulty replicating in other sectors its success as a global venue for business trusts and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
Refinitiv data showed the $3 billion 2010 IPO of warehouse provider GLP was the last primary issue to raise over $500 million on SGX, excluding those of business trusts or REITS. GLP was taken private in 2018 at double its valuation.

Loh also said HKEX's plan to launch Chinese A-share futures contracts, rivalling SGX's FTSE China A50 contracts, should not be a threat for SGX and would help expand the market.

That’s the result from a survey of investors at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s U.S. Macro Quantitative and Derivatives Conference in New York on May 17, with 36% of respondents picking a liquidity plunge and 25% fearing political or geopolitical risks most, according to the conference summary from strategists Marko Kolanovic and Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.
About 59% of those answering saw the 10-year Treasury yield between 2.0%-2.5% at year-end, while 39% expected the S&P 500 between 2,800 and 3,000. A full 23% expect the next recession after 2021, though 33% see it in 2020 and 37% in 2021.
In terms of which quantitative approach has the best outlook, 27% of respondents said it was Equity Multi-Factors, with 22% choosing Statistical Arbitrage/High-Frequency, according to the survey of conference attendees that garnered between 150 and 270 responses per question.
“People remain quite positive on the outlook for quant investing,” Lakos-Bujas said in an interview May 30.
There were other discussions in addition to the survey, including a study showing that market-maker profitability may predict the subsequent month’s liquidity and volatility, as well as the trend lower in liquidity overall in recent years.
“People know this is happening,” Kolanovic said in an interview about the decline in liquidity. “It’s not just a theory.”

Meanwhile, about 80% of attendees responding to questions about volatility targeting said they do employ that method. And when surveyed about signals based on alternative data and machine learning that participants had researched, 59% of the conference’s respondents said none were actually yielding alpha, or excess returns. And 31% said between one and three did.
“It’s not easy to identify sources of alpha, but it’s the future,” Lakos-Bujas said.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 07:18PM ET</span>","U.S. cruise operators stop sailing to Cuba, travelers vent anger online","(Reuters) - Major U.S. cruise operators said on Wednesday they will no longer sail to Cuba following the Trump administration's ban on travel to the Caribbean island, angering travelers and prompting worries about trip cancellations and company earnings.
The new restrictions are aimed at pressuring Cuba's Communist government to reform and stop supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
""Due to changes in U.S. policy, the company will no longer be permitted to sail to Cuba effective immediately,"" Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp said.
A spokesman for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd said the company had ceased all calls to Cuba and was modifying previously scheduled sailings.
The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday the country would no longer permit visits to Cuba via passenger and recreational vessels, including cruise ships and yachts, as well as private and corporate aircraft.
American Airlines Group Inc, JetBlue Airways Corp and United Airlines, which started flying to Cuba in 2016, said they were reviewing the revised regulations.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said it had stopped accepting bookings to Cuba under the so-called people-to-people license as of midnight on June 4. Customers who booked under the exemption before that time will be allowed to travel. 
""The reduction in the number of travelers will probably mean the end of U.S. commercial air flights from places outside Florida because there won't be sufficient demand to fill regular flights,"" said William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert and a professor of government at American University.
The ban was effective as of Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department told Reuters, giving cruise lines no grace period to change destinations and sowing confusion among cruise passengers.
Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean said they would stop at different non-Cuban ports and would offer compensation to travelers.
Carnival said the guests currently aboard its Carnival Sensation cruise that set sail on June 3 would now stop in Mexican island Cozumel on Thursday instead of Havana. The company said the guests would receive a $100 onboard credit for the inconvenience.
""We are working as quickly as possible to secure alternative itineraries for the remainder of our Cuba voyages and expect to have information for sailings further out in the next 2-3 days,"" Carnival said. It has three cruise lines that sail to Cuba. 
Royal Caribbean said all cruises on the 'Majesty of the Seas' and 'Empress of the Seas' this year will have alternative ports in the Caribbean. It is also working on alternate itineraries for 2020 sailings.
Guests can cancel their current booking for a full refund, or can keep their sailing date with a new itinerary and receive a 50% refund, Royal Caribbean said.
On Tuesday, Royal Caribbean said its ships sailing Wednesday and Thursday would no longer stop in Cuba.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) took to Twitter to vent their anger and frustration over the forced changes in their vacation plans.
""Has anyone's cruise to Cuba from @CruiseNorwegian been rerouted yet? If so where did they change the port of call to? Im (sic) booked for July and PISSED! Thanks Trump!"" tweeted Sabrina Carollo @superbri_22.
Susan Berland, a parenting coach from Huntersville, North Carolina, said she was enraged that a vacation designed around visiting Cuba had been upended by the Trump administration.
""To say I'm angry is an understatement. This whoe (sic) cruise was chosen around going to Cuba and now we can't,"" tweeted @SusanBerland.
Neither responded to requests for further comment.
Cuba accounts for a small percent of sailings at about 4% for Norwegian Cruise, about 3% for Royal Caribbean, and about a percent for Carnival, Wolfe Research analyst Jared Shojaian wrote in a note.
Shojaian said that while cruise lines can easily swap a Cuban port for another non-Cuban port, guests may have purchased the itinerary entirely for Cuba.
""That means cruise lines may need to issue refunds or future cruise credits to compensate guests, which makes forecasting the earnings impact to 2019 even harder, and potentially more of a headwind,"" he said.

Shares of Norwegian Cruise closed down 3.5%, while Royal Caribbean and Carnival ended about 3% lower.

Frazis's departure from Australia's second biggest lender was announced in March as a part of a wider shake up. Frazis spent 10 years at Westpac and also held the role of chief executive of its operations in New Zealand.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 06:42PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pentagon eyes rare earth supplies in Africa in push away from China,"By Ernest Scheyder and Zandi Shabalala
CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense has held talks with Malawi's Mkango Resources Ltd and other rare earth miners across the globe about their supplies of strategic minerals, part of a plan to find diversified reserves outside of China, a department official said on Wednesday.
The push comes as China threatens to curb exports to the United States of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals used in a plethora of military equipment and high-tech consumer electronics. 
Although China contains only a third of the world's rare earth reserves, it accounts for 80% of U.S. imports of minerals because it controls nearly all of the facilities to process the material, according to U.S. Geological Survey data.
""We are looking for any source of supply outside China. We want diversity. We don't want a single-source producer,"" Jason Nie, a material engineer with the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency, said on the sidelines of the Argus U.S. Specialty Metals conference in Chicago.
The DLA, which buys, stores and ships much of the Pentagon's supplies - ranging from minerals to airplane parts to zippers for uniforms - has also held talks with Burundi's Rainbow Rare Earths Ltd about future supply, as well as offered to introduce the several U.S. rare earth projects under development with potential financiers, Nie said.
""We can make connections,"" he said.
The DLA routinely talks with potential suppliers as part of its due diligence, steps that do not necessarily result in purchase agreements. Still, the inquiries show that the Pentagon is increasingly focused on diversifying supplies of critical minerals. 
As of September 2016, the most recent operational report, the DLA held stocks of many critical minerals worth $1.15 billion.
For the current 2019 fiscal year, the DLA expects to buy rare earths on the open market (up to a maximum 416 tonnes), lithium ion battery precursors (0.02 tonnes) and tin (40 tonnes), among other strategic minerals, according to a government report.
Some of the equipment the Pentagon buys, including night-vision goggles and aircraft, are made using rare earth minerals. The Pentagon has long supported efforts to require military contractors to buy domestically sourced minerals, though there are no current U.S. rare-earth processing facilities.
China, as part of the escalating trade conflict with the United States, implied through its state-controlled media last month that it could restrict rare earth sales to the world's largest economy. Such a step would have precedence, as China in 2010 culled exports of rare earths to Japan after a diplomatic dispute.
""If you put yourself in China's shoes, this is their main weapon in the trade war,"" said Mark Seddon, an Argus metals analyst.
Mkango Resources is developing a rare earths mine and processing facility in Malawi that is still several years from coming online. Rainbow Rare Earths began operating in Burundi in 2017 and has an offtake agreement with ThyssenKrupp AG.
China dominates global processing capacity for rare earths, with Australia's Lynas Corp the only non-Chinese company with any significant capacity.
""It is not a good idea to be reliant on a single major source of any material,"" Amanda Lacaze, chief executive of Lynas, told Reuters on the sideline of the conference. Lynas last month signed a memorandum of understanding to build a rare-earth processing facility in Texas with privately held Blue  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN).
Texas Mineral Resources Corp is pushing to develop the Round Top rare earth deposit in a remote corner of the state's western edge, and Rare Element Resources Ltd is moving forward on a Wyoming project.
But those projects will take several years to come online, reflecting the reality that efforts to build rare earth processing plants in the United States are still in the early stages.
Privately held MP Materials, which owns the Mountain Pass mine in California, aims to open a processing facility by next year.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday recommended urgent steps to boost domestic rare earth production.

The report includes 61 specific recommendations - including low-interest loans and a buy American provision for defense companies - to increase U.S. rare earths supply. It also called for closer cooperation with U.S. allies, which dovetails with DLA's outreach to miners in Africa and elsewhere.

999,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 06:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo board weighs keeping interim CEO in place - sources,"By Imani Moise and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co board members are considering keeping interim Chief Executive Allen Parker in the job permanently even after saying they would seek an outsider to fill the role, according to two sources familiar with the board's thinking.
Parker, 64, was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly, saying pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.
Critics like U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, had argued Sloan's 30-year tenure made him incapable of changing an internal culture that fueled a string of customer abuses. 
Sloan was the second Wells Fargo CEO to depart following revelations in 2016 that employees had opened potentially millions of fake customers accounts. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has paid billions of dollars in fines and is still being investigated by various federal agencies. 
The board had set a goal of hiring an outsider, with Chair Betsy Duke saying the position should attract the top talent in banking. Reuters reported in April the bank had hired search firm Spencer Stuart and was focused on finding female candidates.
But the external search has been complicated by concerns Wells Fargo could not pay the big dollars necessary to lure talent from competing banks. The board's pick would also be subject to an unusual vetting by U.S. regulators.
Board members started warming up to the idea of keeping Parker after he made a good impression on stakeholders including regulators, investors and employees. 
“He’s obviously exceeded expectations and that’s a credit to him,” said Steven Potter, CEO of executive recruiting firm Odgers Berndtson U.S. 
Sources familiar with the board's thinking said Parker has not been tainted by the scandal since he joined in 2017, the year after customer abuses first emerged. One of the sources said Parker's two years at the bank have given him enough understanding of lingering problems to fix them quickly. 
It could take months for the search committee to come to a final decision about who is the best person to lead the San Francisco-based bank. Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting would then need to privately review and sign off on that pick.
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Representatives from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank's primary regulators, declined to comment.
Parker joined Wells Fargo as general counsel from law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he was partner in charge of managing the firms operations. 
Through his work at the firm defending high-profile clients like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, he also developed relationships in Washington that will be helpful while navigating Wells Fargo's regulatory problems.
At Wells Fargo, he has been focused on cleaning up existing issues and preventing them from spreading. 
Parker spent his first two months as interim CEO meeting with regulators in Washington, employees in Charlotte, North Carolina, and investors in New York City.
He has said his priorities as interim CEO are to improve customer service, satisfy regulatory requirements and continue making operations more efficient.
At an investor conference last week, Parker said the bank had entered a new stage of understanding with regulators and that, based on his meetings, the relationships were more constructive than before. 
""We are probably a little bit more attentive now to everything they're saying,"" he told investors. ""And frankly, in some cases, they've been speaking with greater clarity.""
Still, with Parker at the helm the bank could face even more pressure from lawmakers who wanted to see an outsider, industry analysts said. Turning inside to find a successor could also make some investors feel the board was unable to find a desirable candidate interested in the job.

Since Parker became CEO, Wells Fargo created a new unit charged with working through the 14 regulatory consent orders the bank is operating under and expanded its board to include a director who has experience managing a bank.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 05:28PM ET</span>","Boeing's 777X faces engine snags, questions rise over delivery goal","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's effort to build the world's largest twin-engined jet, the 777X, continues to be hampered by challenges with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's new GE9X turbine engine, a top Boeing executive said on Wednesday.
Boeing is facing testing glitches on the GE9X after assembly delays on the engine and the plane's carbon-composite wings. These issues, coupled with the crisis over its 737 MAX in the wake of deadly crashes, leaves the world's largest planemaker less leeway to deliver on its official 2020 target for entry into service, industry sources say.
Dubai's Emirates has said it expects to fly its first 777X in June 2020, a date now widely seen in doubt.
Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told a conference that 2020 entry into service was ""still the current assumption,"" echoing comments from Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg last week.
""(The) long pole in the tent right now is the GE engine,"" Smith said. ""There's some challenges they are working through there on testing. So we are having to do some re-testing, and they're working their way through that.""
The market for widebody jets has been fragile due to oversupply and fears over the economy and trade disputes. Reuters reported in March that a major potential deal for more than 100 Boeing jetliners of various types with China was in doubt in the wake of the trade dispute and the MAX crisis.
The first two 777X flight test aircraft have left Boeing's Seattle-area factory and are in integrated system testing on the ground, while the next two flight test airplanes are in final assembly, Muilenburg said.
But the engine snags and other issues have diminished the prospect of a maiden flight in late June, despite a prediction over the weekend by the head of Gulf airline Emirates for a ‪June 26 flight.
One airline source familiar with the program said the flight test schedule had originally been set at 14 months, but heightened scrutiny over aircraft certification after two 737 MAX crashes in October and March means that schedule is unlikely to be accelerated.
That means the 777X is more likely to be handed over to airlines toward the end of 2020, and that date could slip into 2021, airline sources said at an industry gathering in Seoul this week.
GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
GE began flight trials of the turbine engine, the world's largest, in March after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor.

1004,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 05:08PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - The market is at the point where bad news is actually good news.
Stocks rallied today following a pretty dismal ADP report on private payrolls.
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) said its measure of nonfarm payrolls rose by just 27,000 in May, well shy of the 180,000 economists were predicting. And that was music to investors’ ears as tepid jobs numbers may give the Federal Reserve just the excuse it needs to cut rates.
The market is now pricing in more than a 50% chance rates will be lower after the FOMC’s meeting in July, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Tomorrow there will be the weekly jobless claims figures as the market moves toward Friday’s big May employment report.
An unexpected jump in jobless claims could further bolster the case for a rate cut and give bulls another reason to keep buying.
Here are the three things that could rock the market tomorrow.
1. ECB's Draghi to Turn up Dovish Rhetoric?
With the European Central Bank widely expected to keep interest rates on hold at Thursday's meeting, investor attention will likely hone in on ECB President Mario Draghi's presser.
The central bank chief is expected to adopt dovish language and likely push guidance on rates further out until next year, or, in a more dovish move, the bank's tightening bias could be axed.
Investors will also be keen for an update on the new targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) program, while projections about growth and inflation will also garner attention.
2. Initial Jobless Claims Expected to Remain Unchanged, Trade Balance to Widen
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended June 1. Economists forecast that initial jobless claims remained unchanged at 215,000.
With the U.S. at risk of entering a trade war on multiple fronts, trade data will likely be closely watched.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will issue the April trade balance numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the trade deficit for January widened to $50.50 billion.
3. Zoom Video Set to Deliver Maiden Quarterly Results
Video conferencing software company  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) is to release its first set of results as a public company on Thursday after the markets close.
The company is expected to post earnings of 1 cent a share on revenue of $111.7 million, according to Briefing.com.
The company went public in April, surging to a high of $91 before paring gains, with many analysts suggesting that optimism concerning the future prospects of the company had been baked into the rally.
JPMorgan said that while the stock appeared expensive, the technology ""will help fundamentally change the way that business is conducted going forward.""
Zoom, unlike some recent IPOs hitting the market including Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), is a profitable company. The company reported $7.58 million in net income last year on revenue of $330.5 million.
Analysts have touted Zoom as a potential leader in video conferencing over rivals like LogMeIn.
Zoom closed at $78.04, down 0.89%, but remains well above its IPO price of $36."

LONDON (Reuters) - Meg Whitman, the former boss of Hewlett-Packard, said she was happy to throw her predecessor Leo Apotheker ""under the bus"" in a moment of anger over the botched acquisition of British software company Autonomy, London's High Court heard on Wednesday.
The U.S. executive was giving testimony in the $5 billion trial of Mike Lynch, whom HP accuses, along with his former colleague Sushovan Hussain, of inflating the value of the big data firm before selling it to HP in 2011 for $11.1 billion.
Lynch has denied the allegations and said the failure of the acquisition was down to HP's mismanagement and neglect of the company during Whitman's tenure.
Apotheker, the architect of the deal, was fired by HP's board just weeks after it was announced as part of a huge shake-up which also included the possible sale of its PC business.
Whitman, a non-executive director on the board, said she had to be persuaded to take the job of CEO. 
Little over a year later, after sacking Lynch, Whitman had written down the value of the acquisition by $8.8 billion.
She said in an email dated Dec 14 2012 to HP's chief communications officer Henry Gomez: ""Happy to throw Leo under the bus in a tit for tat"" after Apotheker had said the HP board should share the blame for the failed deal.
Asked by Lynch's counsel Robert Miles whether she was just protecting herself, Whitman said that was ""absolutely not the case"". ""It was a moment of disappointment and anger,"" she said. ""I shouldn't have said it.""
Miles said that was exactly what she did to Lynch, a charge she denied.
A spokesman for Apotheker said: ""HP's acquisition of Autonomy had the full support of the HP board of directors, who endorsed it unanimously on the basis of thorough due diligence.
""The fact that every member of the board stood behind the transaction at the time it was announced is clear from the proceedings in the high court.""
FELT AWFUL
In sometimes testy exchanges, Miles questioned Whitman on the synergy value HP believed it could generate by combining Autonomy's technology with its existing assets - a number that in large part justified the deal premium - and on whether Autonomy fitted into her own strategy for HP.
Whitman, a technology leader who grew eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) into an $8 billion revenue company, said Apotheker and CTO Shane Robison led the push to buy Autonomy but the board had approved it, and they later ""felt awful"" about it.
The deal was announced on 18 August 2011 as part of a huge shift that included exiting its tablet business, exploring the sale of its PC unit and disappointing quarterly results.
""There was a fair amount of investor push back after Autonomy was announced,"" Whitman said.
She told the court that her priority was stabilising the core business - which was in a more precarious state than she had feared - and reassuring customers and investors that the company was not going to ditch hardware completely.
But she denied that Autonomy was neglected. ""We really wanted Autonomy to be successful,"" she said. ""We were committed to Autonomy but we had to stabilise the core assets.""
She said Lynch, who reported directly to her, received more of her attention in fixing problems than almost anyone else.
However, in her witness statement, she said Lynch had failed to tell her that Autonomy was on track to miss quarterly revenue targets and his management style hampered rather than helped Autonomy's integration.
She said she was not surprised Lynch recalled a telephone call in which she told him and other Autonomy leaders that ""the fun is over and it's time for Autonomy to grow up"".
Her point, she said in the statement, was Autonomy needed to be managed as part of a much larger organisation and not as a start-up.

Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

1006,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 04:54PM ET</span>",Stocks - Techs Rise and Rate-Cut Hopes Boost Market ,"Investing.com – Stocks rallied for a second day in a row, pushed higher by gains in big tech stocks and continued hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.
The gains were handsome, although not as dramatic as Tuesday when the market soared in its biggest rally since Jan. 4. The S&P 500 moved up 0.82%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.82%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.64%.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) led tech stocks higher and contributed 48 points to the Dow's 207-point gain. A late-buying surge helped Boeing (NYSE:BA) add 28 points to the index.
The S&P 500 was helped by a 5% gain in shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which reported better-than-expected earnings and boosted guidance for the year.  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) jumped 10% after earnings beat estimates.
When and if the Fed will make a move on interest rates is open to question. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell promised in a Tuesday speech in Chicago that the Fed would do all it can to keep the economy growing if trade disputes become serious. But Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool projects an 72% chance the central bank will leave rates alone at its June 18-19 meeting.
Some traders believed the chances for a cut improved after the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) employment report was weaker than expected. The U.S. Labor Department will report on job growth and unemployment on Friday.
The market's gains were limited slightly by weakness in energy stocks after oil prices tumbled. WTI fell 3.4% to $51.68 a barrel and Brent, the global benchmark, dropped 2.2% to $60.63 after briefly falling below $60 a barrel for the first time since late January. Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) fell 6%.
On the other hand, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rose 4.3% in large part because oil prices were lower. Going into Wednesday, the shares had been down 9.3%. Fuel is typically an airline's largest expense.
But there was hope that the Trump administration would delay imposing new tariffs on goods shipped into the United States from Mexico. President Donald Trump said he believed Mexico wants to agree to a deal cracking down on illegal immigration.
With Wednesday's gains, the S&P 500 is up 2.69% in the first three days of trading in June, with the Dow up 2.92% and the Nasdaq 1.64%. The indexes fell by similar amounts in the first week of trading in May. The S&P is up 12.7% for the year, with the Nasdaq up 14.2%.
At the same time, the S&P 500 is down 4.33% from its peak in April. The Nasdaq is down 7.35% from its April peak.
The Dow is still 5.24% below its all-time high reached on Oct. 3.
S&P 500 Winners and losers
Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and alcohol-beverage conglomerate Brown Forman (NYSE:BFa) were among the top S&P 500 gainers on the day.
Range Resources (NYSE:RRC),  Cimarex Energy  (NYSE:XEC) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were among the worst performers among S&P 500 stocks."
1007,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 04:51PM ET</span>",Bernie Sanders urges Walmart to boost 'starvation wages',"By Nandita Bose
ROGERS, Ark. (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Wednesday told Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc shareholders and top executives that the world's largest retailer should boost the ""starvation""-level wages it pays its workers and stop fueling income inequality.
""Despite the incredible wealth of Walmart's owners"" the company pays ""starvation wages,"" Sanders said at Walmart's shareholder meeting.
He presented a shareholder proposal asking the company to give hourly employees a seat on its board and raise base wages to $15 an hour. 
Walmart's ""wages are so low, many of these employees are forced to rely on government programs like food stamps, Medicaid and public housing in order to survive,"" Sanders said.
""The American people are so tired of subsidizing the greed of some of the largest corporations in the United States,"" he added.
Sanders' remarks at the meeting drew attention to his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and the drive for higher hourly U.S. wages, one of his signature issues.
The proposal, filed by Walmart worker Carolyn Davis, was buried at the end of the annual proxy filing. It did not pass since a majority of shares are owned by the family of the founder, the late Sam Walton, and the retailer had asked shareholders to vote against it.
Sanders also complained that ""Walmart's CEO is making a thousand times more than the average Walmart employee.""
Walmart's CEO received a $23.6 million pay package last year. The ratio compared with that of the median employee was 1,076 to 1. 
With his frequent attacks on Walmart, and other major employers, Sanders has been trying to distinguish himself from former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination, who also is making a pitch to working-class Americans.
His presence on Wednesday could give Sanders a boost when the two dozen Democratic contenders begin to compete for endorsements from the nation’s biggest labor unions. 
Protesters gathered outside the meeting, many from the labor group ""United for Respect"" which has pushed for a worker presence on Walmart’s board. They held signs supporting the Sanders 2020 Presidential campaign and calling for a $15 per hour U.S. minimum wage.
Walmart has raised its minimum wage twice since 2016 to $11 an hour, still lower than the $15 an hour that rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pays employees. Retailers  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) also pay higher rates than Walmart.
Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said Walmart has raised wages in the United States by 50 percent in the past four years and continues to increase wages on a market-by-market basis to hire and retain talent. He also urged Congress to raise the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 an hour.
""We are not perfect, but together we are learning, we are listening and changing,"" he said. 
Walmart has said it pays an average of $17.50 an hour to its hourly employees, including benefits.
Walmart, which employs nearly 1.5 million Americans and is the largest U.S. private-sector employer, drew sharp criticism from labor groups and unions when it changed the format of its annual meeting last year, splitting it into two separate events.

The business meeting at which Sanders spoke is now held a few days before the big shareholder event, which draws thousands of employees. This year and the year before, the company rushed through shareholder proposals at the business meeting, which had a fraction of the attendees, in less than 30 minutes.

1008,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 04:40PM ET</span>",New Tech Unicorn Aims for Next-Day Delivery Anywhere in Brazil,"(Bloomberg) -- Latin America’s newest tech unicorn has an ambitious goal: next-day delivery to nearly anyone in Brazil. That’s no easy feat in the world’s fifth-biggest country -- where infrastructure networks lag far behind those of most developed nations.
Loggi is now valued at $1 billion, after raising $100 million this month in a funding round led by SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund, the company said Wednesday. SoftBank’s Latin America Fund is considering joining the round with an additional $50 million investment, according to the company. The cash infusion comes on the heels of a $100 million investment the Vision Fund made in the company last year.
The startup, which launched in 2014 delivering documents on the chaotic streets of Sao Paulo, is using the investment to build a team of more than 1,000 engineers as it constructs a Brazil-wide logistics service. The company currently covers about 35% of the population, and makes about 100,000 deliveries a day for clients including French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) SA, e-commerce giant MercadoLibre Inc. and fast-food restaurants McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp. and Burger King. Chief Executive Officer Fabien Mendez said the company aims to increase its coverage to 95% of the country by the end of next year and boost its delivery frequency to about 5 million a day within five years.
“Our philosophy is that we deliver anything for anyone,” Mendez said in an interview. “By the end of 2020, we want to connect all Brazilian cities. The idea is to offer next-day delivery to all Brazilians.”
Loggi will have to overcome obstacles that have made Brazil a notoriously difficult country for shippers, including poor infrastructure, crime, thick bureaucracy and sheer size. Brazil is bigger than the continental U.S. but its transportation infrastructure ranks near that of Rwanda, according to the World Economic Forum.
“When you operate in logistics in Brazil, it’s a death by a thousand cuts,” Mendez said. “The only way to leapfrog the structural barriers is through the use of technology.”
The company is opening a network of distribution centers across the country, including small warehouses in neighborhoods. It says it relies heavily on robotics, artificial intelligence and algorithms to find the most efficient route to air ship packages to those centers. The system alerts a nearby freelance courier -- around 25,000 of them deliver packages for Loggi -- to make the final drop off. The goal is to have minimal labor involved in the process, with only one set of human hands touching the package during each step of the delivery process, Mendez said.
The company is betting the country of 209 million people will rapidly adopt e-commerce. Sales in the sector are expected to rise 15% this year to about $15.5 billion, after rising 12% last year, according to Ebit|Nielsen, a research firm.
That growth has attracted other startups, including the  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).-backed CargoX. Last-mile delivery companies, including Colombia’s Rappi and homegrown iFood, are also expanding in the country.
But instead of competing with other existing players, Mendez said Loggi is working with them, providing delivery services for both Rappi and iFood, as well as retailers including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). “Loggi is emerging as a key enabler for Brazil’s burgeoning gig-economy and e-commerce sector,” said Akshay Naheta, a managing partner at SoftBank.
GGV Capital,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., Fifth Wall Ventures and Velt Partners joined the Vision Fund in the latest Loggi round. SoftBank’s Latin America Fund launched a $5 billion tech fund for the region this year. Already this year, SoftBank agreed to invest $1 billion in Rappi, and is said to be in talks with Brazilian lender Creditas.
Venture capital funding in Latin America has roughly doubled for each of the past two years and is on track to surpass the 2018 record of $2 billion. More than half of that funding last year went to Brazilian companies, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America.
As Brazil’s growing population of smartphone users place more orders online, automating logistics for food and package deliveries will be essential for the economy’s growth, Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV, wrote in an email. “We are seeing this as a global trend from the U.S. and China to Latin America, Southeast Asia and India,” Tung wrote.
If it’s able to establish its service across Brazil, Loggi will look to expand into other Latin American markets, Mendez said.
The 33-year-old, who was raised in a small village in the south of France and moved to Brazil in 2010, said he plans to grow the company’s employee headcount to 1,500 people, from the current payroll of 600. The company charges sellers a delivery fee based on the weight and destination of the package, plus an insurance charge. As a private company, it doesn’t release sales figures, but Mendez said Loggi expects to turn a profit next year, and was profitable in 2017.
Mendez said the startup had no immediate plans to have an initial public offering or to be acquired. But “the plan is to get the company to be IPO-able,” he said. “We want to show exponential growth, but also the Ebitda to make ourselves attractive to the market.”

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 04:31PM ET</span>",Wall St. climbs as weak private jobs data boost rate cut hopes,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes rose on Wednesday as investors bet on a Federal Reserve interest rate cut after weak private sector jobs data and hopes grew that the United States and Mexico would reach an agreement to avoid U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods.
The gains extended the rally on Tuesday when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the central bank may have to react to the U.S. trade wars, boosting rate cut hopes. Other Fed officials also hinted that a rate cut was possible.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday further bolstered bets for a rate cut. U.S. private employers hired at the slowest pace in more than nine years in May, weakness that analysts blamed on the heightening global trade tensions.
The data comes ahead of more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls data from the Labor Department due out on Friday. 
""Today and yesterday the market was embracing the idea of more weakness in the economy giving the Fed some cover to preemptively cut rates. If the excuse evaporates with a strong jobs number Friday the market might be disappointed,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Boston.
For now, he said, the market is betting the Fed will make a precautionary rate cut in July. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 207.39 points, or 0.82%, to 25,539.57, the S&P 500 gained 22.88 points, or 0.82%, to 2,826.15 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.36 points, or 0.64%, to 7,575.48.
Investors were also encouraged after U.S. President Donald Trump said he thinks Mexico wants to reach a deal to stop a new trade war. A White House trade adviser and a senior U.S. Republican senator also said Washington might not introduce proposed tariffs.
A Mexico deal ""would alleviate one of the risks that lurk out there,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia who also cited the prospects of rate hike cuts. 
Schwab's Kleintop saw the prospect of rate cuts as a bigger factor because defensive dividend sectors that do well in low rate environments were outperforming more trade-sensitive sectors in Wednesday's rally. 
The top gainers among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors were real estate which ended up 2.3%, while utilities closed up 2.1% and consumer staples registered a 1.1% advance.
But a rally with defensive sectors outperforming more cyclical sectors made Janney Montgomery Scott's Luschini wary. 
""You'd want to see materials, energy, industrials, financials leading the rally,"" he said. ""I'd be reluctant to chase this rally because it might just be a snapback rebound.""
The technology sector rose 1.4% and provided the biggest boost to the market, helped by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). Another big boost was Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM), which advanced 5.1% after the cloud-based service provider forecast full-year results above expectations.
The energy sector slipped 1.1%, making it the only S&P sector in the red, as crude prices fell sharply. 
Campbell Soup Co, the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P 500, rose 10% after the canned soup maker raised its full-year profit forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 66 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 68 new highs and 117 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 7.02 billion shares changed hands compared with the 7.12 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has reached a tentative agreement with France on the terms of its proposed merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA), two sources told Reuters, as the French carmaker's board met to consider the bid late on Wednesday.
The French state, which owns 15% of Renault, had been seeking more influence over the merged company, firmer job guarantees and improved terms for Renault shareholders in return for blessing the $35 billion tie-up.
Renault, FCA and the French government all declined to comment on the ongoing board discussions.
The new understanding between Paris and FCA, nine days after the Italian-American carmaker pitched its offer, does not mean that Renault board approval is automatic, the two sources close to the talks also cautioned.
Renault directors meeting at the company's Boulogne-Billancourt headquarters outside Paris may decide on Wednesday whether to approve a memorandum of understanding or framework agreement that would begin the long process of a full merger.

FCA has been locked in talks with Renault and the French state over its bid to create the world's third-biggest carmaker. France has broadly welcomed the deal, on condition it guarantees Renault's domestic blue-collar jobs and plants.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 04:21PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC adopts rules to prevent broker conflicts, boost disclosure","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday voted to adopt a package of rules requiring brokerage firms to disclose potential conflicts in the fees investors pay and the commissions brokers earn when giving financial advice. 
The Regulation Best Interest rules also require brokers to raise the standard for giving advice to meet a client's best interest when recommending stocks, mutual funds and other financial products.
""This action is long overdue,"" said Republican-appointed SEC Chairman Jay Clayton of the package, which was first proposed in April 2018.
""The differences between broker-dealers and investment advisers, and how they interact with their customers and clients, make it clear that a 'one size fits all' approach to regulating standards of conduct for financial professionals presents significant risk.""
The rules were passed by Clayton and the agency's two Republican-appointed commissioners. Robert Jackson, a Democrat appointee, dissented. 
Wednesday's vote caps a 10-year battle over regulation of the investment advice industry. Lobby groups last year sued successfully to overturn a similar Barack Obama-era fiduciary standard proposed by the Department of Labor.
The SEC rules, to be implemented by June 30, 2020, are considered a win for Wall Street because, unlike the Department of Labor rules, they would still allow brokers to recommend products that benefit them, provided they disclose the conflict. 
The SEC rules prescribe what brokers must do to comply, a step up from the current standard that allows brokers to recommend products that they view as ""suitable"" for a client's investment goals and risk tolerance, without having to disclose any potential conflicts.
Despite much internal wrangling over the rules and a pushback by consumer groups, SEC officials said Wednesday's final text remains similar to last year's proposal.
Clayton has said the rules would elevate the standard for what is considered in an investor's best interest for both broker dealers and wealth managers. He said the final rules tried to address industry requests for detailed guidelines to make compliance easier.
Investor advocates, however, say the SEC rules are still too vague in its definition of ""best interest"" and do not address all investment advice conflicts, including the higher payments that brokers receive for selling products that are more expensive to trade. 
Representative Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, said the package fell short by failing to require all financial advisors to adhere to ""a strong, uniform fiduciary standard of care when providing investors with investment advice,"" and called on the SEC to rescind it.
The rules have been divisive within the agency. Jackson said the package ""retains a muddled standard that exposes millions of Americans to the costs of conflicted advice."" He has also said the package lacks strong economic analysis to support how consumers will benefit over financial advisers, dissent that could lead to litigation from consumer groups.
Industry groups say the rules' heightened disclosure requirements will benefit consumers. 

""Compliance with the rule will not be easy for the industry. Firms will need to make substantial changes. The costs to implement will no doubt be significant, but ... worthwhile to uniformly enhance investor protection,"" said Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., who leads the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Weighing as much as five pounds, the drone would be able to travel 15 minutes to deliver packages and avoid obstacles such as people, dogs and clotheslines, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) said. Its shares rose 0.45%
The update has been long in the making after the company in December 2016 ran a trial run in the U.K., delivering a package by drone in 13 minutes.
The company also addressed concerns around the safety of the drones to avoid coming into contact with obstacles such as people.
""If our drone’s flight environment changes, or the drone‘s mission commands it to come into contact with an object that wasn’t there previously - it will refuse to do so - it is independently safe,” said Amazon executive Jeff Wilke.
Amazon's move to create its own delivery network comes as the proliferation of e-commerce has, at peak times, overloaded the capacity of its delivery partners.
For the moment, Amazon's foray into the shipping industry will take some time, with many expecting Amazon to continue building more capacity, reducing its reliance on its delivery partners such as FedEx and UPS. But eventually the ""Amazonification"" of shipping industry will threaten the growth of its partners, analysts warned.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said late last year that it believes the market is missing the risk Amazon Air (its in-house Express Air network) poses to UPS and FedDex growth.

""Over the last couple years, RMBS investors are increasingly focused on natural disaster risk. And we felt it would be helpful to try to quantify that for them,"" said Grant Bailey, an analyst at Fitch who co-authored the report.
The adjustment would add a new penalty to existing risk metrics. It is expected to better distinguish mortgage pools with high exposure to natural disaster risk, namely those with high concentrations in Florida and California, said Bailey.
Although the new penalty will apply to ratings which have already been issued, Fitch does not expect it to affect any ratings currently outstanding. 
""Our current proposed adjustment is fairly modest. But our goal here was to develop a framework that would allow us to dial the adjustment as needed,"" said Bailey. 
Fitch is soliciting feedback on the new methodology, so the adjustment will not go into effect immediately. 
Neither Moody's Investors Service nor Standard & Poor's have explicit measures of climate risk in their assessments of RMBS, though both noted that some of that risk is implicitly accounted for in existing metrics.

Investor demand for insight into environmental risk, however, has begun to shift credit assessments more broadly. Moody's recently announced its intention to create a carbon transition assessment, a research tool separate from its ratings that would rank companies by the level of risk associated with a transition to a low-carbon future.

U.S. money fund assets grew by $10.08 billion to $3.121 trillion in the week ended June 4, the Money Fund Report said.
During this six-week stretch, total fund assets increased by $111 billion.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he thinks Mexico wants to make a deal in the neighbors' immigration dispute, but that he will go ahead with tariffs on Mexican goods if it does not do more to control migration.
Trump's threat of tariffs on Mexican imports, which may go into effect next week, intensified a scramble among investors to sock their money into cash and other safe-haven assets.
It remains unclear whether Washington and Beijing would reach a trade pact after talks unexpectedly broke down a month ago.
Taxable money market fund assets climbed by $11.53 billion to $2.985 trillion, while tax-free assets declined by $1.45 billion to $136.13 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet. 
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds rose to 2.04% from a five-month low of 2.02% last week. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds increased to 30 days from 29 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds jumped to 1.11% from 0.99%, which was the lowest since late January. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds was unchanged at 22 days.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is getting more ""candor"" from managers of its businesses by spending days - rather than hours as it previously did - on review meetings with each unit, Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on Wednesday.
The longer reviews, which are held quarterly, are among the cultural changes under GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp, Miller said at a conference organized by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). Culp took over the CEO job in October.
""You can't have the flyby where you're not talking about the real issues, right, because you're staring at the facts,"" Miller said. ""You start to think about what allows candor to come to the surface.""
Culp recently discussed other cultural changes at GE, such as ending ""skirmishes"" in its businesses and moving faster on much needed efficiency improvements. 
The corporate culture is ""still shifting"" under Culp, Miller said, noting that such change ""takes time."" 
Miller said GE may keep its healthcare diagnostics and imaging businesses after the planned sale of the biopharma unit. GE previously said it would exit all businesses except power, aviation and renewable energy.
GE still expects negative cash flow of up to $2 billion in 2019, despite a relatively strong first quarter, Miller said. She also noted that GE's power services business is producing positive cash flow, but did not elaborate. 
GE posted a net loss of $22.8 billion last year, with positive cash flow.

GE shares were down 1.6% at $9.84 in late afternoon trading.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 03:20PM ET</span>",Tillerson Is Concerned China Will Give Up on Trade Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he’s concerned that China may still give up on trade talks with the U.S., even as the two countries come closer to a resolution to end their dispute.
The administration of President Donald Trump hasn’t been willing to deal with China in a language that the other country wants to listen to, Tillerson said Wednesday in an on-stage interview at a conference in Houston organized by KPMG LLP.
""Mutual respect, win-win solutions, these are things they want to hear and they’re not hearing those,"" he said, in a one of his first public appearances since he was fired from his cabinet role in March last year. ""It makes it hard for them to adjust themselves.""
The danger for Trump is that China decides to wait for his successor before truly committing to a resolution to the trade war, according to Tillerson.
“If I had a concern about it, it’s that the Chinese I hope do not come to the conclusion that they can’t make a deal with this administration,"" he said. “We’ll just wait for the next one. I hope that’s not what they’re moving to, I don’t believe it is.”
The comments are some of the most detailed so far from Tillerson, 67, since he was fired from his cabinet job last year. The former  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). chief executive officer broke his post-White House silence in December to talk about the president’s ""undisciplined"" leadership style. That drew a rebuke from Trump.
Tillerson also said at the Houston event that he’s concerned about the U.S. moving to bilateral discussions and that it’s undermining alliances built up with other countries over the past 70 years.
“I have some concerns about moving to strictly bilateral discussions that we are undermining or weakening that very strong alignment that’s been knitted together over the last century,” he said.
Global allegiances are a key U.S. strength and should be maintained, according to Tillerson.
""Russia, China, North Korea have no allies and friends,"" he said. ""Our strength comes from allies and friends.""

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 02:59PM ET</span>",Exclusive: GM CEO defends plan to sell Ohio plant to startup,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra on Wednesday defended the automaker's plan to sell an assembly plant in Ohio, arguing the plan to sell the plant to an electric vehicle start-up was thoroughly vetted and had a chance of success.
Barra told Reuters in a brief interview Wednesday after a series of meetings on Capitol Hill that the company did not plan to add a new vehicle to its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that ended production in March because it has additional unused U.S. capacity. Last month, GM announced it was in talks to sell the plant to EV startup Workhorse Group Inc and an affiliated, newly formed entity.
Barra rebuffed criticism of the planned deal.
""We remain thinking it's a strong possibility and think people should focus on opportunity and maybe every now and then a little optimism wouldn't hurt anyone."" Asked if the deal was a ""PR stunt"" Barra said no. ""We vetted many opportunities."" 
She also said it was unclear what the precise impact would be on GM of U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods that could take effect on June 10, but according to congressional aides, she told lawmakers the impact would be significant. She said ""it really hard to tell without understanding what the rules are going to be and the exclusions around it.""
GM's announcement last month it planned to sell the plant followed months of criticism and pressure from President Donald Trump over the fate of the plant in politically important northeast Ohio. Ohio is crucial to Trump's 2020 reelection chances and he has made auto jobs a key focus of his presidency.
Ohio members of Congress urged Barra to add an electric vehicle at Lordstown or shift production of its Mexican-made Chevrolet Blazer to the plant.
""We want General Motors back. We want them to fill that plant again,"" Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, told reporters after the meeting with Barra. ""We didn't hear from Ms. Barra what Plan B is.""
Some critics question how Ohio-based Workhorse, a small electric truck and drone startup that has reported losses totaling almost $150 million since its launch in 2007, and had just $2.8 million in cash on hand at the end of March, could buy the massive Lordstown plant.
Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said they were told it would take a $300 million to $400 million investment to redevelop the plant. He said it would be ""tough"" for Workhorse to make the investment given its balance sheet and urged Barra to reconsider. ""We think the plant has earned the right to be able to continue to produce products for General Motors.""
Brown noted that the plant employed about 4,500 workers in late 2016 and about 1,500 in March after GM had previously cut two of the three shifts. Workhorse might employ about 400 and it is not clear what they would pay, the senators said.
Barra said Workhorse has technology and contracts. ""I'd like to see people looking and giving it a chance,"" Barra said. Workhorse still needs to raise additional capital and the plant's status must be addressed during this summer's United Auto Workers contract talks that begin in July, she added.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 02:34PM ET</span>",Ford expected to announce closure of Welsh engine factory: source,"By Costas Pitas and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford is expected to announce on Thursday that it is closing its engine facility in Bridgend, Wales, a source told Reuters, in what would be another blow to Britain's car industry. 
More than 2,000 people work at the site, according to Ford's website, which is one of two Ford engine plants in Britain. 
Officials from the Unite union are expected to be told of the decision at a meeting with the U.S. carmaker on Thursday, a source familiar with the situation said on condition of anonymity. 
A spokeswoman for Ford declined to comment on what she said was speculation, after the expected closure was also reported by  ITV  (LON:ITV) news and other media.
Ford makes around 1.3 million engines at two British locations, Bridgend and Dagenham in eastern England. It has previously warned it could face $1 billion in tariff costs in case of a so-called hard Brexit.
In January, Ford said that as part of a worldwide turnaround effort it would cut thousands of jobs, look at plant closures and discontinue loss-making vehicle lines, and would start consultations with unions on the plans. The Unite union said at the time it expected nearly 1,000 job losses at Bridgend.
Ford has already announced 5,000 job cuts in Germany, its second-biggest European market, but it has yet to make major decisions in Britain, which is its biggest.
Britain's largely foreign-owned car industry has become increasingly concerned as a stable and attractive investment environment descends into political crisis due to uncertainty about the terms of Britain's planned departure from the European Union.

Ford's British-built engines, which are shipped for fitting in vehicles in Germany, Turkey, the United States and elsewhere, could face delays and extra costs if Britain leaves the EU without securing a deal with the European Union.

1022,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",Steepening Yield Curve Shows Market Isn't Waiting for Fed to Act,"(Bloomberg) -- The steepening U.S. yield curve shows bond traders have concluded that the case for Federal Reserve rate cuts is only strengthening, even as top policy makers signal they’re not yet ready to act.
Futures reflected more than 70 basis points of easing in 2019 at one point Wednesday, a move that helped push key portions of the curve to their widest since at least November. Bets on steepening -- historically the darling trade during easing cycles -- are building amid signs of weakness in U.S. manufacturing and the labor market, with the trade war only threatening to intensify. Add tepid inflation to the mix, and investors see the basis for the Fed’s first rate cut since 2008.
Traders aren’t waiting for officials to come around to their view. The spread between 5- and 30-year Treasury yields has reached the steepest since 2017, while that for the 2- to 10-year section is blowing wider as well. Ten-year yields, at around 2.13%, are down from about 2.7% at the start of the year.
Here are the themes that investors are focusing on as they add to wagers that policy makers will slash borrowing costs before the year is out:
Tame Inflation
“Inflation has continued to disappoint,” said Gemma Wright-Casparius, a senior money manager at Vanguard Group, during the Bloomberg Invest summit in New York on Tuesday.
About “2% on the 10-year yield is breathtaking,” she said. “But it really tells you how much the market is forward-looking and beginning to price in a series of interest-rate cuts predicated on inflation missing the Fed’s target, and the risk of a more significant global slowdown because of the trade uncertainties.”
The central bank’s favored measure of price pressures rose 1.5% in the year through April, well below the Fed’s 2% target. The outlook reflected in inflation-linked Treasuries shows traders see annual growth below 2% for consumer prices for the next 30 years.
Wright-Casparius and Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Marc Seidner -- who also spoke at the summit -- align in saying steepening will continue in the leadup to an eventual Fed shift toward easing.
Growth Concerns
Even before possible effects from tariffs, U.S. manufacturing has cooled, and a gauge of private payrolls for May just came in at the weakest since 2010. To be sure, a measure of the service industry for last month beat forecasts. That leaves investors on alert for further signs that the trade standoff with China is weighing on the economy as President Donald Trump considers additional tariffs.
A closely watched slice of the curve favored as a recession signal remains inverted: Yields on 10-year notes were about 22 basis points below 3-month rates, near the deepest inversion since 2007.
“There is no question that growth is already slowing,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. “The bond market is telling you that and the data is telling you that.’’
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s Jan Hatzius said in a note Wednesday that weak private employment suggests downside potential for Friday’s non-farm jobs figures. While rate cuts aren’t the bank’s base case, he wrote that the risks have risen and he’ll reassess after the payrolls data.
Some Insurance
Trump’s threat to slap 5% duties on all Mexican imports on June 10 unless Mexico reins in migration into the U.S. was another trigger for many Fed watchers. It led them to predict the central bank will lower rates as insurance against growth headwinds from the trade war.
The steepening move faded a bit on Wednesday after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in an interview with CNN that Mexican officials still have time to prevent the tariffs from taking effect.
Earlier this week, research firm Evercore ISI said its base case is that the Fed will “reluctantly cut rates three times starting in September in a mini-easing cycle” amid the trade conflict.
“As long as the Fed does not suddenly discover that it has slipped behind the curve, we would expect the FOMC to move in quarter-point increments, not 50bp or more to avoid signaling alarm,” Evercore’s Krishna Guha and Ernie Tedeschi wrote in a note Monday."
1023,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 02:20PM ET</span>",Trade War Is Making a Winner Out of Vietnam’s Offshore Loan Market,"(Bloomberg) -- As the U.S.-China trade spat drags on, one winner is emerging. Vietnamese companies are borrowing the most in six years in the offshore loan market as Asia’s fastest-growing economy benefits from businesses shifting their supply chains away from China.
The fledgling loan market in Vietnam is proving to be lucrative for bankers, offering some of the widest margins in Southeast Asia. Dollar syndicated loan volumes have surged 119% to $2 billion so far in 2019 from the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“Vietnam is a bright spot within the ASEAN syndicated loan market in otherwise a tough year,” said Bryan Liew, Singapore-based head of ASEAN loan syndications at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc. “Vietnam is likely to benefit from the shift in manufacturing capital from China amid the U.S.-China trade war.”
Vietnam Tops List of Biggest Winners From U.S.-China Trade War
The Vietnam boom comes as loan volumes in the Asia ex-Japan region have fallen about 25% year-to-date, with the sharpest decline seen in China amid deepening trade tensions.
At least $1.4 billion of deals, including from state-owned PetroVietnam Gas, are in the pipeline. These five facilities are set to boost volumes after a record $5.8 billion in 2018, the data show. That said, Vietnam loans are still only about 4% of the ASEAN market.
Vietnamese deals are providing some of the fattest margins in the region. Consumer finance company VPBank Finance paid 275 basis points over Libor on its 364-day $215 million facility closed in March. The average margin for loans of a similar tenor from ASEAN borrowers was 105 basis points in 2018, Bloomberg data show.
Vietnam’s Economy Could Soon Be Bigger Than Singapore’s
The Southeast Asian nation was one of the fastest-growing sources of American imports from Asia last quarter. The communist-led nation’s economy may gain 7.9% in gross domestic product from trade diversions, according to a report by Nomura this week."

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>",Trump tariffs may steer Mexican cows away from U.S. beef supply,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to slap tariffs on imports of Mexican goods could slow another, often overlooked migration: the more than 1 million cows exported by Mexico across the border each year which become part of the U.S. beef supply.
Tariffs on cattle crossing the border could raise costs for U.S. meat producers and processors, ranchers and economists said, particularly in border states like New Mexico and Texas that supplement more of their herds with Mexican cattle. Those fees could also contribute to more expensive barbecues for U.S. consumers.
Nationwide, the imported livestock account for about 4% of the U.S. supply of young cows, known as feeder cattle. But in parts of the U.S. South and Southwest, more than a quarter of the cattle in feed yards at any given time can originate in Mexico, making those regions among the most vulnerable to Trump's unilateral tariff plan.
If the duties are imposed, U.S. cattle feeders will import fewer cows due to the increased cost, said Derrell Peel, agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University, a situation that may leave them with empty space in their feed yards or paying more for U.S.-born cattle.
Texas-based Cactus Feeders, one of the largest U.S. cattle feeding companies, has fed up to 150,000 Mexican cattle in its feed lots at once, said Surcy Peoples, a Cactus cattle buyer and director of customer service. The lots have a capacity for 525,000 cattle.
""We would not have the number of cattle that we typically have available to place into feed lots"" if the tariffs are imposed, Peoples said.
Trump last week said he will implement a blanket tariff on all Mexican goods from June 10 as he attempts to pressure Mexico into stopping U.S.-bound migrants, mostly from Central America. Levies would start at 5%, but could reach as high as 25% if Mexico does not comply with Trump's demands.
BILATERAL RISKS
The tariffs threaten major economic damage to Mexico, which sends about 80% of its exports to the United States.
The financial risk for U.S. meat producers also show how the tariffs could harm American business. 
Mexican officials will seek to persuade the White House in high-stakes talks hosted by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday that their government has done enough to stem immigration and avoid looming tariffs.
Ahead of those talks, Pence was looking for a comprehensive suite of ""tangible measures"" from visiting officials about stopping the surge of Central American migrants, according to a White House official.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) on Monday estimated a $15 million hit from Trump's proposed tariffs, and said it may cover that by raising burrito prices by around 5 cents to offset higher costs for imported avocados.
The United States last year imported about 1.3 million feeder cattle from Mexico, the most since 2012, according to data analyzed by the Livestock Marketing Information Center, an industry group. 
Mexican cattle in the United States are raised in feed yards from Texas to California and Colorado until they grow large enough to be slaughtered by U.S. processors, like  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and JBS USA.
Tyson declined to comment and JBS USA did not respond to request for comment. Cargill Inc, a major U.S. supplier of ground beef, said it was assessing the potential impact of tariffs.
Trump's 5% tariff could threaten profits for some U.S. cattle-feeding businesses that operate on thin margins, said Jim Robb, senior economist for the center.
""Often in the cattle business, 5% is the difference between profit and loss,"" Robb said.
TRADE DISPUTES WEIGH
U.S. livestock producers have already come under pressure as trading disputes with Mexico and China slowed pork exports last year.
New Mexico, Texas and Arizona imported 603,488 head of Mexican feeder through May 31, up 20% from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Almost half went to New Mexico, where 400- to 500-pound Mexican steers cost as much as $163 per head, down about 7% from 2018.
Meat from some of the cattle may end up back in Mexico, the third-biggest export market for U.S. beef. But that export demand could ease if Mexico imposes retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products in response to Trump's tariffs.
""It scares me that they would start putting tariffs on U.S. beef,"" said Pete Bonds, a cattle rancher and president of Bonds Ranch in Saginaw, Texas.
Mexico could also reduce beef purchases from the United States if tariffs on Mexican goods result in Mexican cattle producers shipping fewer animals north of the border, ranchers said.
""If they are fed in Mexico, they will develop their own customer base that could eventually lead to them becoming competitive in nature to our beef market,"" said Jesse Larios, manager at Foster Feed Yard in Brawley, California.
On Saturday, Larios watched an auction of Mexican cattle that was livestreamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). He did not buy any, but said he is impressed by the sturdiness and health of Mexican cattle.

""They are delivering to the U.S. border cattle that cattle feeders like myself can purchase that the American consumer is going to want,"" Larios said.

(Reuters) -  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc on Wednesday said it had tentatively agreed to pay $15.4 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe into how a drugmaker it now owns marketed an expensive treatment for a rare infant seizure disorder and multiple sclerosis.
But Mallinckrodt said it would fight new claims by the department contained in complaint filed on Tuesday in federal court in Philadelphia that it improperly used a charity to pay kickbacks aimed at encouraging Medicare patients to use the drug.
The department alleged that the drugmaker from 2010 to 2014 used a patient assistance charity as a conduit to improperly subsidize Medicare patients' copayment obligations, allowing the company to keep raising prices for the drug, H.P. Acthar Gel.
""This lawsuit and prior enforcement actions make clear that the Department will hold accountable drug companies that pay illegal kickbacks to facilitate increased drug prices,"" Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said in a statement.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing copayments for patients enrolled in the government’s Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing copay assistance as long as they are independent.
In March the department joined a pair of whistleblower lawsuits that alleged Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which Mallinckrodt acquired in 2014, defrauded government healthcare programs by illegally marketing Acthar.[nL1N22C19E]
The Justice Department said the price of the drug had spiked in the years since Questcor acquired it in 2001 from about $50 per vial to $32,200 in 2014. Mallinckrodt said the drug’s price today is $38,892 per vial. 
Last year, Acthar represented 35% of Mallinckrodt's $3.2 billion in net sales. 
Mallinckrodt said its agreement-in-principle to resolve the department's marketing investigation is subject to finalization and contains no admission of wrongdoing. But it said the company believed its actions related to the charity were lawful.
""We are confident that the litigation process will focus the contested issues and be a productive step in reaching resolution,"" Mark Casey, Mallinckrodt's general counsel, said in a statement.
Mallinckrodt shares fell 2.6 percent to $9.46.

But a deeper dive into the above-consensus results showed a slowing Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO), a recently adopted metric similar to deferred revenue, which has Nomura spooked somewhat.
Nomura cut its price target on Salesforce to $180 from $184.
Salesforce reported a total RPO of $24.9 billion, an increase of 22% year on-year, but that was below 25% year-on-year growth seen in the fourth quarter. Current remaining performance obligation, which represents the future revenues under contract expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, ended the first quarter at about $11.89 billion, an increase of 23% year over year.
Billings, a sales growth metric and closely-watched financial metric for software companies, rose 22% to $2.71 billion, slightly outpacing the company's target of 20%.
Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block attributed the better-than-expected results to ""tremendous demand"" for its offerings as companies ""are undergoing a digital transformation to better serve their customers, and they are choosing Salesforce as their partner.""
The outlook suggest the path for growth in the near term will not be smooth, but it should improve over the ensuing quarters.
Salesforce expects to generate second-quarter revenue of $3.94 billion to $3.95 billion, in line with estimates from Capital IQ. But non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46 to $0.47 would fall well short of expectations of $0.68.
Still, the company upgraded its outlook on the full year, forecasting revenue in the range of $16.10 billion to $16.25 billion, up from $15.95 to $16.05 billion previously. Adjusted earnings are expected between $2.88 and $2.90, up from a prior outlook of $2.74 to $2.76."

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Watchdog examines Guernsey listings of suspended Woodford fund,"By Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said it was examining a decision by a frozen Woodford fund to list investments in Guernsey, as wealth manager St James's Place pulled 3.5 billion pounds ($4.45 billion) from the firm in a widening fall-out from the suspension.
In a rare event, British fund manager Neil Woodford suspended trading late on Monday in his 3.7 billion pound ($4.70 billion) flagship Equity Income Fund after an increase in demand by clients to take back their money.
That followed a period of underperformance that had seen billions of pounds exit in outflows. 
Woodford, one of Britain's highest-profile money managers and a particular favorite of retail investors, told investors he needed to prevent them leaving in order to give him time to sell out of a number of unlisted or illiquid positions.
Orders to trade in the fund placed after 1100 GMT last Friday have been rejected due to its suspension, leaving investors not knowing when they will get their money back. 
The situation is having an impact on firms close to Woodford and has focused attention on the regulator.
The Financial Conduct Authority said it was talking to the fund's administrator and Guernsey's stock exchange about Woodford's decision to list some of the fund's assets on the exchange.
Woodford favored unlisted stocks in the fund but critics say he tended to keep those holdings close to the 10% regulatory limit for investments in unlisted assets that funds like Woodford's face.
""Where the FCA believes there are circumstances suggesting serious misconduct or non-compliance with the rules, it may open an investigation,"" the watchdog said in a statement.
A spokesman for Woodford Investment Management could not be reached for comment.
The head of the FCA said earlier on Wednesday that the regulator stood ready to intervene if it had concerns over the way the suspension was managed.
MANDATE TERMINATED
St James's Place said it had terminated a mandate with Woodford Investment Management, stressing that none of its assets were part of the suspended fund. 
Shares in fund platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) have taken a hit because of its connection to Woodford, down 10% since Monday's open, prompting it to come out fighting on Wednesday.
Hargreaves said it would waive fees on its platform for investors in the suspended fund and called on Woodford to do the same.
Fund rating firm Morningstar cut the suspended fund's rating to ""negative"" from ""neutral"" on Wednesday, its second downgrade in a month, citing a period of heightened redemptions and saying its strategy was ""structurally impaired"" following the suspension.
In a video posted on the company's website on Tuesday, close-shaven Woodford, 59, wearing a blue sweater against the backdrop of a large, modern living room, told investors he was ""extremely sorry"" to have suspended the fund.
He said the decision was ""motivated by your interests, our investors"". 
The suspension will be reviewed by the fund's adviser at least every 28 days, and the FCA will be informed of the reviews, Woodford said in a Q&A document for clients on its website, posted on Wednesday. 
Among the fund's biggest positions in unlisted companies are BenevolentAI and Oxford Nanopore, although it also has large stakes in smaller, listed companies which trade much less frequently than larger peers and so take longer to sell.
Despite that, Woodford's website Q&A said the fund was not a forced seller. ""Neil has the time and space to deliver on his strategy to place the unquoted parts of the portfolio with interested buyers,"" it said. 
Jonathan Miller, UK director of manager research ratings at Morningstar, said Woodford could face further redemptions after the fund reopens, which would mean the firm needed to make quite deep changes to the portfolio.
""There is some reputational damage and current investors may simply prefer an exit when the fund re-opens,"" Miller said.
""They're going to need to access their money, so the portfolio will need to have a totally different make-up to that of today. How long it takes to reach that point is difficult to estimate – it certainly won’t be days from now."" 
Woodford said the fund would continue to be priced daily. The price fell by more than 3% between Friday, the cut-off date for redemptions, and Tuesday. The fund is down more than 14% in the last three months.
Another Woodford fund, Woodford Patient Capital Trust, into which Woodford has already shifted some of the Income Fund's unlisted assets, closed down 6.9%, bringing its losses to 14% this week.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 01:00PM ET</span>",GameStop shares plunge 39%; analysts say 2019 could be challenging,"(Reuters) -  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares plunged as much as 39% and were set for their worst day ever following its weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and dividend halt, and Wall Street analysts said 2019 could be a very challenging year for the company.
The share slide wiped off more than $315 million from the company's market capitalization and at least six brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. 
""Patience is thin given fears around the digitization of gaming and given lags in assessment, plan development and execution...GameStop now faces the need for a dramatic pivot, wholesale changes, and aggressive action to remain relevant,"" Jefferies analysts said.
The gaming retailer continues to struggle with a changing video game landscape and emerging technologies like game-streaming and has seen a slew of management changes after its Chief Executive Officer J. Paul Raines passed away last year.
The company has been cutting costs to remodel itself under its latest chief executive officer George Sherman, but investors are pessimistic that its core business of selling physical video games and hardware consoles can get back on track.
""Overall, the combination of the transformation initiatives, ongoing consumer shift to digital gaming, and current console cycle being in the very late stages are likely to make 2019 a very challenging year for GameStop,"" Telsey Advisory Group analysts wrote in a note.
Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd said on Tuesday consumers were postponing their console purchases as they awaited new versions of PS4 and Xbox One. The current models from Sony Corp (T:6758) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) are in their late stages.
Benchmark analysts said the latest management team ""iteration was uninspiring and lacked any coherent articulation of a tangible vision on how to transform the business.""
""The only impactful transformation we see in GameStop's future is the industry's on-going transition to the digital economy, a viable scenario where GameStop has little value."" 
GameStop said its dividend stoppage will save about $157 million per year, besides helping in cutting its debt of nearly $500 million.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said the dividend elimination was not entirely surprising, but acknowledged that the move to pay down debt is prudent.

""That said, the implication that dollars may be reallocated to transformation initiatives, adds risk at a time when gross profit is already declining. Where that shakes out for 2020 will be key,"" CS analysts said.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 11:55AM ET</span>","U.S. rejects GM, Volvo tariff relief requests for China-made SUVs","By David Shepardson and Esha Vaish
WASHINGTON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The United States has rejected separate requests from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Chinese-owned Volvo Cars for an exemption to a 25% U.S. tariff on their Chinese-made sport utility vehicle models.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, and Sweden's Volvo both said they were aware of the respective denials of their nearly year-old petitions. Both companies had not raised the sticker price to account for tariffs, which came into play last July. 
The denial of GM's petition for its Buick Envision came in a May 29 letter from the U.S. Trade Representative's office saying the request concerned ""a product strategically important or related to 'Made in China 2025' or other Chinese industrial programs.""
The midsize SUV, with a starting price of about $35,000, has become a target for U.S. critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.
Buick Envision sales fell in the United States by nearly 27% to 30,000 last year and fell another 21% in the first three months of 2019.
Only a small number of vehicles are built in China and sold in the United States.
Last month, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office also rejected a request by Volvo Cars for its mid-size XC60 SUVs, its top selling U.S. vehicle.
Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, had already last year begun switching production of U.S.-bound XC60s from China to Europe as part of a global shake up of production plans for most of its lineup in an effort to dodge tariffs. 
A spokeswoman said the XC60 shift, Volvo's biggest move to mitigate the impact of tariffs, was completed in the Spring, meaning Volvo was no longer paying tariffs on XC60 imports and would not see any fresh cost impact due to the rejection.
Volvo had argued in its exemption request that it could ""anticipate"" the XC60 would be eventually produced in its recently opened South Carolina plant, where it is building S60 sedans, but the spokeswoman said no decision had been taken.
""(New production setup) is a cost so that would of course depend on the permanence of tariffs and what the situation looks like going forward. It's a continuous evaluation that we always do with the flexible manufacturing footprint,"" she said.
Besides the shift, Volvo has also split production of its S60 luxury sport sedan between the two countries; altered some European production plans; and reduced shipments of its S90 sedan, which is only produced in China, to the United States. 
U.S. retail sales for the S90 sedan this year to May were down 63.7 percent year on year, company data showed.
GM had argued in its request that Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds ""to invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.""
GM said last year the ""vast majority"" of Envisions, about 200,000 a year, are sold in China.
Because of the lower U.S. sales volume, ""assembly in our home market is not an option"" for the Envision, which competes with such mid-size crossover vehicles as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac XT5.

Ahead of the July 2018 start for higher import tariffs, GM shipped in a six-month supply of Envisions at the much lower 2.5 percent tariff rate, Reuters reported in August 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors pulled approximately $4.7 billion out of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold U.S. stocks last week as concerns about escalating trade wars weighed on equity markets worldwide, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. 
The retreat from domestic stocks came as the benchmark S&P 500 fell three out of the four trading days of the holiday-shortened week, and added to a months-long move away from the U.S. market despite gains in major indexes for the year to date. Since January, investors have pulled a net of $40.3 billion out of U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 12% over the same time. 
World stocks dropped last week after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced new trade tariffs on Mexican goods to stem illegal immigration, while the U.S. and China continued to be at an impasse in talks over ending the trade war between the world's two largest economies. 
Taxable and municipal bond funds continued to pull in new assets, bringing in a net of approximately $3 billion last week. For the year to date, bond funds have grabbed slightly more than $177 billion in inflows. 

World stock funds, meanwhile, were little changed for a second straight week, losing $302 million in net assets after gaining $105 million the week before. For the year to date, world stock funds have lost $5.5 billion in net investor assets.

LONDON (Reuters) - PwC, one of the world's ""Big Four"" accounting firms, said it will spend an extra 30 million pounds ($38 million) to beef up its audit business in Britain, where the sector faces a shake-up after corporate collapses.
PwC said it will hire an extra 500 auditors across Britain, increase training, create a new digital audit team, and review clients to ensure ""we achieve a return that allows continual investment in and focus on quality"".
It stops short of recommendations from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for audit activities at the ""Big Four"" to be operationally separate from the more lucrative consultancy work. Accounting sector officials have questioned whether this would actually improve audit quality.
The collapse of construction company Carillion and retailer BHS led the CMA to make its recommendations, but Britain's government has yet to propose legislation to implement them.
The Big Four have voluntarily agreed not to offer consultancy services to their audit clients. 
""We have said for some time that we support changes that will improve audit quality,"" Hermione Hudson, head of audit at PwC in Britain, said about the changes announced on Wednesday.
PwC, which audited BHS, said it was also commissioning an independent report from an academic on what a culture of challenge means for auditors.
Lawmakers have said a sector shake up was needed to make auditors more willing to challenge what their clients tell them. 
Rival KPMG, which audited Carillion, has announced that from this month there will be more separate performance management and governance of its audit business.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>","Stocks, Treasuries climb on bets for U.S. rate cut","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock markets edged higher and the U.S. Treasuries market resumed its recent rally on Wednesday as investors bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates and help boost a sluggish global economy.
Underscoring concerns over growth was a report by U.S. payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Wednesday that showed U.S. private employers added 27,000 jobs in May, well below economists' expectations and the smallest monthly gain in more than nine years.
A flare-up in trade tensions between the United States and China hurt world stocks in May and triggered fears of an impending recession.
Yields on U.S. two-year Treasury notes - sensitive to traders' view on changes in Fed policy - hit their lowest since December 2017 following the ADP data. The inversion between U.S. 3-month bill rates and 10-year yields continued for a ninth straight session.
""The ADP number does raise some concerns about the further impact of tariffs. It adds to the case of interest rate cuts, the odds of that happening are going up,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials this week helped limit equity market losses as they warned the trade war may force them to respond, prompting investors to price in possible rate cuts.
Interest rate futures show the U.S. central bank will start cutting rates as soon as next month, with as many as three rate cuts priced by year-end.
The benchmark S&P 500 and Dow indexes were trading higher while the Nasdaq turned lower by late morning.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 108.36 points, or 0.43%, to 25,440.54, the S&P 500 gained 5 points, or 0.18%, to 2,808.27 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.19 points, or 0.08%, to 7,520.93. 
MSCI's broad gauge of stocks across the globe was up for a third day, gaining 0.35%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.20%.
In the U.S. Treasuries market, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.1054%, from 2.121% late on Tuesday.
Earlier, Germany's 10-year bond yield reached a record low and Italian debt held on to this week's gains as investors ramped up their bets on a generous loan package for banks in the euro zone as well as a U.S. rate cut. 
The U.S. dollar weakened further in the wake of the recent Fed comments.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.107 points or 0.11%, to 96.965. The yen was last down 0.11% at $108.0200. 
Oil prices resumed their slide, extending losses after data showing a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles.

U.S. crude fell 2.51% to $52.14 per barrel.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 09:39AM ET</span>","Google, Facebook have tight grip on growing U.S. online ad market: report","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - The U.S. internet advertising industry is projected to hit $160 billion by 2023 from $107 billion last year, led by fast-growing categories like mobile video with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) firmly controlling the market, consultancy PwC said on Wednesday.
The two tech giants together commanded nearly 60% of the U.S. internet advertising market in 2018, according to the report, up 3% from the previous year. Google's YouTube dominates online video, while Facebook has been expanding its video product called Watch and adding advertising options.
Google and Facebook are both currently under watch by U.S. regulators for possible antitrust concerns, as well as tech giants Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
U.S. wireless carrier AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) despite spending $85 billion for media company Time Warner to transform into a media and advertising firm, has only managed to eke out single digit market share, according to PwC. 
Gaining market share is difficult because platforms must have features that are new and specific as well as some degree of emerging technology, said C.J. Bangah, a principal at PwC. An advantage the telecommunications companies like AT&T have over Google and Facebook is they will benefit from 5G, the next generation wireless network that is expected to bring technology like autonomous cars to reality. 
""The opportunity created for telecom providers is they know where consumers are, they're benefiting from 5G and they know what apps consumers spend time on,"" she said.
Amazon, the largest U.S. online retailer, has been able to gain the most ground over the past year, though it too only has single-digit market share, PwC said.

Amazon's product ads are fueling their growth, Bangah said, because advertisers are able to reach consumers on a website where people are in the mindset to shop.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>",BT to close most of UK office locations under new CEO,"By Justin George Varghese
(Reuters) - Britain's former telecoms monopoly BT will consolidate its UK offices from 300 locations to roughly 30 sites while pressing ahead with plans to leave its St Paul's headquarters in London, the company said on Wednesday.
New BT chief Philip Jansen inherited a major restructuring begun by predecessor Gavin Patterson as Britain's biggest broadband supplier looks to move on from an accounting scandal and battles multiple pressures on its business.
The shake-up, including 13,000 job cuts, was announced a year ago and aims to tackle problems ranging from criticism of BT's fiber broadband to an underperforming IT services business.
""Today, BT revealed the first eight of the locations that will house its workplaces of the future as part of a three-to-five-year program initially announced in May 2018 to improve and consolidate its workplaces across the UK,"" the company said.
Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Ipswich, London and Manchester would be key locations for the group, BT said in a statement.
BT, which employs over 100,000, gave no indication of the impact of the moves on jobs in particular locations. 
A company spokeswoman confirmed that the office closures were in line with the plan revealed under Patterson last year to cut managerial and back-office jobs and move to a smaller London base.
MOVING HOME
The company, which has been based at the BT Centre, near St Paul's Cathedral and the London Stock Exchange in the City of London since it was privatized in 1984, said on Wednesday it is currently identifying ""a new home"" for the business in the capital.
The program will consolidate BT's ""footprint"" to around 30 sites ""containing modern, future-fit buildings, including corporate offices, contact centers and specialist sites,"" it said. All will be equipped with 5G connections. 
""BT's workplace improvement and consolidation program is the biggest of its type ever undertaken in the UK and is expected to complete by 2023,"" BT said, adding that its telephone exchanges will be retained by the group.
BT has felt the effects of an accounting fraud in its Italy unit two years ago, which required the company to take a 530 million pound ($675 million) charge in early 2017, and a rocky relationship with Britain's telcoms regulator.
BT, which owns Britain's biggest mobile operator EE, said last month core earnings would drop again this year - the third decline in a row - to 7.2 billion-7.3 billion pounds.
Jansen, who took up the post in February, has vowed to roll out full-fiber broadband to 15 million homes by the mid-2020s, offering to spearhead Britain's shift to ultrafast networks if the government and regulator make it worth its while. 

Britain has lagged European rivals in building ultrafast connections, and BT, which operates the national fiber and copper-based network, has come under pressure to do more.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Companies lag in climate-related disclosures: G20 Task Force,"By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - Companies are failing to disclose sufficient detail about how exposed they are to the potential risks of climate change, a global task force said in a report on Wednesday.
Many investors have called on companies to provide better communication on how climate change could impact their businesses, amid concerns that assets are being mispriced because the full scale of the risk is not being factored in.
""Given the speed at which changes are needed to limit the rise in the global average temperature — across a wide range of sectors — more companies need to consider the potential impact of climate change and disclose material findings,"" the report said.
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board, found in its report that climate related disclosure had improved since 2016 but only about a quarter of companies disclosed information aligned with more than five of the TCFD's 11 recommendations.
The TCFD launched a voluntary framework in 2017 that calls on companies to provide climate-related financial disclosures in their public annual financial filings.
Other recommendations include disclosing metrics companies use to set internal climate targets and describing processes for managing climate-related risks.
The task force published its second status report on Wednesday, showing 785 companies and organizations, with a combined market capitalization of more than $9.2 trillion, had committed to supporting the TCFD framework, a more than 50% increase from the first status report published in September.
Companies supporting the framework include insurance groups AXA and  Aviva  (LON:AV), oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total and mining companies  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and BHP.
Climate scientists said last year that keeping the Earth's temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a level that would stave off the worst effects of climate change, required rapid changes in the way people used energy, eat, lived and traveled.
But Wednesday's report said there was only a 3 percent increase from 2016 to 2018 in the number of firms disclosing information on the resilience of their strategies, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree scenario or lower.
The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a long-term goal to limit global warming to ""well below"" a rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times while ""pursuing efforts"" for the tougher goal of 1.5 degrees.
More than 200 of the world's largest listed companies have forecast that climate change could cost them a combined total of almost $1 trillion, a report by charity group Carbon Disclosure Project showed this week.

1047,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Trade Tremors Deepen Biggest Stock Dislocation in Generation,"(Bloomberg) -- Growth is so precious in stock markets these days that a millennial stock picker can hardly remember the last time investors were so enamored of it.
In Europe as in the U.S., stocks promising high earnings and sales growth have hit a new record high relative to value stocks -- newly dubbed a “widowmaker” trade for their persistent losses -- in MSCI Inc. indexes going back to 1995.
There are good reasons for investors to bid up so-called growth stocks. As fears build over an interminable U.S.-China trade war, a gauge of Europe’s inflation expectations has plummeted to an all-time low along with benchmark German bond yields, benefiting long-duration assets such as stocks holding the promise of earnings outperformance and killing cheaply valued sectors such as banks.
For investors, it’s a tug of war between a desire to find the companies more insulated from an uncertain economic outlook on one hand -- and stretched positioning threatening a reversal on the other.
“The market may be extrapolating some of those growth stories too far into the future,” said Ben Stapley, who oversees a growth fund at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in London. “The key is to avoid companies with high expectations of growth that then subsequently disappoint.”
Growing speculation that worsening trade tensions will nudge the Federal Reserve toward rate cuts is only further deepening the value-growth divide.
To add another lens on that gap: global stocks with high forecast sales expansion are now the priciest versus those with slower gains since the early 2000s, data compiled by JPMorgan Asset Management show.
That spread mirrors the yield curve, which is inverting everywhere from the U.S. to Germany and Britain. Just as economic fears are driving fixed-income investors to snap up long-end bonds for safety, stock pickers are favoring shares that promise increased earnings far into the future, rather than those that swing along with the macro cycle.
The extreme dislocations have befuddled strategists and investors alike, who are schooled in mean reversion. For some, the implication is that they need to be more selective with both growth and value.
Stapley’s fund focuses on companies with growth that beats expectations, rather than just those expected to deliver sky-high expansion rates. So LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP), rather than the online retailers, for instance, he said. Even within utilities and energy, sectors not traditionally associated with growth, he’s found attractive picks, such as Finland’s Neste Oyj and Verbund AG in Austria, which both tap into structural trends in renewable energy.
Another dislocation has been underscored in recent days by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS): Europe’s luxury shares, favored for their faster earnings growth in recent years, are outperforming other quality stocks, despite the weakness elsewhere among Chinese proxies, suggesting a potential reversal, strategists led by Matthew Garman wrote in a note. It’s an odd divergence because luxury depends heavily on its Chinese fans.
“European equity markets have been extremely bipolar,” the analysts said.
Others haven’t given up on value so quickly. No pain, no gain, as they say.
“With valuation spreads wider than at any point except for the few months after Lehman’s collapse, the upside potential is clearly there,”  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA strategists led by Andrew Lapthorne wrote in a note.

Both carmakers are under pressure to roll out zero-emission vehicles to meet stringent anti-pollution rules, but have struggled to maintain profit margins faced with the rising costs of making electric, connected and autonomous cars.
""Together, we have the opportunity to cater more effectively for customer needs by shortening development time and bringing vehicles and state-of-the-art technologies more rapidly to market,"" said BMW board member Klaus Froehlich.
BMW and Jaguar Land Rover said they will save costs through shared development, production planning and joint purchasing of electric car components. Both companies will produce electric drivetrains in their own manufacturing facilities, BMW said.
The BMW Jaguar Land Rover pact comes as rivals FiatChrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA) explore a $35 billion tie-up of the Italian-American and French carmaking groups.
Nick Rogers, Jaguar Land Rover's engineering director said, ""We've proven we can build world beating electric cars but now we need to scale the technology to support the next generation of Jaguar and Land Rover products.""
BMW was in talks with rival Daimler about developing electric car components but was also in discussions with Jaguar Land Rover, a company it once owned, to explore an alliance on engines. 
BMW already has a deal to supply an 8 cylinder engine to Jaguar Land Rover.
Carmakers are increasingly open to sharing electric car parts because the technology is expensive and because customers no longer buy a car based on what engine a vehicle has. 
""Carmakers are much less precious about sharing electric car technology because it is much harder to create product differentiation with electric car tech. They all accelerate fast, and everybody can do quality and ride and handling,"" according to Carl-Peter Forster a former chief executive of Tata Motors and a former BMW executive. 
Jaguar Land Rover is still run by former BMW managers, including Ralf Speth the company's chief executive who spent 20 years at BMW prior to joining JLR, and Wolfgang Ziebart, the engineer who oversaw Jaguar's iPace electric car program, who is a former head of research and development at BMW. 
Jaguar Land Rover said it would redouble efforts to cut costs after it posted a $4 billion loss earlier this year, hit by a downturn in demand for sports utility vehicles in China and a regulatory clampdown on diesel emissions.

BMW bought Britain's Rover Group, which included the Jaguar and Land Rover brands, for 800 million pounds in 1994 only to sell Jaguar Land Rover to Ford in March 2000 for $2.7 billion. In 2008 India's Tata Group bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for $2.3 billion.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>",Innogy eyes partnerships in potential U.S. offshore wind push,"By Tom Käckenhoff
ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Energy firm Innogy, in the process of being broken up by parent RWE and rival E.ON, could team up with oil majors to build offshore wind farms in the booming U.S. market, one of its board members said.
Projects off the U.S. coast have become a major target for utilities in Europe, by far the world's largest offshore market in terms of installed capacity, with several large players forming partnerships with Shell (LON:RDSa).
""Big oil firms are muscling into the market for renewable energy - because their previous business model is finite,"" Hans Buenting, Innogy's chief operating officer in charge of renewables, told Reuters.
He said Innogy was still weighing whether to participate in a wind lease auction in the New York Bight expected to take place in early 2020, adding the company was unlikely to go it alone.
""We would definitely seek partners to realize big offshore wind farms,"" Buenting said. ""North America is a huge market with a major appetite for energy.""
He said he was optimistic the group would meet its target of installing more than 500 megawatt of onshore wind power in the United States by the end of next year.
Through Innogy's breakup, which is part of an elaborate asset swap, parent RWE will end up owning the renewable activities of its subsidiary as well as of E.ON, turning it into Europe's third-largest green energy group and the world's No.5.
RWE in April said it wanted to spend several billions of euros to expand in the U.S. renewable sector in the next few years, where it will inherit a 3 gigawatt (GW) portfolio from its two German peers and seek to expand that to 8 GW.
Buenting said utilities and oil firms were a good match to build offshore wind farms, also because these assets require substantial capital, usually more than 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion) per ticket.
""The oil companies may have a lot of experience with platforms out at sea. But -- apart from Equinor -- they have not built offshore wind farms. That's where we come in,"" Buenting said.
Innogy in February said it had teamed up with Shell and Stiesdal Offshore Technologies A/S to test floating offshore wind turbines off the Norwegian coast in 2020.
Buenting said the technology is key because in many potential offshore markets, including Japan and California, the seabed drops steeply very fast.

Investing.com -- After some hesitation at the opening, Europe’s stock markets rose in early trading Wednesday, extending a relief rally that began on Tuesday when Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell hinted at a possible interest rate cut.
Powell had said in a speech on Tuesday that “as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” after voicing concern about the uncertainty created by recent trade- and immigration-related disputes with China and Mexico. There was no mention of the “patient” approach to policy-making that has dominated Powell’s recent communication.
At 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was up 0.8 points, or 0.2% at 373.74, near its highest in a week. The German Dax and the U.K. FTSE 100 were both up 0.2%.
Sentiment was also lifted by a surprising rise in IHS Markit’s service sector surveys around the continent. The Eurozone service purchasing managers index rose to 52.9 in May, better than the unchanged reading of 52.5 that was expected. National indexes weakened in France, Italy and Spain, but rose in Germany.
The biggest laggard was Italy’s FTSE MIB, down 0.1%, unsettled by a vote in the lower house of parliament that indirectly endorsed the populist coalition’s vague plans to issue a parallel currency in the form of short-dated government bonds, known as MiniBOTs. Italian press reports have also suggested that the EU has already made up its mind to open an “Excessive Deficit Procedure” against Italy for violating fiscal rules.
Banks are among the worst performers again on Wednesday, as the thought of Fed easing turns minds to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. Some analysts expect the ECB to push back the date for its first interest rate hike beyond the end of this year, which would prolong the intense pressure on bank margins from low rates.
 Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) were all lagging the local benchmark index, as were Italy’s  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Spain’s Santander (MC:SAN), BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Caixabank (MC:CABK). In the Netherlands, ING (AS:INGA) and ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) were at the bottom of the AEX."

Europe's main STOXX 600 index rose 0.1% after Wall Street and Asian markets had both drawn comfort from U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell's promise to act ""as appropriate"" to combat rising trade war risks.
Investors took that as a shift from the ""patient"" approach the Fed has taken in recent months, and a potential pointer for the European Central Bank's own policy update on Thursday, where low inflation is making the case for more stimulus.
All eyes, however, were on Italy, with a local newspaper reporting that Brussels will launch disciplinary procedures with a letter stating that fiscal policy lacks prudence and could expose the nation to a shock loss of market confidence.
Italy's FTSE MIB fell 0.6% and its banking index dropped 1.2%.

They bought a net 50.7 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) of the notes in May, a month that saw foreign holdings of Chinese bonds rise the most this year. That’s according to ChinaBond data going back to July 2014, which covers about 83% of the holdings. The Shanghai Clearing House typically publishes the remaining data by the 10th day of any given month.
Foreign inflows have been spurred by efforts to open up the debt market, such as the recent index inclusion, said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Banking Group. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index is adding securities issued by the government and its policy banks over a 20-month period that began April 1. Policy banks have been issuing bonds to fund loans offered to local governments for infrastructure spending.
China’s waiver of corporate tax on interest income made by overseas institutional investors in the bond market is also helping to stoke appetite, said Gordon Tsui, head of fixed income at Taikang Asset Management Co. in Hong Kong, adding that policy bank bonds outshine government bonds in terms of liquidity and returns.
The notes were the most popular in terms of monthly trading volume on Bond Connect, followed by negotiable certificates of deposit and Chinese government bonds. The U.S. overtook Hong Kong with the highest market share for accounts opened for Bond Connect, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing said last month.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Wednesday it will narrow the focus of its philanthropy toward three causes including affordable housing and will donate $1 billion to housing over the next few years.
The San Francisco-based bank named Brandee McHale to be the new head of the Wells Fargo Foundation which will be focused on addressing housing affordability, improving financial literacy and growing small businesses. McHale joins the bank from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and replaces Jon Campbell whose retirement was previously announced.
Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has ramped up its charitable giving following a profit boost from tax reform and in the wake of a wide-ranging sales scandal which has badly tarnished its reputation and weighed down its financial performance. 
Wells Fargo gave away $444 million to charitable causes last year, potentially positioning it as the top corporate cash giver in the country. The bank has pledged to donate 2% of its after-tax profit annually.
As part of its renewed focus on promoting home-ownership, Wells Fargo said it will donate $1 billion to organizations that support affordable housing through 2025 and launch a $20 million grant to encourage organizations to find new solutions for the lack of lack of low-to-moderate income housing options.
Wells Fargo has already donated over $460 million in down-payment assistance grants since 2012.
By focusing on housing, financial literacy and small businesses the bank will be donating more money toward causes that align closely with its business expertise, spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said. 

Wells Fargo will still support causes like arts, education and disaster relief through local projects but broader initiatives will be focused on the three primary areas.

SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd said on Wednesday it plans to cut production at a smartphone plant in China, as competition from domestic rivals squeezes its share of the world's biggest smartphone market to less than a paltry 1%.
The output reduction at the factory in the southern city of Huizhou comes just six months after Samsung said it would close its only other handset plant in China, in the northeastern city of Tianjin, in a move it said would enhance efficiency.
Samsung, the world's biggest smartphone maker, has seen its share of China's market shrink from about 20% in 2013, showed data from Strategy Analytics. The intervening years have seen a bout of anti-South Korean sentiment following a diplomatic spat, as well as a shift to local champions like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd at a time of deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations.
In the three months of 2019, however, Samsung's smartphone sales volume in China rose 40% versus the previous three months, helped strong promotion of premium models and cheaper mass-market handsets, showed an April report from Counterpoint Research.
Samsung's Wednesday statement followed a report by financial magazine Caixin saying the South Korean firm had offered voluntary redundancy for some employees at the Huizhou plant.
Samsung declined to detail the plant's capacity, staff numbers or degree of production cut when contacted by Reuters.
A spokesman in China told Reuters there would be ""some adjustment to production volume and staff"" based on the market situation. He declined to provide details.

The smartphone maker's share price was 1.0% higher in afternoon trade in Seoul. The KOSPI benchmark share price index was down 1.0%.

Call of Duty is a first-person shooter title and is one of the best-selling game franchises of all time, Bloomberg said. Tencent’s mobile version is currently in beta-testing and does not have a set-date for a full public roll-out.
The article added that Tencent is adapting popular titles for mobile and exporting them to overseas amid slowing growth and regulatory clampdowns in China.
It was reported previously that the Chinese government is banning violent content online and restricted screen time for youngsters.
Citing Vincent Gao, the overseas marketing director for the Tencent’s Timi Studio Group, the article said the company will hire more developers abroad to tap the overseas market.
“We’ve accumulated a lot of experience from developing mobile games in the past, and we think we have a pretty good chance of exporting our know-how,” Gao said in an interview. “In the future, we plan to introduce more categories with top-tier game developers.”"

(Reuters) - Digital Colony, a private equity firm backed by U.S. real estate investor Thomas Barrack, has raised $4.05 billion to invest in digital infrastructure, seeking to capitalize on new technologies such as 5G wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), according to people familiar with the matter. 
Buyout funds focusing on infrastructure investments have typically put their money in physical assets such as airports, bridges and toll roads. Digital Colony's fund illustrates how investors are now also seeking assets that support the digital economy driven by big data and artificial intelligence.
Mobile operators could invest around $480 billion globally between 2018 and 2020 to upgrade their networks, according to mobile communications industry body GSMA, underscoring the potential size of the investment opportunity.
Digital Colony had set a fundraising target of $3 billion and completed the fundraising at the maximum it could raise, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the details are private.
A spokeswoman for Digital Colony declined to comment. 
Digital Colony was set up in 2018 by Digital Bridge Holdings, which invests in communications infrastructure companies and is led by Marc Ganzi and Ben Jenkins, and Colony Capital, where Barack serves as executive chairman and CEO. Barrack is also a friend of U.S. President Donald Trump and was chairman of his 2017 inaugural committee.
Colony Capital fills two of the five members of the fund's investment committee, while Digital Bridge is responsible for Digital Colony's day-to-day investment activities, according to a person familiar with the fund's operations. Colony Capital supports the fund in regulatory, accounting and investor relations matters. 
Digital Colony has already committed around half its capital in five deals in North America and Europe, the sources said. Its largest deal so far was the roughly $8.2 billion acquisition of U.S. communications infrastructure provider Zayo Group in partnership with private equity firm EQT Partners. 
The fundraising by Digital Colony comes after U.S. infrastructure funds attracted a record $37 billion in 2018, according to data provider PitchBook, amid a dearth of federal and state infrastructure funding for many projects.

Neither PitchBook nor industry tracker Preqin have data on funds raised specifically for digital infrastructure.

The State Administration for Market Regulation said on its website the joint venture, Changan Ford, had set a minimum resale price for its cars in the Chinese municipality of Chongqing since 2013, in breach of the law. 
The joint venture did not provide evidence that this complied with the country's anti-monopoly law during the investigation, it said. 
""Ford Changan's actions deprived downstream dealers of their pricing autonomy, excluded and restricted competition within the brand, as well as damaged fair competition in the market and consumer's legal interests,"" it said. 
The fine is equivalent to 4% of the joint venture's sales in Chongqing last year, it added.
Ford and Changan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares in Changan Auto fell by over 5 percent after the news on Wednesday morning. 
The regulator's move comes as Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China - the second biggest market globally for the Dearborn, Michigan automaker - where its business began slumping in late 2017. 
Changan's president told Reuters in April that it expects sales at its Ford joint venture to rebound at the end of this year.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is rolling out a new wealth management product that combines automated portfolios with human advice, becoming the latest brokerage to seek to boost business by blending digital with personalized financial planning.
It comes as competitors are increasingly offering hybrid advice models, in response to questions about the potential profitability of stand-alone robo-advisers. 
The new service underscores how Bank of America is targeting downscale clients even as certain banks like  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have opted to reserve human advice for wealthy customers.
The Bank of America service, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor, builds on its robo adviser launched in 2017, adding the ability for clients to call or make an appointment with a bank employee to discuss their financial goals.
Providing online investors access to a human adviser is growing more popular in the wealth management industry as studies have shown many clients prefer a combination of digital and personal advice. 
Robo-advisers typically use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost exchange-traded-funds for clients with as little as a few hundred dollars to invest. 
Merrill Guided Investing, which uses recommendations from the wealth management chief investment office, requires a $20,000 minimum investment for access to a financial adviser who can offer help over the phone, online, or in person at a Bank of America branch. 
The tiered offering is meant to attract young families and others in the early stages of wealth accumulation, head of Consumer Banking & Investment Aron Levine told Reuters. 
Bank of America estimates that 85 percent of its clients who are eligible for its wealth management products hold investments elsewhere. 
""It's critical for us to have the right wealth management solution to meet the needs of investors at every age, and every stage of their wealth accumulation,"" said Andy Sieg, president of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.
Research firm Aite Group expects digital wealth management to continue growing quickly over the next few years but said in a May 2019 survey that large incumbents will grow faster than start-ups as they leverage their massive distribution networks.
With a 0.85% annual fee, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor is more costly than many competitors' hybrid financial planning services. 
Betterment, a start-up robo-adviser, charges an annual fee of 0.4 percent for its premium service and has a minimum investment of $100,000, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's Intuitive Investor charges 0.5% annually with a minimum investment of $10,000.

The decision came a day after official data showed on Tuesday the country's economy, Asia's fourth-largest, shrank more than initially estimated in the first quarter while core inflation slowed to a near 20-year low in May.
South Korea's gross domestic product contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in the January-March period from the previous quarter, the Bank of Korea's revised data showed, a notch faster than a 0.3% decline estimated earlier.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 09:47PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Promising thousands of U.S. jobs, Foxconn offshored 155 to Mexico","By Andy Sullivan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foxconn has offshored more than 150 U.S. jobs to Mexico, according to the Labor Department, even as it struggles to meet job-creation targets promised as part of a massive new factory championed by President Donald Trump.
The Taiwan-based electronics maker said in a filing in Indiana in November 2018 that it would lay off 155 workers at a computer factory outside Indianapolis, citing ""changes in our business and production objectives."" 
The Labor Department in February determined that the jobs were eliminated because the company had shifted some production to Mexico, records obtained by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request show. 
Foxconn officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company told the Indianapolis Business Journal in November that the plant in Plainfield, Indiana, was operated by a subsidiary firm and added that the layoffs would not affect other Foxconn-related companies.
The 155 jobs amount to a small fraction of Foxconn's global workforce, which stood at 988,000 at the end of 2017, according to its corporate responsibility report.
But the company is under the spotlight for having so far failed to meet job-creation targets at another facility in Wisconsin unveiled at a White House ceremony in 2017 and cited by Trump as proof that he was reviving American manufacturing.
Trump has threatened to punish companies that ship U.S. jobs to other countries and is currently pushing to impose tariffs on Mexican products due to an immigration dispute.
If completed, the 20-million-sq-foot research facility and liquid crystal display plant in Wisconsin would be the largest greenfield investment by a foreign-based company in U.S. history, employing 13,000 people.
But Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd., has said that it has been reconsidering its plans.
Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said in April that he wants to renegotiate the deal, secured with $4 billion in tax breaks, because Foxconn is not expected to reach its job creation goals for the state. Evers, a Democrat, inherited the project from his predecessor, Republican Scott Walker.
Foxconn has said it remains committed to its agreement, and company chairman Terry Gou met with Trump at the White House last month to discuss the project.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The $5.4 billion iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund, ticker INDA, lured more than $182 million last week, the most in more than four years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors also added the most since September to the $1.5 billion WisdomTree India Earnings Fund, or EPI, in the period through Friday.
“A lot of western investors really like having a conservative like Modi re-elected,” said Andy Wester, a senior investment analyst at Proficio Capital Partners. “He says all the right things to attract foreign investments.”
Modi was sworn in last Thursday for a second five-year term, making him the country’s first premier to be re-elected with a majority since 1984. INDA has risen for the last three weeks, the longest streak of gains since mid-March. India’s key equity indexes resumed their rally since Modi’s victory May 23, and closed at record highs on Monday.
Trouble Ahead
But investors could be arriving in India at just the wrong time. The U.S. plans to end the country’s designation as a developing nation from June 5, thereby eliminating an exception that allowed India to ship close to 2,000 products to the U.S. duty-free. The announcement last Friday adds to investor worries about the country’s slowing economic growth.
“What’s unsettling people now is trade tariffs appear to be becoming part of the policy toolkit,” said Kirk West, executive director for investments at Principal Global Investors, referring to India alongside President Donald Trump’s threat to use tariffs on Mexico.
To be sure, Trump’s move against India hasn’t rattled local investors. The reason: The net benefit to exporters for goods shipped under the Generalized System of Preferences program was about $260 million a year, according to the Federation of Indian Export Organisations. The impact would be minimal, the exporter body said.
On Monday, the rupee rallied to a one-month high, benchmark bond yields slid to a 18-month low and foreign investors bought a net 31 billion rupees of shares. Global funds have plowed more than $11 billion into Indian equities this year, the most in Asia after China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
India should outperform if markets return to normal in the second half of 2019, Principal’s West said. That would make an overweight position in the country look more appealing, compared with benchmark weight at the moment, he added.

Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker purchased 50,000 shares on the open market for $1.4 million, while President Robert Isom bought 15,000 for $416,250, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""These share purchases are not part of our compensation package. They were purchased solely because of the value we see in American today and over time,"" the executives said in a letter to American employees, which did not include the number of shares bought or at what price.
Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr and three other executives bought 5,000 shares each for about $138,800, the filings showed.
American, which has been hurt by the worldwide grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX planes, has been among the worst performing stocks this year in the airline industry.

The company's shares have fallen more than 9 percent so far in 2019, compared with an 8.8% rise in rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Inc's and 3.8% fall in United Continental Holding Inc's. The broader Dow Jones Transport Average index has risen about 10% during the same period.

1080,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 07:20PM ET</span>","BofA, Longtime Leader in Leveraged Loans, Warns of `Carnage'","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy is on solid footing except for one potential trouble spot, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan: leveraged loans -- a business the bank has dominated for a decade.
Problems aren’t yet emerging as the economic expansion continues and companies churn out profits, Moynihan said Tuesday at the Economic Club of New York. His own bank has repeatedly said it focuses on “responsible growth” and sticks to lending standards it’s had for years. Yet, leveraged finance threatens to become an issue in the broader market, he said.
“It’ll be ugly for those companies if the economy slows down and they can’t carry the debt and then restructure it, and then the usual carnage goes on,’’ Moynihan said. He also pointed to weakening terms in the wider market for riskier corporate lending.
Bank of America is sitting atop a ranking of leveraged-loan bookrunners for a 10th year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm has limited exposure to collateralized loan obligations, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said in January.
“We don’t see anything yet because the economy’s good, the companies are making money,” Moynihan said on Tuesday. “The issue that’s there is in the leveraged finance.”
Weaker Terms
Moody’s Investors Service said covenant quality for 2018’s last quarter was close to a record low, and the rating company sees no signs of improvement this year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month that the market looks a lot like the mortgage industry in the run-up to the subprime crisis. But U.S. regulators are watching closely this time around and the financial system is better shielded, Powell said.
The trend toward weaker terms is something “we should worry about,” Moynihan said on Tuesday. “We aren’t lowering standards because we tried that once and it didn’t work so well,” he said, to laughter in the audience.
The leveraged loan market is relatively small, meaning any shakeout is less likely to affect broader markets, according to Moynihan. The “real debate” belongs with the leveraged finance deals that are done outside of banks, Moynihan said -- echoing views of financial watchdogs who’ve expressed concerns that risk has shifted outside their purview.
Market Share
Bank of America was bookrunner on some $317 billion of leveraged loans this year, accounting for 10.8 percent of the market share, the Bloomberg data show, which captures all leveraged term loans and revolver facilities that are either new or have been amended.
That compares with $688 billion for last year, when Bank of America led the loan portion of Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group’s buyout of Thomson Reuters Corp.’s Refinitiv unit. Leveraged loan volumes this year have dipped amid a flight from riskier assets and as investors pull money from loan funds as a pause in rate hikes dims their allure.
The bank had shied away from riskier leveraged finance amid steeper competition from non-banks, Donofrio said in October. For M&A bankers, it sought to loosen reins a little after the bank got “a little too careful,” Moynihan said in December.
On the economy, Moynihan said economic activity and confidence remain strong among U.S. consumers and businesses. Even a recent slowdown in capital expenditures by businesses is consistent with a healthy economy, he said, adding that strong underlying economic data are more important indicators of growth than the possibility of a recession signaled by an inverted yield curve.
Powell on Tuesday suggested he was open to cutting interest rates, given fallout from disputes between the U.S. and its largest trading partners. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Monday that rates may need to decline to prop up inflation and counter economic risks from the trade war.
Moynihan doesn’t expect the Fed to lower interest rates this year, saying the ongoing trade battles aren’t enough to warrant recession concerns.
“Right now you don’t see the impacts,” he said. “I think the economy’s stronger than people think.”

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>","In Vietnam beer war, Heineken and Sabeco seek to take each other's turf","By Khanh Vu and Philip Blenkinsop
HANOI/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - In Vietnam, one of the world's largest and fastest-growing beer markets, new battle lines are being drawn as Heineken NV and local industry leader Sabeco hone their product offerings and build up marketing muscle.
The Dutch brewer in March launched a new version of its Heineken lager and is expanding its reach into suburban and rural areas with its mid-tier Tiger brand and lower-priced Larue and Bivina beers.
The push outside its stronghold of cities in the south has been driven by a doubling of Heineken's Vietnam sales force over the past three years and takes aim at territory commanded by Sabeco, a former state-owned brewer now controlled by Thai Beverage Pcl.
""We aim for the No. 1 position, not only in profit but also in volume,"" Heineken Vietnam managing director Leo Evers told Reuters in an interview.
Heineken, Vietnam's No. 2 brewer, declined to provide sales team numbers but said it had about 3,500 workers in the country.
Vietnam, Asia's third-largest beer consumer after China and Japan, has seen beer volumes climb by an average 6.6% for the last six years compared to an increase of just 0.2% for consumption globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. That growth plus its population of nearly 100 million and beer's 95% share of alcohol consumption make it an alluring market for brewers.
Heineken's Vietnam sales have jumped by double-digit percentages in the past four years and the country is its second-largest source of profit after Mexico. Analysts estimate Vietnam accounted for just over 10% of the 3.87 billion euros ($4.3 billion) Heineken made in operating income before one-off items last year.
Growth has been mainly driven by Tiger, a popular Asian lager it acquired when it took full ownership of Asia Pacific Breweries in 2012. Heineken's overall market share has since risen to 31% from 20% in 2013, at the expense of smaller brewers in the country, according to data analytics firm GlobalData.
Also seeking to shore up sales at the higher-end of the market, the Dutch brewer has launched Heineken Silver, the first country-specific variant of its namesake beer since Heineken Light was introduced in the United States in 2006.
Designed for local palates, the new beer is less bitter and has 4% alcohol content compared to 5% for standard Heineken. It is priced around 5% more than the standard version and both are sold at a premium of about 40% or more over low-end beers. The company said it was too soon to say whether it might market Heineken Silver outside Vietnam.
SAIGON SPECIAL 
Sabeco is in turn keen to forge into the mid-tier segment dominated by Tiger - a strategy it hopes will help lift its market share toward a goal of 50% from 40% now. But the brewer acknowledges it has work to do in differentiating its beers better.
Its brands, which include Saigon Lager, Saigon Export and 333 Export, are ""all over the place"", Neo Gim Siong Bennett told Reuters. One of three former Heineken executives brought in by ThaiBev, he became Sabeco's general director in August.
Since ThaiBev took control, the Saigon beer brand has become a shirt sponsor for English premier league soccer side Leicester City and the brewer has sought to ally itself to Vietnam's national soccer team, holding public screenings of matches including its final victory in the Southeast Asian championship.
It also organized a ""Pride of Vietnam"" gala with soccer and pop stars and held its largest ever promotion, an ""under-the-cap"" competition that gave away eight Mercedes cars.
By comparison, Heineken is a sponsor of the Champions League, Europe's premier soccer club competition and of Formula One, which will hold a Grand Prix in Vietnam for the first time next year.
Sabeco's main challenger to Tiger is Saigon Special, selling at about 30% more than its other products and rebranded in a green bottle. Sabeco parent ThaiBev used a similar strategy with its Chang beer in 2014, boosting the beer's market share in Thailand from below 30% to above 40% in two years.
""It's our flagship product,"" Neo said of Saigon Special. ""We have to be close to the number one, Tiger, or exceed it.""
While noting that taking on Heineken will not be easy, Neo said the company is becoming a more professional and efficient competitor.
But for the time being, at many restaurants in Hanoi, it is Tiger that has a clear foothold.
Nguyen Van Thanh, owner of the Loi Beo restaurant in Hanoi's Old Quarter, said Saigon Special sales rose during the ""under-the-cap"" promotion but had faded since. It now accounts for some 5% of his sales, compared to 50% for Tiger.
""Sabeco doesn't send their marketing staff to the restaurant to support sales like other brands,"" he said.

Sabeco said in an e-mailed statement that it has been carrying out programs to support customer sales and improving its product quality.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 06:40PM ET</span>",British money manager Woodford's star wanes over locked fund gate,"By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Famed for eschewing the tech bubble and sticking with tobacco and pharmaceuticals as others sold out, Neil Woodford's cult status among British money managers is on the ropes after some of his investors were unable to recoup their money.
When Woodford struck out on his own from Invesco and launched Woodford Investment Management, billions of pounds flowed into his funds, which often bucked conventional market wisdom and included riskier, less liquid investments.
His strategy mirrored a trend among institutional investors to increase their allocation to private equity as stock market valuations made listed companies look expensive.
But some of Woodford's listed and unlisted bets have not worked out, including British subprime lender Provident Financial and construction group Kier, prompting many investors to demand their money back.
After struggling to free up cash to pay investors looking to get their money out, the 59-year-old Woodford ""gated"" his LF Woodford Equity Income Fund to fresh withdrawals on Monday. From a high of 10.2 billion pounds in May 2017, the fund now holds around 3.7 billion pounds.
While private equity funds usually raise money before closing a fund for an agreed period lasting years, Woodford's was open-ended, meaning clients could demand their money daily - something that had already raised eyebrows.
Woodford said late Tuesday the suspension of the firm's Equity Income Fund would give him breathing space to shift focus.
""The suspension of dealing in the funds enables us to reduce our exposure and redeploy that capital into more liquid stocks in the FTSE 350 but primarily in the FTSE 100 that fit in with my core strategy"", he said in a video posted on the fund's website.
Morningstar analyst Peter Brunt said on Tuesday, ""The suspension underlines our concern over the illiquid nature of the portfolio,"" adding that the situation would ""take weeks rather than days to become fully resolved.""
The suspension is designed to allow Woodford time to move more of the fund's investments into more liquid assets, as well as protect those investors who wish to remain in the fund from any fire sale of assets to meet redemption requests.
As part of Woodford's attempt to restructure his holdings, a number of the Income Fund's unlisted holdings, including those in Atom Bank, Cell Medica and RateSetter, have been moved to his listed Woodford Patient Capital Trust.
Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services, said the gating was a ""very, very, very rare occurrence in the equity world"".
""We do see a small increase, around the edges, particularly in small and mid-cap funds, of them owning a couple of percent of illiquid or unquoted stocks, but nothing at this level.""
Kent County Council, which had asked to redeem its 263 million pound investment on Monday, was one of those denied its money. A council spokeswoman said on Tuesday it was having ""ongoing discussions"" with Woodford about getting its money back, describing the ""gating"" decision as ""disappointing"".
Woodford declined to specify how many other pension scheme investors had been locked in by the gating decision.
FIRE SALE
Britain's financial regulator is already considering toughening up the rules governing fund holdings in illiquid assets such as property or private equity after seven property funds totaling 18 billion pounds in assets under management froze in July 2016, shortly after the Brexit referendum.
The funds all reopened within weeks, but the Financial Conduct Authority launched a consultation late last year, with a final ruling - and possible new rules - expected in mid-2019.
""If you've got illiquid assets, you should have them in a closed-ended fund rather than an open-ended fund, because you don't want to be forced to sell these things if you have a few redemptions,"" Cliff Weight, director at ShareSoc, which represents individual investors, said.
Woodford had made off-market bets on companies a small but key part of the strategy for his Equity Income Fund, aiming to capture outsize returns as winners materialized.
Critics say he tended to keep its unlisted holdings close to the 10 percent regulatory limit for investments in unlisted assets that funds like Woodford's face.
Since its launch, the Income Fund has returned 11% against a 34% return for the FTSE All Share index. Over the last year it is down 8.3% against a gain of 2.6% for the index, data on the company's website showed.
Despite this performance, Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at fund supermarket  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said it would be unlikely to signal the end for Woodford.
""The last couple of years have been difficult... but his longer-term performance does remain compelling; he's up 121% over 10 years,"" said Wall at Hargreaves Lansdown, which has long been a major backer of Woodford's funds.

The preliminary investigation follows a complaint by an individual  Renault  (PA:RENA) shareholder against Dati, Ghosn and Bauer for corruption and misuse of company funds, the shareholder's lawyer Jean-Paul Baduel said in an interview. 
Payments to consultants made by the Netherlands-based joint venture have come under scrutiny after its ousted chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested and charged in Japan in December for alleged financial misconduct - charges which he denies.
A full independent audit of the Dutch-registered joint venture listed suspect payments made by Renault-Nissan under Ghosn of about 11 million euros. Renault SA's board is seeking to recover the funds jointly with Nissan Motor Co Ltd , as both companies fund the alliance.
Renault-Nissan hired Dati, 53, after she stepped down as justice minister in 2009 to stand for the European Parliament. She recently said she wanted to run for the Paris municipal election in 2020.
Security consultant Alain Bauer, who was paid by the holding company for his services in the wake of an earlier scandal over a 2011 espionage hoax at Renault, is also being probed.

1086,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 05:15PM ET</span>",Stock - Wall Street Surges on Powell's Promises,"Investing.com - Stocks surged Tuesday in their biggest one-day rally since January after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank stood ready to support the domestic economy if trade wars get too crazy.
The S&P 500 jumped 2.1% as 440-plus stocks in the index moved higher. The Nasdaq Composite soared 2.7%, and the Dow added 2.1% or 512 points. The indexes finished very close to their highs on the day.
Oil prices moved higher, as did grain prices on the news. Gold was steady.
The rally was helped by a modest decline in the U.S. dollar, which had been attracting money from investors looking for a safe haven from the volatility caused by the U.S.-China trade war and a tariff dispute with Mexico over immigration.
In a Chicago speech, the Fed chief said the central bank is ""closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective.""
The market took off on that news, with traders assuming Powell meant the Fed would cut interest rates if necessary.
The speech showed Powell that he has a bully pulpit indeed. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made a similar promise during the 2011 budget showdown between Congress and President Barack Obama, and markets promptly reversed a summer-long slump.
Ironically, Powell's speech pushed interest rates higher, as investors shed bonds for stocks. The key 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.119% from Monday's 2.081%.
There may discussion on rates going forward in the minutes when the Fed releases the minutes from its most recent meeting in Wednesday. The minutes from the April 30-May 1 meeting will be released at 11 a.m. ET (20:00 GMT). The Fed has been holding its key federal funds rate at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, despite complaints from President Trump.
The rally was the biggest since Jan. 4. That day, the Dow jumped 746 points, or 3.3%; the S&P 500 added 84 points, or 3.4%; and the Nasdaq soared 275 points, or 4.3%.
A total of 29 of the 30 Dow stocks gained on the day, led by  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Dow (NYSE:DOW) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) was the only Dow decliner.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) were the leaders among Nasdaq-100 stocks. All had been slammed recently by the trade disputes. Only three stocks in the index were lower.
The weak areas of the market overall were interest-rate sensitive stocks like real estate and utilities.
Tuesday's rally was so broad much of the buying decisions were computer-generated. For evidence, look at the uniformity of the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow gains. A trigger may have been that that the relative strength indexes of the major market indicators had fallen below 30 on Monday. An RSI under 30 is often a buy signal. In addition, the Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 ended the day no longer in correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from a recent peak.
S&P winners and losers
Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) were among the top performers in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.
 Nektar Therapeutics  (NASDAQ:NKTR), Veritas (NYSE:VTR) and HCP (NYSE:HCP) were among the biggest S&P 500 laggards."

LONDON (Reuters) - European Union preparations for a no-deal Brexit would split stock markets in Europe, although the damage could be reduced if Britain spelled out in advance its approach to trading, a top EU regulator said on Tuesday.
The EU angered market participants in March when it said that if there is a 'no-deal' Brexit, investors in the bloc would only be able to trade shares which are listed in continental Europe as well as 14 which have a listing in Britain.
London is the center for share trading in Europe, even for many non-UK shares, leaving EU asset managers facing a split pool of liquidity and less competitive prices.
After a spat with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) last week partly reversed its ""share trading obligation"" (STO) so that EU investors could still trade the 14 shares in London.
""Despite this adjustment ... the STO will fragment markets and, being a supporter of open markets, I regret that result very much,"" ESMA Chair Steven Maijoor told a Federation of European Exchanges conference in Dublin.
The STO, however, is due to Britain deciding to leave the bloc and the risk of a no-deal Brexit, Maijoor said.
Britain has said that it will not disclose its approach to securities trading until it is clear there is no deal.
CLARITY NEEDED
Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31 and with no deal in sight Maijoor sought to pile pressure on the FCA to change tack so that there would not be clashing requirements.
""Practically, this may mean that clarity will only be provided a few days, or perhaps even a few hours, ahead of a no-deal situation,"" Maijoor said.
""To allow market participants to properly prepare for the risk of a no-deal, I sincerely hope that this timing is reconsidered, and that clarity is provided well-ahead of the October Brexit date.""
Separately on Tuesday, market participants criticized what they saw as a push by the EU to build up its own capital market now that the region's largest, London, will be outside the bloc.
Bruce Savage, Deutsche Bank's head of regulatory affairs for listed derivatives, told a conference that STO was ""clearly being used as a tool to move liquidity from London"".

And asset managers are now making sure they have the ability to send share orders from their new EU hubs after Brexit to exchanges in the EU, Mark Hemsley, president of cross-border share trading platform Cboe Europe, said.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 03:16PM ET</span>",Automakers say Trump's threatened Mexico tariffs would cost billions,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to slap tariffs on Mexican-made goods could cost its major suppliers $1 billion, highlighting growing concern in the U.S. auto sector about the potential damage of a new front in the Trump administration's trade wars.
Trump has said he will apply tariffs of 5% on Mexican goods on June 10 if Mexico does not halt the flow of illegal immigration, largely from Central America, across the U.S.-Mexican border. Those tariffs would gradually rise to 25% by Oct. 1 if Mexico does not satisfy Trump’s demands. 
Faced with this threat, major automakers are also planning to delay some vehicle shipments from Mexico, people briefed on the plans told Reuters on Tuesday.
The shipment delays would affect vehicles with high inventory levels on U.S. dealer lots if the tariffs take effect as threatened. Automakers are trying to speed some critical parts shipments this week ahead of the Monday deadline.
Consultancy LMC Automotive said on Tuesday the industry could absorb a 5% percent tariff for a month, but that a sustained period at the 25% tariff level would have a potentially devastating impact on the auto industry and cut U.S. new vehicle sales by up to 1.5 million units annually.
""A prolonged period of tariffs on Mexican imports would likely push Mexico into recession and could also threaten a recession in the United States,"" LMC said.
In 2018, automakers sold 17.3 million new vehicles in the United States.
LMC said prices on models imported from Mexico could increase by an average of $8,500, while the average price of a vehicle sold in the U.S. market could rise by as much as $2,500-3,000 when parts for assembly in the United States are factored in. 
In an email seen by Reuters, Toyota Motor Corp told its U.S. dealers the duties could cost its major suppliers between $215 million and $1.07 billion.
The email, dated June 3, from Toyota's North American sales chief, Bob Carter, also told dealers that 65% of the Tacoma midsize pickup trucks the Japanese automaker plans to sell in the U.S. market in 2019 will be imported from its plant in Baja, Mexico.
On Tuesday Kevin Clark, chief executive at auto supplier Aptiv PLC told investors at a conference in Boston that a 5% tariff would cost it around $17 million per month. 
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Montreal on Tuesday, Steve Kiefer, senior vice president, global purchasing and supply chain at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), declined to discuss how much tariffs could cost but said ""the single biggest problem we have is the uncertainty with tariffs.""
""Right now, we’re asking all of our suppliers to be calm and not do anything drastic,"" Kiefer said. 
Automakers are pressing Republican senators on Capitol Hill to contact the White House to try to convince the president not to move ahead with the tariffs, the people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday there was ""not much support"" among his fellow Republicans for the tariffs.

Ghosn is facing financial misconduct charges, which he denies. He was freed in April from jail in Japan on a $4.5 million bail.
Renault's board members were asking the group's representatives to liaise with counterparts at Nissan to explore legal action to recover sums paid for by the Dutch jointly-owned subsidiary Renault-Nissan BV, the board said in a statement after reviewing results of a joint audit mission with Nissan.
The suspect expenses amount to about 11 million euros, which include air travel fees, gifts to non-profit organizations and ""certain other expenses incurred for Mr. Ghosn,"" Renault's board said. 
Ghosn has been indicted four times in Japan, twice on charges that he failed to disclose a portion of his earnings to authorities and twice for aggravated breach of trust.
The latter included an allegation that he received $5 million in payments from a Nissan dealership in Oman after authorizing incentive payments to it from Nissan.
Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing ""backstabbing"" former colleagues of conspiring to oust him as Nissan chairman.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 02:47PM ET</span>","Uber's IPO underwriters recommend buying, estimate deep losses","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Underwriters of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Technologies' initial public offering on Tuesday overwhelmingly recommended the company's shares, even as they estimated deeper losses than previously expected for the ride-hailing service this year.
With the end of a quiet period related to Uber's disastrous IPO last month, at least 16 banks involved in the public listing initiated analyst coverage of the company, all of them positive except for Citi's ""neutral"" rating.
""Uber is a transformational company that should benefit from secular shifts to the sharing economy (Rides), time saving services (Eats), and more efficient marketplace evolution (Freight),"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Justin Post wrote in his report, setting a $53 price target.
Uber's stock was up 2.4% at $42.22 in afternoon trading, but the shares have dropped 6% from the price set in the May 9 IPO amid investor worries over whether the company is able to make money.
About $5 billion of Uber’s stock market value has evaporated since the hotly anticipated IPO, making that event a major disappointment for the company, its shareholders and underwriters.
""We see Uber as the most attractive Internet IPO since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and believe that concerns related to Uber's profitability outlook pose less risk than Facebook's transition to mobile at that time,"" wrote Deutsche analyst Lloyd Walmsley, rating it a ""buy.""
Even as they recommended buying Uber's stock, the analysts initiating coverage on Tuesday estimated deeper losses for the company than the analysts who previously started coverage.
Analysts, on average, now expect Uber to lose more than $6 billion in 2019, according to Refinitiv data. On Monday, the average estimate - provided by analysts not involved in the IPO - was a loss of $4.4 billion in 2019.
William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart, rating Uber ""outperform"" in part on the basis of its breadth of operations, estimated it will lose $9.6 billion this year.
The average estimate for Uber's second-quarter loss per share is now $2.34, compared to $1.23 last week, according to Refinitiv.
At least 19 analysts now recommend buying Uber's stock, while five analysts are neutral and none recommend selling, according to Refinitiv.
Citi analyst Mark May said opportunities remained in transportation services, but he was cautious about competition, regulatory pushback and uncertainty around the future of autonomous vehicles.
Uber was the biggest of a group of Silicon Valley startups that have gone public this year against the backdrop of a global stock market selloff sparked by the trade battle between the United States and China. The San Francisco-based company also faces increased regulation in several countries and wage battles with its drivers.
The company said on Tuesday the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is auditing its taxes for 2013 and 2014 and that it expects unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next year by at least $141 million.
While some analysts see Uber eventually launching fleets of self-driving cars and compare it to Amazon’s ability to spread into new markets, others are focused on the company’s billions of dollars in losses and the threat of increased competition.
(GRAPHIC-Uber revenue link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WF6AS3).
Analysts, on average, now see Uber's revenue in 2019 at $13.98 billion, down from an average 2019 estimate of $14.01 billion last week.

With Tuesday's stock gain, Uber's shares are trading at 5.1 times expected 2019 revenue, the same valuation as smaller rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), which remains down 18% from its IPO in March.

SHERMAN, Texas (Reuters) - A former engineering manager used Huawei Technologies Co Ltd trade secrets and lured away 24 of its employees to improperly build his startup company, a lawyer for the Chinese telecommunications firm told a Texas jury on Tuesday. 
The trade secrets trial, which has become a flashpoint in allegations by the United States government that Huawei gear is a threat to U.S. security, began with the Huawei lawyer showing jurors that spelling errors in its internal documents were repeated in proposals a former manager used to start chip-maker CNEX Labs Inc three days after leaving Huawei.
Huawei sued former manager Ronnie Huang and his CNEX seeking at least $85.7 million in damages and rights to its memory-control technology. 
Huang, who countersued Huawei and denies the company's allegations, was scheduled to testify on Tuesday. 
In addition to showing jurors the documents' common misspellings, Huawei lawyer Michael Wexler played excerpts of a video deposition in which another former employee admitted to copying 5,760 files from his work computer before leaving Huawei to join CNEX. 
""Think of the spelling mistakes as DNA,"" Wexler said in his opening statement to an eight-person jury in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. ""Stealing technology is wrong."" 
But a CNEX attorney rejected the allegations and said the spelling errors were identical because the same person, Huang, wrote all the documents. Neither Huang nor CNEX asked for or were aware its recruit copied files, which were largely personal information, said CNEX attorney Deron Dacus. 
""The things that Huawei claims are trade secrets are not,"" Dacus said in his opening statement, describing the lawsuit as ""bullying and intimidation.""
CNEX develops chips that speed up data storage on cloud computing networks. The countersuit by CNEX and Huang sought $24.5 million in damages from Huawei over development delays and lost future revenue.
Huang started CNEX in 2013 and has raised more than $100 million from backers including arms of Dell Technologies and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
The trial promises to keep Huawei in the spotlight amid a U.S. government blacklisting of the company's telecommunications gear and pressure on U.S. allies not to buy its equipment. China last week retaliated against the ban, saying it planned to draft its own list of foreign companies and people it considers ""unreliable"" for harming Chinese companies. 

Judge Amos Mazzant, who is hearing the case, separately is overseeing Huawei's bid to overturn the Trump administration's ban on its sales to government agencies and contractors.

United States Steel (NYSE:X) was up 4.8%, shrugging off the downgrade amid a broader-based rally in markets as expectation for an interest-rate cut after Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said the central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to support the domestic economy.
Goldman Sachs downgraded U.S. Steel to sell from neutral. The investment house also cut its price target on the stock to $11 from $17, warning lower steel prices will lead to further earnings cuts and possibly hurt the company's bloated balance sheet. U.S. Steel hit a 52-week low of $11.67 on Friday. The Goldman downgrade is fairly aggressive. The consensus target of analysts polled by Investing.com is still $18.15.
The bank also cut its price targets on a slew of the other names in the sector including  Steel Dynamics  (NASDAQ:STLD), AK Steel (NYSE:AKS),  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE),  Schnitzer Steel  (NASDAQ:SCHN) and Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE:RS).
""Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016, and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the U.S. market,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn.
President Donald Trump said last month the U.S. would lift steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada and Mexico. But also left the door open to reimpose the tariffs if the two nations failed to curb any surge of metals imports beyond historical levels.
As part of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trio agreed to more closely monitor where the metals imported into North American originate from, with China accused of flooding the market with cheap metals."

1103,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",Trump Dismisses GOP Dissent Over Mexico Tariffs as ‘Foolish’,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump scoffed at the possibility that Senate Republicans would try to block his plan to impose a tariff on Mexico over concerns about the potential economic fallout.
“I don’t think they will do that,” he said Tuesday at a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May in London. “I think if they do, it’s foolish. There’s nothing more important than borders.”
GOP lawmakers are considering whether to revive a resolution of disapproval against the national emergency declaration that underpins Trump’s justification for the tariffs, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person asked not to be identified in order to discuss sensitive deliberations.
Such an action could also stop the president from spending billions on a border wall without congressional approval, complicating any decision by congressional Republicans.
Congress earlier this year passed a similar resolution, but the House didn’t have enough votes to override a presidential veto. In dismissing the possibility of a rebuke by Congress on Tuesday, Trump cited his “tremendous” support within the GOP.
The political calculation for congressional Republicans could be different this time. Many lawmakers in Trump’s party are concerned about the economic impact of his Mexico tariffs, which will begin as a 5% duty on all of the country’s imports as of June 10 unless the country’s government takes unspecified steps to curb illegal migration to the U.S.
The tariff could rise to as high as 25% by October unless Mexico takes sufficient action, as judged by the president.
Trump left open the possibility that negotiations with Mexico could forestall imposition of the duties “but I think it’s more likely that the tariffs go on.”
‘Dug-In’
Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he spoke with Trump Sunday about the Mexico tariffs and described him as “dug-in.”
“He’s as serious as four heart attacks and a stroke,” Kennedy told reporters at the Capitol. “A 5% tariff isn’t going to break the bank. A 25% tariff is a different story, but we are a long way from there.”
Discussions in Congress about a resolution of disapproval occurred as top GOP senators warned the administration that Congress could reclaim its tariff powers or hold up a new North American free-trade deal if the White House carries out its threat to impose the levies. It would take a critical mass of Republicans in the House and Senate publicly supporting a legislative rebellion to convince Trump to reverse course before the tariffs are set to begin.
Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, suggested he won’t begin consideration of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement if the Mexico tariffs are put in place. Grassley used a similar threat to convince the White House to drop tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada earlier this year.
“It’s the same trouble that we had with the aluminum and steel tariffs. They have to come off before we can take it up here” he said of the USMCA.
Veto Override
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been working with her members and the Trump administration on the North American trade deal to address provisions on labor, the environment and enforcement that Democrats would like to strengthen. While Trump’s surprise tariff threat has thrown Mexico’s enthusiasm for the deal into doubt, Democrats say they still want to improve and pass the agreement.
“With respect to the USMCA we want to get to yes,” Hakeem Jeffries, the New York representative who chairs the Democratic Caucus, said Tuesday. Jeffries said Trump’s “tariff policy is erratic,” and the House will be watching the Republican senators to see how far they’re willing to go to oppose it.
Any measure that could be a check on Trump’s trade policy would need a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override a veto. That means roughly 20 Republican senators and 55 Republican representatives would have to stand up to the president -- and their constituents who support him.
The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, said Congress could eventually act to curb emergency presidential trade powers if Trump carries out his threat to increase tariffs to 25% by October.
“I suspect Congress is going to want to be heard from, for sure,” Thune said. “We have a lot of our members who don’t like where this is headed, about what it means for the economy generally and don’t see it as a path to solve immigration issues.”
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy expressed hope that the situation won’t get to the point of Congress being compelled to act.
""I believe that at the end of the day we will get to a solution that solves our problem,” he said at the Capitol.
Trade Authority
The reactions from members of Trump’s own party show just how far he has pushed Republicans who’ve traditionally supported free trade. The disagreement within the GOP is not just ideological -- there could be a political price to pay as well, especially in states where much of the economy depends on trade with neighboring countries.
Senator Mike Rounds, also from South Dakota, said that his state’s corn farmers are poised to feel the brunt of any Mexican retaliation.
“I think it is very fair to say that Congress should take a look at the authority they have sent to the executive branch, regardless of who the president is,” Rounds said. He added that South Dakotans want Trump to succeed but may need supplemental assistance if they are on the “tip of the spear” in fighting illegal immigration.
Texas Senator John Cornyn said that any legislation curbing Trump’s powers would be difficult given his veto power.
“The challenges legislatively on this are obvious,” Cornyn said. “The president of the United States is going to have a say, so the best way forward is dialogue.”
Pushing Republicans
House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Earl Blumenauer said the House is also considering what action could get the support necessary to stop Trump’s Mexico tariffs. He said members of his committee will meet with House leadership Tuesday to discuss their options.
“There are a lot of members concerned that Trump has usurped this authority,” Blumenauer said.
Only a few Republicans have expressed any level of support for Trump’s move against Mexico, and frustration with the new tariffs was evident throughout a GOP caucus meeting on Monday.
Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas called the tariffs “extremely counterproductive” and Colorado Senator Cory Gardner said they are “a bad idea, plain and simple.”
Republican senators have asked the administration for a briefing on the strategy. One specific concern is what Mexico must do to avoid the tariffs taking effect and scaling up.
“The market doesn’t like uncertainty and these kind of things create uncertainty, which is why you have seen the kind of volatility in the markets,” Thune said.

1104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Poised to Follow Fed With Rate Cuts, Traders Bet","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada is likely to join the U.S. Federal Reserve with an interest rate cut this year to deal with the fallout from rising trade tensions, according to trading in the swaps market.
Investors are betting Canadian policy makers will follow an expected U.S. rate cut in September. The chances of a Bank of Canada match at the Oct. 30 meeting jumped above 50% Tuesday, up from about 25% last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The market is implying 20 basis points of easing over the next six months. The odds of a cut soared after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican products to stem illegal immigration, raising concerns about the ratification of the revised North America Free Trade Agreement.
Traders are increasing their bets on a rate cut even as economic data signal the economy is showing signs of pulling out of a first-quarter slowdown. The median consensus of analysts expect that the benchmark rate will remain unchanged this year at 1.75%.
“The data for Canada is unfolding in a manner about as expected, but the medium-term outlook has definitely been impacted by trade/tariff developments of late,” said Mark Chandler, head of fixed income research at Royal Bank of Canada, which sees the central bank on hold through 2020. “Most of the fear surrounds the potential impact on U.S. factory sector. Analysts have not fully incorporated this into their forecasts I believe because of a belief that the tariffs may yet be avoided.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Tuesday an openness to cut interest rates if necessary, pledging to keep a close watch on fallout from a deepening set of disputes between the U.S. and its largest trading partners. Investors have aggressively increased bets the Fed will cut interest rates this year after Trump widened ongoing trade tensions with the new Mexico threat.
In the U.S., swap traders assign an 89% chance of the Fed cutting rates as soon as September, Bloomberg data show. Investors may get fresh signals on rates this weekend when finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 economies meet in Japan.
“We should get more clarity on both Mexico and China, at the G-20,” said Chandler. If over the coming weeks there is “no improvement, you might see more analysts believing that rate cuts in the U.S. -and maybe Canada- are more likely.”
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said as recently as last month he still believes interest rates are poised to continue rising once headwinds to growth dissipate. “The natural tendency is for interest rates to still go up a bit,” Poloz said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg, adding he didn't yet know the size or the timing of any increases."

Speaking at an investor conference in Boston, company executives said Aptiv imports products worth a little over $3 billion a year from Mexico. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico in a bid to curb illegal immigration - a move that analysts say could cost automakers and suppliers as much as $23 billion.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Climate scientists partner with McKinsey to push companies to self-regulate,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading climate science institute Woods Hole Research Center is taking its first run at directly influencing corporate behavior on climate change through a collaboration with global consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Co, Woods Hole told Reuters. 
To fight global warming, the Woods Hole Research Center historically has worked with governments, the United Nations and investor groups concerned about climate change. But the rolling back of environmental regulations by the Trump administration, and investor-led campaigns to change how companies behave, have had mixed success.
To further its aim, the Falmouth, Mass.-based research center has paired up with the consulting firm and its think tank, McKinsey Global Institute, to take the fight straight to the C-suite. 
""We've got to find new partners because the government is insufficient,"" said Spencer Glendon, senior fellow at Woods Hole and the liaison with McKinsey. 
Terms of the deal are not yet public, but it calls for Woods Hole to examine the effects of climate change on companies. That would afford Woods Hole access to McKinsey's network of corporate leaders, and Glendon said they hope to use that access to convince companies to advocate for environmental regulation and to regulate themselves. 
In return, Woods Hole's research could give McKinsey a lead into the business of helping companies adapt to a new reality ushered in by climate change - whether it be moving headquarters, planning for a heavy carbon tax or reaching a limit on the amount of insurance the U.S. government can offer.
""This year, the McKinsey Global Institute launched a major initiative to better understand the specific risks and costs of physical climate change,"" a McKinsey spokesperson said. ""The Woods Hole Research Center is contributing its expertise and geospatial data to this endeavor.""
Woods Hole still advocates for governmental regulation. It continues to work with international organizations, which has included contributing to the five primary U.N. climate assessment reports. 
Some experts expressed doubts that company-led change would prove sufficient. 
""Private voluntary governance initiatives tend to work in very narrow circumstances. They work when you've got a market actor that's very susceptible to direct consumer perceptions,"" said Douglas Kysar, professor at Yale Law School, citing companies with educated, affluent customers who make decisions based on things like fair-trade certification. 
That criticism has also been leveled at investor campaigns that push companies to meet standards known as ESG - environmental, social and governance criteria. Not only are standards often inadequate, but pressure from investors does not always produce results. 
Groups like Climate Action 100+, a consortium of investors with over $33 trillion under management, last year successfully pushed Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to set carbon emissions targets. But their efforts to persuade shareholders at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) to accept a series of green proposals recently failed, as did a similar slate of proposals at  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
Investor pressure remains a useful way to influence corporate behavior, said Glendon, who has worked as an adviser to Wellington Management and the California Public Employees' Retirement System on incorporating climate concerns into their investment strategies. Approaching chief executives directly is simply another tool in their arsenal.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",London must not become offshore center post Brexit: CFTC chair,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Policymakers should ""tether"" London to the European Union to avoid isolating the region's largest financial hub, harming the euro zone economy and spawning an offshore financial center, the head of the U.S. derivatives watchdog said. 
""It is clear that London is shedding, and will continue to shed, a not insignificant amount of its financial service offerings and specialties to other European financial centers as a result of Brexit,"" Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said on Tuesday.
Banks, insurers and asset managers using London as a gateway to investors across the EU have opened hubs in Dublin, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Luxembourg to maintain customer links.
""Despite this, I believe that London will remain one of the world's major financial centers and Europe's largest,"" Giancarlo said in a speech in London's financial district.
EU policymakers want to see chunks of clearing in euro-denominated transactions shifted from London to Frankfurt where they can be closely scrutinized, in a proposed move Giancarlo called ""Fortress Europe"".
Giancarlo said it was not in the EU's interests to restrict financial activities to the euro zone as the bloc needs the type of access to global capital that no EU city was capable of assembling any time soon.
""In short, the EU needs the City of London, and the City of London needs the EU. I expect that sooner or later that is going to become apparent to the political classes on both sides of the Channel,"" said Giancarlo, who is due to step down shortly.
Even without Brexit, there would be some ""rebalancing"" between London and other European financial centers as the EU builds a capital markets union, he said.
London also needs the EU to remain an integral part of the European economy and avoid becoming an ""offshore"" financial center, Giancarlo added.
Brussels has said that financial firms in Britain face a narrow form of access to the EU available to other ""third"" countries like the United States and Japan, which falls far short of the unfettered access enjoyed at present.
Giancarlo said that keeping London ""tethered"" to Europe after Brexit should be a starting point for policymakers, otherwise activities will flow from Britain to New York and Asia, and Europe's economy would suffer.
Brussels rejected a broad two-way form of ""mutual recognition"" access proposed by Britain's financial sector and Giancarlo said industry needed to step up.
""Leaders of business and finance from both sides of the Channel need to get together and persuasively explain to their respective political representatives why the EU and the City need each other,"" Giancarlo said.

""It is time to pull out a fresh sheet of paper and draw up the right arrangement between the EU and a post-Brexit London.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock indexes rallied on Tuesday as U.S. tech shares bounced back from the previous day's selloff and investors weighed the possibility of a U.S. interest rate cut, while yields on U.S. Treasuries rose.
Longer-dated Treasury yields climbed back from their lowest since September 2017.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank will respond ""as appropriate"" to the risks posed by a global trade war and other recent developments.
His remarks followed St. Louis Fed President James Bullard's comments late on Monday that a rate cut ""may be warranted soon.""
Strategists said the comments suggested the Fed is considering its options.
Equity ""investors are taking comfort in what appears to be a Fed that is contemplating cutting rates if the economy materially slows down,"" said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group in New York.
In a brief statement included as part of a speech on broader monetary policy issues, Powell said the Fed was ""closely monitoring the implications"" of ongoing trade disputes. 
The United States' trade war with China and other countries has been escalating in recent weeks, increasing market uncertainty and worries about the global economy for investors.
U.S. technology stocks bounced back from Tuesday's sharp selloff, driven by worries about a clamp-down on the world's internet and social media giants. The Nasdaq also confirmed a correction at the day's close, falling more than 10% from its May 3 record high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 424.07 points, or 1.71%, to 25,243.85, the S&P 500 gained 46.15 points, or 1.68%, to 2,790.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 151.06 points, or 2.06%, to 7,484.08.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.59% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.13%.
In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose 5.70 basis points to 2.138% after hitting 2.061% on Monday, their lowest since September 2017.
Jitters over the global economy have pushed investors into top-rated government bonds and other safety plays in recent weeks.
The dollar was near steady after Powell's comments.
The dollar index rose 0.07%, with the euro up 0.08% to $1.1249.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.11% versus the greenback at 108.20 per dollar.
The rally in stocks helped oil prices, and gold prices eased off of a three-month peak. 

U.S. crude rose 0.28% to $53.40 per barrel. Brent crude rose 0.7 percent to $61.71. Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $1,323.31 an ounce.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top trading exchanges said on Tuesday they would not rush into introducing ""speed bumps"" to slow down high-technology trading and ensure a more level playing field with traditional market participants.
Last month, Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) was given permission from U.S. regulators to introduce the first ""speed bump - or Passive Order Protection feature - in the U.S. futures markets. That followed complaints from some market players that hi-tech traders had an unfair speed advantage forcing them to spend large sums on technology.
Thomas Book, chief executive of Germany's Eurex exchange, said on Tuesday it had launched a six-month pilot scheme.
""I don't like the term speed bump,"" Book told the annual IDX derivatives industry conference in London.
The pilot was not about discriminating in favor or against certain market users or about slowing down trading, he said, adding that high-speed traders played a useful role in markets.
""We are about fairness in price discovery,"" Book said, referring to the creation of prices when buy and sell orders are matched.
William Knottenbelt, senior managing director, international, at CME, told the conference it was looking at a variety of measures.
""In looking at those, we have not come up with any clear measure that shows it helps the market. At this moment in time it's not on the table,"" Knottenbelt said.
ICE will initially apply a three millisecond pause to certain incoming orders for its Gold Daily and Silver Daily futures.
Stuart Williams (NYSE:WMB), president of ICE Futures Europe, said the exchange was trying to encourage more orders onto markets.
""We will see how that plays out and see if there are any unintended consequences,"" Williams said.

Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor said the funds would be used to expand the company's Michigan plant, which was bought as part of its takeover of Enfamil infant formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition company for about $18 billion in 2017. He gave no further details.
Kapoor made his remarks at a breakfast event at St James' Palace, the Queen's official residence, attended by U.S. President Donald Trump and high level executives from 10 U.S. and British businesses.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Trust Bank, set up to take over bad assets from lenders rescued by the state, needs to add more than $6 billion to its reserves to meet the central bank's requirements, Trust's earning report showed.
The report, which Reuters confirmed with the bank itself and banking sector analysts, showed the central bank examined Trust Bank's assets and provisions in the second half of 2018.
The central bank ruled that Trust Bank needs to top up its reserves with 400 billion rubles ($6.13 billion), according to figures in the Trust Bank earnings report published in late April.
Trust Bank's spokeswoman said the bank had in advance expected to need in 400 billion rubles to top up reserves.
Trust's negative capital, or by how much its liabilities exceed assets, has exceeded 1.28 trillion rubles as of May 1 and is now set to rise further after Trust sets aside the extra funds for its reserves.
Trust has no plans to ask the central bank, which bailed it out in 2017, for additional funds, the bank's spokeswoman said.
The central bank, which typically does not comment on banks that are still operating, did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.
The central bank launched its banking sector clean-up program in 2013 and has so far spent up to $50 billion on saving major banks in the past few years, while shutting down dozens of their smaller rivals.
The central bank had hoped to recover around 20% of the value of assets that were transferred to Trust Bank, also known as the bad bank, from lenders that the regulator had bailed out, including Otkritie and B&N.
These assets included a wide range of items, from non-performing loans to collateral against real estate, and from stakes in oil companies to shopping malls.

1129,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 09:51AM ET</span>",FCA-Renault tie-up clears French hurdles before board meeting: sources,"By Arno Schuetze and Laurence Frost
FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler has resolved key differences with France over its proposed merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA), three sources told Reuters on Tuesday, as the French carmaker's board met to review the $35 billion tie-up plan.
The compromise on French government influence over a combined FCA-Renault may clear the way for Renault directors to approve a framework agreement and begin the long process of a full merger, unless new issues surface at their meeting.
France, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15% stake, had been pressing for its own guaranteed seat on the new board and an effective veto on future CEO appointments.
But after late-night talks with John Elkann, the Italian-American carmaker's chairman, officials approved a compromise giving the French government one of four board seats allocated to Renault, balanced by four FCA appointees, the sources said.
Renault would also cede one of its two seats on a four-member CEO appointment committee to the French state, they said.
With Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, 66, set to become FCA-Renault's first operational chief under Elkann's chairmanship, the move gives France a formal say on the appointment of his successor.
Renault, FCA and the French government, which have been locked in talks over the offer pitched by FCA to create the world's third-biggest carmaker, declined comment.
The proposal would see both carmakers acquired by a listed Dutch holding company owned 50-50 by current FCA and Renault shareholders, after payment of a 2.5 billion euro ($2.8 billion) special dividend to FCA shareholders.
Responding to criticism from some analysts and French industry leaders that the deal undervalued Renault and its 43.4% stake in Nissan, Paris pushed for better terms.
This bore fruit over the weekend, as FCA discussed concessions including a dividend to Renault shareholders, stronger French job guarantees and a Paris-based regional headquarters for the combined group.
JOB UNDERTAKINGS
FCA and Renault shares rose on the news of the board compromise, and were up 4.5 percent and 5.2 percent respectively at 1240 GMT.
""The market has been worried that too much could be given away, and there's a price to be paid for execution risk,"" a source close to the negotiations said. ""The more our hands are tied the harder it is to achieve meaningful synergies.""
The possible dividend was still being discussed shortly before the Renault board convened at 1300 GMT, people close to the talks said. Firm undertakings on French jobs and sites as well as the Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters site are likely to be worked out later in the process, they added.
The FCA-Renault talks are playing out amid a French public outcry over 1,044 layoffs at a  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) site in Belfort, eastern France - where the U.S. group had promised to safeguard jobs on acquiring  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in 2015.
""After the mess with GE, the government was determined to get binding agreements on jobs,"" a source close to Renault said. ""And they will. The state has made itself heard.""
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has also stressed that the FCA-Renault deal must preserve Renault's existing alliance with Nissan - already strained by the arrest and ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.
Nissan's two Renault board representatives are expected to abstain in any vote on Tuesday, sources at both companies said, a day after the Japanese carmaker's CEO Hiroto Saikawa warned that the proposed merger would trigger a ""fundamental review"" of its relationship with Renault.
Achieving 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in FCA-Renault synergies would depend partly on access to technology jointly owned by Nissan, executives acknowledge.
A Renault board decision to approve the merger proposal, subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, would begin a process expected to last well into 2020. 
FCA and Renault would aim to put the tie-up to shareholder votes in the first quarter, one source close to the talks said.

Cook, speaking in an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, said Apple controlled a moderate share of the market but was not too big, and disagreed with calls from some U.S. politicians that the company be broken up.
""With size, I think scrutiny is fair. I think we should be scrutinized,"" he said. But, he added, ""I don't think anybody reasonable is gonna come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly.""

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>",Uber says IRS probing its 2013-14 tax returns,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is auditing Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's taxes for 2013 and 2014 and the ride-hailing company expects unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced within the next year by at least $141 million.
In its full quarterly report on Tuesday, Uber said various state and foreign tax authorities were also looking into its taxes and that it was currently unable to put a definite timeline or estimate on the overall adjustments that might result.
The $141 million amount related only to its transfer pricing positions, which refers to the common multinational practice of charging for services between wholly-owned businesses in different countries or jurisdictions to reduce the tax it pays. 
Industry experts characterize transfer pricing as a relatively risky strategy, which typically is among multinationals' top tax concerns and has been used by authorities in the past to go after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of the audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months,"" the company said.
Uber did not respond to a request for additional information.
The announcement came on a day when at least 11 of the brokerages whose underwriting arms backed Uber's Wall Street debut last month weighed in with ""buy"" recommendations on the company's shares as a statutory embargo lifted.
Also helped by a recovery for Wall Street from a technology sector sell-off on Monday, Uber shares gained almost 3 percent in trading before the bell. 
Uber's shares have struggled since its launch on May 10. Tuesday's pre-market moves took them above their closing price on the first day of trading, but they remain below the $45 at which the original offer was priced by its underwriters.
Still, the shares have outperformed rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), which have fallen by a third in value since its own debt in March, and analysts from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the stock remained the best internet IPO for investors since Facebook's launch in 2012.

In its first quarterly report as a public company last week, Uber reported a $1 billion loss as it spent heavily to build up its food delivery and freight businesses.
But many of the analysts covering the stock on Tuesday said they believed it had the scale and time to develop into another powerful U.S. global tech player. 
""Uber should trade at a premium to LYFT given Uber's larger global scale and reach, cross product growth opportunity and larger ability for long-term leverage,"" said analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 

""It is still in the early innings in its core and emerging opportunities.""

1136,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Two Fed Cuts This Year May Be Going Bit Too Far for Some Traders,"(Bloomberg) -- Some investors are betting that the markets may have gone overboard in pricing two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve by year-end.
Soon after a five-day rally in U.S. Treasuries stalled, one trader paid $4 million in premiums to buy options that would pay off if eurodollar futures fall from current levels. That’s a far cry from others in money markets, who are pricing two quarter point interest-rate cuts by year-end.
Global bond markets have surged in recent weeks amid the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, which is threatening to end the longest expansion in postwar history. While Treasury yields are at the lowest level in almost two years, those in Europe have touched the lowest levels on record despite the region’s central bank having little wriggle room to cut rates.
The trade in eurodollar options begins to profit at the first strike of 98.25, which was bought, with maximum gains at the second strike, 98.125, which was sold. The underlying eurodollar futures contract -- which is priced off three-month U.S. Libor expectations -- is now hovering around 98.38, or 1.62%, over 90 basis points lower than current Libor levels.
The trader is targeting a profit of around $12.5 million, before costs are deducted.

1137,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>",Renault Directors Named by Nissan Set to Abstain on Fiat Vote,"(Bloomberg) --  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) is facing resistance from partner Nissan Motor Co. as the French carmaker’s board prepares to consider an offer to merge with Italy’s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU).
Directors of Renault nominated by Nissan are expected to abstain from a vote Tuesday on backing further talks with Fiat about the proposal, said people familiar with the information who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. Fiat Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley is in Paris ahead of the vote, which would stop short of approving a merger.
Renault’s path toward a deal with Fiat was muddied on Monday by Nissan, which holds a 15% stake in the French manufacturer as part of their two-decade auto-making alliance. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said the company needs to review the future of their partnership, including contractual relationships, in light of Renault’s potential tie-up with Fiat.
Fiat Chrysler’s proposal for a 50-50 Dutch holding company would create the world’s third-biggest car maker, adding scale to help the companies share costs and resources while tackling an expensive shift to electrification and autonomous driving. Shares of both Fiat and Renault climbed early Tuesday.
While Nissan can’t block a Fiat-Renault combination, the Yokohama-based company could use its strong presence in China, Japan and the rest of Asia, as well as its electric-car technology, as leverage. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has also said he wants any combination with Fiat to come within the framework of the Franco-Japanese alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
‘Fundamental Review’
“The potential addition of FCA as a new member of the alliance could expand the playing field for collaboration and create new opportunities for further synergies,” Saikawa said in his statement. “That said, the proposal currently being discussed is a full merger which — if realized — would significantly alter the structure of our partner Renault. This would require a fundamental review of the existing relationship between Nissan and Renault.”
The French government, Renault’s most powerful shareholder, is also making demands. It wants additional guarantees from Fiat to avoid job cuts in France and other steps to protect national interests, people familiar with the matter have said.
France is seeking operational headquarters of the combined company in Paris, and a special dividend for shareholders of Renault, which owns a 43% stake in Nissan, as well as a French government seat on the new company’s board, a finance ministry spokesman said.
Le Maire is also seeking guarantees on the mandate of Senard. The minister’s office wants Senard, 66, to have the CEO role for at least four years, one of the people said.
Representatives for Renault and Fiat Chrysler have declined to comment.
The deal would benefit Fiat more than Renault, Paris-based activist investment manager CIAM said in a letter to Renault board members ahead of the vote. The French carmaker’s industrial assets have a negative implied value of 3 billion euros under the terms of the proposed deal. Based on earnings before interest and taxes, they should be valued at 6.75 billion euros, according to the Renault shareholder.
Under terms of the proposal, Renault shareholders including the French government, which owns a 15% stake, would get an implied premium of about 10%, while Fiat owners would get dividends to account for its higher equity value. Renault shares rose as much as 3.9% by 1:22 p.m. in Paris, while Fiat climbed 3.2% in Milan, giving the firms a combined market capitalization of about 34.2 billion euros ($38.5 billion).
The relationship between Renault and Nissan has been strained by the fallout from the arrest of their former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, in November. Mitsubishi Chairman Osamu Masuko has said he would need more time to determine the benefits, if any, for the Japanese automaker of the Renault-Fiat merger.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",Walmart faces major India test over unit Flipkart's legal spat with startup,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian startup's legal challenge against a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) unit claiming losses caused by sharp discounting of its products is winning support from other online sellers, in what is shaping as a key test of how the giant retailer operates in the country.
The legal tussle between GOQii, a seller of smartwatch-type health devices, and Walmart's Flipkart unit, comes just months after India imposed stricter rules for foreign investment in e-commerce that were aimed at deterring such sharp discounts. 
GOQii sued Flipkart last month in a Mumbai court, alleging its devices were discounted by around 70% to the retail price, much more than the two sides had agreed to, legal documents related to the case showed.
The case will next be heard on Friday. Flipkart has denied any wrongdoing, saying it was not responsible for any discounts which are only determined by third-party companies which sell on the e-commerce website.
The legal spat has brought to the fore concerns long raised by small traders and a right-wing group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party. They say companies such as Flipkart and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) deeply discount some products by burning billions of dollars to lure customers onto their sites in the expectation that they will also buy other goods. 
""It will set a precedent if the final decision goes against Flipkart for predatory pricing,"" said Salman Waris, a partner at TechLegis Advocates & Solicitors.
""Small traders' associations and other startups may take other marketplaces adopting deep discounting strategy to court.""
The GOQii case could snowball. The All India Online Vendors Association told Reuters in a statement it plans to file a plea to join GOQii's case against Flipkart on behalf of 3,500 online sellers it represents.
Flipkart said in a statement it takes legal compliance seriously and was compliant with Indian law. ""We are engaged with the supplier to come to a swift resolution,"" it said.
With a 19 percent market share, GOQii was the second-biggest player in India's so-called wearables market last year, data from industry tracker IDC in December showed. The market is dominated by China's Xiaomi, with Samsung (KS:005930) a small player.
GOQII VS FLIPKART
GOQii's dispute with Flipkart centers around two of its wearables devices that allow users to track exercise measurements, such as the number of steps walked, or heart rates.
GOQii's Chief Executive Vishal Gondal told Reuters the firm signed an agreement in September with a Flipkart unit, allowing it to sell the two GOQii devices at a price not below 1,999 rupees and 1,499 rupees, after discounts.
But GOQii last month found Flipkart's website showed the devices on sale for 999 rupees and 699 rupees. The company wrote to Flipkart, saying it was giving ""unauthorized"" discounts and resorting to ""predatory pricing"", violating the agreement, its legal notice showed.
Flipkart was just a business-to-business wholesale venture which sells good to re-sellers, its law firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, said in its response that was seen by Reuters. 
That's central to how Flipkart operates - as India prohibits foreign e-commerce firms from stocking and selling their own inventory on its websites, their wholesale units purchase goods in bulk and sell them to re-sellers. Those re-sellers use Flipkart's own website to sell some of those goods to customers.
Flipkart does not control or influence prices which were determined by such re-sellers, the law firm said, adding that it reserves ""the right to institute actions for defamation, both civil and criminal"".
GOQii's Gondal, however, said he was in possession of WhatsApp messages and e-mails from Flipkart's employees that show the company was aware and involved in discounting products on its website. He declined to share those with Reuters, citing the ongoing court case.
Gondal said about 500,000 device orders were canceled after GOQii's other customers accused the startup of cheating them when they saw cheaper prices on Flipkart. The company was also assessing monetary damages it plans to seek from court. 
""It's a matter of survival. It's not easy to take on a multi-billion-dollar company,"" Gondal said.
In interim relief, the court has ordered the sellers, who are also party to the case, to remove the wearable devices from the Flipkart platform.
WALMART'S STRUGGLES
India's new foreign investment rules introduced in February were troubling for Flipkart and Amazon as they barred companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and stopped them from pushing their sellers to sell exclusively on their websites.
The policy was aimed at deterring deep discounts and helping small traders, but it shocked Walmart as it had just months ago closed its biggest deal by investing $16 billion in Flipkart.
Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Modi's ruling party, said on Tuesday the government must investigate online discounts. 
""We are standing behind any small trader, businesses who suffer online,"" said Ashwani Mahajan, SJM's co-convenor, adding it would discuss GOQii's legal case against Flipkart with government officials.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Bond traders swap phones for new technology as market catches up,"By Tommy Wilkes and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Carl James became a trader when he was 19, in the boisterous telephone dealing rooms of the 1990s.
Now, he and his colleagues at Pictet Asset Management are about to start learning computer coding to help them understand the technological changes sweeping through one of the final frontiers of 'old-style' trading.
Stocks and currencies mostly moved to electronic and automated trading platforms over the past 15 years but the opaque $100 trillion-plus world of government and corporate debt has been a laggard.
It is catching up. Nearly two-thirds of government and corporate bond orders in the United States and Europe are now placed electronically on average, according to 12 large asset managers, banks and trading venues interviewed by Reuters. Volumes are also rising in more specialized markets such as junk debt, emerging markets, repurchase agreements and swaps.
The change has accelerated since new European Union rules in 2018 made it more cumbersome to carry out trades over-the-counter, they said. Electronic platforms make the required time stamping and data reporting easier.
This has contributed to a reduction in staff in trading rooms and a shift toward hiring quantitative analysts, often mathematicians. It has also dented fixed income revenue at some banks - the middle men who have oiled bond market trading.
James is Pictet's head of fixed income trading and as recently as 2016, his team conducted four-fifths of his deals the old way - entrusting contacts at banks to quote him competitive prices by phone.
Four in every five trades at Pictet, which manages around $200 billion, are now placed electronically - tapped into a machine aggregating prices and analyzing data from dozens of banks and trading venues.
""You can make decisions based on the data rather than just the relationship,"" said James.
Eventually, ""the relationship won't matter at all,"" he said.
He has hired a data expert and the coding trading should help the traders to better understand the new technology they are using.
Some fund managers have gone one step further since the introduction of the EU's new MifiD II rules to improve transparency. They have built systems where computers replace humans in deciding when to buy and sell.
Proponents say the shift to electronic and automated trading should make the bond market more transparent, lower costs for the ultimate buyers - asset managers like pension funds - and give fund firms power held by banks to get the best prices.
Electronification: https://tmsnrt.rs/2EmBYtU
STAFFING CHANGES
Along with lower market volatility and tighter regulations, the shift to electronic trading has contributed to a reduction in staff on trading desks at banks and fund firms, banks and asset managers said.
Analytics firm Coalition estimates the 12 biggest investment banks employed 1,400 fixed income sales and trading staff at end-2018, down from 2,300 in 2010 and with a year-on-year fall in each of the past eight years.
Dutch lender ING last year rolled out Katana, an artificial intelligence tool to identify and trade small emerging market bond deals.
Katana is designed to free up traders to focus on higher-value business rather than replacing them, said global head of credit trading Santiago Braje, but he said such tools allow desks to do more with fewer people. He said Katana had increased ING's deal ""win rate"" in emerging markets by 20 percent.
The sources at the banks, asset managers and trading platforms told Reuters there was a shift toward hiring quants, who usually have a degree in maths, physics or computer science, or staff with a data background. Sometimes they are trained as traders.
One head of multi-asset trading at a German asset manager said that of the nine traders on his team, at least five have hybrid roles that have a focus on technology.
Fixed income revenues, headcount: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Elxkws
The shift has also impacted investment banks. Fixed income revenue is down at the top twelve, due in part to the shift to electronic trading. They earned $5.4 billion in 2018, down from $6.3 billion in 2016 and $9.1 billion in 2010, Coalition data shows.
""On the issue of lower profits in fixed income among the world's biggest banks, the growth of electronic trading has played a major role,"" said Coalition research director Amrit Shahani.
Ed Wicks oversees Legal and General Investment Management's trading desk. Britain's biggest fund manager, it invests more than 160 billion pounds ($202 billion) in fixed income assets.
Wicks says the buying and selling of corporate debt is now done in seconds whereas before it took hours.
Three-quarters of the fixed income trades by ticket on his desk are now made electronically. He also expects 15-20% of his bond book to be automated - that means trades selected and executed by computers - this year, from less than 10% today.
U.S. primary dealer holdings: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wg9o7S
Daily trading volumes for government bond and credit products on electronic platform Tradeweb rocketed to $368 billion on average in 2018, up two-thirds from 2016.
""The first battle was between getting people off the phone and clicking a mouse,"" said Billy Hult, president of electronic platform Tradeweb, which last month went public with a valuation of nearly $10 billion.
""Now the mouse is going away and it's about engaging with clients through algos and more sophisticated tools.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) said it will offer expanded health services such as nutrition counseling and blood pressure screenings in 1,500 stores by the end of 2021, following through on plans announced during the pharmacy chain's 2018 acquisition of health insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET).
It plans to convert a total of 50 stores this year in Houston, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Tampa, representing about 15% of the stores in each of the markets, the company said ahead of a meeting on Tuesday with Wall Street analysts and investors in New York. The bulk of the expansion will be split between 2020 and 2021.
CVS first launched a handful of these stores with expanded health services it is calling health hubs in Houston earlier this year. The new format includes an employee with the title of ""care concierge"" who will direct customers to health services such as a nutritionist or nurse practitioner. It also will offer screenings for sleep apnea and opthalmology issues related to diabetes, among other services.
These CVS stores have experienced increases in foot traffic, front-of-store sales and MinuteClinic visits per day, as well as prescriptions dispensed, CVS pharmacy executive Kevin Hourican said in a phone interview. He declined to provide specific figures. MinuteClinics are walk-in health clinics located in CVS pharmacies.
When CVS bought Aetna for $69 billion, it said the companies would work to bring more health services into its stores beyond the MinuteClinic offerings to tackle chronic conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.
Separately, CVS this week is in federal court in Washington D.C., where a judge is reviewing the Aetna deal. The U.S. Department of Justice and the companies agreed on an anti-trust settlement that included the sale of Medicare prescription drug plans to WellCare Health Plans Inc, but the court has not yet signed off on it.

In addition to its retail stores with pharmacies, CVS is one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",EU needs to act on steel imports in wake of U.S. tariffs: industry,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Steel is being diverted to Europe as a result of U.S. 25% tariffs and the European Union needs to act, European steel industry chiefs say a letter sent to EU leaders and EU institutions.
There has been a sudden downturn in the European steel industry's prospects, underpinned by long-term trends, 45 chief executives representing around 90% of the EU's steel output said in the letter.
""Global overcapacity in steel and the use of the EU market as a dumping ground for the world's excess capacity are at the root of the problem,"" they said in the letter sent on Monday and seen by Reuters.
Steel imports into the EU have more than doubled since 2013 while demand had increased only marginally and is seen falling in 2019, they said.
The European Commission is currently reviewing its ""safeguard"" measures designed to limit incoming steel and prevent a surge of imports as a result of Washington's 25% import tariffs, which have effectively closed the U.S. market.
These safeguard measures should be tightened, the steel chiefs said. 
Currently quotas are set at the average level of imports in 2015-2017 plus 5%, with further 5% hikes envisaged on July 1 and a year later. Beyond these quotas, 25% tariffs apply.
The steel bosses urged EU countries, the European Parliament and the European Commission to convene an emergency meeting with the industry to discuss solutions. 
The signatories include the chiefs and regional chiefs of steel and stainless steel producers ArcelorMittal, ThyssenKrupp, Tata Steel and Acerinox.

ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, announced production cuts twice in May, while British Steel collapsed into liquidation.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The sudden deterioration in trade talks between the United States and China last month has ratcheted up concerns among U.S. firms that the dispute could go beyond tariffs and affect business in the long-term.
Business associations and consultants say they have been fielding a growing number of inquiries from companies about how best to navigate the trade dispute. They expect those calls to intensify after FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) over the weekend became embroiled in U.S.-China frictions and an ongoing spat over Chinese tech giant Huawei.
Further rattling nerves are Beijing's plans to unveil an unprecedented hit-list of ""unreliable"" foreign firms, groups and individuals that harm the interests of Chinese companies. China's commerce ministry announced the move on Friday without singling out any country or company.
The US-China Business Council (USCBC), which represents roughly 200 American companies that do business in China, told Reuters on Monday that anxiety among its members was on the rise, especially over the list. 
""The key point for them is that there's a great deal of uncertainty on how the list will be implemented and what negative repercussions will be brought about should a company be added to the list,"" said its vice president of China operations, Jacob Parker. 
""At the moment many of our companies are wondering whether this is an attempt by the Chinese government to increase their potential leverage in the trade negotiations, or if it's an actual effort to force companies into an unenviable position of choosing between the two markets.""
LOOMING LIST
Analysts said U.S. companies had been more sanguine in the initial stage of the trade war, with many believing that it could not possibly go on, but that began to change after Washington last month accused Beijing of reneging on previous promises, prompting fresh tit-for-tat tariffs.
The United States also last month put China's Huawei on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker, aggravating existing frictions.
""We have in the last three weeks fielded more calls from firms wondering about the political risk here than we probably have in the last 10 years,"" said Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group, whose clients have ranged from clothing retailers to chemical firms.
""Right now there's a lot more concern that the situation regarding the negotiations has become so unstable and so emotional, when or if there's going to be a resolution.""
It is unclear exactly how many U.S. companies do business with China, but the American Chambers of Commerce (AmCham) in Beijing and Shanghai count more than 2,000 member firms between them. 
""This is a discouraging development,"" said AmCham Shanghai President Ker Gibbs. ""We are concerned and have requested more information about the list. We hope that both sides can refrain from this type of tit-for-tat behavior and get back to the negotiating table.""
Beijing-based AmCham China did not respond to a request for comment.
""At least three clients have asked us about how the entity list might affect their business,"" said a Shanghai-based consultant, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. 
Even some British firms had sought advice, he added, saying they were expressing worry over U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Britain this week, when he is expected to demand that Prime Minister Theresa May's successor ban Huawei from 5G networks.
""They fear that the U.S. president might pressure the incoming prime minister to follow his policies,"" the consultant said.
SOUTH KOREA EXPERIENCE
One big concern, analysts said, was that U.S. firms could start to experience similar treatment to that doled out to South Korean companies in 2017, after China opposed Seoul's decision to install a U.S. missile system. 
South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate Lotte, was among the worst hit. Chinese authorities suspended its work on a $2.6 billion project and ordered Lotte Mart stores to shut over what they said were fire safety violations. Company officials privately linked the action to the missile spat. 
""It would not be inconceivable that China will look at, for example, large retail brands that are operating here and saying, well maybe they should also have fire code violations too. That would create immediate harm to a lot of businesses,"" Cavender said. 
Another worry is that U.S. corporate officials could personally start to face scrutiny or be investigated in China as a result of the trade frictions, one China-based foreign executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Some, he added, were ""exploring summer plans abroad"", having not previously considered doing so, because they were worried about getting caught in the crossfire. 

""Many U.S. senior executives in China that I know have this growing concern right now.""

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 06:12AM ET</span>","Exclusive: SEC probes Siemens, GE, Philips in alleged China medical equipment scheme","By Brad Brooks
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Philips NV and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co for allegedly using local middlemen to negotiate bribes with Chinese government and hospital officials to sell medical equipment, two U.S. sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The investigations into the companies' business in China, along with an existing SEC probe into their sales in Brazil, are part of a new effort by U.S. regulators to crack down on alleged corruption in sales of costly medical equipment worldwide, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. 
The SEC declined to comment.
Siemens, GE and Philips all denied wrongdoing and said they were unaware of any SEC investigation concerning their operations in China. 
Reuters reported in May that the SEC, along with the U.S. Justice Department and FBI, were investigating Siemens, GE and Philips - as well as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - for allegedly paying bribes to win contracts in Brazil. The four companies all denied any wrongdoing in Brazil.
Under a U.S. federal law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), it is illegal for Americans, U.S. companies or foreign companies whose securities are listed in the United States to pay foreign officials to win business. If found guilty of violating the act, firms could face fines from the SEC.
China's medical device market stood at $58.63 billion in 2017 - compared to $10.8 billion for Brazil - according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Commerce Department. 
In both markets, the companies benefited not only from the sale of the equipment but also from the bigger profit margins to be made on servicing it during its 10-to-15 year lifespan as well as selling software updates, spare parts and the materials used in operating the machines, the sources said. 
China's National Health and Family Planning Commission and the China Food and Drug Administration, which regulate the healthcare system, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Brazilian federal prosecutors declined to comment.
INVESTOR LAWSUIT
Some details of the alleged scheme in China were included in a shareholder lawsuit against current and former members of GE's board in New York state court, which the company disclosed in its 2018 annual report. 
The GE shareholder lawsuit, filed in New York state Supreme Court last December, alleges that since at least 2011 GE employees in China or workers at its subsidiaries ""have bribed hospital administrators, engaged in collusive bidding, and given kickbacks to government officials.""
The lawsuit includes translations of Chinese criminal court rulings finding middlemen who sold GE equipment guilty of bribing Chinese government and hospital officials. Some hospital administrators confessed in open court and received prison sentences, according to rulings cited in the lawsuit. GE was not charged in the Chinese court rulings included as evidence.
The lawsuit accuses GE of colluding with Philips, Siemens and Toshiba Corp's medical unit - which was bought by Canon Inc in 2016 - to fix prices and rig tenders for expensive medical equipment, such as MRI machines and CT scanners, through Chinese middlemen. The lawsuit included public data on how much Chinese hospitals paid for the equipment, which it said was routinely at least 40 percent above the price the middlemen paid to the companies. The difference was then distributed as bribes to health officials, the lawsuit alleges, with some money being pocketed by the middlemen and flowing back to the other companies, who allegedly put in ""cover"" bids to make the public tender appear competitive.
Lawyers for GE in February filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying the complaint failed to link alleged wrongdoing in China to any of the defendants. The judge in the case has not yet ruled on the motion. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not respond to emailed requests for comment. 
Boston-based GE said in an emailed statement that it believes the lawsuit lacks merit, adding that ""we are committed to integrity, compliance and the rule of law in every country in which we do business.""
Amsterdam-based Philips said in an emailed statement it is ""fully complying with local and international anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws."" Philips said it was ""not involved"" in any of the transactions in the criminal cases in China and that it makes extensive efforts to ensure its third-party agents act lawfully. 
Siemens said in an emailed statement that it had just become aware of the New York lawsuit and it would ""investigate any new allegation of misconduct that directly or indirectly involves Siemens"" that may arise from the litigation. Siemens, based in Munich, said that its policy is ""to cooperate with law enforcement investigations when they occur.""
Canon said in an emailed statement that ""Canon Medical Systems Group are committed to conducting business activities with the highest priority on compliance with laws"" and that the company has a zero tolerance toward bribery.
Toshiba said in an emailed statement that it was not aware of the New York state lawsuit. It said company policies ""prohibit illegal or improper payments against lawful business practices.""

1149,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 05:14AM ET</span>",StockBeat - Volkswagen Juggernaut Rolls On,"By Geoff Smith
Investing.com - To some people, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is like a supertanker: huge, slow and cumbersome - but very difficult to stop when it has momentum. Sometimes, that momentum can surprise even itself.
Europe’s largest automotive group has confirmed it intends to list its truck unit Traton by August, having decided only a couple of months ago that the timing wasn’t right.
Market conditions have gotten a lot worse since then, as U.S. President Donald Trump has stepped up his trade war with China and signalled his intention to start a new one with Mexico (he’s still deciding whether or not to attack Europe head-on).
The market has chosen to interpret the news as a sign of confidence rather than desperation, pushing the group’s shares up 2% in early trading in Frankfurt Tuesday, while Germany’s Dax has bounced only 0.9% after Monday’s 'Sturm und Drang'. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 meanwhile was up 0.3% as of 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2%.
If and when it comes, Traton could be Europe’s biggest IPO this year. Analysts estimate the unit’s value at around 16 billion euros ($18 billion), meaning that a 25% sale would raise €4 billion.
Given that it’s aiming for a dual listing in Frankfurt and Stockholm (the home of Traton’s Scania brand), liquidity will suffer if it tries to sell much less than that.
It turns out that the imperative to list Traton is more powerful than the loss of a billion here or there on the valuation. That imperative is born of VW’s diesel disaster, which has cost it $30 billion in fines and other costs so far (more is likely to come in the shape of an EU antitrust fine for conspiring with BMW (MI:BMW) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) to keep cleaner technology off the market).
VW’s response has been to plan a huge expansion into electric vehicles, aiming to make a quarter of its global output electric by 2025. That’s a formidable challenge, as attested by reports that it is having to rejig a $56 billion battery purchasing plan because even mighty Samsung (KS:005930) can’t be sure of meeting its delivery commitments.
It’s not clear whether the change of heart on Traton is related, but the execution risks of the electric transition demand a strong balance sheet. They also demand that group management is adequately focused. Letting the truck business go its own way is a step towards both of those goals at once."

As global demand for sustainable investing increases, a growing list of large investors, including Dutch fund ABP, have ditched tobacco and weapons stocks due to the adverse health, social and environmental impact of these industries.
AP2 said it had sold its holdings in around 60 companies either involved in tobacco or in the maintenance and modernization of nuclear weapons systems. 
""The divestment from tobacco companies is in line with the intention of the convention on tobacco control: a sharp reduction in tobacco consumption and the harmful effects of tobacco smoke,"" it said in a statement.
Additionally, the departure from companies related to nuclear weapons systems was in line with the aim for all countries to disarm nuclear weapons, it added.
The holding was worth 2 billion Swedish crowns ($212 million), or roughly 0.6 percent of AP2's 334 billion Swedish crowns under management, according to a spokeswoman, who declined to name the 60 stocks.
The move comes after sister funds AP1 and AP4 took similar action and follows the introduction earlier this year of Swedish rules that demanded these funds manage assets ""in an exemplary way through responsible investments and... ownership.""

In 2014 the AP2 fund ditched its investments in 83 coal, oil and gas and utility companies due to financial climate risks.

“Our indicators are showing things are getting really overbought and that this vicious spike down in yields we have had is likely to be reversed in the near-term,” Minerd said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday.
Benchmark 10-year yields briefly dropped below 2.06% on Monday to touch the lowest level since September 2017, while 2-year yields fell as low as 1.81%. Fed funds futures show traders expect the U.S. central bank to cut its target rate by more than half a percentage point this year.
A bet on a steepening yield curve would likely be the “most productive trade on rates” should the Fed ease policy, Minerd said.
The yield on 10-year notes on Monday fell to as much as 28 basis points below three-month rates, the most since 2007. An inversion of these rates has historically proven a strong signal of looming recession.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Tuesday outlined plans to increase spending and dividends after 2020 in a show of confidence by the energy company despite an uncertain outlook for oil and gas prices.
In a strategy update, the Anglo-Dutch company said it was on track to deliver its previous commitments to increase cash generation and carry out one of the world's largest share buyback programs of $25 billion by the end of next year.
Shell, the world's second-largest listed oil and gas company after  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) , underwent deep cost cuts following the 2016 acquisition of smaller rival BG Group for $53 billion and the collapse of oil prices in late 2014.
Despite a slow and bumpy recovery in oil prices, it reported the largest profit among its peers last year and vastly increased its revenue from previous years.
""It is the success of our strategy and strength of our delivery today that gives us confidence for the future,"" Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement.
Shell said its free cash flow - cash available to pay for dividends and share buybacks - is set to rise to around $35 billion per year by 2025 at a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel.
That compares with $28-33 billion in free cash flow it expects to deliver by the end of next year.
It said the cash delivery ""creates the potential to distribute $125 billion or more to shareholders"" in the form of dividends and share buybacks between 2021 and 2025.
That compares with distributions of around $90 billion between 2016 and 2020.
It expects to increase its dividend payouts to shareholders once it completes a $25 billion share buyback by the end of 2020 it had promised following the BG acquisition.

Shell, the world's biggest dividend payer at $16 billion a year, last increased its quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2014 to $0.47 per share.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 02:30AM ET</span>",Departures at South African state firms could drag out Ramaphosa's reforms,"By Alexander Winning and Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - President Cyril Ramaphosa's mission to fix two of South Africa's most troubled state companies, power firm Eskom and South African Airways (SAA), could take longer than planned after their chief executives quit within a week of each other. 
Investors say the CEOs' resignations could slow the implementation of turnaround plans seen as critical to shoring up confidence in Africa's most industrialized economy, which has for years struggled to grow and whose last investment-grade credit rating is hanging by a thread.
Since becoming president in February 2018, Ramaphosa has pledged to woo investment, create jobs and tackle deep-rooted corruption. 
The roles at Eskom and SAA are some of the most challenging in corporate South Africa, with fierce disagreements over how the companies should operate, meaning it will be difficult to find replacement leaders quickly.
Both have received government bailouts in recent years but executives say that financial support was insufficient. 
Eskom is choking under 440 billion rand ($30.3 billion) of debt -- equivalent to around 9 percent of South Africa's 2018 gross domestic product -- and this year implemented some of the worst power cuts in several years. It said last month that CEO Phakamani Hadebe would step down in July for health reasons.
But two sources close to Hadebe told Reuters that another reason for his departure was that he felt frustrated at being excluded from important decisions affecting the utility.
Ramaphosa has appointed a raft of advisors to come up with solutions to Eskom's woes and has preferred to listen to their views rather than consult Hadebe, the sources said.
""The government needs to understand that if it wants these companies to be run properly, then it needs to create an environment where the new CEOs can function,"" said Pavel Mamai, partner at fund manager ProMeritum.
""The CEO changes make the task of fixing Eskom and SAA more urgent.""
SAA CEO Vuyani Jarana wrote in his resignation letter last week that his plans to revive the loss-making airline were being undermined by a lack of state funding and too much bureaucracy.
Jarana, who will leave SAA at the end of August, told Reuters in a May 2018 interview that government funding was critical to fixing the airline.
Hadebe and Jarana had both been in their roles for less than two years when they resigned -- a common trend at South African state firms.
""The revolving-door policy at key state-owned enterprises does little to instil investor confidence,"" said analyst Shaun Murison at IG Markets.
Hadebe's phone was switched off when a Reuters reporter called on Monday. An SAA spokesman said Jarana was not available for comment.
MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE
The search for replacements for Hadebe and Jarana has only just got under way.
But the new Eskom and SAA executives will face monumental challenges, which include navigating the competing interests of different sections of government and society.
Eskom and SAA report to South African Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, a close Ramaphosa ally respected by investors for running a tight ship while finance minister but whose management style opponents call interventionist. 
Gordhan's aides told Reuters on Monday that the financial and operational crises at Eskom and SAA necessitated close attention from the minister.
They said the scale of the problems facing Eskom, which range from liquidity issues to coal quality, meant it was unrealistic to expect the CEO alone to solve them. Fiscal constraints meant the government had to opt for a ""phased recapitalization"" rather than giving SAA all the money it wanted in one go, they added.
The new executives will also have to establish a close working relationship with Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, who this year likened giving state funds to Eskom to pouring water into a sieve and last year said SAA should be closed down. The airline has not made a profit since 2011.
A further complication comes from labor unions and sections of Ramaphosa's governing African National Congress party that vehemently oppose efforts to trim the two firms' bloated workforces.
Analysts say job cuts should be a key component of the companies' recovery plans and that the stakes are high if those plans fail. Eskom employs roughly 48,000 people, after hiring about 12,000 additional employees in the past decade. A World Bank research report published in 2016 said it was significantly overstaffed.
""If Ramaphosa does not come up with a solution to this crisis soon, there is a good chance Moody's will remove South Africa's last investment-grade credit rating,"" said Nigel Rendell, a director at Medley Global Advisors.
""Eskom is the biggest issue hanging over financial markets, and there won't be a happy ending unless there is a significant capital injection from somewhere.""

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 02:30AM ET</span>",World's biggest firms foresee $1 trillion climate cost hit,"By Matthew Green
LONDON (Reuters) - More than 200 of the world's largest listed companies forecast that climate change could cost them a combined total of almost $1 trillion, with much of the pain due in the next five years, according to a report published on Tuesday.
Even so, the findings by charity CDP suggested many companies still underestimated the dangers as scientists warn that earth's climate system is on course to hit catastrophic tipping points without rapid cuts in carbon emissions. 
""Most companies still have a long way to go in terms of properly assessing climate risk,"" said Nicolette Bartlett, CDP's director of climate change, who authored the report.
Founded in the early 2000s, CDP - formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project - is a respected voice in a growing coalition of pressure groups, fund managers, central bankers and politicians who believe global warming poses a systemic risk to the financial system.
By pushing chief executives to confront risks to their operations, advocates of greater disclosure hope to spur enough investment in cleaner industries to cut carbon emissions in time to meet global climate goals.
In its latest study, CDP analyzed survey data from 215 of the largest companies, ranging from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), UBS, Nestle, China Mobile, Infosys, Sony and BHP.
The companies anticipated a total of $970 billion in extra costs due to factors including hotter temperatures, chaotic weather, and pricing of greenhouse gas emissions. About half of these costs were seen as ""likely to virtually certain.""
Many companies also saw a huge potential upside if the world can de-carbonize in time to avert the bleakest climate scenarios, which scientists see as an existential risk to industrial civilization.
The companies in the CDP study, which have a combined market capitalization of roughly $17 trillion, saw potential opportunities worth $2.1 trillion, spanning faster-than-expected demand for electric vehicles to investments in renewables.
THE GREAT TRANSITION
Investor concerns over climate risk have risen sharply in parallel with an upsurge in climate activism in many countries as the heat waves, droughts, wildfires and super-storms fueled by climate change have become harder to ignore. 
In April, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and Francois Villeroy de Galhau, head of the French central bank, warned of the risk of a climate-driven ""Minsky moment"" – a sudden collapse in asset prices - unless business embraced greater disclosure.
The CDP aligns its questionnaires with the reporting requirements of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, a voluntary initiative launched by the G20 in 2015, which is due to publish a status report on Wednesday.
British-based CDP acknowledges its research cannot provide a perfect snapshot of companies' thinking since a lack of mandatory reporting requirements on climate risk means it has to rely on whatever figures executives are willing to share. 
The charity argues, however, that the degree to which companies are willing to engage provides a yardstick to judge the relative transparency of different sectors and generates peer pressure for greater disclosure.
Although no sector was entirely transparent on climate risk, financial services companies tended to be among the most forthcoming respondents, CDP said, accounting for about 70-80 per cent of the estimated costs and opportunities.
Fossil fuel companies who submitted responses to the study reported $140 billion of potential opportunities in the drive toward a low-carbon economy - more than five times the $25 billion value of the risks they identified, CDP said. 
With climate action focused on limiting the burning of coal, oil and gas, CDP urged investors to question why fossil players seemed so confident of benefiting from an energy transition that would render their existing business models obsolete.

""The financial sector seems to be identifying more risks than the real economy,"" said Pedro Faria, a strategic advisor to CDP. ""This raises the question: who is managing these risks?""

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>",Mounting climate change fears push U.S. investors to assess geographical risks,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With an above-average percentage of its power generated from renewable sources and one of the largest battery storage operations in the United States, utility  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) seemed to check all the boxes for portfolio manager Todd Ahlsten, who manages more than $18 billion for Parnassus Investments based on each company's environmental, social and governance attributes. 
But he sold his shares in the San Diego-based company earlier this year because of his conviction that its location in California will put it in the crosshairs of increasingly severe weather patterns, no matter how environmentally responsible it may be. 
""They were doing all the right things, but the risks were too high on the physical side so we exited the position,"" Ahlsten said. 
Ahlsten's decision to factor in the geographical risks of climate change is becoming increasingly familiar in the fast-growing world of so-called ESG investing, which has long focused more on avoiding companies with poor environmental track records than assessing which face the greatest risk of physical damage or business disruptions from more volatile climate. 
The bankruptcy of California utility company Pacific Gas and Electric in January following devastating wildfires caused in part by climate change is prompting investors to recognize what had been one of the biggest blind spots of environmentally driven investing: the reality that even companies that pledge to combat climate change could be negatively affected by it.
As a result, ESG investors are increasingly judging companies based on what sort of physical risks they will face as global temperatures continue to rise and storms become more severe. 
Firms including Parnassus, Hermes Investment Management and  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance's Calvert Research and Management are avoiding companies ranging from retailers with large footprints in Florida to utilities in Southern (NYSE:SO) California to barge shipping companies that may have to deal with more frequent Midwestern floods.
PG&E faces liabilities that it estimates at over $30 billion in the aftermath of November's Camp Fire, which killed more than 85 people and destroyed more than 14,600 homes, making it the most destructive wildfire in California history.

The risks of physical damage, liabilities or business disruptions from climate change do not currently factor into ESG-ratings by index-providers, which often shape the investable universe for fund managers or exchange-traded funds. 
""The industry is turning more to try to understand and embed and measure the physical risks associated with climate change, but that's still an evolving area,"" said Tony Campos, head of ESG, Americas, at FTSE Russell. 
More accurate analytics and modeling programs that help predict the specific impacts of different weather scenarios on individual companies are prompting more fund managers to take the impact of climate change into consideration, said Louise Dudley, portfolio manager of the Federated Hermes Global Equity fund in London. 
""In terms of physical risk up, until now we've looked at the type of companies that are the most exposed. But now with more data we're able to get more specific, more accurate insights and therefore more useful outputs,"" she said. 
Over the last year, Hermes has spent more time on modeling the likely outcomes for each company it evaluates based on global temperatures rising by 2, 4, or 6 degrees Celsius, she said. Global temperatures are on course to rise between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius (5.4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century, according to a 2018 estimate by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization.
Brian Ellis, portfolio manager of the Calvert Bond fund and the Calvert Green Bond fund, said his fund is increasingly focusing on the geographical footprint of companies, ranging from retailers to hotel operators to real estate investment trusts that may be concentrated in areas that could get hit by severe storms or high temperatures. 
That focus on recognizing which companies may be more likely to bear the physical brunt of climate change is relatively new, he said, and is a step up from crediting companies that had been investing in renewable energy or decreasing their carbon emissions. 
""I think people are recognizing more so that you can do all that but you can still have very large impacts to your infrastructure"" due to more volatile weather patterns, Ellis said. 

As a result, he is increasingly demanding more enticing potential returns to compensate for the risks of physical damage from climate change, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said on Tuesday it is seeking to attract high school students by offering them a low-cost path to a college degree and will expand an education program it started a year ago - in a new bid to draw workers in a tight labor market.
Walmart's announcement comes a day before its annual shareholders meeting in Bentonville, Arkansas, which will be attended by Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders.
At the meeting, Sanders is expected to pressure Walmart to raise its wages and introduce a shareholder proposal calling for hourly associates to have a seat on Walmart's board. 
""I'm going to Bentonville, Arkansas, to tell the Walton family of Walmart, the wealthiest family in America: Get off welfare. Pay your workers a living wage!"" Sanders tweeted last week.
The world's largest retailer offers an entry wage of $11 while rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) pays $15 an hour and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) has said it will offer $15 by the end of 2020, prompting labor groups, unions and politicians to criticize Walmart's pay policy. 
Walmart has said its average hourly total compensation and benefits total more than $17.50 an hour.
Tuesday's announcement is also tied to U.S. retailers struggling to hire and retain talent, especially young workers, with unemployment at its lowest in nearly half a century.
$1 A DAY
Last year, Walmart said it will pay its part-time and full-time workers to go to school, in an effort to improve employee retention rates and engagement at work.
Walmart, which is the largest U.S. private sector employer, with a nearly 1.5 million workforce, said it will cover the costs of tuition, books and fees while employees will be required to pay $1 a day for the duration of their studies. 
Walmart's initial offer required employees to get degrees in business and supply chain management. The expanded program, it said, will add 14 new technology degrees in areas including cyber security and computer science.
The expanded program will also seek to draw and retain high school students by offering them jobs with scheduling options, such as the opportunity to work the same day and shift for 13 weeks.
It will also offer free ACT and SAT test prep, up to seven hours of free college credit, a debt-free college degree and a graduation bonus program of up to $1,500 for 5,000 U.S. workers who have not previously completed a college degree.
The cost of college remains a significant barrier for many high school students, which often leads to costly student loans, Julie Murphy, executive vice president, People, Walmart US, told reporters on a call.
The Center for Microeconomic Data recently reported that student loan debt is now nearly $1.5 trillion and fewer and fewer teens are entering the workforce, Murphy said, citing numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS estimates that by 2024 only 26 percent of teens will have a job, she said.
Walmart workers can earn degrees and certificates at six nonprofit universities, including Southern (NYSE:SO) New Hampshire University, Purdue University and the University of Florida.
Less than a year after the launch of Walmart's program, more than 7,500 Walmart workers have been accepted to at least one of the programs, the retailer said.

""If somebody is ready to cancel the MAX order because of what happens I think it is more of an emotional decision than a rational decision,"" Chief Executive Rafal Milczarski told a CAPA Centre for Aviation conference after an IATA airlines summit.
Some airlines have threatened to cancel orders citing safety reasons, though analysts say the moves coincide with sporadic economic pressure on airlines to reduce or defer deliveries.

After vastly underperforming their American counterparts during the trade-war battles last year, China’s domestic shares are bearing up with a lot less relative damage this time around.
Since a near-6% mauling on May 6, a day after President Donald Trump’s tweeted pledge to step up tariffs on Chinese imports, the Shanghai Composite Index has even outperformed the S&P 500 Index. For the month of May, the two are roughly equal, with China’s onshore gauge slightly worse in dollar terms.
That’s a big change from last summer, when Trump tweeted that “our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing.”
Different This Time
“There seems to be this zone of relative stability in Chinese shares for a number of reasons, including inviting valuations,” said Daniel Xu, a managing partner at Beijing Eastern Smart Rock Asset Management Co. in Beijing. “There could be -- more importantly -- non-market forces at play,” he said, with Chinese officials eager for stability in equities in the run-up to the launch of a Nasdaq-style technology-sector board.
Chinese stocks got walloped in mid-June 2018, when Trump put China on notice he was proceeding with tariffs on $50 billion of imports and would keep going from there if needed. The Shanghai Composite entered a bear market later that month, vastly underperforming the U.S., and it lost ground most months for the rest of the year.
Read a QuickTake about China’s plunge-protection team.
Boosted by the tax-cut fed growth spurt, the S&P 500 Index by contrast hit a new high in September. Wall Street then got hammered in October and December by fears about Fed tightening and the threat of a U.S. recession on the horizon.
Both markets put in a stellar first quarter of 2019, with China outstripping the U.S. as Chinese policy makers shifted to stimulus mode and confidence strengthened that a trade deal was coming. That was all upended in early May, and now the two markets may be on more equal footing, market players say. Both are off to a losing start in June.
“The U.S. had a higher position to fall from than China,” said Pan Yue, the investment director at Beijing JingHong Investment Co. in Beijing. And “the impact of the trade war on the U.S. is no less than that on China,” Pan said.

Developments in the Sino-U.S. trade war continued to make headlines. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said China was pursuing a “blame game” and Washington reiterated its view that China “backpedalled” on key elements of a trade deal that had been largely agreed.
“Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,” the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Treasury said in a joint statement. “Rather, the issues discussed are common to trade agreements and are necessary to address the systemic issues that have contributed to persistent and unsustainable trade deficits.”
The remarks came after China issued a government policy paper over the weekend that claimed the U.S. is responsible for the setback in negotiations.

The potential investigation represents the latest attack on a tech company by the Trump administration, which has accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices on their platforms online.
Alphabet's market capitalization was reduced by $54 billion as its shares recorded their biggest drop outside earnings since April 2011.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) closed 7.5% down, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell about 5%.
Amazon shares were also pressured by news that the company could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S. regulators, which puts the e-commerce giant under the trade commission's watch.
Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey cut his price target on the Alphabet stock by $50 to $1,200, the second lowest on Wall Street and well below the median price target of $1,350.
""For investors, the investigation comes at a time when the stock's bull case is challenged by concerns of an abrupt revenue slowdown last quarter,"" Rippey said.
""While precedent suggests that Google enjoys broad discretion over the direction of search results, the questions arising from an investigation will challenge the possibility of multiple expansion,"" he added.
Google's search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a start-up to one of the world's richest companies in just two decades.
Along the way, it has made enemies in the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and also in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Justin Post said a possible investigation could lead to a breakup.
""To break up Google, the DoJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition. It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of,"" Post wrote in a note.
Google also faced a widespread outage on Sunday as it experienced high levels of congestion in the eastern United States, affecting multiple services in Google Cloud, G Suite and YouTube. The company later said it identified the root cause and resolved the issue, but did not elaborate further.

1165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 09:30PM ET</span>",Mexico Says Tariffs May Backfire as Talks With U.S. Begin,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexican officials began talks to avert President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs, arguing the move could backfire by derailing the country’s efforts to stem the flow of Central American migrants to the U.S.
Mexico has returned tens of thousands of people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador this year, paying for shelter, meals, transportation and medical aid, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters on Monday. More than a quarter million more migrants would reach the U.S. this year from the region without Mexico’s help, he added.
The U.S. threat to impose the tariffs on all Mexican goods and possibly cancel aid programs for Central America could cause financial and economic hardship in Mexico and hurt the country’s efforts to address migration flows, he said. Mexico is willing to work with the U.S., but its ability to meet Trump’s demands is limited by the nation’s constitution, a global migration pact signed in Morocco last year and “the dignity of Mexico,"" Ebrard said.
Ebrard said that an idea favored by some U.S. officials to force Central American migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to instead do so with Mexico as a ""safe third country"" wouldn’t be acceptable.
""We’ve been saying for a while that a ‘safe third country’ agreement wouldn’t be acceptable for Mexico,"" Ebrard said. ""Up until now, they haven’t proposed it to me.""
Ebrard arrived in Washington late Friday night and along with Mexican Ambassador Martha Barcena met with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan on Sunday, according to two people familiar with the conversation, who asked not to named because it hasn’t been made public. Meetings on Monday will include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Homeland Security, Ebrard said.
Mexican officials are emphasizing the importance of the relationship between the two nations, echoing the tone adopted by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who said on Monday morning in Mexico City that he’s optimistic a deal can be reached to avoid tariffs. Trump last week threatened to slap 5% duties on all Mexican goods on June 10 that would rise to 25% by October unless the country steps up its work to fight illegal immigration. The move roiled markets and opened a new front in Trump’s trade wars.
Investors were less optimistic. The peso slumped on Monday, falling 0.7% to 19.7618 by 1:30 p.m. in New York.
The tariff threat could derail passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- the successor to the Nafta trade deal -- just as the three nations looked set to seek ratification from their legislatures.
Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said last week the tariffs could jeopardize the passage of USMCA, adding that trade policy and border security should remain separate issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said on Monday that China was pursuing a ""blame game"" in recent public statements and a weekend white paper that misrepresented the trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies.
In a joint statement, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office and the U.S. Treasury reiterated their view that China's negotiators had ""backpedaled"" on important elements of a deal that had been largely agreed, including on an enforcement provision.
""Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,"" USTR and the Treasury said. ""Rather, the issues discussed are common to trade agreements and are necessary to address the systemic issues that have contributed to persistent and unsustainable trade deficits."" 
China on Sunday issued a government policy paper on the U.S.-China trade dispute in which it asserted that the United States bore responsibility for setbacks in the talks, citing three instances in which Washington had backtracked on commitments made during the negotiations.
China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, a prominent member of Beijing's negotiating team, said in presenting the paper to the media that it would be impossible for the United States to use ""extreme pressure"" to force concessions from China.
Acrimonious rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has steadily increased since talks broke down in early May over U.S. accusations that Beijing had backtracked on commitments to codify in law changes to its intellectual property and technology transfer practices to address U.S. demands.
President Donald Trump imposed an increase in tariffs to 25% on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, saying that China ""broke the deal."" His administration later imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, China's premier telecommunications equipment firm.
""The United States is disappointed that the Chinese have chosen in the 'White Paper' issued (on Sunday) and recent public statements to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries,"" USTR and Treasury said in the statement.
The agencies, which have taken the lead in negotiations for the U.S. side, said that the impetus for the negotiations was China's ""long history of unfair trade practices,"" and U.S. negotiating positions have been consistent throughout the talks.

There have been no talks scheduled since the last round ended in May, and it remains unclear whether Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet when they both attend the G20 leaders summit later this month in Japan.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 07:04PM ET</span>","Credit analysts cautious over Illinois budget, infrastructure plan","By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Some results from Illinois' action-packed spring legislation session that produced a budget and a variety of revenue-raising measures won initial praise on Monday from credit rating analysts, who cautioned that fiscal challenges remain.
Lawmakers wrapped up the session on Sunday, passing a $40.1 billion fiscal 2020 budget and a $45 billion infrastructure plan, along with a variety of tax and fee hikes and projected new revenue from a massive gambling expansion that includes sports betting, and from legalizing recreational marijuana. 
Illinois has the lowest credit ratings among U.S. states at a notch or two above the junk level due to its huge $133.5 billion unfunded pension liability and chronic structural budget deficit. 
Carol Spain, an S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings analyst, said the state's recently increased forecast for income tax collections along with revenue measures passed by the legislature resulted in a budget with ""few one-time revenues."" 
""In S&P Global’s view, the fiscal 2020 budget signals near-term credit stability and buys the state more time to address out-year gaps,"" she said in an email. 
Spain added that to maintain an investment-grade rating, further progress is needed ""toward sustainable structural balance, paying down its bill backlog, and addressing its pension liabilities.""
Ted Hampton, a Moody's Investors Service analyst, said full payment of Illinois' fiscal 2020 pension contribution, which lawmakers said was in the budget, would be a positive move.
After an unexpected income tax revenue surge in April, Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker dropped a proposal to extend the state's current 50-year pension payment plan and reduce the coming fiscal year's contribution.
Hampton said he will have to look at a provision in the budget that would restore a 6% cap on end-of-career teacher salary increases that had previously been lowered to 3% to cut pension costs. 
Lawmakers also voted for a three-year extension of a bond-financed pension benefit buyback program also aimed at reducing costs.
A ""Rebuild Illinois"" capital plan passed by lawmakers is supported by higher taxes on gasoline, parking, and cigarettes, as well as money from a gambling expansion that adds casinos, including the first for Chicago.
""Generally, when we see states gathering the political courage to do things like raise gasoline taxes for an infrastructure plan that's also positive,"" Hampton said. 
The $20.8 billion of bonds included in the plan would ""substantially"" increase Illinois' debt burden, according to Spain.
""The new revenues that will support increased debt service will relieve some state operating pressure, but Illinois’ large liabilities will continue to weigh on its credit profile,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Illinois' yield penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market, the biggest among states, has shrunk to its lowest level since 2014 for 10-year bonds, according to Municipal Market Data (MMD). The state's bonds are yielding 139 basis points over MMD's benchmark triple-A yield scale, down from as much as 185 basis points earlier this year.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 05:30PM ET</span>",Explainer: U.S. dependence on China's rare earth - Trade war vulnerability,"(Reuters) - Rare earth elements are used in a wide range of consumer products, from iPhones to electric car motors, as well as military jet engines, satellites and lasers.
Rising tensions between the United States and China have sparked concerns that Beijing could use its dominant position as a supplier of rare earths for leverage in the trade war between the two global economic powers.
China supplied 80% of the rare earths imported by the United States from 2014 to 2017.
China is home to at least 85% of the world's capacity to process rare earth ores into material manufacturers can use, according to research firm Adamas Intelligence.
It would take years to build enough processing plants to match China's processing capacity of 220,000 tonnes- which is five times the combined capacity of the rest of the world.
Alternative processing plants would struggle to compete with China's low costs in the future, should trade tensions abate.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS USED IN?
Rare earths are used in rechargeable batteries for electric and hybrid cars, advanced ceramics, computers, DVD players, wind turbines, catalysts in cars and oil refineries, monitors, televisions, lighting, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and glass polishing.
Several rare earth elements, such as neodymium and dysprosium, are critical to the motors used in electric vehicles. 
Some rare earth minerals are essential in military equipment such as jet engines, missile guidance systems, missile defense systems, satellites, as well as in lasers.
Since 2010, the government and private industry have built up stockpiles of rare earths and components that use them, according to Eugene Gholz, a former senior Pentagon supply chain expert, who teaches at the University of Notre Dame.
Some manufacturers have also scaled back their use of such elements, or substituted them for other metals, he said.
WHICH COMPANIES ARE MOST DEPENDENT ON CHINESE SUPPLIES?
Companies such as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc all make sophisticated missiles that use rare earths metals in their guidance systems, and sensors. Lockheed and BAE declined to comment. Raytheon did not respond to a request for comment. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) uses rare earth elements in speakers, cameras and to make phones vibrate.
The United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.
WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS AND WHERE DO THEY OCCUR?
Rare earth metals are a group of 17 elements - lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium - that appear in low concentrations in the ground.
Although they are more abundant than their name implies, they are costly to process.
(GRAPHIC-Rare earth production link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2I4ixHG).
Importers made limited efforts to reduce rare earth consumption and dependence on China after a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan in 2010. Japan accused China of halting rare earth supplies for political reasons, sparking recognition worldwide of the risks of dependence on one supplier. China denied it had halted supplies.
California's Mountain Pass mine is the only operating U.S. rare earths facility. But MP Materials, owner of Mountain Pass, ships the roughly 50,000 tonnes of rare earth concentrate it extracts each year from California to China for processing. China has imposed a tariff of 25% on those imports during the trade war.
Australia's Lynas Corporation Ltd in May said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Texas-based Blue  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN) to build a rare earth processing facility in the United States.
Rare earths are also mined in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia and Vietnam. 
HOW ARE RARE EARTHS AFFECTED BY U.S. TARIFFS?
So far, the U.S. government has exempted rare earths from tariffs on Chinese goods.
OPTIONS TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CHINESE IMPORTS
U.S. senators introduced legislation in May to encourage development of domestic supplies.
As yet, recycling is not a significant source of rare earth minerals.
Congress is also eyeing federal funding to develop ways to extract rare earths from coal ash, a byproduct of coal-fired power plants, but it could take a decade to make the process viable for wider industrial use, said Eric Williams (NYSE:WMB), a professor of sustainability at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
HOW HAVE RARE EARTHS PRICES REACTED TO THE RISING TENSIONS?
Having held largely steady for the past several months, the export prices of an array of rare earth elements have rallied strongly since Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to a rare earth processing firm in southern China on May 20. 
The price of neodymium metal - used in magnets and speakers - increased 26.5% since May 20. Dysprosium metal (used in lasers), erbium oxide and gadolinium oxide (used in medical imaging and fuel cells) are up around 10%.

The S&P 500 ended down 0.28%, and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 1.61% on heavy selling in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The Nasdaq 100 Index, dominated by big tech companies like Facebook and Alphabet, fell 2.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a late-session rally that saw a 100-point loss turn into a tiny 0.02% gain.
A try at a rally emerged after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to counter economic risks from President Donald Trump’s trade fights, but the rally mostly stalled out.
The selling was prompted by reports that the Justice Department may probe Alphabet for antitrust violations. Facebook fell more than 8% on reports the Federal Trade Commission will be looking into antitrust issues as well.
In addition, markets worldwide were wary about the Trump Administrations threats to boost tariffs on goods from Mexico to try to force the Mexican government to stop illegal immigration. A weaker-than-expected report on domestic manufacturing didn't do much for investors' moods, either.
With today's selling, the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 indexes are off more than 10% since peaking in April. A 10% decline from a peak is a common definition of a correction.
The S&P 500 is off 7.1% from its April peak. The Dow is off 7.9% from its 52-week high reached last fall.
The selling caused many investors to flee to the relative safety of bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.08%, its lowest level since November 2016.

The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) met in recent weeks and agreed to give the Justice Department the jurisdiction to undertake potential antitrust probes of Apple and Google, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, the sources said. 
The FTC was given jurisdiction to look at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), the sources said.
The sources did not say what the government's potential concern might be regarding Apple. 
Streaming music leader Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA and others have criticized the iPhone maker’s practices, describing the company as anti-competitive in a complaint to the European Union’s antitrust regulators. Central to Spotify’s complaint is a 30% fee Apple charges content-based service providers to use Apple’s in-app purchase system.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company has defended its practices in the past, saying it only collects a commission if a good or service is sold through an app. ""Our users trust Apple - and that trust is critical to how we operate a fair, competitive store for developer app distribution,"" it has said previously.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - With the quiet period related to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) disastrous IPO last month coming to an end, investors can expect a deluge of analyst research initiations on the ride-hailing service.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are among roughly two dozen Wall Street banks that underwrote the firm's stock market debut, and they have been required by industry practice to wait until June 4 to launch analyst coverage. 
Shares of Uber, which is losing billions of dollars a year, are down 9% from the price set in its May 9 initial public offering - the most hotly anticipated public listing since Facebook's in 2012. The stock was up 0.7% at mid-day on Monday.
About $7 billion of Uber's stock market value has evaporated since the IPO, making it a major disappointment for the company, its shareholders and underwriters.
So far, three analysts from banks uninvolved in Uber's IPO recommend buying the stock, while five have neutral ratings and none recommend selling, according to Refinitiv data. 
On average, those analysts expect Uber to lose $4.4 billion in 2019, equivalent to $3.49 per share, according to Refinitiv. At the same time, they expect Uber's revenue to climb 24% this year to $14 billion. 
After Uber reported a quarterly loss of $1 billion last Thursday, Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell upgraded his rating to ""overweight"" from ""neutral,"" pointing in his research note to ""an increasingly benign competitive environment in ride-hailing and more attractive stock valuation."" 
Uber was the biggest of a group of Silicon Valley startups that have gone public this year against the backdrop of a global stock market sell-off sparked by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China. The San Francisco-based company also faces increased regulation in several countries and fights with its drivers over wages.
While bulls see Uber eventually launching fleets of self-driving cars and compare it to Amazon's ability to spread into new markets, bears are focused on the company's billions of dollars in losses and the threat of increased competition.
Uber and smaller rival  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), which is also losing money, are each trading at five times analysts' expected 2019 sales. That suggests investors value them similarly, even as many Uber enthusiasts argue the larger company deserves a premium because of its global dominance in ride-sharing and additional businesses, including Uber Eats.

By Peter Szekely
(Reuters) - Smoothie King, a U.S. chain of shops specializing in blended fruit and vegetable drinks, said on Monday that it was temporarily shutting two of its North Carolina stores after workers used racial slurs on receipts to describe customers.
The Dallas-based franchise company said two employees who wrote offensive descriptions on the receipts of an African-American and an Asian customer had lost their jobs. The dismissed employees worked at separate stores in Charlotte.
""We have zero tolerance for any action where a guest is disrespected and we have taken immediate and decisive action,"" Smoothie King Franchises Inc said in an emailed statement.
The company said it was closing the two stores where the incidents occurred ""until the franchisees and their respective teams complete further training on our standards and to ensure that nothing like this occurs again.""
The events are the latest example of a major U.S. retailer in recent months requiring employees to undergo training in response to racist incidents at its stores. 
Smoothie King said it was still investigating the incidents, and that franchisees and workers at all of its more than 1,000 stores, which are mostly in the U.S. South and Southeast, will get more training about ""inclusivity policies and best practices.""
The incidents came to light on Sunday, when a customer responded to a Smoothie promotion on Twitter that said ""Cheers to $5 Friday,"" with a picture of a store receipt and a comment that said, ""Do I have to be called the n-word for the discount?""
The pictured receipt for a ""Hulk Strawberry"" drink showed that the order was for ""nigger - To Go.""
Another Twitter user described the second incident where an Asian man was labeled as ""Jackie Chan,"" the Hong Kong-born actor and martial arts expert.
LVMH's Sephora beauty chain said on Sunday that it will close all its U.S. stores, distribution centers and corporate offices for one hour on Wednesday to conduct diversity training for employees, following a racial incident involving Grammy-nominated singer SZA, who is black.
A year ago, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) closed 8,000 stores across the United States for anti-bias training after a Philadelphia cafe manager's call to police resulted in the arrests of two black men who were waiting for a friend.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U. S. President Donald Trump's tariffs confrontation with China may force global bond investors to rethink exposure to emerging markets despite robust 2019 gains, according to a Wall Street portfolio manager of $17 billion of emerging markets (EM) fixed-income.
Federico Kaune, head of EM fixed income at UBS Asset Management, also said on Monday in an online interview that central-bank officials in developing countries likely have little scope to combat slowed cross-border commerce with rate cuts.
The following are excerpts from the Reuters Global Markets Forum chat:
Question: How have the trade disputes affected emerging economies, where debt investors had total returns as measured by the JP Morgan EMBI index of nearly 7% during January, February and March?
Answer: Negatively. The premise at the beginning of the second quarter was that the trade disputes between the U.S. and China were going to get resolved. But now the risk scenario is becoming the baseline scenario. Hence, EM economies and their assets are likely to underperform our previous expectations. 
Q: How have you shifted investments?
A: If the trade disputes are not resolved soon, and if the trade war escalates, then China will likely grow less, together with the rest of the world (particularly Asia and Europe), and that lower growth will affect global trade volumes and also commodity prices. We are far more defensive now ... We increased duration in portfolios as UST (U.S. Treasury) yields started to rally earlier in May.
Q: What can EM central bankers do, if the crisis continues?
A: Central banks will probably try to lower rates where they are high or keep them low where there are already low. But there are limits. If there are risk-aversion episodes, as a result of the trade disputes, then EM central banks may not be able to lower rates further.
Q: Is it time for investors to look at Venezuelan debt?
A: Venezuela is not a poor country resources wise, but it needs a resolution to the current political and economic crisis for bonds to recover. Recovery rates could be in 50s or more once everything is said and done, assuming that the econ/pol crisis is resolved favorably. But it could take further until that happens.

1180,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 03:15PM ET</span>","Facebook, Google Fall out of Favor as U.S. Authorities Sharpen Fangs","Investing.com Facebook and Google moved lower Monday as the threat of regulatory scrutiny by U.S. authorities prompted investors to rein in their bullish bets on the tech heavyweights.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice struck an agreement to step up antitrust regulations, with Google and Facebook fixed in the crosshairs.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 7% and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost 6%.
Under the agreement, the FTC will reportedly be able to examine the effect of the Facebook's practices on digital competition, The Wall Street Journal reported.
The increased regulatory microscope on Facebook, already under investigation by the FTC over its handling of user data, comes as the company has warned that it is on the hook for a fine of up to $5 billion.
A similar deal reportedly was also struck between the two government entities concerning Google, but the Justice Department will receive jurisdiction over a potential antitrust probe. The investigation would look into Google’s search practices and other businesses, the Journal reported Friday.
U.S. authorities are somewhat behind their international counterparts when it comes to looking deeper into the practices of the tech heavyweights, with European regulators on the trail for months.
Earlier this year in March, the European Union slapped a fine that ran into the billions of dollars on Google for giving itself an illegal advantage in search, paving the way for corporates to jump on the ligation bandwagon.
Google is reportedly facing nearly $2 billion in litigation obligations, including a $565 million lawsuit by German price comparison site Idealo and more than $1 billion in lawsuits by British price comparison sites Foundem and Kelkoo, according to a report from Financial Times in April.
Facebook is up 35% year to date, while Google is up 5.89%. That compared with the S&P 500 returns of about 9% so far this year."
1181,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 03:08PM ET</span>",Mexico draws red line on asylum in talks to stop Trump tariffs,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico on Monday made clear it would reject a U.S. idea to take in all Central American asylum seekers if it is raised at talks this week with Trump administration, which has threatened to impose tariffs if Mexico does not crack down on illegal immigration. 
President Donald Trump last week said he will impose tariffs on all Mexican imports from June 10 as a way to pressure Mexico to tackle large flows of mostly Central American migrants passing through on the way to the United States.
The threat was a shock to global markets, which are already suffering from a trade war between the United States and China.
Speaking to reporters in Washington before this week's meetings, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said the country is committed to continuing to work to keep illegal immigrants from Central American from reaching the United States border. 
However, a more radical proposal favored by some U.S. officials to designate Mexico a ""safe third country,"" which would force Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States to instead seek that status in Mexico, is not an option, he said.
""An agreement about a safe third country would not be acceptable for Mexico,"" Ebrard said. ""They have not yet proposed it to me. But it would not be acceptable and they know it.""
The talks in Washington will be closely watched by financial markets concerned that import tariffs would ultimately hit the U.S. economy by adding to the cost of a wide range of goods in the United States, from Mexican-made cars and auto parts to beer and avocados. 
U.S. business groups have opposed the tariff plan and the influential U.S. Chamber of Commerce is looking at ways to challenge it, including legal options. 
MEXICAN ECONOMY
The Mexican economy which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, shrank in the first quarter and would reel under U.S. levies that would start at 5% but could reach as high as 25% this year under Trump's plan.
U.S. stock index futures fell on Monday as the multi-front trade war made investors increasingly risk averse and fueled worries of a recession, although the market ticked higher, propped up by healthcare stocks.
Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an ""America First"" agenda aimed at reshaping global trade, said in a tweet last Thursday that he would ratchet up tariffs on Mexico ""until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied."" 
Since January, the government of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has ramped up migrant detentions and deportations, but that has not been enough to stop the growing tide of families reaching the United States, mainly from Guatemala and Honduras.
In May, numbers are expected to have outpaced the 99,000 people apprehended at the U.S. border in April, with many of those crossing in groups of families who will mostly be released to await asylum hearings in the United States. 
Mexican officials in Washington on Monday warned that the tariffs could backfire, fanning further migration by hammering regional economies. 
""Tariffs, along with the decision to cancel aid programs to the northern Central American countries, could have a counterproductive effect and would not reduce migration flows,"" Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Martha Barcena, told the news conference.
The tariffs also ""could cause financial and economic instability,"" reducing Mexican authorities' capacity to address migration flows and ""offer alternatives"" to migrants fleeing Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, she said.
Approval of a deal to revamp the NAFTA free trade agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada is also pending and could be hampered by the latest dispute over immigration, Mexican authorities said. 
Jesus Seade, Mexico's deputy foreign minister for North America described the imposition of tariffs on Monday as a ""stumbling block"" that puts at risk passage of the trade deal. 
The talks in Washington come as Trump is out of the country on an extended trip to Europe. Several of his key advisers on immigration and trade issues are with him, including Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and immigration adviser Stephen Miller. 
The discussions will include a meeting of Mexican Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Monday, Mexican officials said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan also are expected to participate in talks, Mexican officials said. 

Mexican Economy Secretary Graciela Marquez and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will meet this week, as will Ebrard and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Talks on Fiat Chrysler's proposed merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA) became mired in politics on Monday, as France sought more concessions to maintain government influence over the new carmaker's management and French assets, sources told Reuters.
Italian-American FCA is in negotiations with Renault and its biggest shareholder, France, over the $35 billion merger proposal it pitched last week to create the world's third-biggest carmaker.
France, which owns 15% of Renault, has broadly welcomed the deal on condition it safeguards domestic jobs and plants - but political sensitivities have only increased as talks progress.
John Elkann, scion of the Agnelli family whose Exor holding controls FCA via a 29% stake, has sought to placate the French and Italian governments, while also keeping shareholders including Renault's alliance partner Nissan on board.
The FCA proposal would see both carmakers acquired by a listed Dutch holding company owned 50-50 by current FCA and Renault shareholders, after payment of a 2.5 billion euro ($2.8 billion) special dividend to FCA shareholders.
Responding to criticism from some analysts and French industry leaders that the deal undervalued Renault and its 43.4% stake in Nissan, Paris pushed for better terms.
The approach bore fruit over the weekend, as FCA discussed a Renault dividend and stronger job guarantees among concessions designed to secure France's support.
They include a Paris headquarters for the combined carmaker's Europe, Middle East and Africa region and its global chief executive, current Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, as well as a seat on the board for the French state, people with knowledge of the matter said.
As the two sides appeared to be converging on a deal, with the Renault board meeting on Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron's government upped its demands, two people close to the negotiations said.
The government is now pushing for a significant board presence on the French subsidiary that would oversee Renault assets and plants, the sources said - as well as an effective veto on future CEO appointments after Senard, who is 66.
French officials want to be able to ensure that the job guarantees and ""merger of equals"" philosophy underpinning the deal are respected, sources close to the Renault board said.
Renault, FCA and the French government all declined to comment on the ongoing negotiations.
As officials, bankers and lawyers were absorbed in what may be a final deal push, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was jeered on Monday by some of the 1,044 former  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) workers being laid off by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) - which had promised to safeguard their jobs when it acquired the business in 2015, along with their plant in Belfort, eastern France.
""It's understandable that the French government is pushing here and there, but FCA probably isn't ready to re-open the whole deal,"" one source close to the tie-up talks said. ""If it drifts back towards a quasi-French nationalized business, things may start to fall apart.""
In Italy, where the government has consistently said it supports the deal, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's right-wing League Party expressed annoyance with the French position.
France should sell its Renault stake to meet EU deficit limits rather than seek more influence, the party's economics spokesman Claudio Borghi said. ""By what right, in the Europe of liberalism and privatizations, can the French state negotiate seats on the board of a car company?""
FCA and Renault have also stressed they want to preserve the Renault-Nissan alliance - already strained by the arrest and ouster of chairman Carlos Ghosn, who is now facing trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges he denies.
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said on Monday the carmaker would conduct a ""fundamental review"" of its relationship with Renault if its tie-up with FCA went through. However, he conceded that FCA's arrival could bring ""opportunities for further synergies"".
The claimed 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in cost and investment savings would depend partly on FCA access to technology jointly owned by Nissan, executives acknowledge.
Renault had no comment on Saikawa's statement, company spokesman Frederic Texier said. But a source close to the French carmaker's board said it could have been worse.

""If you want to say no, you say no,"" he said.

The tariffs currently set for 5%, will rise every month until they reach 25% on Oct. 1, unless Mexico takes action to curb illegal immigration.
The higher levies are expected to result in an increase in prices in everything from cars to avocados for American consumers.
The following is a list of comments from companies on the proposed tariffs:
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG)
The U.S.-based Mexican-themed chain estimated a $15 million hit from Trump's proposed tariffs on Mexican imports, and said it could cover that by raising burrito prices by around 5 cents.
The company also said its margins would be reduced by 20-30 basis points if the tariffs were to take effect.
Chipotle does not disclose how much it imports from Mexico, but according to its last annual filing, a ""substantial volume"" of its produce is grown in Mexico and other countries.
Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI)
The jeans maker said the proposed tariffs would have a negligible impact on the company this fiscal year and that it would be able to substantially mitigate the effects of the levies in fiscal 2020 and beyond.
Levi's sources some of its products from Mexico, but does not disclose how much.
Wright Medical Group
The medical device maker said the proposed tariffs would have an immaterial impact on the company as it does not have any plants in Mexico, and both its customer and supply base in the country are very small.

1189,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>","In Chrysler, France May Be Served a Slice of Corporate Americana","(Bloomberg) -- Chrysler has bounced around between different owners for the better part of two decades. Next up: the French government.
If a board meeting slated for Tuesday goes according to plan and seals the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), the French government will end up owning a 7.5% sliver of the combined group. And while there are plenty of French companies owning U.S. household names -- think luxury house LVMH or advertising giant  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) -- the involvement of the state in a storied U.S. consumer brand is still an unusual corporate development.
That the French government would ascend to a stakeholder in Chrysler is testament to the twists and turns that have characterized the U.S. carmaker’s winding corporate road, as well as France’s long history as a Renault shareholder. Founded in 1925, Chrysler ascended to the Big Three that dominated American roads for decades, though it’s long been the scrappy player trailing behind General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
Germany’s  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) bought the company in 1998, only to unceremoniously divest less than a decade later amid mounting losses. Following the global recession, Chrysler combined with Fiat SpA, which has managed to turn the business around.
Among the company’s stable of products is the Jeep, which has a cult following among U.S. consumers and dates back to World War II, when the U.S. government solicited bids for a four-wheel drive vehicle to ferry soldiers over rugged European terrain. Chrysler’s lineup also includes Ram pickup trucks and Dodge Charger and Challenger muscle cars that have graces American garages for decades.
In the past, Chrysler churned out oversize, gas-guzzling LeBaron sedans and Plymouth station wagons. In many ways, that history runs counter to France’s auto industry, which built a reputation for zippy and quirky cars like the Citroen DS, Renault R4 and Espace or the Peugeot 504, a rugged and boxy station wagon popular in far-flung places like Africa.
Under the 34 billion-euro planned Franco-Italian deal, the French state’s 15% stake in Renault will be cut in half. While that might sound like a diminished role, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is still pushing for guarantees on French jobs and factories, as well as future influence. Paris is also pressing for boardroom representation along with operational headquarters for the combined company in France and the nomination of Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard as chief executive officer for four years, Bloomberg News has reported.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been mum about the potential deal. The “America first” leader has been a cheerleader for Detroit’s carmakers, with the exception of when they’ve closed plants or plotted investments in Mexico. He cheered Fiat Chrysler earlier this year for adding jobs in Michigan, but the company continues to operate several factories south of the border and recently cut a shift of workers at a plant in Illinois.
If the Renault board gives the green light to the deal, Jeep and Ram would become part of a broad mix of brands and nameplates, ranging from Italian marques Maserati and Alfa Romeo to the diminutive Fiat 500 and compact Renault Clio. Fiat’s founding shareholder, the Agnelli family’s holding company Exor NV, would be the single largest investor.

Shares of the social media giant were down nearly 7% in trading on the Nasdaq.
The news on Facebook underscores a growing U.S. backlash faced by Silicon Valley companies and marks another step by the Trump administration to regulate the biggest tech and social media companies. 
Trump, without providing evidence, has repeatedly accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices online. 
The FTC's new jurisdiction results from an agreement that allows the U.S. Justice Department to take the reins of a similar Google probe, the WSJ report https://on.wsj.com/2XvgaEl said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Reuters and other media reported on Friday that the Justice Department may investigate Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc , to determine whether the technology company violated laws to ensure fair competition.
Shares of Alphabet fell as much as 7% on Monday, their biggest drop outside earnings since April 2011.
U.S. antitrust regulators have divided oversight of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google, putting Amazon under the watch of the FTC and Google under the Justice Department, the Washington Post reported on Saturday.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while the FTC declined to comment.
Last month, Facebook co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate Chris Hughes called for the break up of the social network in an opinion piece in the New York Times.
He wrote that company CEO Zuckerberg had unprecedented power and said U.S. regulators needed to take action. At the time, Facebook rejected the calls for a breakup. 
Facebook owns the largest social network with more than 2 billion users across the world. It also owns WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, each used by more than 1 billion people.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc and Qantas Airways Ltd have been given the U.S. government's tentative approval to operate a joint venture after a prior effort was rejected in 2016.
The U.S. Department of Transportation on Monday issued an order tentatively approving the joint business agreement and tentatively granting antitrust immunity to the airlines covering international service. An application for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was rejected by former President Barack Obama's administration. 
The deal would allow the airlines to coordinate their planning, pricing, sales and frequent flyer programs, with new options and customer service improvements. The airlines planned up to three new routes within the first two years and increased capacity on existing routes, the department said.
American Airlines said a final decision is expected in the coming weeks.
""The joint business will also create additional jobs at our respective companies and in the industries we serve,"" said American Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker.
The department will require the airlines perform a self-assessment of the joint venture's impact on competition seven years after it takes effect and report their findings to the government, which could subsequently take action.
Regulators in Australia and New Zealand approved the first application for the joint venture before it was initially rejected by the U.S. Transportation Department.
American and Qantas in February 2018 made a second attempt to gain U.S. regulatory permission under President Donald Trump's administration for a venture that would let them coordinate prices and schedules. They threatened to cancel services if it was rejected and argued it could ""unlock"" up to $310 million annually in consumer benefits.
The revised application made significant changes, including removing a provision that would have barred either carrier from code-sharing with other carriers. Code-sharing is an arrangement between airlines in which two or more carriers publish and advertise a single flight under their own flight number.
The airlines argued in their 2018 application that the venture would lead to a reduction in fares and higher capacity as a ""more viable third competitor"" and require other carriers to respond with improvements in quality, schedules and prices.
Qantas said last year the joint venture would allow the two airlines to ""significantly improve service"" and ""stimulate demand."" The airlines said the agreement could generate up to 180,000 new trips between the United States and Australia and New Zealand annually.

U.S. regulators in 2001 approved similar joint venture agreements for United and Air New Zealand Ltd and in 2011 for Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Virgin Australia.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks went back into the red on Monday after regulatory fears sent shares of internet giants Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) sharply lower, particularly weighing down on the tech-laden Nasdaq.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) tumbled 7.4% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has secured the right to examine how the social media company practices affect digital competition. The stock was on pace for its biggest one-day drop since July 26.
Alphabet Inc tumbled 6.7% after sources told Reuters the U.S. Justice Department is preparing an investigation to determine if the Google-parent broke antitrust laws. Amazon.com slipped 4.3% on a report that the e-commerce giant could be put under the watch of the FTC.
""The concerns that the government is going to get involved and possibly break these companies up or impose fines on their operations is a major concern here,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
Facebook and Alphabet dragged the communication services sector down 3.09%, while Amazon shares pulled the consumer discretionary sector down 1.3%.
The ISM survey showed U.S. manufacturing growth unexpectedly slowed in May, accelerating demand for safety of government bonds. Two-year yields (US2YT=RR) hit their lowest since September 2017 on growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates to stave off a recession.
The data is the latest Sino-U.S. trade war fallout which flared up dramatically last month and ended with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening tariffs on all Mexico imports. Wall Street's main indexes ended May at least 6% lower and the S&P is now 7.7% away from its all-time high hit on May 1.

Healthcare stocks rose 0.40%, while the Nasdaq biotech index advanced 1.29%, helped by shares of companies including  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Merck & Co that reported positive drug data at the ongoing annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.
Amgen jumped 4.0% after its drug showed a high response rate in a small lung and colon cancer trial, while Merck rose 1.3% after data showed nearly a quarter of patients who received immunotherapy Keytruda as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer were still alive after five years.
Humana (NYSE:HUM) gained 1.4% after saying it would not make a bid to combine with health insurer  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp, which plunged 10.7%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.4% and was the biggest drag on the blue chip Dow index.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Green demands force European brewers to raise their drinks game,"By Philip Blenkinsop
ANTWERP, Belgium (Reuters) - European brewers expect they will need to tell more demanding drinkers as much about the environmental impact of a beer as its taste in the next decade as Europe enforces pollution laws.
The European Union has brought in waste management laws and banned single-use plastics in the last 12 months, as well as setting limits on carbon emissions from trucks, while Green parties gained in last month's European Parliament election.
""The changing political landscape is forcing us to think there will be a stronger push for topics like climate change,"" said Heineken Chief Executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer told the Brewers of Europe Forum in Antwerp on Monday.
Brewers at the gathering of some 1,000 beer specialists in the Belgian city said they would need to innovate to meet these new demands and the targets they have set for themselves.
""The biggest thing for us now as a new challenge is how do we make it sustainable,"" Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa) Chief Executive Cees 't Hart said. The Danish brewer has set itself green objectives which include cutting carbon emissions from its breweries to zero and water usage by half by 2030, with intermediate targets for 2022.
""We know how to reduce further. What we don't know is how we go from 2022 to 2030,"" Carlsberg's 't Hart said.
PACKAGING PUZZLE
Meanwhile Van Boxmeer, whose Dutch company introduced new targets for water use in March, said brewers still had work to do on packaging, whose CO2 footprint is 36 percent of the group's total, double that of the brewing process. 
""We have to deliver a lot more on the 36 percent ... That is perhaps one of the most technically challenging things we have to do,"" Van Boxmeer said.
Japan's Asahi Breweries, a relative newcomer to Europe, said innovation had to go beyond turning out new brand variants.
""Beyond the liquid, we're going to see innovation in the areas of pouring technology and packaging. There will be very important changes coming from that direction,"" Asahi's Paolo Lanzarotti, head of its central European operations, said.
Brewers also highlighted the rising trend for zero and low alcohol beers, which while profitable also reinforced the wider public health message of drinking responsibly. 
As a result the drinks industry faces potential legislation such as setting minimum pricing and in Ireland the possibility of giving drinkers warnings linking alcohol to cancer. 

""It is very important to be pro-active... before you get badly legislated,"" Van Boxmeer said.

If the tariffs on all Mexican exports suggested by Trump are enacted, the restaurant chain's costs could go up by about $15 million this year and reduce its margins by 20-30 basis points, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters.
Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) shares were down 2.45%. 
Trump said last week the U.S. will impose, starting June 10, a 5% tariff on all imported goods from Mexico that would ""gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.""
As well as the proposed tariffs, higher labor costs and a rise in avocado prices following a poor harvest in Mexico are also threatening to send costs higher.
Mexico, the largest supplier of agricultural produce to the United States, exported more than $8 billion worth of avocados and other vegetables to the U.S. last year.
Still, Chipotle added it could offset the increased costs by charging 5 cents more per burrito.
The shares were off 4.14% in May and have fallen 11.6% since hitting a 52-week high of $727 on May 20. Still, they are up 49% on the year."
1200,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>","Facebook, Google Regulatory Woes Erode $137 Billion From FANGs","(Bloomberg) -- A wave of antitrust probe headlines on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. just yanked about $137 billion from FANG stocks’ market values.
Some $41 billion evaporated from Facebook on Monday as a person familiar with the matter said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission will oversee antitrust scrutiny into whether the firm’s practices harm competition in the digital market under an agreement with the Justice Department. That added to early-morning losses as the group was hammered by a report the Justice Department was preparing an antitrust investigation into Google. Some $52 billion was erased from Google’s market value as the stock fell 6.9%, on pace for the lowest close since Jan. 3.
The move comes as politicians from both parties face increasing pressure to apply tougher regulation on tech and telecom giants like Alphabet and Facebook Inc. and even break up the companies -- which are among the largest in the U.S. For investors, tougher regulation most likely means a negative impact on profits, making it harder to justify the rich valuations of some of the world’s highest-flying stocks.
Two FANG megacaps that were not directly targeted -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). -- also sold off sharply. Amazon plunged 4.7% as about $41 billion was wiped out of the e-commerce giant. Netflix lost $2.5 billion from its market value as the stock fell 1.6%."

Eckert, a former executive of Bain Capital Ventures, will take over from Lori Flees, who ran Store No. 8, in addition to working as senior vice president of health and wellness at Walmart-owned Sam's Club, according to a memo sent by retailer's head of U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore, to its employees on Monday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
Flees will focus on her role at Sam's Club.
Store No. 8, which is based in California's Silicon Valley, works with startups that specialize in areas that include robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
It has so far launched several startups such as JetBlack, a same-day delivery service where customers can place orders using a text message and Spatial&, a virtual reality merchandising company.
Walmart has kept the startups separate from the broader organization so that do not affect the retailer's bottom line, according to former executives who ran the investment arm.
In the memo on Monday, Lore said that Eckert has ""built companies, raised substantial venture capital and brought disruptive technologies to market.""
""He has a record of turning innovative ideas into successful businesses and building them to scale, either within large organizations or as stand-alone companies,"" Lore added.
At Bain, Eckert evaluated potential new investments along with advising chief executives of existing portfolio companies, the memo said. 

Eckert will be based in Hoboken, New Jersey and report to Marc Lore.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 11:52AM ET</span>",Airlines scramble to overcome polluter stigma as 'flight shame' movement grows,"By Tracy Rucinski , Anna Ringstrom and Matthew Green
SEOUL/STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - In Lorna Greenwood's London home, there is a shelf lined with travel guides. But the 32-year-old mother and former government employment lawyer has given up flying.
Greenwood, who grew up enthralled by the possibilities offered by plane travel, is part of a growing group of environmental activists in Northern Europe who are shunning flights as concerns about global climate change increase.
""It's a tough pill to swallow, but when you look at the issues around climate change, then the sacrifice all of a sudden becomes small,"" Greenwood said.
A Swedish-born anti-flying movement is spreading to other European countries, creating a whole new vocabulary, from ""flygskam"" which translates as ""flight shame"" to ""tågskryt,"" or ""train brag.""
A number of famous Swedes have stopped flying, including opera singer Malena Ernman, the mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg who has thrust climate change into the spotlight.
""Flygskam"" was a major topic at a three-day airline summit in Seoul this weekend, with global industry leaders launching a counter-offensive. 
""Unchallenged, this sentiment will grow and spread,"" Alexandre de Juniac, head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) told some 150 CEOs.
The industry says it is shrinking its carbon footprint and its sustainability plan is among the most ambitious and globally focused of any industry.
""Come on, stop calling us polluters,"" de Juniac said at a news conference after detailing the global initiative. 
The IATA said the CO2 emission for each CEO's flight to Seoul was half the amount of a 1990 flight, largely thanks to more fuel-efficient aircraft.
STRUGGLE 
Commercial flying accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions today but without concrete steps, that number will rise as global air travel increases.
The aviation industry has set out a four-pronged plan to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and halve net emissions from 2005 levels by 2050.
But airline leaders acknowledge they have struggled to articulate their plans in a way that resonates with the public.
When CNN anchor Richard Quest asked a room full of aviation executives whether they had used an often available booking option to offset emissions from their own flights to the South Korean capital, only a handful raised their hands.
The industry's plan rests on a mix of alternative fuel, improved operations such as direct flight paths and new planes or other technology.
But a widely publicized March study funded by investors managing $13 trillion said airlines were doing too little.
""If we as an industry can provide better, more concrete answers...people will start to feel more comfortable that airlines are serious about this commitment,"" JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said in an interview.
OFFSET SCHEME
Questions remain over how airlines will slow, steady and finally reduce harmful emissions.
Use of sustainable-fuel would have the single largest impact, reducing emissions from each flight by around 80%, according to the IATA. The problem is that it is in short supply.
""The reality today is there's just not enough and it's too expensive,"" KLM CEO Pieter Elbers told Reuters. KLM last week announced a deal to develop and buy biofuels from Europe's first sustainable aviation fuel plant, due to open in 2022.
Still, the IATA targets 2 percent of total fuel supply from sustainable sources by 2025 and then expects a steady increase. 
In Europe, eliminating dozens of national airspaces borders could reduce fuel consumption by around 6 percent, but lobbying for a Single European Sky has been bogged down for years.
Airlines say small steps like single-engine taxiing and the use of lighter materials are cutting around 1-2% of emissions each year. 
MIND THE GAP 
In the absence of a quick and substantial reduction its carbon footprint, the industry has committed to a carbon-offset program.
The global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) allows airlines to purchase pollution credits from environmental projects.
It's unclear what will count as an ""offset"" and critics say such schemes hide how much effort is being made by industry and how much is being imported and at what price.
""The risk is that the price airlines are effectively paying for carbon will not be politically acceptable in 5 or 10 years,"" a senior aviation executive said, asking not to be named.
European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc told Reuters she favors reviewing available green technology every five years ""and then seeing if we can reach even further.""
For now, trains are benefiting from the anti-flight movement, although airline bosses in Seoul said that option barely exists in their busiest new markets such as Indonesia's archipelago.
In Stockholm, Susanna Elfors says membership on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group Tagsemester, or ""Train Holiday,"" has spiked to some 90,000 members from around 3,000 around the end of 2017.

""Before, it was rather taboo"" to discuss train travel due to climate concerns, Elfors said. ""Now it's possible to talk about this on a lunch break ... and everybody understands.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group aims to build a warchest of several billion dollars in the next five years to target financial technology in Asia, its chief said, as the Japanese megabank looks to chart a different path from its bigger rivals.
Mizuho is fighting to right its business after posting an 83% plunge in net profit in the last financial year, hit by impairment losses on fixed assets and an overhaul of its securities portfolio.
Once Japan's second-largest lender by assets, Mizuho has been recently eclipsed by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG). Its market value is down by a third in a little over a decade and it has largely stayed on the sidelines as top megabank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, in particular, has been more aggressive overseas.
""I have an image that we will be able to have several billion dollars for investment,"" chief executive Tatsufumi Sakai said in an interview with Reuters last week that was embargoed for release on Tuesday.
""I would positively consider digital businesses if there are opportunities in Asia,"" he said, adding he was not interested in investing in a traditional banking business overseas.
Mizuho has already made some forays into the digital space. In 2016 it jointly founded online credit scorer J.Score Co with SoftBank Corp. 
Last year, it agreed with Line, the dominant messenger app in Japan, to launch a smartphone-focused bank, aiming to start its operation in fiscal 2020.
But aggressive expansion appears unlikely. Under a mid-term plan that was unveiled last month, Mizuho is looking to boost a key measure of capital strength, its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, to more than 9% from 8.2% in fiscal 2018. As it stands, Mizuho's ratio is the weakest among the Japanese megabanks with SMFG boasting 10.3% and MUFG at 11.4%.
Mizuho is also aiming for a group net profit of 900 billion yen ($8.31 billion) by 2023 versus 408 billion yen in fiscal 2018. 
MUFG and SMFG each reported more than 1 trillion yen of group net profit in the year ended in March, while Mizuho fell well behind them in profitability.

Undeterred, Sakai said the bank would walk its own path. ""We are not chasing them,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is rolling out a new wealth management product that combines automated portfolios with human advice, becoming the latest brokerage to seek to boost business by blending digital with personalized financial planning.
It comes as competitors are increasingly offering hybrid advice models, in response to questions about the potential profitability of stand-alone robo-advisers. 
The new service underscores how Bank of America is targeting downscale clients even as certain banks like  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have opted to reserve human advice for wealthy customers.
The Bank of America service, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor, builds on its robo adviser launched in 2017, adding the ability for clients to call or make an appointment with a bank employee to discuss their financial goals.
Providing online investors access to a human adviser is growing more popular in the wealth management industry as studies have shown many clients prefer a combination of digital and personal advice. 
Robo-advisers typically use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost exchange-traded-funds for clients with as little as a few hundred dollars to invest. 
Merrill Guided Investing, which uses recommendations from the wealth management chief investment office, requires a $20,000 minimum investment for access to a financial adviser who can offer help over the phone, online, or in person at a Bank of America branch. 
The tiered offering is meant to attract young families and others in the early stages of wealth accumulation, head of Consumer Banking & Investment Aron Levine told Reuters. 
Bank of America estimates that 85 percent of its clients who are eligible for its wealth management products hold investments elsewhere. 
""It's critical for us to have the right wealth management solution to meet the needs of investors at every age, and every stage of their wealth accumulation,"" said Andy Sieg, president of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.
Research firm Aite Group expects digital wealth management to continue growing quickly over the next few years but said in a May 2019 survey that large incumbents will grow faster than start-ups as they leverage their massive distribution networks.
With a 0.85% annual fee, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor is more costly than many competitors' hybrid financial planning services. Betterment, a start-up robo-adviser, charges an annual fee of 0.4 percent for its premium service and has a minimum investment of $10,000, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's Intuitive Investor charges 0.5% annually with a minimum investment of $10,000.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court to hear IBM retirement fund dispute,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to weigh whether managers of a retirement fund for  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp employees that invested in the company's stock can be sued for failing to disclose that its microelectronics business was overvalued.
The justices will hear an appeal by IBM's retirement plan of a lower court ruling allowing the litigation to proceed. IBM is not a defendant in the case.
Participants in IBM's retirement plan have said that in 2013 the company's microelectronics division was incurring losses even though IBM said at the time it was valued at $2 billion.
The plaintiffs have said the Retirement Plans Committee of IBM, which oversees the fund, knew or should have known that the business was overvalued. The committee's members included senior IBM executives.
IBM sold the microelectronics business a year later at a significant loss, leading to a decline in the company's stock price. IBM paid GlobalFoundries Inc $1.5 billion to take over the money-losing unit and announced it would take a $2.4 billion write-down on the entire value of assets as well as $800 million of other unspecified costs.
The plaintiffs sued the committee and its members in 2015. A federal judge dismissed the complaint the following year. The New York-based U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a ruling last year revived the litigation, prompting the retirement plan committee to appeal to the Supreme Court. 
The court will hear arguments and issue a ruling in its next term, which starts in October.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Infineon has agreed to buy Silicon Valley-based Cypress Semiconductor for $10 billion, in an expensive move by Europe's largest chip-maker to expand further in next-generation automobiles and Internet technologies.
Investors swiftly gave the deal a thumbs-down on concerns that Infineon was paying a heavy price just as the chip business was weakening, pushing its shares 9% lower on Monday.
The deal would create an automotive leader with a 13% market share, coupling Infineon's prowess in managing electric drivetrains with Cypress's superior connectivity in areas such as in-car entertainment.
That would enable the combined company to offer more complete packages for electric vehicles that are expected to win a growing share of the car market as governments clamp down on emissions from petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles.
The cash offer of $23.85 per share represents a 46% premium to Cypress' share price over the last month, the Munich-based maker of power-management chips said.
That equates to a multiple of 4.5 times sales at San Jose, California-based Cypress. ""It's a proud price, no doubt,"" said Infineon CEO Reinhard Ploss.
""From our point of view it was an acceptable price, and if you look at the synergies, it represents an additional gain in value,"" Ploss told reporters on a conference call.
Chief Marketing Officer Helmut Gassel said discussions had been triggered by interest expressed in Cypress by another unidentified party. Infineon was invited to take part in the process around five weeks ago.
SHARE SLUMP
Infineon was among the few companies in a sector facing headwinds that could finance a deal that in more prosperous times might have been out of its reach, veteran CEO Ploss said.
Investors took a dimmer view, however, sending shares in Infineon sharply lower on fears that it was overpaying in a transaction that will be 30% financed through equity, with the rest paid for in debt and cash. Cypress shares jumped 27% to $22.74 in U.S. pre-market trading, below Infineon's offer.
""The overall risk-reward profile of the deal is unfavourable,"" Citi analysts said in a note, highlighting execution and regulatory risks, and promised long-term synergies that were hard to substantiate.
One trader speculated that Infineon could itself become a takeover target after the company twice lowered its revenue guidance this year as demand in China slowed and trade frictions escalated between Washington and Beijing.
Infineon shares traded at 14.61 euros in Frankfurt, representing a fall of a third since they last peaked in April, to value the business at 17 billion euros.
DEAL SURGE
The deal to create the world's No.8 chipmaker ranks as one of the biggest takeovers led by a European company this year.
It follows a string of recent semiconductor deals, including Marvell Technology Corp's sale of its WiFi and Bluetooth assets to NXP for $1.76 billion, and Marvell's earlier acquisition of Avera Semi for $650 million.
One banker close to the Infineon-Cypress deal said it could trigger more deal activity. ""Deals like this can beget copycat transactions,"" the banker said.
In semiconductors, global deals activity slowed to $23 billion last year from a peak of $107 billion in 2015, according to IC Insights, as the Trump administration stepped up scrutiny of tech mergers relevant to U.S. national security.
Infineon said it expected the deal, subject to regulatory approval, to close by the end of this or in early 2020. Cypress said it would have to pay a $330 million break fee if Infineon is outbid. Infineon should pay $425 million, in other situations, if the deal falls apart.
Infineon played down concerns that the takeover might be blocked by CFIUS, the U.S. panel that reviews whether deals might compromise national security, saying that Cypress's focus on automotive products meant its products were not sensitive.
Infineon has curbed deliveries of U.S.-sourced products to Huawei in response to Washington's imposition of export controls on the Chinese telecoms giant. It says that most of its business with Huawei remains unaffected.
SYNERGIES, FINANCING
The deal represents a bet on the growth of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the universe of connected devices ranging from robots to refrigerators that is expected to expand rapidly in the years ahead.
Infineon expects the deal to add to earnings in the first full year after closing.
It nudged up its long-term revenue forecast to 9% or more, lifted its main margin target by 2 percentage points to 19% and said its investment-to-sales ratio would decrease to 13 percent.
Infineon's leverage ratio, measured as gross debt to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) will exceed a target of two times before returning to that level in late 2022.

Still, Infineon expects to keep its investment grade credit rating after the deal, which Schneider said had been fully underwritten by banks  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), J.P. Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Cypress was advised by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

The U.S.-based Mexican-themed chain's finance chief Jack Hartung said its margins would be reduced by 20-30 basis points if the tariffs suggested by Trump are enacted, pushing up prices of avocados and other imports.
Mexico is the largest supplier of agricultural produce to the United States, exporting more than $8 billion worth of avocados and other vegetables north last year.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 08:49AM ET</span>",Spice maker McCormick's quest to make your vanilla milkshake cheaper,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO/ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (Reuters) - A kilo of vanilla beans costs more than a kilo of silver.
Cultivated painstakingly over years from an orchid plant, vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world, after saffron.
In less than five years, the wholesale price has risen nearly 500 percent, partly because of growing global demand for healthy, natural ingredients. But supply is an issue too: Cyclones, drought and crop-theft have hit Madagascar in recent years, slashing into the tender crop's quality and quantity. The African island nation produces about 80 percent of the world's vanilla.
For McCormick (NYSE:MKC) & Co, the world's largest spice company, the scarcity of vanilla has become too big a risk to ignore, spurring it to begin cultivating an alternative source on the north coast of Papua, Indonesia. McCormick, which sells vanilla and its extract to retailers, restaurants and packaged food makers, said it has been passing the higher costs on to buyers.
The price of black whole-bean Madagascar vanilla, the benchmark product, costs $520 per kilo. While this isn't quite the spice's record-high of $635 per kilo - reached after a ruinous cyclone in 2017 - it is still nearly six times the price of $87.50 per kilo in early 2015.
Back-to-back typhoons in 2017 and 2018 ""definitely put input pressure on costs,"" Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) U.S. CEO Steve Presley recently told Reuters.
The world's No.1 food company raised prices for U.S. ice cream products in 2017, partly due to mounting vanilla prices, he said. The Swiss food giant makes Haagen-Dazs, Edy's and Skinny Cow ice creams, which tout natural vanilla flavoring or beans on their labels.
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), which sells Haagen-Dazs outside the United States and in the brand's international ice cream parlors, said higher vanilla costs were forcing prices upward. 
Now, Donald Pratt, managing director of McCormick's global procurement arm, said the company is looking to Indonesia as a possible solution to the industry's supply problem.
But pulling this off may be an uphill task.
Indonesia produces only about 100 tonnes of whole vanilla beans a year, a far cry from Madagascar's output of about 2000 tonnes, Pratt said. And some others who have tried to cultivate a secondary source for vanilla have not been successful - Unilever's Ben & Jerry's, for instance, ""invested heavily"" in a similar project that backfired in Uganda.
'THE DARK SIDE OF VANILLA'
Vanilla - sometimes called green gold - is so coveted thieves will kill for it.
""This is the dark side of vanilla. You don't realize because it's such a sweet thing,"" said Cheryl Pinto of Ben & Jerry's, which uses vanilla in most of its ice creams, as well as in other items such as cookie-dough chunks. Pinto said she is in charge of managing the company's supply chain with a ""social mission"" in mind.
To protect their crop in Uganda, ""farmers were sleeping in these fields and there were murders and beatings,"" she said. ""It was awful."" 
This month, when setting harvest dates, the Ugandan government called out ""cases of theft and loss of lives"" spurred by higher prices. The violence goes both ways: Last year, Reuters reported Malagasy growers defending their fields by beating apprehended suspects to death.
Vanilla is valuable largely because it is laborious to grow.
For a graphic on vanilla cultivation and cost, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2WzjXmM
New vanilla vines take three to four years to produce orchids and can only be pollinated - by hand – a few days each year during a pre-dawn, four-hour window. From bloom to sale, the average production cycle is 16-18 months, and 600 hand-pollinated flowers yield only about 1 kilo of dried beans. 
The vines can flourish only if intertwined with small trees that provide support and shade. And they must be grown close to the equator.
Bourbon vanilla, which McCormick sells, is by far the most popular variety in the world. Though it has historically been cultivated in Mexico, it mostly has been produced in Madagascar for the past century because many farmers elsewhere found it such a time-consuming, delicate crop, not worth the uncertainty and price fluctuations. Pratt said he doesn't yet know how much Indonesia would have to produce to calm market prices. Tam Hun Man Tombo, a vanilla exporter in Madagascar, is skeptical farmers elsewhere are up to the task.
""I've been in the vanilla business for more than 30 years, and every time I hear the same refrain: Buyers are looking for other origins, buyers will be working with farmers in other countries,” he said. ""It is a threat to which we are accustomed. But we do not fear that too much. Indonesia cannot produce vanilla as good as Madagascar.""To boost production quickly, McCormick is scaling up training programs in Papuan farming communities. To produce beans of Madagascar's quality - to which consumers are accustomed - McCormick has been changing some practices related to soil and water management. 
McCormick is in discussions with CARE, a non-governmental organization that helped re-establish the market in Madagascar after the 2017 cyclone destroyed about 30 percent of the island’s vanilla crops. The agency has founded cooperatives in Indonesia as well as Madagascar that provide training for growers - often women - on crop production and management, as well as aspects of financial literacy. CARE has suggested other geographic alternatives, as well, including Uganda and Tanzania, said Elly Kaganzi, deputy director of CARE’s agriculture & market systems. 
Pinto told Reuters Ben & Jerry's efforts in Uganda foundered, however, because eastern buyers - mainly from China - swooped in and ""showed up to the village with a boatload of cash"" ahead of the government-sanctioned harvest date.
""We have not been able to get any vanilla out of Uganda,"" Pinto said.
Ben & Jerry's says it hasn't raised prices due to vanilla costs, choosing to absorb them and stay competitive. But retail prices for other companies' vanilla-containing products, from coffee sweetners to yogurt to extract, continue marching upward. 
As of May 30, a 2-fluid ounce bottle of McCormick's Vanilla Extract from Walmart (NYSE:WMT).com cost $8.12, up from $5.94 in May 2015, according to the retail consulting firm GlobalData. 

""Vanilla has always been a store-cupboard staple, a common product,"" said Neil Saunders, who heads the firm. ""Consumers might be surprised at the high cost, but what can they do if everyone from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Walmart is raising prices?""

Stocks fancied by both mutual and hedge funds have enjoyed higher annualized returns since 2013 than those liked by just one of the two investor types, strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a May 31 report, which noted that each of these three categories beat the S&P 500. Currently, stocks popular with both groups include Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL).
“Despite posing a tactical risk, concentrated ownership has generally been a positive signal for subsequent stock returns,” the strategists wrote. “Shared favorites (+18%) have outperformed our hedge fund VIP (+13%) and mutual fund overweight baskets (+15%) year to date.”
Investors often see crowded trades as a sign of an impending reversal. Indeed, crowded positions tend to fare badly in falling equity markets, the Goldman strategists wrote.

1228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",FedEx Drops After Being Caught Up in China-U.S. Spat,"(Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). dropped in pre-market New York trading as investors assessed the impact of a Chinese probe that puts the delivery company in the middle of an escalating trade conflict with the U.S.
China said Saturday that it’s investigating FedEx for “wrongful” deliveries, a move framed by the state news agency as a warning by Beijing after the Trump administration declared a ban on business with telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.
FedEx shares traded as low as $148.45 in pre-market activity, 3.8% below their close on Friday, and changed hands at $149.13 as of 5:55 a.m. in New York. The stock last closed below that level in June 2016.
China said it’s drawing up a list of “unreliable entities” that harm the interests of local companies. That opens the door to targeting a broad swath of the global tech industry, from U.S. giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). to non-American suppliers that have cut off Huawei, such as Toshiba Corp. and SoftBank Group’s ARM Holdings (LON:ARM).
A Chinese official said on Sunday that the government is firmly against the U.S.’s “long-arm” jurisdiction on Huawei, while downplaying concerns that the planned list of unreliable entities will be used to target foreign companies as a retaliation tool in the trade war.
FedEx, which had already felt the impact of China’s slowing economy due to trade tensions, apologized for errors involving Huawei packages following reports that parcels were returned to senders. China’s biggest tech company said it’s reviewing its relationship with the U.S. delivery service. Two packages containing documents being shipped to the company in China from Japan were diverted to the U.S. without authorization, Reuters reported.
China opened a probe because FedEx violated Chinese laws and regulations and harmed customers by misdirecting packages, Xinhua said. Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said Sunday that ""there’s no grounds to blame China"" for starting the investigation into FedEx. China Central Television said in a commentary the probe will be a warning to other foreign companies and individuals “that violate Chinese laws and regulations.”
FedEx said it values its business in China and its relationship with Chinese clients, including Huawei. “FedEx will fully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers,” the company said in a statement Saturday.
With markets roiled by the threats and rhetoric on trade, the S&P 500 had its worst month of May in seven years. Investors are now looking to a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month at the Group of 20 Summit in Osaka for a possible rapprochement and easing of trade tensions.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government wants new European Union executives to push for an end to the global tax exemption for jet fuel to reduce CO2 emissions but has dismissed opposition calls for a ban on some domestic flights to encourage train travel.
The 1944 Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation exempts kerosene from taxation, but environmental activists say the aviation fuel should be taxed to reduce air travel and limit the emissions that are causing global temperatures to rise.
French ""Yellow vest"" protesters demonstrating against President Emmanuel Macron's economic reforms have demanded higher taxes on airline travel and jet fuel, rather than hiking taxes on diesel for automobiles.
""Under the 1944 convention there can be no tax on kerosene in any country in the world, but this was introduced at a time when climate change and greenhouse gases were not an issue,"" Environment Minister Francois de Rugy said on BFM television.
""That convention needs to be changed, it is a priority that we will want to see for the next European Commission,"" he said.
A new Commission is due to take office in November after European Parliament elections in May saw Europe's Green parties make their strongest showing.
Earlier attempts by the EU to tax CO2 emissions by airlines have not succeeded. A 2011 proposal that would have forced airlines to buy carbon emission permits for flights in and to the EU foundered over resistance from China and other countries.
Opposition lawmakers, including former Socialist Environment Minister Delphine Batho and far-left La France Insoumise politician Francois Ruffin, have proposed banning domestic flights for trips that could be made by high-speed train.
""That is not very serious,"" De Rugy said. ""I am and have always been a green activist, but this proposal would mean we could no longer take the plane in France.""
He said air traffic between destinations connected by France's high-speed TGV train network had already fallen without any official ban.
""When the TGV arrived in my home town Nantes, air traffic virtually disappeared. The same has happened on Paris-Bordeaux, where airline travel fell 40% thanks to the TGV,"" he said.
But he said the train was not fast enough to offer an alternative on some domestic journeys.

Yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries slumped as much as eight basis points to 1.84%, the lowest since December 2017, while those on 10-year notes fell five basis points to 2.07%. That means the extra yield investors get to hold the longer-dated debt is a mere 23 basis points, reflecting pessimism about the outlook for the world’s largest economy.
Yields across the euro area were also lower, with the rate on 10-year German bunds falling one basis point to a record-low minus 0.21%.
JPMorgan predicted that 10-year Treasury yields will slide to 1.75% by the end of the year, compared with an earlier outlook for 2.45%. It sees the two-year yield falling to 1.40%.

1232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Glencore's Executive Departures Hasten as Oil Chief Leaves,"(Bloomberg) -- The generational change at the top of  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc gained speed on Monday, after the company announced the retirement of its long standing head of oil Alex Beard.
Beard, 51, was at one time seen as a possible successor to Glencore chief Ivan Glasenberg. He was all but ruled out for the job after Glasenberg said in December that the next leader will come from a younger generation. Beard will retire at the end of June.
Known for his acumen trading Russian oil, the British executive became the head of oil at Glencore in 2007 and helped lead the company through its initial public offering nearly a decade ago, becoming a billionaire on paper with a stake worth $2.8 billion in 2011.
Beard is one of the executives closest to Glasenberg, but has a mixed reputation among investors. Many blame him for a nearly $1 billion writedown from an ill-timed investment in oil production in Chad, just before oil prices crashed. He oversaw the oil business in Venezuela and Nigeria, which is now under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, and dealings with Brazil, which are the subject of separate investigations in the U.S. and Brazil.
Glencore shares have fallen more than 30% in the past year, and the stock is trading at a two-year low.
Going forward, the oil role will be split in two. Alex Sanna, 37, will oversee oil trading, while Peter Freyberg, 59, widens his current role as head of industrial assets to include oil production, according to a statement on Monday.
In promoting Sanna, a well-regarded diesel trader but an unknown executive outside the world of commodities, Glencore passed over other senior traders in its oil division, including Maxim Kolupaev, the head of crude trading and de-facto number two of the business.
Several of Glencore’s key executives, who also rank among its big shareholders, have left in the past six months. Chris Mahoney is stepping down as top boss of its agriculture unit after 17 years in the role. Telis Mistakidis, the head of copper marketing, and Stuart Cutler, head of ferroalloys marketing, retired last year.
The exit comes amid a broader generational shift at the company. Glasenberg said in December he would retire in three to five years and is actively searching for a successor. At the time, he said whoever takes the reins should be about 45 years old at the time of the succession, implying that none of the top traders who took the company public are likely to be chosen.
The leadership exits also raise the question of how soon the executives will sell their remaining Glencore shares.
With his retirement, all but five of the 13 top executives at the time of the IPO -- many of them billionaires or hundred millionaires -- have left the company. The only four remaining are Glasenberg, Chief Financial Officer Steve Kalmin, Daniel Mate, head of zinc; Tor Peterson, head of coal, and Giles Jones, who was chief risk officer in 2011 and now oversees U.S. trading.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 07:19AM ET</span>",Bonds 'on fire' as flight to safety gathers momentum,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A stampede to safety sent benchmark government bond yields tumbling on Monday, hoisted the Swiss franc to its highest in nearly two years, gold to a 10-week peak and left oil heading for bear market territory.
After a torrid May that wiped $3 trillion off global equities, the worsening trade tensions and broader economic backdrop made for a jarring start to June.
European shares and Wall Street futures both fell further after Beijing sent another shot across Washington's bows on trade and then euro zone data came in weak, though the main groundswell was in bonds.
German government bond yields -- which move inversely to price -- fell to a new all-time low and those on two-year U.S. Treasuries were trying for their biggest two-day fall since October 2008, when the global financial crisis was kicking off.
""Bonds are more or less on fire and I think we are going to spend the week with trade dominating everything else,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) global strategist Kit Juckes.
With German and UK political concerns and worries about Italy's finances resurfacing too, ""it is hard to think the yen is not going to be at least one of the winners this week,"" he said.
The Japanese currency consolidated Friday's biggest one-day jump in over two years at 108.40 yen per dollar, though Europe's go-to safety play, the Swiss franc, kept the rally going by scoring a near 2-year high against the euro. 
The euro, for its part, hovered at $1.1176 having been stuck in one of its tightest ranges ever against the dollar for weeks and waiting to see how generous the European Central Bank will be with a new tranche of cheap funding this week. 
Asian stocks had fared slightly better overnight as gains in South Korea and India offset a 4-1/2 month low for Tokyo's Nikkei. Chinese shares ended little changed though the yuan faced pressure.
A private survey of China's manufacturing sector published on Monday suggested a modest expansion in activity as export orders bounced from a contraction.
Economists noted increases in new export orders pointed to possible front-loading of U.S.-bound shipments to avoid potential tariff hikes that U.S. President Donald Trump - who kicked off a potentially confrontational state visit to Britain on Monday - had threatened to slap on another $300 billion of Chinese goods.
""Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the U.S. in order to avoid paying the tariffs,"" Trump said on Twitter shortly after landing in Britain. ""No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking billions.""
RISING TENSIONS, FALLING ACTIVITY
With the bitter trade mood weighing, factory activity contracted in most Asian countries and the euro zone last month, surveys showed.
The euro zone's slowdown was for the fourth month running, and at an accelerating pace, as slumping automotive demand, Brexit and wider political uncertainty took their toll.
""The sector remains in its toughest spell since 2013,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
A senior Chinese official and trade negotiator had said on Sunday the United States could not use pressure to force a trade deal, refusing to be drawn on whether the leaders of the two countries would meet at the G20 summit at the weekend.
The standoff between the world's two largest economies goes beyond trade, with tension running high ahead of the 30th anniversary of a bloody Chinese military crackdown on protesters around Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ).
China's Defence Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea, after acting U.S. Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Washington would no longer ""tiptoe"" around Chinese behavior in Asia.
""No one now thinks a deal would be possible at the G20. It is going to be a prolonged battle. Investors are rushing to the safe assets,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
BEWARE OF THE BEARS
The gloomy economic outlook has prompted traders to increase bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates sooner rather than later.
Fed funds rate futures are almost fully pricing in two rate cuts this year, one by September, with more than a 50 percent chance of a move by July 30-31.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to as low as 2.07%, a level last seen in September 2017 while bond market volatility gauges have now spiked to the highest in more than two years.
It was lively in commodity markets too. 
Brent oil futures tumbled almost 2% to $60.55 per barrel before pulling all the way back up to $62.55. They have dropped almost 20% since April, a plunge classed as a 'bear market' in trader parlance. 
Another bashing for industrial metals sent Shanghai Copper to a 2-year low as safe-haven gold jumped to a 10-week high of $1,316 per ounce.
Mexico's peso steadied, meanwhile, after being whacked 2.5% late last week by Trump's sudden threat to impose tariffs -- 5% to begin but potentially going up to 25%.

Mexico's president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hinted on Saturday his country could tighten migration controls to defuse tensions with Trump, saying he expected ""good results"" from talks planned in Washington this week.

1234,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>","Saudis Take Iran’s Oil-Market Share, Keeping OPEC Supply Steady","(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia ramped up oil production last month by the most this year, largely filling the gap created by tougher U.S. sanctions on its political rival, Iran.
Iranian output plunged in May to the lowest since 1990 as the Trump administration threatened penalties for anyone trading with the Islamic Republic, according to a Bloomberg survey of officials, analysts and ship-tracking data.
Nonetheless, the production boost by Riyadh, along with increases in fellow OPEC members Libya and Iraq, meant that overall output from the group remained unchanged in May from the previous month. OPEC pumps about 40% of the world’s oil supplies.
Iran’s production plunged by 230,000 barrels a day to 2.32 million a day, according to the Bloomberg survey. Saudi Arabia increased by 170,000 barrels a day to 9.96 million a day. Total supply from OPEC’s 14 members was unchanged at 30.26 million barrels a day.
President Donald Trump is tightening the squeeze on Iran’s oil exports amid a dispute that revolves around the country’s nuclear program, and has turned to America’s allies in Riyadh to keep global crude markets comfortably supplied. The survey indicates that Saudi Arabia, a long-standing antagonist of Iran, has been willing to oblige.
That sets the stage for a contentious meeting when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners gather in the coming weeks to consider production levels for the second half of the year. Iran has warned that the 59-year-old cartel is at risk of collapse because of aggressive moves by some members.
Despite the boost, the Saudis are still significantly below the limit of 10.3 million barrels a day agreed at the start of the year with a global coalition of producers, which spans fellow OPEC members as well as nations outside the group including Russia and Kazakhstan.
Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih has recommended that the alliance should keep the supply curbs in place for the rest of the year, as headwinds to global economic growth may reduce oil demand.
Oil prices slumped more than 11% in London last month as the trade dispute between the U.S. and China threatened to crimp growth in the world’s two biggest economies. Brent, the international benchmark, was trading around $62 a barrel on Monday.
While the Saudi production increase was still well inside the limits agreed with fellow producers, the same can’t be said of a boost by Iraq.
Baghdad raised output by 50,000 barrels a day last month to 4.63 million a day, meaning that it has now abandoned any of the restraint pledged under the OPEC agreement. As the Saudis have urged fellow OPEC members to abide by their individual targets, that could provide another source of friction when the producers get together.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 06:55AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nissan optimistic about FCA partnership, but wants right terms, source says","By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co is optimistic about partnering with a combined  Renault  and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), as long as it can protect the ownership of technology developed over two decades of working with Renault, a senior executive told Reuters.
The executive, who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said he was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of generating ""synergies"" by sharing Nissan's autonomous drive know-how, electrification and greenhouse-gas-scrubbing technologies for powertrains.
But he said the possible $35 billion merger of Renault SA (PA:RENA) and FCA would not give FCA the automatic right to use those technologies, which it needs to meet stringent emissions regulations and better compete in a industry being transformed by electric vehicles.
He also floated the possibility that Nissan could look at boosting its stake in Renault, or a merged Renault-FCA, to gain more say in shaping the future of the alliance. 
""We would go ahead with partnering or cooperating with FCA only if we can guarantee tangible benefits from sharing technologies with FCA and only if we can work out conditions that are satisfactory to us,"" the Yokohama-based executive said.
""If Renault wants to pursue this deal, we feel we need to look seriously at supporting them,"" he said.
The executive's comments highlight how Nissan could look to leverage its advanced technology to gain greater bargaining power with a merged Renault-FCA. Renault is Nissan's top shareholder with a 43.4% shareholding, while Nissan holds a 15% non-voting stake in the French automaker. That unequal partnership has long rankled Nissan, which is the bigger company by far. 
A Nissan spokesman referred Reuters to a statement issued on Monday, where Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said: ""I believe that the potential addition of FCA as a new member of the alliance could expand the playing field for collaboration and create new opportunities for further synergies.""
""That said, the proposal currently being discussed is a full merger which—if realized—would significantly alter the structure of our partner Renault. This would require a fundamental review of the existing relationship between Nissan and Renault,"" Saikawa said, adding that Nissan would analyze and consider its ""existing contractual relationships"".
BOOSTING STAKE?
If technology alone doesn't give Nissan enough leverage in negotiating with Renault and FCA, the executive said Nissan could consider boosting its stake in Renault or the merged FCA-Renault to gain more influence. 
The executive said Nissan has enough financial and other resources to pursue such an option, but declined to comment further.
More than a year ago, Nissan started an early study about possible benefits of adding FCA to the Renault-Nissan alliance, one begun at the instruction of ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn, the executive said.
""There is no doubt there are potentially many opportunities for Nissan to share technology with FCA,"" the executive said, referring to the study.
As examples, he pointed to the full-size pickup truck business in the United States between FCA's Dodge and Nissan brands, as well as the possibility of sharing with the Jeep and Alfa Romeo brands the advanced gasoline engine technology Nissan is now using for Infiniti, its premium brand.
FCA is discussing a Renault special dividend and stronger job guarantees in a bid to persuade the French government to back its proposed merger between the car makers, Reuters has reported. 
The deal would create the world's third-largest automaker, but it also raises difficult questions about how Nissan would fit into a radically changed alliance.
Despite being long-time alliance partners, the executive noted that Nissan was completely blindsided by news of the FCA deal. ""Renault did not give us the proper heads-up, and that should not have been like that.""
Still, he was optimistic that an enlarged alliance could work, at least from Nissan's perspective of sharing its technology.

""Cooking a meal for three or four isn't all that different,"" he said.

Investing.com -- It’s a tale of woe across Europe’s stock markets again on Monday, with a familiar cause.
The evidence that President Donald Trump’s trade war is choking the global economy is increasingly hard to ignore, and stock markets everywhere are pricing in a sharp slowdown in growth.
The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 2.7 points, or 0.6%, at 366.38 as of 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), its lowest since mid-February.
The latest moves come after China published a policy paper on trade at the weekend accusing the U.S. of “intimidation”, “coercion” and “exorbitant demands”. China has also started an investigation into the practices of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) in the country, citing customer complaints.
The impact of the trade dispute is taking an increasingly heavy toll on global manufacturing. Purchasing managers surveys released so far on Monday showed that activity in Japan and the euro zone contracted again in May,
Markets have barely recovered since Thursday, when Trump unexpectedly resorted to using the threat of import tariffs in his long-running efforts to pressure Mexico into stopping illegal immigration into the U.S.
Among individual movers in early trading, German chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn) fell to the bottom of the Dax after announcing the $9 billion acquisition (including debt) of U.S. rival Cypress (NASDAQ:CY).
Also in Germany,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares fell below 6 euros for the first time as the yields on German government debt also collapsed to their lowest ever in the latest wave or risk-aversion. Germany is suffering some unaccustomed political volatility after the resignation at the weekend of Andrea Nahles from the head of the Social Democratic Party.

1241,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street Warns of Mounting Recession Risk From Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s biggest banks lined up to warn investors of growing recession risks from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.
A global recession could start within nine months if President Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese exports and Beijing retaliates, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Separately, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). said the probability of a U.S. recession in the second half of this year had risen to 40% from 25% a month ago.
""Recent conversations with investors have reinforced the sense that markets are underestimating the impact of trade tensions,"" Chetan Ahya, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report. ""Investors are generally of the view that the trade dispute could drag on for longer, but they appear to be overlooking its potential impact on the global macro outlook.""
Such warnings may set the tone for financial markets and will inform this week’s gathering in Japan of the Group of 20 finance chiefs. The potential for a marked slowdown in the world economy was underscored Monday by weakening manufacturing gauges across Asia.
“Global growth now looks likely to slip below trend for the rest of this year,” JPMorgan Chief Economist Bruce Kasman and colleagues wrote in a report.
Also sounding the alert, economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said they now expect the U.S. to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion-worth of imports from China and on all Mexican goods, too. The bank lowered its U.S. second-half growth forecast by about half a percentage point to 2% and said its sees a greater likelihood of interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
""While it is a close call, the outlook has not yet changed enough for cuts to become our baseline forecast,"" Goldman analysts led by Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said in a note.
The rift between the Trump administration and China has escalated as each side blames the other for the breakdown in talks. The trade war is also taking on a global dimension amid simmering tensions between the U.S. and the European Union, while Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on Mexican goods in response to illegal immigration.
Morgan Stanley’s Ahya advised clients that if the conflict continues, growth will suffer as costs increase, customer demand slows, and companies reduce capital spending.
Analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). recommended investors buy U.S. Treasuries, noting the last time the world economy looked as it does now was at the start of 2016 -- which was followed by a meaningful slowdown worldwide.
“That episode may provide a useful blueprint for the coming months,” said Mark Schofield, Citigroup’s director of macro strategy. “The U.S. economy has been resilient up to now, however, persistent themes of softening tailwinds in the form of declining fiscal stimulus and strengthening headwinds in the form of trade tensions and China slowdown, are a threat.”

1242,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 04:10AM ET</span>",Infineon Will Buy Cypress Semi in Latest Chip Mega-Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Infineon Technologies AG (DE:IFXGn) agreed to buy Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (NASDAQ:CY) in a deal that values the U.S. target at about $10 billion including debt, the latest mega-deal for an industry grappling with slowing growth.
The deal confers an enterprise value of 9 billion euros ($10 billion) on Cypress, a memory chip maker re-positioning itself as a provider to automobiles and other connected devices. Infineon’s cash offer of $23.85 a share marks a 46% premium to Cypress’s average price over the past 30 days, the companies said in a statement confirming an earlier Bloomberg report.
Shares of Infineon fell as much as 6.5% during early trading Monday in Frankfurt.
The semiconductor industry has been reshaped over the past five years as companies combine to gain scale while fighting rising costs and shrinking customer bases.  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) recently announced a $1.76 billion deal for Marvell Technology Group Ltd.’s Wi-Fi connectivity business, while Nvidia Corp. agreed to buy chipmaker Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for $6.9 billion in March.
But Infineon until now has mostly sat on the sidelines. It’s lost almost a third of its value over the past year, as the European chipmaker twice revised its forecasts to account for global economic uncertainty and a slowdown in Chinese car sales. Infineon’s offer values Cypress at roughly $8.7 billion based on its outstanding shares alone, excluding debt.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Infineon’s reported plans to acquire Cypress may result in some arduous integration work, with the buyer focused on power chips and the target on Internet of Things and specialty memory. Infineon makes about a quarter of its sales in China, which has turned into a headwind as the economy slows. It will need stronger 2H sales to meet its 8 billion-euro sales guidance.
-- Anand Srinivasan and Johnathan Ritucci, analysts--Click here to read the research
Infineon’s target designs and manufactures flash memory chips and microcontrollers, or chips used for powering small electronic devices.
Cypress has been trying to recast itself as a provider of chips for use in vehicles and the growing market for so-called internet of things, the push by the electronics industry to connect devices. It’s told investors it expects its automotive business to grow 8% to 12% over the next five years and its IoT unit to expand at as much as 14% in that period.
Annual revenue, helped by an acquisition, has more than doubled in five years to $2.5 billion in 2018. Analysts are predicting that sales growth will disappear this year, forecasting a contraction of about 11%, according to the average of analysts’ estimates from data compiled by Bloomberg.
“This will accelerate the company’s path of profitable growth of recent years,” Infineon said in its statement.
It remains to be seen whether Infineon can win the necessary regulatory approvals in the midst of escalating trade battles. China effectively killed Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.’s planned $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors NV last year by withholding its blessing for more than 20 months. China later said it was not to blame for the deal falling apart.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.6% by 0720 GMT, extending losses from Friday that marked its worst monthly performance this year. Germany's DAX, which is particularly exposed to trade risks, was down 0.7% to a two-month low.
Stock markets globally took a hammering in May, with the STOXX sinking more than 6% as a series of new developments in President Donald Trump's trade war with China and others convinced some investors a slide into recession was possible over the next year.
Data on Monday showed factory activity across most Asian countries contracted last month, indicating tariff wars were taking a toll. Results of the latest surveys on European and U.S. manufacturing are due later in the day.
In M&A news, Germany's Infineon agreed to buy U.S. peer Cypress Semiconductors in a deal valuing the company at 9 billion euros, including debt. Infineon's shares fell 5%, putting it at the bottom of the STOXX 600.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Malaysia Airlines is looking at its order for 25 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jets ""very carefully"" in light of the global grounding and plans for the first delivery in July 2020 could be delayed, the carrier's chief executive said on Monday.
""I think our introduction to service will slide,"" Malaysia Airlines CEO Izham Ismail told Reuters on the sidelines of an airline industry conference in Seoul. 
""We are having a discussion and conversation with Boeing."" 
Malaysia Airlines has been trying to transform its operations as it recovers from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.
The Malaysian government is considering whether to shut, sell or refinance its loss-making national carrier, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in March.
Malaysia Airlines has been losing domestic market share to low-cost rival AirAsia Group Bhd and faces stiff competition in south-east Asia.
Izham said Malaysia Airlines' board had approved a restructuring plan in February that would be debated at the next board meeting of its owner, sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which is chaired by Mahathir.
Izham declined to divulge specific details of the plan. However, he said Malaysia Airlines would cut costs but remain a full-service carrier and planned to form more alliances like a joint venture with Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) agreed last week.
The venture with JAL on Malaysia-Japan routes, if approved by regulators, will help the carriers better align their flight schedules and could later be expanded to cover U.S. routes, he said.

The two carriers also plan to look at cooperation in ground handling, cargo, lounges as well as executive secondments, Izham said.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>",Oil loses luster as banks cash in on cleaner commodities,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks are beefing up trading teams in markets such as gas, metals and carbon permits that are flourishing as businesses and economies become greener, according to recruitment consultants.
The shift in staffing at the world's biggest investment banks comes at the expense of oil, which has fallen out of favor after being the most profitable and best-staffed commodities business for years.
Natural gas, which is considered a cleaner energy source than oil, and metals, which are essential components of batteries and for electrifying transportation systems, are now seen as a better bet, some headhunters said.
""As we move toward a decarbonized economy these businesses realize they need to be involved in electricity,"" said Jonathan Funnell at recruiters Proco Commodities. ""Oil (revenues) being so bad has brought this to the forefront.""
The world's 12 biggest investment banks earned a combined $2.5 billion from power, natural gas and metals last year, according to previously unpublished data provided to Reuters by consultancy Coalition https://www.coalition.com. That's more than five times the $450 million they made from oil.
Four headhunters specializing in commodities positions said hiring in the oil sector fell 20%-25% over the last 18 months or so. Hiring of power and gas specialists, meanwhile, rose about 20% and there was an increase in metals desks of 5%-10%.
Investment banks regularly chop and change teams depending on which markets are the most profitable and some consultants say the latest shift is just the result of a poor performance in oil over the last two years.
In some cases, investment banks have just been rebuilding power and gas teams they had a few years ago. Recruiters and industry sources say oil is still the best staffed commodities business, with power and gas in second place and metals third. 
But some believe the greening of industries and economies could eventually lead to a change in the hierarchy.
""In the next five years, banks may have more people in power and gas than in oil,"" said Dylan Pany at recruitment consultants Phaidon International.
CRUDE EARNINGS
Overall, commodities businesses have become far less profitable for investment banks as tougher capital regulations have reduced their ability to take positions in physical markets, or own assets such as warehouses for metals.
Some banks suffered huge commodities losses during the financial crisis and performances since have been patchy, leading them to cut back on commodities operations. That has allowed trading giants and brokers subject to less onerous regulation to take the lion's share of the commodities market. 
According to Coalition data, net revenue from commodities at the 12 largest investment banks, a group including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), plunged from more than $13 billion in 2009 to $2.5 billion in 2017 and $3.6 billion last year. Coalition measures income from trading, selling derivatives and other activities. 
But revenues from oil, which typically accounted for a quarter to a third of the overall commodities income, slumped the most over the last few years.
Banks' commodities revenues: https://tmsnrt.rs/2KdGcYF
Behind the recent weakness was lack of demand for hedging and trading losses at several banks in the second half of last year, said Coalition research director Amrit Shahani. ""Client activity was low and trading conditions were difficult.""
Oil prices plunged during the last quarter of 2018 from a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel in October to below $50 at the end of December. Oil prices have bounced back somewhat this year boosting revenues, though Shahani said banks might have earned more if they hadn't been cutting back their oil teams and being more cautious in trading.
Investor interest in metals, power, gas and carbon prices, meanwhile, has revived in part thanks to price rallies and bumper trading volumes. 
Metal prices surged from 2016 to the middle of 2018 after an environmental clampdown on polluting smelters and mines in China threatened to curtail supply. Some metals, such as copper and nickel, have also been boosted by hopes electrification will require more material for wiring and batteries, although a trade row between Washington and Beijing has since weighed on prices.
High volumes and volatility in gas futures on the U.S. NYMEX exchange also created opportunities for banks to make money, while European carbon permits, which come under banks' power and gas desks, have tripled in price since the start of 2018.
HIRING AND FIRING
Industry sources said banks including Citi, JPMorgan and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) have been building up their power and gas businesses in the United States, where Goldman Sachs has also expanded in power. 
In Europe, Morgan Stanley has re-entered the gas and power market after leaving in 2015 and now has three to five people, while Bank of America, which left the market in 2014, has returned with about three people, sources said. 
HSBC, meanwhile, has expanded in industrial metals after pulling back in the mid-2000s and now has a handful of staff in trading and sales, sources said. 
""Our clients have also increasingly been asking for us to provide base metals coverage as existing providers have scaled back,"" said HSBC's head of precious metals, Paul Voller.
Citi, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Commodity Appointments said they had placed almost 20% fewer staff in oil departments across the industry - including banks, brokers and trading firms - in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the same period of 2018. Placements in power and gas rose by about 15% and in metals by 7%.
Phaidon International said hiring in gas and power was up 15%-20% over the past year compared to the previous year. Metals hires were up 5%-10% while oil was down 25%.
Eleven Recruitment said it placed no one in an investment bank oil team in the 2018-19 financial year but demand for gas and power specialists was so strong it changed its name last year from Oil Recruitment.
Proco Commodities' Funnell said hiring in power and gas was up across the industry by some 20%, with areas such as market analysis and origination - finding and signing clients - up 40-50%. But the number of oil trading placements Proco has made since 2017 has halved, said chief executive Chris Powell.
The 12 banks included in Coalition's data are Bank of America,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Citi,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and UBS.

Together they account for about two-thirds of total investment bank earnings in commodities, according to Coalition data. Of the 12, the top performers in commodities have been Morgan Stanley, Citi, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>",Can a derivative turn Europe's green energy dream into virtual reality?,"By Stephen Jewkes and Isla Binnie
MILAN/MADRID (Reuters) - Italy's Ferrero is famous for its red-and-white Kinder chocolate eggs. But soon it may hope to be able to slap more green on the wrapper. 
The confectionery giant, which runs its own gas-fired power plant near its factory in northern Italy, is in early talks to help finance a new clean energy plant, possibly a solar farm in the sunnier south, according to three sources familiar with the matter. 
Like other companies in Europe, Ferrero is under growing pressure from investors and authorities to shift toward greener energy. But without enough wind or sunshine on its doorstep to provide a renewable alternative, it's looking to a new financial derivative known as a virtual power-purchase agreement.
These complex contracts are effectively insurance policies for renewable project developers against the risk of falling power prices, with the premiums paid by companies like Ferrero to support sustainable energy even though they remain plugged into fossil fuels. 
Virtual PPAs are slowly beginning to gain traction in Europe, and other companies considering the option include French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), two separate industry sources told Reuters. 
Telecom Italia, Italy's No. 2 energy user, is discussing a possible PPA of up to 30 years, while Kering plans a deal involving funding a renewable plant in Italy, said the sources. 
Ferrero confirmed its interest in PPAs but said it was premature to make any decision, while Kering said it was looking at the idea. Telecom Italia also said it was interested and had been approached by energy companies. 
Many firms now fund schemes such as planting forests to offset emissions, but shareholders and authorities want companies to underwrite the direct addition of new renewable generation to grids.
""Investors are increasingly calling on companies to go greener and offer 'additionality' to show they're serious about funding new clean projects,"" said Aldo Bonati, manager at Italian fund Etica Sgr which counts renewable group Erg and offshore wind developer Orsted among its investments. 
    Since PPAs do not require companies to reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions, their direct contribution to tackling climate change may be limited. Nevertheless, advocates believe the instruments can help catalyze a broader shift to clean energy sources by financing projects. 
The European Union has urged states to boost green PPAs to help it meet a third of the bloc's energy demand from clean sources by 2030. Renewable energy accounted for 17.4 percent last year, little changed from 2016.  
""The big development in renewables in Europe in coming years to meet 2030 targets will mainly be through PPAs,"" says Antonio Cammisecra, head of green business at Europe's biggest utility, Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI). 
Graphic on renewable energy and CO2 emissions in EU: http://tmsnrt.rs/2XIzjC6 
VIRTUAL CONSUMPTION
Companies in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) struck PPA deals for clean energy projects with a total capacity of 2.3 gigawatts (GW) last year, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The level more than doubled from 1.1 GW in 2017. 
Big utilities like E.ON, RWE and Engie have all struck PPA deals to help finance renewable projects in Europe. 
To put the figures in perspective, 2 GW can power around one million households, but is still a fraction of the more than 500 GW of renewable energy capacity that was installed in Europe by the end of 2017. 
Europe still lags the United States, a more mature market where tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have used the instruments to bolster their green credentials. U.S. companies signed 8.5 GW of PPAs last year, almost triple the level of 2017 and more than 60 percent of global activity. 
The contracts are offered by middlemen, known as offtakers, often big energy trading companies like Switzerland's DXT and utilities like Enel. 
Under a typical PPA, an offtaker enters an agreement with a renewable developer, effectively guaranteeing it a fixed price for the electricity it produces. The offtaker will pay a refund if the price dips below the set rate. 
The offtaker in turn enters into a mirror agreement with a corporate customer. The company agrees to fix its own power costs at a set price for up to 10 years or more, but if those bills exceed the fixed price agreed in the PPA, the offtaker will refund the difference. 
The two agreements transfer the developer's main risk - that power prices will fall - to the offtaker, which in turn hedges its position by persuading a company to fix its power costs. In this way, the corporate customer ""virtually"" consumes the power from the renewable project. 
Without such an agreement, a new renewable project, exposed to the ups and down of the wholesale power market and unable to count on generous subsidy schemes that once held sway across Europe, could struggle to raise bank finance. 
RISKS VS REWARDS
There are, of course, inherent risks. 
For corporate customers, locking in large supplies of power for years can guard against rising prices, but can prove unfavorable if markets move lower. The converse is true for developers, who can lose out on income should prices rise. 
Other potential turnoffs include the sheer complexity of contracts and the legal complications in the event one link in the chain becomes insolvent and unable to maintain commitments.
In the United States, energy group PG&E Corp is looking to rescind costly PPAs as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization.
The fact PPAs have made a much slower start in Europe means there are fewer precedents than in the United States, which makes companies even more wary of committing to deals. 
As a result, only a few long-term PPAs - usually measured as more than 10 years - have been sold on the continent, many to companies with experience of the U.S. market. They include German carmaker Mercedes-Benz and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE). 
But some European companies are ready to take on risk. 
""In Europe there is no liquid long-term forward market for power beyond 2-3 years so without price signals there is the risk of booking a loss,"" said Antonio Gozzi, head of steel group Duferco, which last month signed Italy's first corporate PPA deal for wind power.
""But you have to offset that with the marketing advantages."" 
SUNNY SPAIN
Spain is emerging as a hot spot for PPAs, although deals are often structured differently with the middleman trading the renewable energy produced to various customers. 
Greenpeace has signed a deal to power its Madrid offices from a wind turbine in Barcelona. Under that agreement, accounted for as an advance payment, the provider gives a guarantee every hour for the origin of the electricity, meaning when the turbine stops for maintenance, Greenpeace knows it is paying for power from another renewable source.
Spanish renewable energy producer Acciona is talking to some Spanish companies about virtual PPAs but discussions are primarily with U.S.-based multinationals, said Eduardo Sola, Acciona's director of global origination. 
""Spain's potential is it has big solar and wind resources which allow us to be competitive in a virtual contract with the rest of Europe,"" he added. 
Enel, which counts Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Facebook among its PPA clients in the United States, recently signed a wind PPA with Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) and is talking to other EU corporates who are already clients. 

""It's not an easy walk,"" said Enel CEO Francesco Starace. ""But in a few years PPAs will become common practice in Europe.""

1251,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>",Trump’s India Trade Threat Demands Cool Heads,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump just piled another problem on to the already-full slate of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. By removing zero-duty access for $6.3 billion of Indian goods, the U.S. leader threatens growth at a time when India’s economy can least afford it.
The country’s unemployment rate was at a 45-year high of 6.1% in the year to June 2018, while economic growth in the March quarter of 2019 slowed to a five-year low of 5.8%, data released Friday showed. Publication of the jobless statistic was held back until after Modi won last month’s general election and took his oath for a second term on Thursday, though it had leaked anyway.
Demand for Indian goods in the rest of the world needs to perk up to create space for GDP growth and job creation. Trump’s trade action is, therefore, bad news. With the domestic auto industry in a tailspin, losing duty-free access to the U.S. could lead to closures of some of India’s less-competitive small engineering firms. India is the largest beneficiary of the so-called generalized system of preferences, or GSP, under which developed countries encourage developing economies to industrialize.
By targeting India, Trump isn’t opening another front in the trade war, after China and Mexico. He is sending a warning shot that the U.S. expects New Delhi to do more to prove it’s a Washington ally.
The U.S. has a history of wielding the GSP privilege as a stick, as I wrote in March when the tariff action against India was first announced, most famously using it to effect regime change in Chile in the 1980s. In India’s case, Washington’s goals could range from arm-twisting New Delhi to stay away from Iranian crude oil to pressuring it to tone down the growing rhetoric – and regulatory action – around data sovereignty. The Trump administration will be loath to see India mimicking China’s strategy of building its own e-commerce, search and fintech champions, keeping out Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Paypal Holdings Inc.
Another long-standing friction between the two countries involves cheaper generic drugs. India meets almost 40% of U.S. demand. Should Trump drive a hard line around poor quality and price fixing, the consequences for India’s economy could be serious.
By appointing Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, a former ambassador to both the U.S. and China, as his new foreign minister, Modi has acknowledged the gravity of the trade war. Being in the camp of either superpower is risky. On the one hand, India has to reduce its $53 billion bilateral trade deficit with the People’s Republic; on the other, it has to squeeze itself on to the shortlist for a non-China-centered global electronics supply chain. India’s 5G network rollout will see the government grappling with the question of whether it should join Trump’s ban of Huawei Technologies Co. or strike a more conciliatory tone with its neighbor and largest trading partner. Just as any new deal with the U.S. will be multifaceted, any bargain to be struck with China will also have to include a long-simmering border dispute, and getting Beijing to influence India’s relations with Pakistan, currently at their nadir.
The loss of GSP privileges is an economic challenge, but it’s also a diplomatic opportunity. Having won a landslide electoral victory, the Indian leader doesn’t need to respond in kind to the White House’s machismo just to please voters. On the contrary, this is a chance to reconsider some of India’s sillier regulatory decisions of the last six years, such as curbing the maximum price of heart stents and knee implants by as much as 70%. That was an own goal because it kept the more U.S. innovative versions out of India, and gave a windfall to Chinese device producers.
India’s economic situation calls for cool heads. Investment is anemic, consumption is faltering, and all domestic balance sheets – for households, companies, banks, shadow financiers and the government – are stressed. Trump has thrown down the gauntlet. Modi should respond by instilling more pragmatism into India’s trade and investment policies."

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component declined 0.7% and 0.6% respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.6%.
Over the weekend, China issued a white paper that claimed the U.S. is an untrustworthy negotiator and blamed it for starting global trade problems.
The escalating trade war has not “made America great again” and “will only make things worse for all sides,” the paper said, as trade actions taken by U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have done serious harm to the U.S. economy due to increased production costs.
Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said at a press conference on Sunday that the main reason trade talks stalled last month was that “the U.S. has backtracked.”
“During the consultations, China has overcome many difficulties and put forward pragmatic solutions. However, the U.S. has backtracked, and when you give them an inch, they want a yard,” Wang said.
Separately, Dai Xianglong, former governor of the People’s Bank of China, warned in a press event on Friday that the global economy would decline “if the China-U.S. trade war continues to grow larger, it may cause the global economy to decline.”
“The consequence of the China-U.S. trade war not only will be reflected in both countries, but will also extend to relevant regions, extend to the whole world.”
“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” he added.
On Sunday, China implemented previously announced tariff hikes and said it will take action against “unreliable” foreign companies, with a list of violators pending.
Although not a major directional driver, a private survey showed China’s Caixin/Markit factory Purchasing Managers’ Index for May was 50.2, slightly above the expected level of 50.
“The stronger rise in overall new business supported a renewed expansion in buying activity among Chinese manufacturing firms. Though only slight, it was the first time that purchasing activity had increased for five months,” Caixin said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.2%.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.7% even after data showed the country’s headline Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index in the manufacturing sector fell to 48.4 in May, from 50.2 in April.
The contraction was at its fastest pace in three months.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 10:17PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. set to grant tentative approval to American, Qantas venture - sources","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department is expected to provide tentative approval to a bid by American Airlines Group Inc and Qantas Airways Ltd to operate a joint venture, two people briefed on the matter said on Sunday.
The department is expected to issue an order tentatively approving the joint business agreement and tentatively granting antitrust immunity, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The order, which is expected as early as Monday and would be subject to public comment, is likely to include conditions to protect competition and allow for government oversight of the venture, the sources added.
A department spokesman declined to comment on the matter.
The application by American and Qantas for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was tentatively rejected in November 2016 by former President Barack Obama's administration amid opposition from rival carriers Hawaiian Airlines Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp.
Regulators in Australia and New Zealand approved the first application for the joint venture before it was rejected by the U.S. Transportation Department.
American Airlines spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said on Sunday the airline feels ""we have made a compelling case about the benefits of the joint business for customers, and there was no opposition raised to our proposal. We're hopeful the Qantas joint business will be approved.""
American and Qantas in February 2018 made a second attempt to gain U.S. regulatory permission under President Donald Trump's administration for a venture that would let them coordinate prices and schedules, threatening to cancel services if it was rejected and arguing it could ""unlock"" up to $310 million annually in consumer benefits.
The revised application made significant changes including removing a provision that would have barred either carrier from codesharing with other carriers. Codesharing is a arrangement between airlines in which two or more carriers publish and advertise a single flight under their own airline number.
The airlines argued in their 2018 application that the venture would lead to a reduction in fares and higher capacity as a ""more viable third competitor"" and require other carriers to respond with improvements to quality, schedules and price.
Qantas said last year the joint venture would allow the two airlines to ""significantly improve service"" and ""stimulate demand"". The airlines said the agreement could generate up to 180,000 new trips between the United States and Australia and New Zealand annually.
The airlines said if the bid were rejected it could result in Qantas reducing the frequency of, downgrading or even cancelling its A380 service between Sydney and Dallas/Fort Worth, while American may further reduce service between Los Angeles, Sydney and Auckland.
The airlines started sharing codes on each other's flights in 1989, co-founded the ""oneworld"" marketing alliance in 1999 and formed a deeper partnership in 2011 without antitrust immunity.
American Airlines and Qantas currently rely on codeshare agreements to make those routes economically viable. If the venture is granted final approval, the two could offer more flights, including to cities not currently served by either, they said.
New routes for Qantas could include non-stop flights from Brisbane to Chicago, Dallas or Seattle, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said on the sidelines of an airline industry conference in Seoul.
""We have a number of different, very good routes and plans for a very good expansion into the U.S. when it is approved,"" he told reporters.

U.S. regulators in 2001 approved similar joint venture agreements for United and Air New Zealand Ltd and in 2011 for Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Virgin Australia.

R&B singer SZA, who is black, said in April she was racially profiled at a Sephora store in Calabasas, California.
""We have been informed of an incident at our Calabasas store and in addition to reaching out to SZA directly, we are gathering more information about the incident in order to take the proper next steps,"" Emily Shapiro, a spokeswoman for Sephora, told Reuters in an email. ""We take complaints like this very seriously, profiling on the basis of race is not tolerated at Sephora.""
SZA said a Sephora employee she identified as ""Sandy"" called security to make sure the singer was not stealing from the store. ""We had a long talk. U have a blessed day Sandy,"" SZA said in a Twitter post.
Shapiro said the Sephora closures were not ""a response to any one event,"" saying that planning for the ""inclusivity workshops"" had been in progress for several months and that a broader campaign called ""We Belong to Something Beautiful"" had been in the works for at least a year.
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH is based in Paris.
SZA was quoted in an interview with U.S. digital publisher Refinery29 last year as saying she previously worked in the skin-care department at a Sephora store.
""You are a part of the Sephora family, and we are committed to ensuring every member of our community feels welcome and included at our stores,"" Sephora said at the time in a response to the singer's post. 
SZA is a Grammy nominee who also collaborated with Kendrick Lamar on the song ""All the Stars"" for the blockbuster movie ""Black Panther.""
After SZA's tweet following the incident, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reviews for the Calabasas store spiked, with many users criticizing Sephora over the incident. 
Barbadian singer Rihanna last month unveiled her new fashion brand with LVMH, a rare move by the French group to set up a label from scratch as it taps into soaring demand for celebrity collaborations in the luxury world.
Sephora's workshops come about a year after Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) closed 8,000 stores across the United States for anti-bias training after a Philadelphia cafe manager's call to police resulted in the arrests of two black men who were waiting for a friend.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>","Collapsed Jet Airways' ex-partners, rivals scramble to fill India capacity void","By Jamie Freed
SEOUL (Reuters) - Former partners and rivals of Jet Airways Ltd are launching replacement routes and looking for new codeshare partners as they scramble to fill a lucrative gap left by the collapse of the India's once-largest international airline.
Jet, which halted operations on April 17 after running out of cash, had a market share of around 12 percent on international flights to and from India in 2018, according to government statistics, outstripping even national carrier Air India.
In Jet's absence, cash-strapped Air India is the only Indian carrier that operates widebody jets capable of non-stop flights to Europe and the United States, although the Vistara joint venture owned by Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines Ltd has 6 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787s on order due for delivery from next year.
With international airfares spiking by up to 36 percent in May and June according to data from travel portal Yatra.com, Jet's former partners, Virgin Atlantic and Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), have been among the first to announce new Indian routes to replace ones previously flown by Jet.
""People still want to travel. Foreign carriers are changing their networks and putting more into India if they can,"" Association of Asia Pacfic Airlines Director General Andrew Herdman said on the sidelines of an airline industry conference in Seoul.
KLM and sister carrier Air France will boost their capacity in India by 25 percent in the upcoming winter season through the use of bigger planes, higher frequencies and a new Bangalore-Amsterdam route from October.
In October, Virgin Atlantic will launch Mumbai-London, while Delta will fly from Mumbai to New York from December, in a sign it will take months to replace Jet's non-stop capacity.
""I think you'll see in the next four or five months most of the (domestic) capacity will be taken up,"" SpiceJet Ltd Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview. ""As far as international is concerned, that may take a little longer as Jet was flying a significant number of widebody aircraft which are tougher for carriers in India to add at such a rapid pace.""
Other airlines, like Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines, will need India's newly re-elected Modi government to loosen bilateral restrictions that cap flights at current levels. Singh said that was unlikely due to India's policy of trying to develop its own hubs.
The capacity gap in the Middle East means fares in that market are expected to remain higher for longer than on some domestic and other routes, Indian low-cost carrier IndiGo's Chief Financial Officer Rohit Philip told analysts on May 27.
IndiGo has a codeshare agreement with Turkish, and days after Jet stopped flying SpiceJet signed a codeshare agreement with Emirates. Neither Indian carrier has widebodies.
Airbus SE Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said new technology, such as a longer-range version of the A321neo, could help IndiGo launch non-stop flights to Europe without taking the costlier and riskier decision to add widebodies to its fleet.
""I think you are going to see some widebody capacity going into India to replace Jet's and you are going to see some narrowbodies picking up that market,"" he told reporters.
Other former Jet partners are in talks with carriers like IndiGo and SpiceJet about new codeshare relationships. 
Qantas Airways Ltd does not fly to India itself but it had used Jet to boost its reach beyond Singapore to Indian destinations and wants a new partner for the large market, CEO Alan Joyce said.

""They were a big partner and we were carrying a lot of traffic on them,"" he said. ""We have been approached by just about every major Indian carrier because they know there is a lot of traffic that we can provide them. We have had dialogue in the last few days with four different carriers about possible agreements.""

1257,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>",Trump Downplays Chance of Tariffs on Australia After NYT Report,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump downplayed the chance he would impose tariffs on Australia, a top U.S. ally, after the New York Times reported his administration considered doing so last week.
Asked about the report on Sunday before a visit to the U.K., Trump said the U.S. had very strong ties with Australia, without directly mentioning tariffs.
“The Australian situation is interesting but the relationship is very strong,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “No, we’re doing a very special relationship with Australia.”
Some of Trump’s top trade advisers had urged tariffs on Australia to stem a surge of aluminum from the country over the past year, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the discussions. The administration at least temporarily decided not to take action after objections from officials at the Defense and State Departments, the report said.
As a close security ally of the U.S. and the most China-dependent economy in the developed world, Australia’s $1.3 trillion economy already had a lot to lose as the world’s two biggest trading nations lock horns. China buys 35% of Australian exports, equivalent to about 8 percent of gross domestic product, and dominates iron ore shipments and education.
The prospect of the U.S. targeting Australian trade has received little analysis. The two fought together in every major war in the 20th century and the U.S. is a major investor in Australia, although their trade relationship isn’t particularly significant."
1258,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 05:41PM ET</span>",U.S. regulators say some Boeing 737 MAX planes may have faulty parts,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Sunday disclosed a new problem involving Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX, saying that more than 300 of that troubled plane and the prior generation 737 may contain improperly manufactured parts and that the agency will require these parts to be quickly replaced.
The FAA said up to 148 of the part known as a leading-edge slat track that were manufactured by a Boeing supplier are affected, covering 179 MAX and 133 NG aircraft worldwide. Slats are movable panels that extend along the wing's front during takeoffs and landings to provide additional lift. The tracks guide the slats and are built into the wing.
The 737 MAX, Chicago-based Boeing's best-selling jet, was grounded globally in March following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash after a similar Lion Air disaster in Indonesia in October. The two crashes together killed 346 people. Boeing has yet to submit a software upgrade to the FAA as it works to get approval to end the grounding of the 737 MAX. 
In a statement issued after the FAA announcement, Boeing said it has not been informed of any in-service issues related to this batch of slat tracks. Boeing, the world's largest plane maker, said it has identified 20 737 MAX airplanes most likely to have the faulty parts and that airlines will check an additional 159 MAXs for these parts.
Boeing said it has identified 21 737 NGs most likely to have the suspect parts and is advising airlines to check an additional 112 NGs. The NG is the third-generation 737 that the company began building in 1997.
The affected parts ""may be susceptible to premature failure or cracks resulting from the improper manufacturing process,"" the FAA said.
The FAA said a complete failure of a leading edge slat track would not result in the loss of the aircraft, but a failed part could cause aircraft damage in flight.
The FAA said it will issue an Airworthiness Directive to require Boeing's service actions to identify and remove the parts from service. It said operators will be required to perform this action within 10 days, but can continue to fly the planes during the 10-day period before the parts are removed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT ON BOEING
Boeing in April said the two fatal crashes had cost it at least $1 billion as it abandoned its 2019 financial outlook, halted share buybacks and lowered production. The company's shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent since the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March.
Some international carriers are skeptical the plane will resume flying by August as some U.S. airlines have suggested.
Tim Clark, president of Emirates, told reporters in Seoul that it could take six months to restore operations as other regulators re-examine the U.S. delegation practices. ""If it is in the air by Christmas (Dec. 25) I'll be surprised - my own view,"" he said.
Boeing said one batch of slat tracks with specific lot numbers produced by a supplier was found to have a ""potential nonconformance"" and said airlines ""are to replace them with new ones before returning the airplane to service.""
The company said it is ""now staging replacement parts at customer bases to help minimize aircraft downtime while the work is completed."" Boeing said once new parts are in hand, replacement work should take one to two days.
A separate service bulletin will go to 737 MAX operators to do inspections before the MAX fleet returns to service.
The FAA said Boeing has identified groups of both 737 NG and 737 MAX airplane serial numbers on which these suspect parts may have been installed, including 32 NG and 33 MAX in the United States. 
The issue was discovered following an investigation conducted by Boeing and the FAA Certificate Management Office, the FAA said. An FAA spokesman said the issue should not delay Boeing's planned submission of a software update and training revisions, but it remains unclear when that will be submitted.
The FAA has said it has no timetable for ending the grounding of the airplane. Boeing said last month it completed its software upgrade but was still working to address information requests from the FAA before it can schedule a certification test flight and submit final certification documentation.
Reuters reported last month that the FAA has indicated privately to other regulators that it aims to certify new software by the end of June, after which it would take several weeks at a minimum to get planes flying.

Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told reporters on May 23 in Texas after a meeting with more than 30 international air regulators that the agency had not decided yet on training requirements.

PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler is discussing a  Renault  (PA:RENA) special dividend and stronger job guarantees in a bid to persuade the French government to back its proposed merger between the carmakers, sources close to the discussions said.
The improved offer, if formalized and accepted, would also see the combined company's operations headquartered in France and the French state granted a seat on its board, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
FCA spokeswoman Shawn Morgan declined to comment. The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake, also declined to comment. A Renault spokesman did not return calls and messages seeking comment.
Italian-American FCA is engaged in intensive discussions with Renault and the French government over the $35 billion merger proposal it pitched last Monday to create the world's third-biggest carmaker.
The concessions being discussed are not definitive and depend on other aspects of an emerging compromise deal, both sources cautioned.
They nonetheless increase the chances that the merger plan will be approved by Renault's board, on which the French state has two seats. The board meets again on Tuesday.
Some analysts and French industry leaders had voiced doubts about the 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in claimed cost and investment savings, and whether the proposal represents a fair deal for Renault shareholders.
A Renault dividend would improve the valuation in their favor, balancing a 2.5 billion euro proposed dividend to FCA shareholders. The sources did not elaborate on the potential size of a Renault payout.
The merger plan presented on Monday would see the two carmakers acquired by a listed Dutch holding company whose ownership would be split equally between current FCA and Renault shareholders, after special dividend payments.
FCA had proposed locating the combined group's operational head office in a neutral city, most likely London, but has now indicated readiness to base it in the greater Paris area, meeting a key French government demand, both sources said.
The French government is also likely to be granted a seat on the board to reflect its 7.5 percent stake in the merged company, the people said.
Nissan, whose matching 15 percent stake in its French alliance partner will also be diluted to 7.5 percent of the new group, receives a board seat under the plan unveiled on May 27.
Guarantees to maintain Renault's French blue-collar jobs and industrial sites would also be extended to four years from the two initially proposed under the compromise being discussed, the sources added.

Both France's pro-business government and Italy's populist administration back the merger in principle but fraught relations between the two could yet derail the deal if one side feels disadvantaged.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 10:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Google has a target on its back in Washington,"By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is preparing an investigation of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Google to determine whether the technology company violated laws to ensure fair competition, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The potential investigation, first reported on Friday, is the latest challenge for Google which already faces a raft of complaints about its business practices from rivals, as well as Democrats and Republicans. EU regulatory actions have already led to multibillion dollar fines and reforms to Google's business practices. 
The U.S. probe would focus on accusations Google gave preference to its own businesses in search results, one source said. 
Google declined to comment on the possible probe.
The latest news underscores a growing U.S. backlash aimed at Silicon Valley companies, and marks one of the biggest steps yet by the Trump administration toward regulating a giant technology firm.
The following explains the antitrust concerns about Google from other companies, critics in Washington and the EU, and how a Justice Department probe could impact the sprawling U.S. company.
WHY ARE ANTITRUST REGULATORS INTERESTED IN GOOGLE?
Google's dominance of the search engine market has transformed it from a start-up into one the world's most valuable companies. 
Google controls much of the technology used to buy online ads, and its Android operating system runs most of the world's smartphones.
Digital advertising revenue accounted for about 85% of revenue for Google's parent Alphabet last year. 
Some web companies, including Yelp Inc and TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ:TRIP), have long complained that Google skews search results and uses its market dominance to unfairly promote its own services over theirs.
Google has said it is transparent about how it promotes its own services, and that its focus has been on benefiting consumers.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which enforces antitrust laws along with DOJ, previously investigated Google's business practices. The 2013 settlement with the FTC was widely viewed as a victory for Google because the company was only required to make modest changes to its practices and was allowed to continue to highlight its own services in search results.
Under FTC pressure, Google agreed to end the practice of “scraping” reviews and other data from rivals’ websites for its own products, and to let advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns.
Europe's competition authority has taken a tougher stance against Google, handing down three fines totaling more than $9 billion in recent years.
In a 2017 deal with the EU, Google agreed to pay $2.7 billion to resolve claims it unfairly steered business toward its shopping platform. In March it was fined $1.7 billion in a case focused on illegal practices in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016.
COULD THE DOJ TRY TO BREAK UP GOOGLE?
Yes, in theory, but experts have said such action against a technology firm is unlikely. 
The Justice Department would have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition. 
It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T (NYSE:T) being the two biggest examples.
Perhaps the most famous case is the government’s effort to break up  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.
Justice Department antitrust probes more often result in an agreement to change certain business practices. 
WHY IS GOOGLE UNDER INCREASED SCRUTINY?
Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) collect personal data on users to target their advertisements.
Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue as massive breaches have compromised the personal information of internet and social media users.
Congress has long been expected to take up privacy legislation after California passed a strict privacy law that goes into effect on Jan. 1.
Some Republican Party lawmakers have also said Google, Facebook and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) discriminate against conservative viewpoints and suppress free speech. Representatives of the companies have denied the censorship claims.
Soon after news of the possible Google probe, Republican Senator Josh Hawley said on Twitter: ""This is very big news, and overdue."" As attorney general of Missouri, Hawley probed Google over allegations it misappropriated content from rivals and claims it demoted competitors' websites in search results.
Beyond Congress, Google's Washington critics have included the United States’ top general who in March said the Chinese military was benefiting from the work Google was doing in China, where the technology giant has long sought to have a bigger presence.

Google, which did not comment at the time, has previously said it has invested in China for years and plans to continue to do so, but that the company also was continuing to work with the U.S. government on projects in healthcare, cybersecurity and other fields.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 06:28AM ET</span>",Global airlines slash profit forecast on protectionism fears,"By Jamie Freed and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Global airlines slashed a widely watched industry profit forecast by 21% on Sunday as an expanding trade war and higher oil prices compound worries about an overdue industry slowdown.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents about 290 carriers or more than 80 percent of global air traffic, said the industry is expected to post a $28 billion profit in 2019, down from a December forecast of $35.5 billion.
""Airlines will still turn a profit this year, but there is no easy money to be made,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said at the group's annual meeting in Seoul. 
""Creeping protectionist or isolationist political agendas are on the rise,"" he added.
Global stock markets tumbled on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected threat of tariffs on Mexican goods added to fears that escalating trade tensions will push the United States and other major economies into recession.
Airlines had reported $30 billion in annual profits in 2018, but conditions in the air cargo market - an extra source of revenue for carriers - have weakened substantially.
""You see that international trade is now at a zero growth rate, so there is an immediate impact on our cargo business,"" de Juniac told Reuters TV.
IATA voiced concerns the trade tensions, which have forced several carriers in Asia to ground or delay taking delivery of air freighters, could spill into the passenger market.
Passenger capacity growth, which reached 6.9 percent in 2019, is forecast to slow to 4.7 percent this year, with average fares flat following a 2.1 percent decline in 2018. 
The dip is potentially significant because airline profits track consumer confidence and global trade, economists say.
After struggling to inspire confidence for decades due to high fixed costs that are mainly out of their control, airlines have managed to cover the cost of their capital in recent years by squeezing their expenses and carrying out some restructuring.
But analysts have said that aviation is nearing the end of an extended business cycle.
The sector's heavy reliance on one region, North America, for half of the global profits prompted leading consultant Peter Harbison to warn airline CEOs from the floor of the IATA meet that the industry's good fortunes were a ""temporary aberration"".
The industry's growth continues to be stimulated by low fares, but such travel tends to be most vulnerable in a downturn, Harbison told Reuters. 
'LOW PRICES CAUSE CONGESTION'
In a $900 billion cut-throat industry brimming with tensions, the head of Germany's Lufthansa hit out at low-cost airlines who slash fares to what he called unrealistic levels, though those firms say legacy carriers are bloated.
""I'm not complaining about the competition. Don't get me wrong ... but that kind of ticketing below 10 euros is hurting the ... trust of public and politicians (and) congesting air traffic,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said. 
The practice also undermines climate goals by spurring trips that would not otherwise exist, he added.
Europe could see more airlines disappear after a series of failures through mergers or bankruptcies.
""We have just begun to see the beginning of it,"" he said.
The CEO of the recently acquired UK-based Flybe said she saw a risk of ""massive consolidation without independent and challenging carriers"".
Christine Ourmieres-Widener plans to step down on July 15, months after the sale of the low-cost airline to a consortium including Richard Branson.
Airbus said on Sunday it was receiving some requests to defer plane orders but denied the aviation market had cooled.
""I put it in the category of a discreet event more than a global phenomenon at this point. My impression is not that the tide has turned,"" said sales chief Christian Scherer.

The planemaker is close to a deal to sell A330neo wide-body jets to Virgin Atlantic, people familiar with the matter said.

The pair signed a memorandum of understanding for a JV on Malaysia-Japan flights on May 27, but JAL President Yuji Akasaka said that was only part of a deepening partnership between the two, both members of the oneworld alliance.
The Malaysian government is considering whether to shut, sell or refinance its loss-making national carrier, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in March.
JAL, which undertook a successful turnaround after entering bankruptcy in 2010, could provide advice to Malaysia Airlines based on its own experience, Akasaka told reporters on the sidelines of an airline industry conference in Seoul on Sunday. 
""We believe what Malaysia Airlines is going through right now is similar to what Japan Airlines went through and we recovered from that situation,"" he said through a translator.
Akasaka said once the Malaysia-Japan JV was approved by authorities there would be opportunities to extend the partnership, to cover U.S. flights and other Asian routes.
Malaysia Airlines lacks direct flights to the United States, but JAL operates a large number of U.S. routes.

Akasaka said it was too early to say whether JAL would consider an equity investment in Malaysia Airlines but future discussions were possible.

""That is not the solution,"" Thiam told Swiss newspaper Blick am Sonntag. ""Negative interest rates have created an extremely difficult environment, where many banks have come under long-term pressure. A merger here would fix nothing.""
UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said last month after Germany's  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) called off merger talks that consolidation in the European banking industry remains inevitable.
However, Thiam said he did not think that either of Switzerland's two largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, would become takeover targets. The failed merger talks between Germany's two biggest lenders prompted speculation of deals with other European banks, including UBS. 
Thiam said in the interview he was not criticizing the policies of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which has used negative rate to weaken the Swiss franc.
""I am only saying that negative rates have a negative effect on the economy,"" he said.
Thiam, who has led Credit Suisse since 2015, said its main problems have now been settled and the bank had made great strides in reducing costs through technology.

The former minister in his native Ivory Coast also ruled out a return to politics, saying a change of jobs was not on the cards and he was planning ""for the long term"".

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 03:18AM ET</span>","Airlines want joint lifting of 737 MAX ban, but EU cautious","By Tim Hepher and Tracy Rucinski 
SEOUL (Reuters) - Airlines urged regulators on Sunday to coordinate on software changes to the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX in a bid to avoid damaging splits over safety seen when the aircraft was grounded in March.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose 290 carriers account for 80 percent of world flying, said trust in the certification system had been damaged by a wave of separate decisions to ground the jet, with the U.S. last to act.
Airlines are worried further differences between regulators over safety could confuse passengers and cause disruption.
""Any rift between regulators is not in anyone's interest,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told an annual meeting of the association in Seoul.
Boeing's best-selling jet was grounded after two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, over five months killed a total of 346 people.
The Federal Aviation Administration initially resisted the decisions led by China, but later followed suit. 
Airline officials say any new bout of staggered decisions could cause problems in operations and code-sharing. 
""Obviously for us to operate the MAX, the approval from the Singapore authorities is not enough. We have to operate somewhere ... Indonesia and China are two important markets for us,"" Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong told Reuters.
But the European Union's top transport official said bloc's regulator, the European Aviation Safety Agency, reserved the right to carry out its own separate review at its own pace.
""Certainly EASA will take a very close look at the results (of proposed design changes) and then make a decision and that message was very clearly passed,"" Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc told Reuters at the Seoul event.
""We always work together with other regulators and we certainly will take joint moves, but EASA will reserve the right to take an individual look at the results and then of course engage with the rest of the regulators.""
Asked how long it would take to end the crisis, she said, ""I hope as soon as possible, because we do need to restore order and trust and move on.""
UNCLEAR RESUMPTION OUTLOOK
The 737 MAX crashes have thrown the spotlight on cockpit software and a certification system which relies on the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) delegating some approval tasks to Boeing staff working on their behalf.
""I think the investigations ... will probably reveal that the FAA perhaps unwittingly let a little bit too much go,"" said Emirates president Tim Clark. ""And I think that the other regulators didn't realise how much the FAA had empowered the manufacturing delegates,"" he added.
Clark warned it could take six months to restore operations as other regulators re-examine the U.S. delegation practices - though U.S. majors have only suspended MAX schedules to August.
""That is why it is going to take time to get this aircraft back in the air. If it is in the air by Christmas I'll be surprised - my own view,"" he told reporters. Emirates' sister carrier flydubai is a major 737 MAX customer.
The FAA says it has no firm date but has indicated privately to other regulators that it aims to certify new software by end-June, after which it could take weeks to get planes flying.
A person familiar with the plans said the FAA wanted an ""orderly"" process, anticipating a sequence of approvals for software changes and training rather than one global decision. 

If confirmed, that could see 737 MAX aircraft back in the air in some markets as early as the summer, the person said, barring further hitches or surprises in the ongoing review.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2019 01:55AM ET</span>","A year after Qatar boss' gaffe, airlines still pay 'lip service' to diversity: executives","By Jamie Freed
SEOUL (Reuters) - A year after Qatar Airways boss' remark that a woman could not do his job drew scathing criticism, airline executives called out the industry for paying only ""lip service"" to diversity and not pushing to get more women out of cabins and into boardrooms.
While Akbar al-Baker had apologized for his remarks made at last year's International Air Transport Association (IATA) meeting in Sydney, saying they were intended as a joke and taken out of context, the controversy highlighted the lack of women in senior aviation roles.
His airline is now sponsoring three diversity and inclusion awards with $25,000 prizes, each to be presented on Monday at this year's IATA meeting in Seoul.
But Air New Zealand Ltd CEO Christopher Luxon said more concrete action was needed, such as refusing to serve on all-male panel talks and creating women's support networks.
""Compared to other sectors and other business sectors that I'm part of around the world and in New Zealand, aviation and IATA's record is abysmal in terms of gender diversity and inclusion,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.
""We are just paying lip service to it at the moment and window dressing it and we are not even doing a very good job of that if we are really honest with ourselves.""
The top of the airline industry remains male dominated, with only two women CEOs on the 27-member IATA Board of Governors currently chaired by al-Baker.
One of the two, FlyBe CEO Christine Ourmières-Widener, has said she will resign from her FlyBe role on July 15 after her airline is taken over by Connect Airways. 
""It is clear that this industry has a good record in terms of employing women, broadly speaking on average. But at the senior position level, it is not the case,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said.
IATA is working with industry partners to share best practices and help form a strategy on gender diversity against which to measure progress, he added.
Kirstin Colvile, the CEO of the SkyTeam airlines alliance, said IATA could do more at the annual meeting, such as hosting a networking breakfast to promote women in aviation.
""Female networks and support groups are incredibly important to give you the confidence,"" she said. 
""In order to move the needle - and you see that it hasn't moved much - I think we are going to have to take some steps, whether that is just targets or concerted efforts, we just have to drive more women into leadership position.""
TARGETS
The industry does a good job at attracting women into some roles, such as flight attendants and travel agents, but far less so in pilot and engineering positions.
In India, which has the highest ratio of female pilots in the world at around 12% despite a patriarchal society, SpiceJet has set a target to increase its proportion to 33% in the next few years, Chairman Ajay Singh said in Seoul. 
""It is not very nice to have a 33% target to be honest. Ideally it should be anybody who is capable,"" he said. 
""But I think for periods of time positive discrimination helps. I think in countries like ours these women become terrific role models for young women.""
SpiceJet's female pilot ratio is now in line with India's average, or more than double the global average of under 5%, according to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots.
Air New Zealand too has set targets and is looking to raise the number of women in top general manager jobs to 40% by 2020, from 16% in 2013, Luxon said. 
""We got there last year,"" he said. ""Now we are at 43% and we are on our way to 50% next year, maybe at the end of this year.""
He said Air New Zealand had achieved that by a ruthless focus on identifying women with leadership potential, ensuring salaries were equal for the same roles, creating internal groups to give women more of a voice and ensuring recruiters considered female candidates for top executive roles.

""I feel very comfortable we will get to a place where the CEOs who come after me, it will be a 50/50 chance they will be women as well,"" Luxon said.

Amazon could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S. regulators which puts the e-commerce giant under the watch of the trade commission, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The development is the result of the FTC and Justice department quietly dividing up competition oversight on both of the American tech giants, Amazon and Google, the newspaper said adding that the FTC's plans for Amazon and the Justice Department's interest in Google were not immediately clear.
The news comes after Reuters and other media reported on Friday that the Justice Department is preparing an investigation into Google in order to ascertain whether the company broke antitrust law in operating its online businesses.

Google said it had no comment on the report while Amazon, the FTC and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.

The appeal was issued in a letter to several airline bosses meeting in Seoul where the International Air Transport Association has warned of the impact of broader global trade tensions, a person familiar with the issuance of the letter told Reuters.
The United States and Europe have been locked in a 15-year spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened last month to impose tariffs on $11 billion of European goods including planes and their parts, prompting the European Union to propose a list of $20 billion worth of U.S. imports it could hit in retaliation.
""If the tariffs are applied, the effects would include greatly increased costs to U.S. and European airlines, aerospace suppliers and manufacturers,"" Airbus sales chief Christian Scherer said in the text of the letter seen by Reuters.
It asked airlines to ""urge Boeing to enter into the negotiations proposed by the EU and Airbus.""
Airbus and Boeing had no immediate comment.
It is the first time either company has sought to directly involve the airline industry in the dispute, which is the largest ever handled by the World Trade Organization. U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has said it opposes the U.S. tariff threats, saying they harm U.S. interests.
Delegates at the IATA talks said airlines would weigh carefully whether to step directly into the aircraft dispute which has laid bare intense competition for plane orders and which has cost the warring parties tens of millions of dollars.

But IATA, which groups 290 airlines representing 82 percent of global traffic, is expected to express growing concerns about a worsening pattern of global trade tensions which has already depressed cargo business and threatens some passenger demand.

Plans announced last Tuesday for over 1,000 potential layoffs, mainly targeted at the Belfort plant, prompted France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire to say he would fight to save jobs at the site as negotiations kicked off with unions. 
GE had said the move was aimed at making its operations more efficient in France in response to a shrinking market for power plants. Belfort handles gas, steam, nuclear and hydro technology. 
In an interview published on Sunday in France's Journal Du Dimanche, Hugh Bailey, the general manager of GE in France, said Belfort's sales of gas turbines had halved between 2017 and 2018 and the group was struggling to remain competitive.
""That said, I want to be clear, Belfort will not close,"" Bailey was quoted as saying. ""It will remain GE Power's number one industrial site in Europe.""
Bailey said gas power still had a future but added other areas that were developing rapidly - such as renewable energy and energy storage - could also be key. 
He said GE businesses in other countries could be affected by the restructuring, though he did not give details.
""GE's difficulties in energy are well known. When it comes to this (job cut) project, the announcement is part of a global decision, which is then adapted on a European level, country by country,"" Bailey told the JDD.
French industrial group  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) was Belfort's biggest employer until 2014 when it sold its gas turbine manufacturing business to GE, which pledged to create 1,000 jobs to win backing for the deal from the French government.

However, the company had to break that commitment as the gas turbine power plant market collapsed. In February GE agreed to pay 50 million euros ($56 million) into a reindustrialization fund for falling short of the target.

Morgan bond analysts cut back on their outlook on U.S. Treasury yields for 2019 as growing risks to the economy from trade tensions may cause the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates twice in the second half of the year.
They revised down their year-end targets late Friday on two-year Treasury yields to 1.40% from an earlier call of 2.25% and on 10-year yields to 1.75% from 2.45%.
Separately, J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli said on Friday he expects the U.S. central bank to lower key lending rates two times later this year: one quarter-point cut in September, following by another quarter-point decrease in December.
Earlier this week, investors were already pulling money from stocks and other risky assets due to fears of a protracted trade war between China and the United States.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement to impose tariffs on Mexico on June 10 roiled financial markets, sending investors to stampede into yen, Swiss and U.S. government.
U.S. two-year yields and 10-year yields on Friday fell as low as 1.916% and 2.126%, respectively, which were their lowest levels since September 2017.
Trump's move is aimed at forcing the Mexican government to stop immigrants from crossing illegally into the United States at its southern border. Analysts cautioned the initial 5% duties on Mexican tariffs, if they go into effect, would raise the costs for U.S. businesses and consumers, putting a drag on the economy.
""Against this backdrop, we revise our interest rate forecast lower as well, and no longer look for yields to move higher into year-end. Instead, we think that yields have further to fall in the coming months,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a research published late on Friday.

(Reuters) - An anonymous bidder has agreed to pay a record $4,567,888 at an annual charity auction to have a private lunch with Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa)
The winning bid, which was submitted during a five-day online auction on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) that ended Friday night, was nearly one-third higher than the previous record $3,456,789 bids in both the 2012 and 2016 auctions.
Proceeds benefit the Glide Foundation, a charity in San Francisco's Tenderloin district that serves the poor, homeless or those battling substance abuse.
Buffett, 88, has raised about $34.2 million for Glide in 20 annual auctions, which began in 2000 and moved to eBay in 2003. His first wife Susan, who died in 2004, introduced him to Glide after volunteering for the charity.
""Mr. Buffett is thrilled. We just spoke with him,"" Glide President Karen Hanrahan told Reuters after the auction ended. ""Mr. Buffett is committed to continuing the auction as long as he's able. He has been a thought partner in thinking through Glide's future, and how to set it up for the next 50 years.""
The winning bidder and up to seven friends can dine at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in Manhattan with Buffett, who says he will discuss anything apart from his next investments.
This year's auction drew 18 bids from five bidders.
The top bid would also be enough to buy 15 Class A or 23,137 Class B shares of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, whose more than 90 businesses include auto insurer Geico and BNSF railroad.
Past auction winners have included hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital in 2003, and Ted Weschler, now one of Buffett's portfolio managers at Berkshire, in 2010 and 2011.
Glide's budget goes toward providing roughly 2,000 free meals a day, shelter, HIV and Hepatitis C tests, job training, and children's daycare and after-school programs.
""What it means to us as an organization: It's huge,"" Hanrahan said, referring to the auction. ""It's going to help many many thousands of people in this city.""

With Chinese officials due to announce their position on trade talks with the U.S. on Sunday, the investigation into FedEx’s “wrongful delivery of packages” was framed as a warning by Beijing after the Trump administration imposed a ban on business with telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co.
The latest salvo signals there’s no detente in sight in the struggle between the world’s two biggest economies at a time when trade talks have broken down. Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports kicked in Saturday in Beijing, affecting more than 2,400 goods that face levies of as much as 25% compared with 10% previously.
FedEx apologized this week for delivery errors on Huawei packages following reports that parcels were returned to senders, and China’s biggest tech company said it’s reviewing its relationship with the U.S. delivery service. Two packages containing documents being shipped to the company in China from Japan were diverted to the U.S. without authorization, Reuters reported.
China opened a probe because FedEx violated Chinese laws and regulations and harmed customers by misdirecting packages, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said Saturday.
‘A Warning’
“Now that China has established a list of unreliable entities, the investigation into FedEx will be a warning to other foreign companies and individuals that violate Chinese laws and regulations,” China Central Television said in a commentary.
China said Friday it will draw up a list of “unreliable entities” that harm the interests of Chinese companies. That opens the door to targeting a broad swathe of the global tech industry, from U.S. giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). to non-American suppliers that have cut off Huawei, such as Toshiba and Arm.
Xinhua used two hashtags in Weibo posts on the FedEx probe: #ChinaUSTrade and #RetaliateAgainstUSTradeBullying.
China will publish a white paper on its position on trade talks with the U.S. on Sunday in Beijing. The document will be released at 10 a.m. on Sunday, and Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen will take questions, according to an official statement.
Markets Rattled
Trade tensions are spilling ever wider, raising concern about the impact on the global economy. Bloomberg reported on Friday that China has a plan to restrict exports of rare earths to the U.S. if it needs to. On another front, President Donald Trump said he plans to impose a 5% U.S. tariff on all Mexican goods over illegal immigration.
With markets roiled by the threats and rhetoric on trade, the S&P 500 had its worst month of May in seven years. Investors are now looking to a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month at the Group of 20 Summit in Osaka for a possible rapprochement and easing of trade tensions.
Trump may ask Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to meet with Chinese officials while in Japan next week amid an escalating trade dispute between the two countries, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said."
1278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",A Brazil Firm Sweats Over Getting Caught in U.S.-China Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- For Embraer Commercial, the escalating rift between the U.S. and China is making things awkward.
That’s because the commercial plane-making unit of Embraer SA counts China as its biggest market and is in the process of being taken over by the U.S.’s top exporter, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. The unit, which will be renamed Boeing Brasil Commercial, is seeking antitrust approval from China for the deal and waiting for for two plane models to get certified by Beijing to deliver the aircraft to Chinese airlines.
""We are trying as best we can to stay away from the political environment,"" John Slattery, head of Embraer Commercial, said in an interview in Seoul on June 1. ""There’s very little upside for Embraer to comment on trade disputes between superpowers.""
There’s much to be worried about. What began as a trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies has morphed into full-blown tensions. China just warned it will establish a blacklist of entities that could harm its local companies, a sweeping order coming on the heels of the U.S. decision to cut off much-needed American supplies from Chinese technology champion Huawei Technologies Co.
So for the soon-to-be American company, it appears the best strategy for now is to lay low, play down the company’s new owner and hope for the best.
""The political relationship between China and Brazil is the only one I can talk to,"" Slattery said. ""That relationship is robust and positive. I’m hopeful that we will see, in the near term, certification of those aircraft,” he said adding that the company still expects to complete all antitrust approvals before the end of this year.
Slattery also said the company is expecting its 80-seater E175 regional jet to get certified first, followed by its next-generation E2-195. Embraer currently has about 100 aircraft flying in China, he said."

JEJU, South Korea (Reuters) - Kim Bo-Min, a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) barista, paid 140,000 won ($118) for a round-trip from her hometown of Daegu to the popular resort island of Jeju, arriving on T'Way Air Co Ltd, part of South Korea's rapidly growing low-cost airline sector.
The route between Jeju and Seoul has in fact emerged as the world's busiest domestic one as travelers like Bo-Min flock to the southern resort island, lured by cheaper rates from budget carriers. The 28-year-old barista would have paid 22% more if she had flown Korean Air Lines Co Ltd.
""I have taken both full-service airlines and budget carriers for my previous Jeju trips, but I do not think there is much difference when it comes to services,"" she told Reuters after her flight of under one hour to Jeju.
Korean low-cost carriers (LCCs) have cornered a large chunk of the domestic market since Jeju Air Co Ltd launched in 2005 with five Q400 turboprops, turning up the heat for bigger players like Korean Air and Asiana Airlines Inc and pushing them to start their own budget brands.
Jeju Air is South Korea's No.3 airline by revenue, operating 6 local and 66 international routes with 42 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700 jets. In November, it placed a $4.4 billion order for 50 737 MAX jets.
The budget airline boom has fueled a spike in travel to Jeju, with the number of tourists jumping almost three-fold to 14.3 million over 2005-2018 from 5.3 million, Jeju Tourism Association data shows. https://tmsnrt.rs/2WEa5b8
South Korea's five no-frills carriers had a 61% share of the Jeju travel market in 2018, according to data firm OAG. 
""Not too long ago, many South Koreans found air travel a luxury, but perception has changed as budget carriers brought us lower fares, allowing more affordable travel,"" an official at Korea's Airports Corporation's Jeju International Airport said, declining to be named due to company policy.
SOUTH KOREA LEADS 
In broader North Asia, LCCs have been slower to take off than in other parts of the world, due partly to slow-moving Chinese policies, a domestic aviation duopoly in Japan and Cathay Pacific's dominance of the Hong Kong market. 
But South Korea, host to the high-profile International Air Transport Association annual meeting in Seoul this weekend, is the outlier, with local start-ups like Jeju, financially backed by the Jeju Island government, being encouraged to grow. 
The country's transport ministry in March issued aviation business licenses to three additional budget carriers, further crowding the industry and intensifying competition. 
The 53% domestic market share of carriers like Jeju and Jin Air Co Ltd outstrips the 9% LCC penetration in Japan and 13% in China, data from CAPA Centre for Aviation shows.
Internationally, South Korean LCCs have rapidly expanded on routes to nearby destinations like Japan, Vietnam and China with narrowbody jets, with their market share growing to nearly 57 percent on international routes to Japan in 2017, from 44 percent in 2016, according to South Korea's transport ministry.
""We should not underestimate how important the role of budget carriers are on a given route,"" said Park Seong-bong, a senior analyst at Seoul-based Hana Financial Investment.
INCUMBENTS FEEL THE HEAT 
With the fleet size of the country's budget carriers jumping three-fold over the past five years, legacy carriers Korean Air and Asiana are feeling the heat. 
Korean Air's operating profit fell over 40 percent to 640 billion won ($537 million) in 2018 from 1.1 trillion won in 2016, while Jeju Air's operating profit nearly doubled to 100 billion won over the period. 
Korean Air's budget arm Jin Air has come under a lot of pressure in the wake of public outrage over the behavior of members of its founding family, while financially troubled Asiana's largest shareholder has put its stake up for sale.
Their pains have meant gains for independent budget carriers like Jeju Air and Eastar Jet as they expand their long-haul routes such as Busan-Singapore to attract more customers.
""For long-haul routes, customers tend to seek more premium services which used to be found in full-service carriers. We are now providing business-class like services at more competitive prices,"" said Lee Dae-woo, a deputy general manager at Jeju Air.

1280,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 01, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Fed Can’t Afford a Little Patience?
A key portion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted further this week as worries about a prolonged U.S.-China trade battle rattled investors and sent money into safer bonds.
The yield on the 10-year, at about 2.16%, is solidly below that of the 3-month, which is at about 2.35%.
A yield-curve inversion is generally considered a sign of a potential recession. And the Federal Reserve may need to get off the bench and make a move if it wants longer-term rates to rise, according to BNY Mellon.
“Since November 2018, the fall in yields has been due to a both a more dovish outlook on policy, but also - and notable - falling real rates,” BNY Mellon said in a note. “Real 10-year yields are now just 1.6%.”
Lately, Fed members have been on the same page, stressing a message that is as neutral as you can get: the FOMC is as likely to raise rates as it is to cut them and can afford to be patient.
While this looked more dovish in late 2018, recent market activity “suggests that ‘patient’ is no longer sufficient,"" BNY said.
In Treasuries, as “long ends tumble (both in lower inflation expectations as well as real rates), the only prospect for re-steepening requires rate cuts to drive the short end lower and (perhaps) reignite inflation and real growth expectations,” BNY added.
And the market expects the Fed to heed that call in the second half of the year.
Fed funds futures are pricing in a more-than-50% chance that rates will be lower following the September FOMC meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
2. Defensive Stocks Shunned, Too
In the middle of global trade tensions, with escalation every day this week, investors are looking at whether they should take their cue from the aforementioned bond market or from stocks that are still pretty resilient.
For months, the wide gap between frothy stock prices and depressed Treasury yields has divided analysts.
Even with an inverted yield curve, stocks are just 5% below all-time highs. And equity bulls continue to suggest the recent downturn is more of a correction rather than a reversal.
But investors should take a look at the surprise malaise in defensive stocks, despite a weakening risk backdrop.
Usually defensive stocks, like bonds, benefit from a rotation. But the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSE:XPH) fell more than 7% in the past month and SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSE:SDY) lost about 5.5%. Both lost more than the S&P 500.
Equities are finally catching up to what the bond market has been saying for months, specifically, that growth is weak and there is a limit to how bad defensive sectors can get in a negative growth environment, Morgan Stanely said.
Meanwhile, the credit markets are facing circumstances not unlike those just before the financial crisis, with a build-up in corporate leverage and a decline in credit quality and underwriting standards, Scott Mather, chief investment officer of U.S. core strategies at Pimco, told Bloomberg.
3. Pass the Popcorn
Faced with increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others, there was some good news this week for movie theater operators hoping to still lure people out of their living rooms.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) said this week its loyalty and benefits program AMC Stubs now has more than 20 million household subscribers, up 700% from when it debuted in 2016.
The AMC Stubs program has three offerings: Insider, with perks like free large popcorn refills and discount Tuesday, the mid-level Premiere, which adds things like priority lanes and concession stand upgrades, and the top-tier A-List, which includes three movies per week.
There was a decline in average additions per day, but that should be viewed as representing “a healthy membership base that is not looking to exploit the program,” research firm B. Riley FBR wrote last week.
“AMC confirmed Stubs A-List is already profitable” with the potential for $35 million plus in incremental annual EBITDA per 1 million members, B. Riley said.
“With at least $340 million in annual recurring and add-on revenues from the membership base, we could see a valuation multiple lift,’ it added.
Shares of AMC have struggled to find momentum this year, down more than 3% so far."
1281,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2019 02:35AM ET</span>",Macau casino revenue hits 5-month high in May,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Gambling revenue in the Chinese territory of Macau hit a five-month high in May, although softer demand from high rollers amid a slowdown in the world's No.2 economy and a Sino-U.S. trade war continued to keep a lid on gains.
Revenue was 25.95 billion patacas ($3.21 billion), the highest this year, Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination said on Saturday, versus 25.5 billion patacas a year ago and also up from April's monthly haul of 23.6 billion patacas. 
Analysts were expecting a flat to 4% year-on-year drop.
As the special administrative region marks 20 years since its handover from Portuguese rule, slower mainland economic growth, a weaker yuan and a simmering trade war threaten to derail growth.
For operators in China's only legal casino hub, the outlook remains challenging as Beijing pushes to rebrand Macau as a family-friendly destination. 
They are plowing about $10 billion into mostly non-gaming attractions before their licenses expire in 2022 amid warnings new permits will be linked to efforts to diversify.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2019 01:24AM ET</span>","Ten years on, questions remain over response to Air France 447","By Tim Hepher and Allison Lampert
SEOUL/MONTREAL (Reuters) - As Air France pilots fought for control, an Airbus A330 passenger jet plummeted from 38,000 feet for four minutes, its engines running but its wings unable to seize enough air to fly. 
The doomed jet, weighing 205 tonnes, was in freefall after entering an aerodynamic stall. The ordeal ended in tragedy in the early hours of June 1, 2009 https://reut.rs/2YYR1lt, mid-way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris during an Atlantic storm, killing all 228 people on board.
As relatives mark the disaster's tenth anniversary, the aviation industry is still implementing lessons learned from Air France flight 447 even as it faces a new crisis over the two-month-old global grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft.
French investigators found the crew of AF447 mishandled the loss of speed readings from sensors blocked with ice from the storm, and pushed it into a stall by holding the nose too high.
The BEA investigation agency called for improved training of pilots, instructors and inspectors, and better cockpit design among recommendations to prevent a repeat of the catastrophe.
The crash, which sparked a wider debate about the balance of humans and technology, is seen as one of a handful of accidents that changed aviation. But it has taken as much as a decade to implement some recommendations put forward by the BEA.
Even before finding the main part of the wreckage, the agency called in late 2009 for improved tracking of aircraft.
The initial reaction of the airline industry was lukewarm and the regulatory panel charged with such discussions had gone for some time without meeting because it lacked a secretary, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
It was not until after the disappearance of a second jet in 2014, the MH370 - a Malaysia Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777, that regulators took firm action, they said. 
A decision to require signals every 15 minutes in remote zones came into force last year. 
""After AF447 many people had an intuitive perception that an accident of a plane cruising over the ocean is very, very rare and so it wasn't evident that there would be another (case),"" said the BEA's current director, Remi Jouty.
""To see adoption of international norms taking time was frustrating. But we know processes are very slow, and then MH370 accelerated matters and there was momentum,"" he told Reuters.
Airlines holding annual talks in Seoul this weekend will seek to restore confidence strained by the two recent Boeing crashes and still haunted by the disappearance of MH370. 
A spokesman for the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations' aviation agency, cautioned against drawing links between AF447 and Malaysia's MH370.""The real aircraft tracking recommendations came after MH370, and the only reason they appear to have been adopted more quickly is because they leveraged the work already initiated post-AF447,"" he said.
AUTOPILOT DILEMMA
A second major upheaval from AF447 concerned training, BEA's Jouty said. Investigators rarely cast blame for accidents but seek to understand the mental picture facing a confused crew and what training is needed to avoid future disasters.
Together with the fatal crash of a Colgan Air turboprop near Buffalo, New York, in 2009, the AF447 tragedy led to new procedures and training. 
Yet other key recommendations remain mired in disagreement.
The BEA called in 2011 for an indicator showing pilots the ""Angle of Attack"" - a stall-related parameter that is once again in the spotlight after MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. 
Opponents say civil pilots are trained to rely on other data and the gauge would be redundant or even confusing. 
For almost 20 years, many investigators have also called for cockpit video cameras to record what information is actually displayed to pilots. The BEA repeated the proposal after AF447.
Pilot unions oppose the idea due to concerns over privacy and fears it could be a distraction. 
Loss of control remains a worry. 
Air France and French unions have defended the AF447 pilots, saying they faced conflicting alarms.
""I've been really for the past 20 to 25 years pushing people to fly manual,"" said Mohammed Aziz, a former air investigator and consultant with Aviation Strategies International, adding many pilots are ordered to use autopilot as much as possible.

""Automation is what makes your life much easier but then the minute you need to use your skills you find that most pilots have lost some,"" Aziz added.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday denied  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).'s request to dismiss a lawsuit by the Washington, D.C. attorney general over the social media giant's improper sharing of 87 million users' data with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.
The U.S. capital city sued Facebook in December, accusing it of misleading users because it had known about the breach for two years before disclosing it and had allowed third-party app makers to access user information without their consent.
Judge Fern Flanagan Saddler signed the order denying Facebook's motion to dismiss, or alternatively, stay proceedings, the court said in a brief statement on its website. 
It was the second legal blow for the world's largest social network on Friday, after a judge in Delaware ordered it to turn over to shareholders emails and other records on its handling of data privacy, also linked to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the decision.
Cambridge Analytica, hired by U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, used a personality quiz distributed on Facebook to gather profile information in order to predict and influence voter behavior.
It shut down after the breach was disclosed. Several U.S. and European regulatory probes into Facebook ensued, including investigations by multiple state attorneys general.
The Washington, D.C. court could award unspecified damages and impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per violation of the district's consumer protection law, or potentially close to $1.7 billion, if penalized for each consumer affected.

The lawsuit alleges the firm's quiz software had data on 340,000 D.C. residents, even though just 852 users had directly engaged with it.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 10:23PM ET</span>",Cruise line Carnival seeks dismissal of U.S. lawsuits over Cuba docks,"By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cruise line Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp is asking a U.S. court to dismiss lawsuits that claim the company profited from confiscated Cuban property, the first such cases brought since the Trump administration made them possible this month. 
Two U.S. citizens who claim to hold titles to the Havana and Santiago de Cuba ports that were nationalized by Cuba after Fidel Castro's 1959 leftist revolution filed suits against Carnival in U.S. District Court in Florida in early May for docking there.
That came after the Trump administration announced a long dormant and controversial section of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act would take effect on May 2, allowing U.S. citizens to sue Cuban entities and foreign firms over confiscated Cuban property.
The law is part of a broader attempt by the United States to pressure Cuba over its support for Venezuela's embattled government by taking aim at Havana's beleaguered economy. 
Cuba sought to reassure foreign investors at an event in Havana on Friday, saying only four lawsuits had been filed so far, despite the United States saying there could be hundreds of thousands. The European Union and Canada have said they will use blocking legislation to protect their companies.
""Helms-Burton has no application here,"" according to a filing in the case by Carnival on Thursday. ""First, by its own terms, trafficking under Helms-Burton does not include uses of property 'incident to lawful travel to Cuba'.""
These cases could set a precedent, especially in the travel industry. Some lawyers like Carnival's say the travel exemption should shield U.S. cruise lines and airlines doing business with Cuba under licenses granted by former President Barack Obama during the two countries' brief 2014-2016 detente.
But U.S. courts could determine the travel they facilitate is tourism and violates the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba.
""The fulcrum for determining the outcome of all travel-related lawsuits will be whether there has been tourism,"" said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc.
Carnival also disputed the ownership of the two U.S. citizens who are descendants of original owners. Their lawyers did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
Increased U.S. hostility, more than Helms-Burton, is affecting foreign companies operating in Cuba, said Xulio Fontecha, head of the Association of Spanish Businesses in Cuba (AEEC), at the event in Havana.
Banks in Panama and Costa Rica had closed the accounts of some customers in recent months and courier services were declining to send documents to Cuba, he said.
""The problem goes far beyond Title III, which we condemn of course,"" he said, referring to the section of the Helms-Burton Act that permits the lawsuits.
Some Spanish companies also received a letter from a group in Florida warning them of potentially being complicit in violations of human and labor rights, he said.
The ambassador of the European Union, Alberto Navarro, said the bloc would continue to seek to expand business with Cuba, defying the U.S. hostility.

He encouraged Cuban reforms to make the island more attractive to foreign investors and offset disincentives created by the Trump administration policy.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 09:38PM ET</span>","Mexico, U.S. business groups urge Trump to back down on tariff threat","By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president and the top U.S. business lobbying group called on President Donald Trump to back down from a threat to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican imports, in a dispute over migration that could shock Mexico's economy.
Trump said he will introduce the tariffs on June 10 if Mexico does not halt the flow of illegal immigration, largely from Central America, across the U.S.-Mexican border, battering Mexican financial assets and denting global stocks.
The ultimatum from Trump is the biggest foreign policy test to date for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and a tall order for Mexican security forces struggling not only to combat migrant flows but also to fight a record level of gang violence and homicide.
Mexico's economy, which is heavily reliant on exports to the United States, shrank in the first quarter and would reel under U.S. tariffs that could reach as high as 25% this year under Trump's plan.
Veteran leftist Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, predicted that Trump, who is also engaged in a worsening trade war with China, would ease up on his demand.
""I tell all Mexicans to have faith, we will overcome this attitude of the U.S. government, they will make rectifications because the Mexican people don't deserve to be treated in the way being attempted,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters. 
In April, Trump took a step back from an earlier threat to completely close the U.S. border with Mexico to fight illegal immigration, under pressure from companies worried it would cause chaos for businesses. The tide of migrants crossing from Mexico has swelled, with U.S. officials saying that an average of 4,500 are arriving daily.
Global equities tumbled and safe-haven sovereign bonds surged Friday after Trump's unexpected threat added to fears that escalating trade wars will push the United States and other major economies into recession.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said he would attend talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the tariff issue.
The influential U.S. Chamber of Commerce is looking at ways to challenge Trump's tariff move against Mexico, including legal options. ""We have no choice but to pursue every option available to push back,"" Neil Bradley, the business group's executive vice president and chief policy officer, told reporters.
Other industry groups also criticized Trump's threat, saying it would hurt American businesses, farmers and consumers who have already borne the brunt of the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The White House called on U.S. companies to persuade their Mexican partners to lobby their government to cooperate.
""Industry should be in communication with their counterparts in Mexico to encourage the Mexican government to work with the administration and stave off the dangerous crisis at our southern border as quickly as possible,"" spokesman Judd Deere said.
Underscoring the interconnected nature of the U.S. and Mexican economies, the U.S.-based Beer Institute said most Mexican beer sold in the United States is made from U.S.-grown barley and hops. 
""Whether it be the truck driver, farmer, distributor, local retailer or favorite tavern, every community in America will be affected by this decision,"" Jim McGreevy, the institute's president and chief executive, said of the proposed tariffs. 
Mexico sends 600,000 to 700,000 barrels of oil to the United States every day, mostly to refiners, and buys more than 1 million barrels per day of U.S. crude and fuel, more than any other country. Analysts are concerned that retaliatory tariffs from Mexico could disrupt that trade.
STEEP TARIFFS 
Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an ""America First"" agenda aimed at reshaping global trade, said in a tweet on Thursday he would ratchet up tariffs on Mexico ""until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied.""
The plan would impose a 5% tariff on Mexican imports starting on June 10 and increase monthly, up to 25% on Oct. 1.
Such levies would deliver a heavy blow to Mexico's economy, which is underpinned by exports to the United States of goods from avocados and tequila to televisions and cars made by companies such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Coand Nissan.
Mexico sends around 80 percent of its exports to the United States and is one of America's top trading partners.
Mexican officials have signaled they will respond in kind if Washington actually imposes tariffs, steps likely to target regions with high concentrations of Trump voters.
Mexican stocks slid 1.4% on Friday as equities fell across the region, while the peso softened 2.3%. 
Trump sought to turn up the pressure again on Friday.
""Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Trump vowed frequently during his 2016 election campaign to make Mexico pay for construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration, but successive Mexican governments have firmly rejected that idea. 
The U.S. Congress also refused a request from Trump for $5.7 billion to help build the wall, prompting him to declare a national emergency and try to divert funds from other areas of the U.S. government. The issue is now in the courts. 
Trump and fellow Republicans say something needs to be done to stem the biggest migrant surge on the border in a decade. 
U.S. officials say 80,000 people are being held in custody, and the 4,500 mostly Central American migrants that on average are arriving daily are overwhelming the abilities of Border Patrol officials.
A senior White House official said Trump was particularly concerned that U.S. border agents apprehended a group of 1,036 migrants illegally crossing from Mexico on Wednesday, the largest single group since October, officials said. Before making the threat, Trump posted a video purporting to show the crossing on his Twitter feed.
Since taking office in December, Mexico's Lopez Obrador has urged Trump to help him tackle migration by promoting economic development in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the poor Central American countries where most of the migrants apprehended on the U.S. border come from.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 09:25PM ET</span>","U.S. tariff threat backs Mexican president into corner, facing Trump","By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to slap punitive tariffs on all Mexican trade if Mexico does not stop illegal immigration has punched a gaping hole in his Mexican counterpart's hands-off approach to diplomacy, with potentially ruinous consequences.
Mexico could face a severe economic shock if Trump makes good on a pledge to impose escalating tariffs of 5% on all Mexican goods from June 10 if the country does not halt a recent surge of migrants from Central America crossing the U.S. border.
The news, delivered in a tweet on Thursday evening, battered the peso and fueled concern about President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's reluctance to engage in foreign affairs or push back against Trump on his touchstone issue of illegal immigration.
It also raised fears that the Republican president will keep attacking Mexico as he seeks re-election next year.
In power since December, the leftist Lopez Obrador has tried to deflect Trump's barbs, insisting that the best way to tackle migrant flows is by jointly fostering development in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where most of the migrants apprehended on the U.S. border come from.
Trump has shown no enthusiasm for the idea.
In his day-to-day business, the 65-year-old Mexican president has stayed focused on domestic issues, pursuing a nationalist agenda of economic self-reliance and putting the brakes on foreign investment in the oil industry.
Foreign policy has been largely left in the hands of Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who has been dispatched to Washington to persuade the Trump administration to back down. 
""Lopez Obrador doesn't want to get involved in this, but it's impossible to avoid,"" said former foreign minister Jorge Castaneda, a longstanding critic of Lopez Obrador, who says he has failed to grasp the significance of the U.S. relationship.
""Relations with the United States in Mexico are not a foreign policy issue. They are a domestic policy issue.""
Around 80 percent of Mexico's exports are sent to the United States, whose businesses by far account for the biggest source of foreign direct investment to the country. U.S. business groups and lawmakers have said tariffs could be devastating to both countries.
Lopez Obrador told his morning news conference on Friday he believes the U.S. government will ultimately ""rectify"" its position. Asked if he would change the country's migration policy to accommodate Trump's request, he said Mexico is already tackling the problem.
Mexican officials have signaled they will respond in kind if Washington actually imposes tariffs, steps likely to target regions with high concentrations of Trump voters.
But doubts are growing in Mexico about whether Lopez Obrador has taken the wrong tack by downplaying U.S. provocations.
Agustin Basave, a former diplomat and ex-leader of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution, said Mexico had to put cooperation on security, combating drug trafficking and migration with Washington ""on the table"" to stand up to Trump.
There was no point in trying to ""appease"" Trump because even if Mexico completely sealed its southern border with Guatemala, he would keep demanding concessions, Basave added.
Trump has said this year he will cut off U.S. aid to Central America and threatened to close the Mexico-U.S. border.
""He'll use Mexico as a scarecrow the whole time,"" Basave said. ""And this will increase the closer the (U.S.) election gets.""
UNPREDICTABILITY
Mexico faces an uphill struggle to contain immigration, particularly in the wake of budget cuts to migration authorities made to fund Lopez Obrador's flagship welfare policies. 
One Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of people seeking to reach the United States from the rest of Latin America through Mexico is now so great that Mexico could only hope to ""administer"" the problem.
Hector Vasconcelos, a lawmaker from the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) who heads the Senate foreign relations committee, said Lopez Obrador was right to try to manage tensions by not reacting to Trump's broadsides.
""It's always been a given for me that President Trump could do anything at any moment,"" Vasconcelos told Reuters, pointing to how the U.S. election process was influencing his rhetoric.
""I think we need to get used to this being President Trump's way of governing. So I don't think there is a way out,"" he added, saying that if Mexico had taken a more combative approach to Trump, bilateral relations would today be even worse.
Among diplomats and government officials, widespread unease about Lopez Obrador's attitude extends beyond his dealings with Trump to the international stage in general.
In March, Lopez Obrador said he had asked Spain to apologize for crimes committed during the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1519-1521, a step one foreign diplomat from a third country described as ""nuts"".
The president's announcement this month that he wanted to ditch the so-called Merida Initiative, a framework for security cooperation with the United States, did little to cement stronger U.S.-Mexico ties.
Sergio Alcocer, a former deputy foreign minister for North America, said the Merida scheme was beneficial to Mexico because it made Washington assume co-responsibility for security matters that have helped fan bilateral tensions over the border.

""If you leave the mechanism, you lose that,"" he said.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:28PM ET</span>","Target Trump's base if trade spat worsens, Mexican farm lobby says","By David Alire Garcia and Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government should target agricultural goods produced in states that have voted for U.S. President Donald Trump's Republican Party if the trade conflict between the two neighbors worsens, the head of Mexico's main farm lobby said on Friday.
Bosco de la Vega, head of Mexico's national farm council CNA, told Reuters that such retaliatory measures should only be applied as a last resort and that he supports the Mexican government's efforts to first seek a negotiated settlement to the dispute.
De la Vega criticized what he described as Trump's unjustified ""mistreatment"" of Mexico by threatening the across-the-board tariffs on the country's exports and emphasized that any potential retaliation should seek to cause the U.S. leader maximum political pain.
""In the unlikely event that (the U.S. tariffs are enacted), we will be supporting the government in surgically implementing tariffs aimed at farm products in Republican states,"" he said.
Mexico has employed the strategy before as a means of pressuring Trump's base of supporters in rural America, by seeking to convince them his policies are counterproductive.
Noting that Mexican officials are ""drawing up a new map"" of potential U.S. targets, de la Vega emphasized that such measures should only be taken as a last result after negotiations between both sides run their full course.
Nevertheless, the president of Mexico's national farm council, which represents the country's largest private sector agriculture and livestock companies, ticked off potential targets for the Mexican government's possible retaliation, including U.S. grains like yellow corn, pork legs, apples, potatoes and whiskey. 
U.S. exports of feed corn and soybeans, also mentioned by de la Vega, are used to fatten Mexico's cows, hogs and chickens.
American farmers sold Mexico some 14 million tonnes of corn and almost 4 million tonnes of soy last year.
""This would be a last resort and we have to wait to see if by June 10 they've solved it,"" he said, referring to the date Trump said an initial 5% tariff on all Mexican exports would take effect if Mexico fails to stop the flow of migrants into the United States.
""I'm betting that they're going to solve it,"" he added.
BILLIONS AT STAKE
Trump's plan would ramp up the tariffs each month to reach 25% by October.
Responding to the threat, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday sent his foreign minister to Washington to negotiate a settlement with U.S. officials and repeated his desire to avoid a major confrontation with Trump.
He also said that for the time being he is not planning on lodging a formal complaint over the threatened tariffs to international bodies such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).
But Raul Urteaga, Mexico's top agricultural trade official in the previous administration, described Trump's tariffs as illegal under international trade rules.
""WTO rules and NAFTA don't contemplate the imposition of tariffs because of migration issues,"" he said.
""Mexico will not have any other option but to retaliate in kind"" if the U.S. tariffs are enacted, said Urteaga.
For decades, Mexico and the United States have engaged in complementary agricultural trade in which U.S. farmers sell large volumes of yellow corn and select meat cuts, for example, to buyers south of the border, while Mexican producers send products such as avocados and berries, among many others, north.
Last year, Mexico exported some $26 billion in agricultural products to the United States, according to CNA data.
Meanwhile, the U.S. exported $19 billion worth of agricultural products to Mexico in 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Around 80 percent Mexico's total exports are sent to the United States.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 07:21PM ET</span>",Struggles of transport stocks transmit caution to market,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Add this to worries about Wall Street: The index of planes, trains and trucking companies, considered an important stock barometer of the U.S. economy's health, is struggling.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average swooned 10.2% in May, a far steeper decline than that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. For analysts who closely watch the transports, this could be a sign of deeper market stress.
The transports were dealt another blow late on Thursday when U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose a tariff on all goods coming from Mexico until the flow of illegal immigrants across the southern border ceases.
In response, the Dow transport index dropped 1.9% on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling 1.3%. Rail operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), which derives a big portion of its revenue from Mexico, saw its shares tumble 4.5%.
The Dow transports started 2019 strong along with equities in general. But while the S&P 500 minted a new all-time high in April, the Dow transports have so far failed to reclaim their record peak set last September.
Now, with stocks also hit by concerns about a growing U.S.-China trade dispute, the Dow transport average is about 16% below its Sept. 14 all-time closing high.
""I see the performance of the transports really making it difficult for the broad market to sustain a big upward move,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
The transport stock weakness compounds other investor concerns, including that the U.S. trade war with China and other countries will harm the global economy and whether an expected pick-up in U.S. corporate profits will materialize later in the year. 
The 20 stocks in the Dow transport index, including airlines such as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), rail operators like  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) and package delivery companies FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), are ""leading indicators of the economy,"" said Miller Tabak equity strategist Matt Maley.
Therefore their underperformance, according to Maley, is a ""sign that growth in the U.S. economy was starting to slow even before the trade negotiations started breaking down.""
This year, as the market rebounded from its late-2018 dive, the transport index closed at 11,098.99 on April 24, within about 4% of its all-time peak last year. But by this week the DJT had dropped below 10,000, a technical support level that Maley and other strategists have been watching.
For the third time in recent months, the Dow transports fell to their lowest level compared to the Dow industrials since 2012, according to Refinitiv data, another indication of the stocks' struggles.
(Graphic: Transports lagging link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WBcByQ).
The transports and the industrials are often linked together for investors who follow Dow Theory, which tracks the two indexes to determine trends for the overall stock market.
Like the transports, the Dow industrials have yet to eclipse their all-time closing high, which was set in October. The industrials also recently joined the transports in trading below their 200-day moving averages, a key technical indicator for trends.
""Historically, what has been the best for markets is both the industrials and transports above their longer-term trends, but at this point it probably calls for further consolidation,"" said Will Geisdorf, ETF strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Florida.
""The market is going to have a tough time ripping higher from here without some leadership from the transports,"" Geisdorf said.
The sluggish performance of transport stocks stems largely from one reason, according to Baird analyst Ben Hartford: slowing economic growth.
In a late-cycle economic environment, Hartford said, ""until there's confidence that growth rates are going to bottom and re-accelerate, transport stocks and cyclically sensitive stocks in general"" tend to lag the broader market.
Among the Dow transports, airline, trucking and package delivery stocks generally have underperformed the S&P 500's 9.8% gain in 2019. For example, UPS shares are off 4.7% this year, United Continental Holdings Inc has dropped 7.3%, while J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc has slumped 8.5%.
But rail stocks have fared better, even with Thursday's Mexico tariff threat, with Union Pacific climbing 20.7% in 2019, and  Norfolk Southern  Corp (NYSE:NSC) rising 30.5%.
Rail companies have demonstrated efficiency through cost-cutting and other means, according to Hartford. They also do not face the same level of perceived structural threats to their overall businesses from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that package-delivery and trucking companies do, he said.
But even for rails, measures of volume show caution. For example, the Cass Freight index showed a 3.2% decline in shipments in April, its fifth month in a row of negative volume. Meanwhile, according to Hartford, U.S. rail carload growth has been negative in the second quarter so far, compared to a year ago.
If the railroad stocks falter, that knocks down the main pillar that has kept the Dow transports from more significant underperformance.

""I'll be watching to see if the recent roll over in the rail data, which has been disappointing, is followed up with a roll over in the railroad stocks,"" Maley said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Friday, as the S&P 500 closed out the month with its biggest May slump since 2010, after President Donald Trump's surprise threat of tariffs on Mexico fueled fears that a trade war on multiple fronts could lead to a recession.
Washington will impose a 5% tariff from June 10, which would rise steadily to 25% until illegal immigration across the southern border was stopped, Trump tweeted late on Thursday.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador responded by urging his U.S. counterpart to back down. 
""It really is applying a trade tariff to a national security issue and that is different,"" said Christopher Smart, head of Barings Investment Institute in Boston. 
""That is the issue and now what country is not vulnerable to tariffs or what political, diplomatic or national security issue won’t now include the threat of tariffs to resolve. So if you are an investor this is a significantly different world.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 354.84 points, or 1.41%, to 24,815.04, the S&P 500 lost 36.8 points, or 1.32%, to 2,752.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 114.57 points, or 1.51%, to 7,453.15.
Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed below their 200-day moving averages for the first time since March 8, seen as a strong technical support level that could presage further losses. 
For the week, the Dow fell 3.01%, the S&P 500 dropped 2.62% and the Nasdaq declined 2.41%. The weekly decline was the sixth straight for the Dow, its longest weekly losing streak since 2011. For the month, the Dow fell 6.69%, the S&P 500 dropped 6.58%, the Nasdaq declined 7.93% to mark the first monthly decline of the year for each index.
Investors have grown more worried about deteriorating trade talks between the United States and China and have sought safety in government bonds. Technology and energy have been among the hardest hit sectors since May 3 as Trump ramped up tariff threats with Beijing. 
U.S. Treasury yields fell to new multi-month lows. Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped as low as 2.128 percent, the lowest since September 2017.
The yield curve, as measured in the gap between three-month and 10-year yields, remained deeply inverted. Some investors view this as a sign a recession is likely in one to two years. 
Of the 11 major S&P sectors, only defensive plays utilities and real estate were on the plus side while eight were showing drops of more than 1%. 
U.S. carmakers and manufacturers were also pulled lower. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) dropped 4.25% and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co 2.26%, pushing the consumer discretionary sector down 1.44%. 
Adding to the downbeat mood, Beijing warned on Friday that it would unveil an unprecedented hit-list of ""unreliable"" foreign firms, as a slate of retaliatory tariffs on imported U.S. goods was set to kick in at midnight. Tariff-sensitive industrials declined 1.46%. 
Data showed U.S. consumer prices in April increased by the most in 15 months, but a cooling in spending pointed to a slowdown in economic growth that could moderate inflation pressures.
Among other stocks, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) tumbled 9.32% as the worst performer on the S&P 500 after the apparel retailer cut its 2019 profit forecast.
Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), which has substantial brewery operations in Mexico, slid 5.79%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.20-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 52 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 12 new highs and 210 new lows. 

About 7.92 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.01 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 06:00PM ET</span>",Auto sector scrambles after Trump threatens Mexican tariffs,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global auto and parts manufacturers scrambled on Friday to make contingency plans and look at ways of speeding some deliveries after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on all Mexican imports starting early next month.
Companies based in North America, Asia and Europe were holding conference calls and meetings to explore if they could move up certain shipments of parts and vehicles to mitigate tariffs on Mexican goods, auto executives and trade group officials said.
Those tariffs were set to begin at 5 percent on June 10 and rise from there - to 10 percent on July 1 and ultimately hitting 25 percent on Oct. 1 ""unless Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory,"" Trump said Thursday. 
Trump said on Twitter the tariffs were aimed at Mexico's insufficient response to migrants crossing the border illegally. The tweets blindsided business executives, who two hours earlier had learned from trade officials the administration hoped to push Congress to hasten a vote to approve a revised North American free trade deal, auto executives said.
Shares in auto companies slumped on Friday.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) warned that a 25 percent tariff on vehicles and parts imported from Mexico would result in $23 billion hit that ""could cripple the industry and cause major uncertainty.""
Some companies still hope Trump will reverse course, auto executives said. 
The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association warned U.S. governors, members of Congress and the White House that the tariffs ""will only serve as an additional tax on the American people by increasing the cost of goods and putting jobs and investment in the U.S. at risk. In short, this action will undermine U.S. economic stability.""
The industry has taken a series of trade hits since Trump took office in January 2017.
""It isn’t just this one thing; it is the cumulative impact of trade policies that are challenging the industry right now,"" said John Bozzella, who heads an auto trade group representing major foreign automakers.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said in a research note the Mexican tariffs could be ""devastating to the entire auto value chain"" and a 5 percent tariff could result a $300 per vehicle hit.
Autos are at the heart of U.S. trade talks with Japan and the European Union. ""If Trump will put these tariffs on Mexico, there will be no hesitance to tariff Europe,"" he wrote.
Already, Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs have added billions of dollars to the cost of assembling U.S. vehicles, and tariffs on Chinese-made parts have also hiked costs. Companies like General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and dozens of parts suppliers have petitioned for relief.
GM and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, citing a rapidly changing industry. Other companies have cut hundreds of jobs. 
Major suppliers like Delphi Technologies, Lear Corp and Visteon Corp all derive at least 22 percent of their global revenue from Mexico with a ""meaningful portion"" that crosses the U.S. border, Deutsche Bank said.
The industry also faces additional tariffs on Chinese-made goods. UBS warned that these, along with Mexican tariffs could push the U.S. economy into recession.
The industry has spent more than a year fighting to convince Trump not to carry through on a threat to impose up to 25 percent tariffs on all imported cars and parts on national security grounds. That decision has been delayed to allow for more trade talks with the European Union and Japan.
Trump, who has frequently boasted of a strong economy and stock market, believes the tariffs could actually boost U.S. growth. He said Friday that to avoid tariffs ""companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA."" 

Industry officials say it takes years and billions of dollars to shift production, and that lower-margin vehicles cannot be built profitably in the United States.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 05:45PM ET</span>","From prison, 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli sues ex-colleagues for $30 million","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur serving a seven-year prison term for fraud, on Friday sued three former colleagues at Retrophin Inc for more than $30 million, saying they illegally ousted him from that company in 2014.
In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Shkreli said Stephen Aselage, Margaret Valeur-Jensen and Gary Lyons fraudulently induced him to negotiate his exit from Retrophin, only to then ""trick him"" into signing away his rights as chief executive and founder without receiving anything in return.
Shkreli said the defendants were ""driven by their egos, jealousy, and greed,"" and that Aselage and Valeur-Jensen then ""paid themselves"" more than $35 million from assets he created.
Aselage is a director of Retrophin, where he also served as chief executive after Shkreli left, while Lyons is Retrophin's chairman. Valeur-Jensen is a lawyer who became the San Diego-based company's general counsel after Shkreli's departure.
Retrophin was not named as a defendant. The company, through an outside spokesman, declined to comment on the lawsuit or on the defendants' behalf. The defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. Shkreli's lawyer, Edward Kang, declined to answer questions about the lawsuit.
Shkreli said his damages estimate reflects compensation owed under his employment agreement ""and other compensation he would have received."" He is also seeking unspecified punitive damages.
Known as ""Pharma Bro,"" Shkreli, 36, is perhaps best known for raising the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by more than 5,000% while serving as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, now known as Phoenixus AG.
He also became known for his use of social media, including when he offered followers a $5,000 bounty for a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
A jury in Brooklyn, New York, convicted Shkreli in August 2017 of defrauding investors in hedge funds he once ran, and conspiring to manipulate Retrophin's stock price. He was acquitted on other charges.
Shkreli is serving his sentence at a low-security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania.
He had been imprisoned in Fort Dix, New Jersey, but was moved after The Wall Street Journal said in March he was helping ""call the shots"" for Phoenixus from there, with the aid of a contraband smartphone, as that company's ""shadow power.""

The case is Shkreli v Aselage et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-05120.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 04:25PM ET</span>","Mexico, Canada plow ahead with trade pact ratification plan despite Trump threats","By David Alire Garcia and David Ljunggren
MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Mexico and Canada said on Friday they would proceed with plans to ratify a new continental trade pact despite a new threat from U.S. President Donald Trump that critics say could undermine chances of the treaty coming into force.
Trump, whose administration has made passing the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement a priority, unexpectedly said on Thursday he would slap tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico unless a surge of illegal immigrants ceased.
Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the move undermined the relationship with Canada and Mexico.
""This is definitely a roadblock to securing passage of USMCA,"" he told CNN.
Trump made his threat the same day that Vice President Mike Pence visited Ottawa and said he was pushing to get the U.S. Congress to ratify the deal this summer after both Canada and Mexico moved to start the approval process this week.
The news rocked markets and prompted a flurry of protests from Mexican and U.S. business groups.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters on Friday that ratification efforts would continue.
""The opinion of the Executive is that the process of ratification of the treaty continues, that we comply with the commitments that were made and that we finish soon approving the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement,"" he said.
The Mexican and Canadian governments appeared unclear as to how serious Trump might actually be. The USMCA was agreed last year after 15 months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations marked by episodes of U.S. brinkmanship.
""It is a little strange, to say the least, that he decides to resolve the issue of immigration using tariffs,"" Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Luz Maria de la Mora said in an interview on Friday.
Canada and Mexico both ship more than 75 percent of all their goods exports to the United States and are heavily reliant on free trade.
""Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump's and what could be a big victory for the country,"" said U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley.
In Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declined to comment on what she described as a bilateral issue between the United States and Mexico.
""Our intention is, in so far as possible, to move in tandem with our partners,"" she told reporters.
Canada moved to ratify the deal by formally presenting it to parliament on Wednesday. 
Roland Paris, former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said there was no reason for Ottawa to react immediately to Trump's latest move given that Mexico was seeking clarification from Washington.
""That said, Trump's new threats are a reminder that we will need to remain vigilant, because negotiations for him never seem to be final,"" he said in an interview.
A Canadian source with direct knowledge of the situation said Ottawa was aware that Trump had not always followed through with previous threats to impose tariffs on trading partners.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 03:40PM ET</span>","Exclsuive: Fertilizer dealer Nutrien aims to triple U.S. farm loans, guided by ex-Walmart executive","By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian fertilizer dealer Nutrien Ltd is aiming to triple its lendings to U.S. farmers to $6 billion within five years, in a bid to drive up farm supply sales, its chief financial officer said.
Nutrien's push to expand farm loans starting this year comes as low commodity prices have depressed U.S. farm incomes, leaving growers less money to spend on seed and fertilizer.
""We are trying to provide the fuel for retail to grow,"" CFO Pedro Farah, a former Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc executive, told Reuters. ""We know whoever buys with financing tends to buy a lot more. It increases the depth of the relationship (with farmers) and the stickiness.""
Nutrien has not previously disclosed its target for farm loans. It told a meeting of investors this week that it intends to expand its financial arm.
The Saskatchewan-based company's current loans to U.S. farmers to buy supplies amount to $2 billion, or 8 percent of the U.S. farm input financing market, in which it competes with commercial banks, tractor-maker Deere & Co and rival farm suppliers such as CHS Inc.
Farah, a 58-year-old Brazilian by birth who joined Nutrien in February from Walmart, is leading the strategy, but adds that Nutrien was developing the idea before he arrived.
Expanding Nutrien's lending to customers mirrors a broad expansion of financial services by retailers such as Walmart, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), he said. 
""All retailers are recognizing that financial services are a key component of the sales process. It's something that, as a retailer, we've got to offer, especially in a market that's probably underserved,"" Farah said.
Nutrien is seeking the approval of credit rating agencies to raise its debt to equity ratio and lend more, starting this year, Farah said.
Nutrien's share of U.S. farm retail sales is a market-leading 20 percent, and the company has said it aims to grow further through acquisitions of smaller sellers.
Asked why Nutrien would expand U.S. farm loans when some banks see them as too risky, Farah said the company's longstanding relationships with farmers is a major difference.
""They don’t know growers as well as we do,"" he said.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 02:47PM ET</span>",How tariff hikes are squeezing the U.S. furniture business,"By Lisa Baertlein and Richa Naidu
LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump decided to raise tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this month, Francis O'Brien was left with no choice but to add a 4% fee on every item of furniture he sells.
O'Brien, who owns two Furniture Market retail stores Modesto, California, is trying to cover added costs from Trump's 25% levy on $200 billion of Chinese imports that hits on June 1. 
""I don't have any other option,"" he said of his decision to raise prices on all his furniture. ""It's too hard to go through the 5,000 products I have and figure out what's from China.""
Now, Trump may be forcing his hand again. The U.S. President on Thursday vowed to impose a 5% tariff on all goods coming from Mexico on June 10, and to increase that rate to 25% by October unless his demands on immigration curbs are met. 
""I don't know what I'm going to do with this Mexico thing,"" O'Brien said.
He is hardly alone in dealing with the chaos created by Trump's trade policy decisions. More than a dozen furniture retailers, manufacturers, and vendors interviewed by Reuters are already adopting strategies to mitigate the impact of the China tariffs, imposed as part of the bitter trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
Like O'Brien, some are hiking prices. Others said they are canceling or pausing orders. Still others are imposing tough new contract terms, rerouting sourcing and discussing ways to share costs with each other.
When Trump first imposed 10% tariffs on furniture and other Chinese goods in September, some furniture retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers agreed to divvy up the costs.
For instance, reclining chair and sofa maker Manwah Holdings, which ships around $470 million annually to large U.S. furniture retailers from its factory outside Shenzen, absorbed 5% of the 10% U.S. tariffs.
Now, with tariffs rising to 25%, Manwah is back in negotiations with retailers. ""Manwah has committed to additional tariff relief dollars but the amount will be based on an individual conversation with each of our customers,"" spokesman Kevin Castellani said in an email.
But such offsets are often limited to the big factories and purchasers, and many in the $114 billion U.S. retail furniture industry are scrambling to cope with a sharp rise in costs from their biggest supplier.
Last year, the U.S. imported $5.7 billion in wood furniture; $5.3 billion in upholstered furniture; $7.2 billion in ""metal and other"" furniture and almost $1 billion in mattresses from China for residential use, according to an analysis by investment banking and advisory firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson.

Jeff Child, president of Berkshire Hathaway's RC Willey Home Furnishings, canceled an order for leather chairs and sofas after one Chinese manufacturer declined to help cover the extra tariff. 
Unable to make the higher price work for his 12-store chain, Child scrapped the 15-container order, worth just over $300,000.
Many of Child's Chinese manufacturers covered up to half of the 10% tariffs, but the additional 15% is a heavy lift. ""It's a big bite for them too,"" Child said.
BEYOND CHINA
For some, the answer to the tariffs has been to look beyond China for supplies. 
Manwah, for instance, is more than doubling the size of its factory in Vietnam, which now ships 1,000 containers per month.
U.S. imports of Chinese-made furniture by retailers such as IKEA,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) fell 13.5 percent in the first quarter. That was partly offset by a 37.2 percent rise in shipments from Vietnam and a 19.3 percent increase in imports from Taiwan, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva. 
Mexico is the fourth-largest import of furniture to the United States, behind China, Vietnam and Canada, according a WorldCity analysis of U.S. Census Bureau trade data.
The strategy is not without risks. Alternate countries lack China's experienced labor force and efficient shipping and manufacturing infrastructure - something that concerns Harvey Karp, chief executive of startup Happiest Baby.
""It's a complex product so we can't just go to Vietnam, Indonesia or India,"" Karp said.
Karp said paying the 25% tariff would threaten the viability of his business because many parents already consider his $1,295 self-rocking bassinet - sold at  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY), Crate & Barrel and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) - too expensive.
Others raised similar concerns about pricing and demand. A typical furniture seller would have to raise the retail price of a table that wholesales for $400 to about $999 from $799 to cover the 25% tariff costs, said Stephen Antisdel, founder of Precept Partners, an e-commerce consultancy.
Big-ticket items like sofas and kitchen tables are subject to sticker-shock and, unlike necessities, are purchases that can be put off by consumers.
""Furniture isn't food. Rarely is it a case where somebody has to buy it,"" Antisdel said.
None of the industry players have enough profit margin to absorb the 25% tariffs, said Wallace Epperson, managing director at Mann, Armistead & Epperson. 
""The incremental 15% is really beginning to cut into the meat,"" Epperson said.
Big retailers have already begun squeezing the baby furniture supply chain by canceling or pausing orders and demanding contracts that will keep prices the same even with higher tariffs, said Kelly Mariotti, who heads the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, which represents about 200 makers of baby furniture and gear.
Top importers of Chinese furniture, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Target, Amazon, Home Depot, IKEA and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), declined to give specifics on how the tariffs are changing purchasing patterns.
But Delta Children, which supplies baby furniture to retailers like Walmart, William-Sonoma Inc's Pottery Barn and Wayfair Inc, is witnessing the shifts in buying patterns first hand. 
Delta raised prices 3% when the 10% tariffs hit - but still lost $8-$10 million in sales after some retail stores withdrew orders, said Joe Shamie, Delta Children's president, who declined to say which clients balked. 
It was just recovering from that blow when Trump said he would raise the tariff to 25%. That reignited anxiety among retailers, some of whom have canceled parts of orders. 

""The retailers are scared that the consumer is not going to be able to afford products so it's a trickle-down effect. And the cost of crib, or a child's bed or car-seat or bassinet is going up by 25%, if not more. The average middle American can't afford it,"" Shamie said.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 02:17PM ET</span>",Trump's Mexican tariffs threaten to disrupt auto sector,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Georgina Prodhan
TOKYO/MILAN (Reuters) - Shares of global automakers and suppliers tumbled on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, potentially upending a global manufacturing business model established decades ago.
From Mazda Motor Corp in Japan to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG in Germany to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in the United States, carmaker stocks took a hit as a new front opened in the global trade war. Analysts estimated the proposed duties could cost automakers and suppliers as much as $23 billion, an amount that Deutsche Bank's Emmanuel Rosner said ""could cripple the industry.""
Automakers and suppliers could try to pass along tariff costs to consumers. Swedish industrial seals and bearings maker SKF, which supplies carmakers in the United States from Mexico, said it would pass on any tariff impact to customers..
""Margins are so thin in the U.S. market right now that there's no way that any automaker is not going to pass on these tariffs to their customers,"" said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.
However, other analysts said tough competition and slowing demand for vehicles would likely force manufacturers to eat much of the added cost. That in turn could force more cost-cutting by auto sector manufacturers.
Major trade groups that represent the Detroit Three automakers and global automakers with U.S. operations criticized the proposed tariffs in statements Friday.
""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect – harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment,"" David Schwietert, interim head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in a statement that called tariffs a tax on consumers. 
Auto trade groups also expressed concern that a tariff war with Mexico would undermine efforts to win congressional approval for a new U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement negotiated by the Trump administration.
Automakers shipped 2.52 million vehicles to the United States from Mexico in 2018, accounting for about 14.6% of total U.S. car and light truck sales, according to IHS Markit, a consulting and market research firm.
Railing against a surge of illegal immigrants across the U.S. southern border, Trump said he would target all goods coming from Mexico with a 5% tariff from June 10, increasing monthly to 25% by Oct. 1, unless Mexico took immediate action.
""In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA,"" Trump wrote in a tweet on Friday.
Auto industry executives have said it would cost billions to abandon factories in Mexico and build replacements in the United States. For years carmakers and auto parts makers have built vehicles and parts in Mexico, taking advantage of its cheap labor, trade deals and proximity to the United States, the world's second largest auto market after China.
Mexico now dominates production of certain key automotive components, such as wiring harnesses - the networks of cables that connect on-board computers, brakes, headlights and other electrical systems. Mexico produces 97% of the wiring harnesses used in North American made vehicles, said Peter Nagle, senior automotive economist at IHS Markit. 
Trump's threat to impose tariffs rattled a number of global companies and industries. In addition to the auto sector, aerospace suppliers, industrial component makers and electronics firms are vulnerable. 
""This being escalated at a time when the China situation is not still resolved shows that Trump views tariffs as a weapon he can use without damage to the U.S. economy. That's worrying and sends a bad signal for the outlook for global trade overall,"" said Jon Harrison, a senior macro strategist at TS Lombard.

TRADE FLOWS
The latest threat to impose tariffs on millions of vehicles bound for the United States comes two weeks after Trump announced he would delay a decision on imposing up to 25% tariffs on vehicles from the European Union and Japan by up to six months.
Automakers shipped $52.6 billion worth of vehicles to the United States from Mexican assembly plants in 2018. Another $32.5 billion in auto parts flowed to the U.S. from Mexican factories, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.
Some of the most popular vehicles sold in the United States are made in Mexico, including versions of GM's Chevrolet Silverado pickup, the Chevrolet Blazer SUV, Volkswagen's Jetta sedan and Toyota Motor Corp's Tacoma pickup.
SHARE IMPACT
Trump's tweet ignited a global sell-off in shares of major auto industry players. In Japan, where Trump's initial tweet threatening tariffs landed as markets were opening, shares in Toyota fell 3% while Nissan dropped 5% and Honda 4%. Mazda took a bigger hit, tumbling 7%. All four operate vehicle assembly plants in Mexico, producing roughly one-third of the vehicles made there.
In Europe, potential merger candidates Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) led the carmakers lower, each falling 5%, while automotive supplier Faurecia SE was down 4% in late afternoon trading.

In Friday afternoon U.S. trading, shares of GM, Ford and big auto parts makers Delphi Technologies PLC, Aptiv PLC and seat maker Adient PLC all tumbled.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fidelity International, one of the largest shareholders in Acacia Mining, said on Friday Barrick Gold's low bid to buy the Acacia shares it does not already own showed a lack of judgment and it was a ""no brainer"" to reject it.
The comments in an interview are the first public response from one of Acacia's top shareholders since Barrick's offer earlier this month to buy them out for $787 million.
Barrick Gold spun off Acacia into a separate company in 2010, but owns 63.9% of it. Barrick has said the offer level reflects the risk of operating in Tanzania and it has until June 18 to turn the indicative bid into a firm offer.
Barrick had no further comment on Friday.
Fidelity International said the bid was around 50% too low.
""We are definitely not going to accept the offer,"" Alexander Wright, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, Acacia's sixth biggest investor according to Refinitiv data, told Reuters. ""At this price it's a complete no brainer not to accept it.""
Fidelity International, with headquarters in Bermuda and offices in London, owns 3.2 percent of Acacia. It would require 4 percent of Acacia's shareholders to block a compulsory sale and 18 percent to stop a delisting in the case of formal offer, analysts said.
Barrick's Acacia offer follows two years of wrangling over a $190 billion Tanzanian tax bill. A proposed settlement Barrick announced in February included a $300 million payment to resolve the tax claims.
Fidelity International is also a small shareholder in Barrick Gold and Wright said he was also indignant in that capacity. 
""I think it reflects extremely badly on Barrick,"" Wright said of the takeover bid. ""The ability to operate fairly and economically in Africa is important for the company. This shows a real lack of judgment.""
Wright said his most recent move into Acacia dated from 2017 when he made the assumption an amicable resolution to the company's dispute with the Tanzanian government would be found.
In the absence of a finalised deal with Tanzania, Acacia is expecting to go ahead with an international arbitration hearing in July, with an outcome expected by the end of this year. 

Acacia's shares reached a peak above 6 pounds in 2016 and have plunged to less than 2 pounds, although they rallied in February on the announcement of the proposed settlement and better than expected output.

Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) fell 1.4%, while  Aurora Cannabis  (TSX:ACB),  Cronos  Group (NASDAQ:CRON) and  Canopy Growth  Corp (NYSE:CGC) fell around 4%.
The FDA got its first public hearing on cannabidiol, one of the most common chemical compounds found in marijuana, underway, with a host of cannabis companies seeking to sway the FDA to permit the sale of cannabis-derived dietary supplements and foods products.
But before the arm-wringing has even begun, the agency warned there is still much to find out about the risks of cannabis food products.
In prepared remarks, Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless said there are ""real risks associated with (THC and CBD) and critical questions remain about the safety of their widespread use in foods and dietary supplements.""
While medical marijuana has been permitted in a number of states to treat various ailments, including severe pain and nausea, cannabinoid is not allowed in dietary supplements or foods.
Friday’s hearing is unlikely to prove anything more than a fact-finding mission for the agency, and many say this is just the first step in a long battle for cannabis companies' attempts to get their marijuana-infused munchies legalized."
1309,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>","Latin America hot money flows cool as growth ebbs, Trump threatens","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The nasty whiff of recession is hanging over Latin America and investors are taking cover as U.S. President Donald Trump ratchets up political and trade tensions. 
The flow of funds into the region's equity and bond markets has evaporated in recent weeks, indicators show, and a gloomy domestic - and suddenly darker international - economic backdrop threatens to trigger full-on outflows.
Trump dropped a bombshell on the world economy and markets on Thursday, vowing to slap tariffs on imports from Mexico of up to 25% unless the flow of immigrants into the United States from its southern neighbor stops.
That could be the trigger that switches a slowdown in demand for Latin American financial assets into a stampede for the exits, according to some analysts. All three of the region's largest economies contracted in the first quarter of the year.
""Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse,"" Deutsche Bank's global head of FX research George Saravelos said. ""The global economy is being faced with a huge uncertainty shock across multiple fronts ... This is a large additional shock.""
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) says Mexican and Brazilian bonds are particularly vulnerable to overseas investors cutting and running.
Some 61% of Mexico's local bond market is held by foreigners, the highest of any emerging nation. Second is Brazil, where 51% of local debt is held by foreigners. 
No other emerging country has over 40% of local bonds held by overseas investors, Deutsche figures show. The average across Latin America is 54%, compared with the emerging market average of 28% and more than double Asia's 23%.
Mexico's peso is also highly vulnerable to a quick-fire selloff, if the positioning of hedge funds and other speculators on U.S. futures markets is any guide. It has already tumbled 2.5% on Friday, its biggest fall since last October.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show that funds have amassed a huge net long position in the Mexican peso, effectively a bet that it will rise in value. Last month the net long position hit a record high 156,030 contracts, a collective bet of around $4 billion on the peso appreciating.
DEMAND EVAPORATING 
Figures from the Washington-based International Institute of Finance show that portfolio inflows - overseas demand for local stocks and bonds - have evaporated. In some cases, like Brazil, investors are now pulling cash out.
Non-resident portfolio inflows into Latin American markets in May were only $300 million, according to the IIF, easily the smallest inflow this year. April's figures show foreigners pulled out $1.7 billion from Brazil and $1.5 billion from Mexico, the first redemptions in both countries since December.
Official figures on Thursday showed Brazil's economy shrank in the January-March period for the first time since 2016. The 0.2% contraction raised the prospect that Brazil could fall back into recession this year. 
That followed a similar story the previous week of a 0.2% contraction in Mexico in the first quarter, before Trump's tariff thunderbolt. Throw in Argentina, which is already in a deep freeze that shows little sign of thawing ahead of October's presidential election, and Latin America investors have reason to be fearful.
""Clearly investors and analysts, including ourselves, have become more nervous,"" said Dirk Willer, managing director and head of emerging market strategy at Citi.
Analysis from Willer and his colleagues shows that investors have been withdrawing cash from Latin America mutual funds for over a month. Cumulative inflows this year now stand at just $106 million, after nudging $1 billion in mid-April.
It wasn't meant to be like this. Market-friendly reforms from newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro, notably on pensions, were supposed to trigger a long-awaited market and economic boom in Brazil, while Mexico's political shift left with the election of President Manuel Lopez Obrador last July didn't push the economy off a cliff, as some economists had feared. 
Although Argentina has been in a deep recession since the middle of last year and political uncertainty is rising, a series of government and central bank measures recently in tandem with a $50 billion International Monetary Fund aid package were supposed to mark a turning point.
That hope has faded.

""We are getting more concerned,"" said Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). ""Growth has been disappointing everywhere.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury has decided to skip the spring offering of its ""BTP Italia"" bond for the first time since it started selling this type of inflation-linked debt to small savers in 2012, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
The decision comes after an unsuccessful sale in November, when investor concerns over Italy's public finances under a populist government amid an escalating row with Brussels curbed ordinary Italians' demand for the bond.
Market tensions have heated up again ahead of a European Commission's decision next week over disciplinary steps against Italy for budget slippage. On Friday, the risk premium Italian bonds pay over safer German paper rose to a five-month high of nearly three percentage points.
Sources had told Reuters last week the Treasury was considering scrapping the sale given market turmoil and muted inflation sapping appetite for linkers.
In past the three years, Italy has offered the BPT Italia bonds twice a year, usually in April-May and October-November.
Asked for a comment, the Treasury told Reuters it remained committed to selling at least one new BTP Italia bond this year.
Rome introduced the BTP Italia bonds at the height of the euro zone debt crisis to tap large private wealth at home in the face of scant foreign demand for its debt.
These bonds have proved a success with both private and institutional buyers, leading to record-sized issues including a 22 billion euro single sale in 2013.
With the latest BTP Italia offer in November, the Treasury raised just 863 million euros from retail investors and 1.3 billion euros from institutionals.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 10:58AM ET</span>",Golf industry upturn is more Trump than Tiger,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Tiger Woods' Masters' triumph last month was an epic comeback for the former world number one after an 11-year major title drought, but it is Donald Trump who may better symbolize the U.S. golf industry's improving fortunes after a long lean spell.
While Woods' comeback has rekindled hopes of broadening the sport's appeal dashed by his past struggles on and off the course, the swelling ranks of older players, led by Trump's generation of baby boomers, are right now the main source of the industry's cautious optimism.
Take Jeff Huber, an Omaha, Nebraska, resident and chief executive of elderly care company Home Instead, who said golf took on a greater role in his life after he turned 50.
""There's something about that milestone birthday that really caused me to think 'okay how am I going to live my life intentionally' and golf has surfaced prominently as a major focal point for me,"" he said. Huber said not only he was dedicating more time to the sport, but also upgrading to more expensive clubs that are lighter and easier to swing.
The number of people playing on U.S. golf courses rose 1.7% to 24.2 million in 2018, the first reported increase in 14 years, according to data from the National Golf Foundation. 
""Two percent growth may not sound heroic, but for those who view the sport of golf as 'dead,' we believe this should serve as a potent correction,"" Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said.
While initiatives like computer-aided Topgolf have helped the game's profile, analysts and industry insiders chiefly credit two factors for an upswing that is also expected to bring the first rise in the number of rounds played since 2016. 
First, more Americans are retiring than ever. Secondly, Wall Street's decade-long bull run has finally helped replete savings wiped out by the financial crisis, making people willing to spend more on leisure.
U.S. retirement assets grew from $18 trillion in 2010 to just over $27 trillion at the end of last year, according to Investment Company Institute, an association of U.S. fund industry. 
Likewise, the share of those 65 and older in the U.S. population is expected to grow from 15.8% in 2016 to nearly 17% in 2020 and more than 20% by 2030, according to the United States Census Bureau.
PAST THE CRISIS
The lean times bankrupted many course operators and brought consolidation among equipment makers and retailers. 
Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) sold golf club maker TaylorMade in 2017,  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) exited the equipment business in 2016, while Golfsmith and Sports Authority, two retailers dependent on golf goods, went out of business in 2016.
Market research firm NPD, however, estimates mass market sales of golf equipment rose 8% in the 12 months ending November 2018, after a 4% drop in the prior year.
""Many people lost all their retirement savings in the crash and so had to work longer and I think we're getting past all that now,"" Matt Powell, senior industry advisor at NPD said.
That is good news for equipment makers and golf course operators, among them Trump, himself a regular visitor on his golf properties.
Clubmaker Callaway Golf Co has reported 14% average annual revenue growth over the last three years, and analysts expect its sales to rise 35% in its current fiscal year, largely as a result of rising sales of newer, more expensive equipment.
A strong economy was underpinning the business, but demographics were helping too, Harry Arnett, Callaway's executive vice president for global marketing said. 
""Baby boomers retiring could positively impact participation in the sport, and thus, potentially equipment sales as well,"" he told Reuters. 
Course operators say older players tend to spend more time and money on their hobby than younger ones.
Robbie Kearney, General Manager at Cimarron Hills Golf & Country Club in Austin, Texas, said among members between 50 and 70 several would play four to six times a week and did not scrimp on equipment or instruction.
""Those individuals are looking for the new putter and the new driver. They're spending money on golf instruction trying to get better and beat their friends,"" Kearney said.
Jefferies, citing National Golf Foundation data, says people play more rounds as they get older and no one plays more than those in their early 70s - the first cohort of the baby boom generation - those born during the first two post war decades.
David Abeles, Chief Executive Officer of TaylorMade told Reuters his company's 20% revenue increases in 2017 and 2018 were largely due to new technology in golf clubs and higher selling prices. 
While baby boomers get credit for improving business, the sport still has its sights on the younger generations. Kenneth Ameduri, editor of financial publication CrushTheStreet said the sport would not fully recover globally until millennials, the first generation predicted to outnumber baby boomers, start reaching their 40s in greater numbers.
And the industry has still high hopes for Tiger Woods.
""Now that (Woods) is back in the mix on Sundays, he's bringing a whole audience...back into the fold,"" Cimarron Hills' Kearney said.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 10:55AM ET</span>",Uber suspends XL service in Istanbul,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - U.S.-based ride-hailing service Uber (NYSE:UBER) will suspend its UberXL services in Istanbul from Friday, it said, though passengers in Turkey's largest city will still be able to call smaller yellow taxis through its app. 
The company, which reported a $1 billion loss on Thursday after spending heavily in the run-up to its initial public offering earlier this month, did not give a reason for the suspension but said it was committed to the Turkish market.
Tensions have risen in Istanbul, home to 15 million people, since Uber entered the Turkish market in 2014. Some Uber drivers say they have been threatened, blocked in traffic and beaten by yellow cab drivers, an accusation the industry denies.
""Unfortunately, we have made the difficult decision to suspend our UberXL service in Istanbul effective May 31,"" Uber said in the statement, which did not give a reason for the decision.
Uber has faced controversies in a number of markets since its launch, including allegations of sexual harassment against drivers and protests from existing taxi firms who complain that their business is being undermined.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in June last year that Uber was ""finished"" in Turkey, following pressure from Istanbul taxi drivers who said it was providing an illegal service and called for it to be banned.
The drivers took Uber to court last year, accusing the U.S.-based ride-hailing app of endangering their livelihoods and seeking its shutdown. The next hearing is due to be heard on July 3.
Uber said its app has been downloaded more than four million times in Turkey, where it operates in Istanbul and in the resort towns of Bodrum and Cesme in the summer months.

The company said some 12,000 people worked for UberXL, using large vans to transport groups to parties, or to run people with bulky luggage to Istanbul's airports. Yellow and turquoise cab drivers also use the Uber app to find customers.

Airbus declined to comment. AirAsia was not available for comment. 
AirAsia is one of the European planemaker's biggest customers with 100 A321neo and 232 smaller A320 jets in service and another 270 on order, according to Airbus data as of the end of April.

But the group is now reported to be considering converting part of that order into long-range versions of the smaller A321.
The A321XLR is expected to enter service in late 2023.
Airbus aims to launch the plane with at least 200 orders, industry sources say. 
AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes has placed several orders at annual air shows after taking negotiations down to the wire, but it is not yet known whether a deal to buy the A321XLR can be agreed in time for the June 17-23 Paris event.
Sales chief Christian Scherer has said Airbus is seeing more demand for longer-range versions of medium-haul jets like the A321, blurring boundaries with bigger jets.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",German Bund yield slides to record low as Trump-Mexico tariff vow rattles markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's 10-year bond yield slid to record lows on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods sent shock waves through world markets and heightened fears of a global recession.
Seen as unthinkable even a few weeks ago, the relentless fall in yields in what is seen as one of the world's safest assets -- German government debt -- speaks to the scale of pessimism gripping investors.
""The Trump Mexico tariffs surprised me and more so than the escalation in the trade war with China,"" said Nordea chief market strategist Jan von Gerich. ""This news is negative for markets and the economic outlook.""
The global outlook darkened further and a rally in so-called safe assets -- government bonds, yen and gold -- accelerated after a measure of Chinese manufacturing activity in May disappointed.
Dovish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Richard Clarida, saying the Fed would act if inflation stays too low or global risks endanger the economic outlook, only added to a sense that a U.S. rate cut may come sooner rather than later.
Germany's 10-year bond fell more than three basis points to a record low of minus 0.21%. It surpassed a previous all-time low hit in July 2016 just after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
The yield is down more than 20 basis points this month.
""Bund yields are at historic lows even as there are no real rate cuts priced in the euro area,"" said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at Futures First Info Services.
""It's either the biggest mispricing of the century, or Bund yields are headed below minus 50 bps.""
Data showing annual inflation in Germany eased sharply in May reinforced expectations for lower bond yields.
Yields on Dutch 10-year bonds fell below 0% for the first time since 2016.
French 10-year bond yields hit their lowest since 2016 at just 0.21% and Spanish and Portuguese yields kept hit fresh record lows.
Greece's 10-year bond yield fell below 3% for the first time.
The latest moves will have added to the pool of euro zone bonds carrying sub-zero yields. This amounted to 3.71 trillion euros by close of trade on Thursday, according to Tradeweb, a sharp rise from 3.44 trillion in April.
Worldwide, analysts reckon more than $10.5 trillion in bonds now carry negative yields.
""We have to repeat the old saying that the trend is your friend,"" DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk said.
U.S. Treasury yields are not in negative territory but they too resumed their slide, with 10-year yields falling to new 20-month lows. The U.S. yield curve, as measured in the gap between three-month and 10-year bond yields, was at its most inverted since 2007 in a sign of growing investor concern about recession risks.
And in Britain, 10-year gilt yields fell to their lowest since October 2016 at 0.85%.
But elsewhere in the euro zone, Italian yields jumped in response to the selloff in riskier assets, and growing concerns about the policies of the government in Rome.
Italy's government has no plans to issue small denomination bonds to help pay state debts owed to companies, the Treasury said, looking to quell market concerns about the introduction of a parallel currency.
The so-called ""mini-BOT"" scheme, named after Italy's Treasury bills, was drawn up by the ruling League party, and on Tuesday parliament approved a motion saying it should be considered.
Two-year Italian yields were up 10 bps at 0.76% but off highs hit earlier at 0.82%.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:55AM ET</span>","Explainer: Zambia's moves on Vedanta, KCM alarm mining industry","By Chris Mfula and Barbara Lewis
LUSAKA/LONDON - Zambia's decision to name a provisional liquidator to run Vedanta Resources' Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) business, one of the country's biggest employers, has rattled international miners concerned about rising resource nationalism. 
Vedanta, founded by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, is seeking international arbitration over Zambia's appointment of the provisional liquidator, it said in a statement on Friday.
Ahead of a court hearing in Zambia expected on June 4, which provides Vedanta with another chance to fight back, here are some responses to the questions thrown up by the case.
IS VEDANTA A SPECIAL CASE?
Vedanta Resources, part-owner of the Mumbai-listed Vedanta group of companies, is KCM's majority shareholder, while Zambian state mining company ZCCM-IH holds a roughly 20 percent stake. 
The Zambian government says KCM has breached the terms of its license. In London, it faces court action from nearly 2,000 villagers who allege their livelihoods have been destroyed by pollution caused by the company.
Analysts say Vedanta and KCM are a case apart, but with resonance for the other big miners in Zambia - Barrick Gold,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and First Quantum.
""It somehow sends some nuanced message to other mining companies to comply or be doomed,"" Chibamba Kanyama, an economist at Zambian consultancy Bridges said.
Mines Minister Richard Musukwa said it was a signal to other miners to follow the law. 
IS CHINA THE NEXT OWNER OF KCM?
Zambia has said it is looking for new owners for KCM and speculation is strong that China, Zambia's biggest creditor, is the most likely buyer.
Sources have said China is interested and that there are other potential buyers. Vedanta says KCM is not for sale. 
The president, who stands for re-election in 2021 and whose party lost a seat in the Copperbelt region in a by-election in April, could be wary of local opinion, which is firmly against more Chinese ownership.
But the government-appointed liquidator needs to bring in new money to run KCM, which requires significant investment, analysts say.
Vedanta has said it is willing to invest provided the right framework is in place. 
Western investors are generally wary of spending more in Zambia when they are struggling to guarantee returns, especially given the government's apparent determination to increase its tax take. 
""My view is that these assets were very mature and underinvested after 25 plus years of nationalization,"" Grant Sporre, an associate director at Macquarie, said.
""By taking over some of the shuttered operations, the government of Zambia can run these operations for cash, but this is a short-term strategy because at some point there will be the requirement for further investment,"" he said.
HOW IS ZAMBIA TACKLING ITS DEBT BURDEN?
Consultations are ongoing about a new non-refundable sales tax to replace value added tax.
Zambia will also cancel or delay more approved project loans to cut its fiscal deficit and rein in debt service payments.
Some analysts say Vedanta and KCM can negotiate with the government if they accept they must hand it a greater share of any earnings.
WHAT CAN THE MINERS DO?
Vedanta is pushing back with adverts in Zambian newspapers and social media pages.
Other miners have begun to retrench. Glencore is closing two shafts, which it says have reached the end of their economic life. 
First Quantum has retreated from threats to reduce its workforce in favor of seeking to negotiate with the government.
Earlier this year, sources who declined to be named said First Quantum had sought to buy out state mining firm ZCCM-IH, which also has a nearly 20 percent stake in its mines dating back to the privatization of the late 1990s.
The ZCCM-IH stake in Vedanta allowed Zambia to bring the liquidation case. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ZAMBIA'S ECONOMY?
Copper accounts for 12.2% of Zambia's GDP and 70% of its foreign currency earnings, according to last year's economic report released by the ministry of finance.
Ratings authorities and the International Monetary Fund have issued repeated warnings about the country's lack of liquidity and mounting debts.
Many mining operations do not yet pay tax on profits because they say they are still paying off capital expenditure, and the government is keen to increase its tax take.
Vedanta says it has invested $3 billion since 2004 and contributed $1.3 billion to the national exchequer.

It also says Zambia owes it more than $180 million in VAT refunds. Zambia disputes this figure.

Trump tweeted on Thursday that he would impose a 5% tariff starting June 10 on all Mexican exports to the U.S. unless the country stopped immigrants from crossing the border. The news also increased the likelihood that a trade deal between the U.S. and China is not likely any time soon.
“It is a very sticky situation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. 
“American companies needed to find supply chains outside of China when it looked like the (U.S.-China) trade deal is going to take much longer and one of those countries that was pointed to outside the Pacific was Mexico.”
Technology stocks were down, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) falling 1.6%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slipping 1% and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) down 1.7% as the electric car maker struggles to increase sales in China.
Shares of banks were also down, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) slumping 1.4% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) dipping 1.9%.
Meanwhile, Uber (NYSE:UBER) rose 0.3% after it posted a net loss of $1 billion, which was in line with forecasts.
In commodities, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,297.00 a troy ounce, while crude oil slumped 2.9% to $54.95. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, inched down 0.2% to 97.882.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 09:00AM ET</span>",German Bund yield slides to record low as Trump-Mexico tariff vow rattles markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's 10-year bond yield slid to record lows on Friday, after U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods sent shock waves through world markets and heightened fears of a global recession.
Seen as unthinkable even a few weeks ago, the relentless fall in yields in what is seen as one of the world's safest assets -- German government debt -- speaks to the scale of pessimism gripping investors.
""The Trump Mexico tariffs surprised me and more so than the escalation in the trade war with China,"" said Nordea chief market strategist Jan von Gerich. ""This news is negative for markets and the economic outlook.""
The global outlook darkened further and a rally in so-called safe assets -- government bonds, yen and gold -- accelerated after a measure of Chinese manufacturing activity in May disappointed.
Dovish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Richard Clarida, saying the Fed would act if inflation stays too low or global risks endanger the economic outlook, only added to a sense that a U.S. rate cut may come sooner rather than later.
Germany's 10-year bond fell more than three basis points to a record low of minus 0.21%. It surpassed a previous all-time low hit in July 2016 just after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
The yield is down more than 20 basis points this month.
""Bund yields are at historic lows even as there are no real rate cuts priced in the euro area,"" said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at Futures First Info Services.
""It's either the biggest mispricing of the century, or Bund yields are headed below minus 50 bps.""
Data showing annual inflation in Germany eased sharply in May reinforced expectations for lower bond yields.
Yields on Dutch 10-year bonds fell below 0% for the first time since 2016.
French 10-year bond yields hit their lowest since 2016 at just 0.21% and Spanish and Portuguese yields kept hit fresh record lows.
Greece's 10-year bond yield fell below 3% for the first time.
The latest moves will have added to the pool of euro zone bonds carrying sub-zero yields. This amounted to 3.71 trillion euros by close of trade on Thursday, according to Tradeweb, a sharp rise from 3.44 trillion in April.
Worldwide, analysts reckon more than $10.5 trillion in bonds now carry negative yields.
""We have to repeat the old saying that the trend is your friend,"" DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk said.
U.S. Treasury yields are not in negative territory but they too resumed their slide, with 10-year yields falling to new 20-month lows. The U.S. yield curve, as measured in the gap between three-month and 10-year bond yields, was at its most inverted since 2007 in a sign of growing investor concern about recession risks.
And in Britain, 10-year gilt yields fell to their lowest since October 2016 at 0.85%.
But elsewhere in the euro zone, Italian yields jumped in response to the selloff in riskier assets, and growing concerns about the policies of the government in Rome.
Italy's government has no plans to issue small denomination bonds to help pay state debts owed to companies, the Treasury said, looking to quell market concerns about the introduction of a parallel currency.
The so-called ""mini-BOT"" scheme, named after Italy's Treasury bills, was drawn up by the ruling League party, and on Tuesday parliament approved a motion saying it should be considered.
Two-year Italian yields were up 10 bps at 0.76% but off highs hit earlier at 0.82%.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:55AM ET</span>","Explainer: Zambia's moves on Vedanta, KCM alarm mining industry","By Chris Mfula and Barbara Lewis
LUSAKA/LONDON - Zambia's decision to name a provisional liquidator to run Vedanta Resources' Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) business, one of the country's biggest employers, has rattled international miners concerned about rising resource nationalism. 
Vedanta, founded by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, is seeking international arbitration over Zambia's appointment of the provisional liquidator, it said in a statement on Friday.
Ahead of a court hearing in Zambia expected on June 4, which provides Vedanta with another chance to fight back, here are some responses to the questions thrown up by the case.
IS VEDANTA A SPECIAL CASE?
Vedanta Resources, part-owner of the Mumbai-listed Vedanta group of companies, is KCM's majority shareholder, while Zambian state mining company ZCCM-IH holds a roughly 20 percent stake. 
The Zambian government says KCM has breached the terms of its license. In London, it faces court action from nearly 2,000 villagers who allege their livelihoods have been destroyed by pollution caused by the company.
Analysts say Vedanta and KCM are a case apart, but with resonance for the other big miners in Zambia - Barrick Gold,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and First Quantum.
""It somehow sends some nuanced message to other mining companies to comply or be doomed,"" Chibamba Kanyama, an economist at Zambian consultancy Bridges said.
Mines Minister Richard Musukwa said it was a signal to other miners to follow the law. 
IS CHINA THE NEXT OWNER OF KCM?
Zambia has said it is looking for new owners for KCM and speculation is strong that China, Zambia's biggest creditor, is the most likely buyer.
Sources have said China is interested and that there are other potential buyers. Vedanta says KCM is not for sale. 
The president, who stands for re-election in 2021 and whose party lost a seat in the Copperbelt region in a by-election in April, could be wary of local opinion, which is firmly against more Chinese ownership.
But the government-appointed liquidator needs to bring in new money to run KCM, which requires significant investment, analysts say.
Vedanta has said it is willing to invest provided the right framework is in place. 
Western investors are generally wary of spending more in Zambia when they are struggling to guarantee returns, especially given the government's apparent determination to increase its tax take. 
""My view is that these assets were very mature and underinvested after 25 plus years of nationalization,"" Grant Sporre, an associate director at Macquarie, said.
""By taking over some of the shuttered operations, the government of Zambia can run these operations for cash, but this is a short-term strategy because at some point there will be the requirement for further investment,"" he said.
HOW IS ZAMBIA TACKLING ITS DEBT BURDEN?
Consultations are ongoing about a new non-refundable sales tax to replace value added tax.
Zambia will also cancel or delay more approved project loans to cut its fiscal deficit and rein in debt service payments.
Some analysts say Vedanta and KCM can negotiate with the government if they accept they must hand it a greater share of any earnings.
WHAT CAN THE MINERS DO?
Vedanta is pushing back with adverts in Zambian newspapers and social media pages.
Other miners have begun to retrench. Glencore is closing two shafts, which it says have reached the end of their economic life. 
First Quantum has retreated from threats to reduce its workforce in favor of seeking to negotiate with the government.
Earlier this year, sources who declined to be named said First Quantum had sought to buy out state mining firm ZCCM-IH, which also has a nearly 20 percent stake in its mines dating back to the privatization of the late 1990s.
The ZCCM-IH stake in Vedanta allowed Zambia to bring the liquidation case. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ZAMBIA'S ECONOMY?
Copper accounts for 12.2% of Zambia's GDP and 70% of its foreign currency earnings, according to last year's economic report released by the ministry of finance.
Ratings authorities and the International Monetary Fund have issued repeated warnings about the country's lack of liquidity and mounting debts.
Many mining operations do not yet pay tax on profits because they say they are still paying off capital expenditure, and the government is keen to increase its tax take.
Vedanta says it has invested $3 billion since 2004 and contributed $1.3 billion to the national exchequer.

It also says Zambia owes it more than $180 million in VAT refunds. Zambia disputes this figure.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>",Cherry-picking through Turkey's gloom: The funds staying put while others flee,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - While Turkey's economy flounders, some foreign funds are buying into everything from fizzy drinks firms to automakers to banks as they winnow out likely survivors in the country's beaten down corporate bond and equity markets.
Many overseas investors and macro-focused asset managers are pulling out, alarmed by a combination of a falling lira, high inflation, monetary policy missteps and a damaging standoff between President Tayyip Erdogan's and the United States.
But with Turkey's main equity index down 4% this quarter, others are cherry-picking based on a different range of criteria, including companies' exposure to foreign markets, debt levels and relations with Erdogan. 
Germany-based Union Investment, which manages around 343 billion euros ($380 billion) globally, bought into dollar bonds belonging to Coca-Cola's Turkish bottler Icecek (CCI), and conglomerate Koc Holding. The sellers were international investment banks.
""We've seen the trade fears and volatility ...and usually it's a very good opportunity to get some bonds, to do some bottom-fishing,"" said Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment, who was satisfied with the 5 to 6 percent yield offered.
""I'm a long-term investor and long term we are quite positive on Turkey because you have a young population and huge disparity between the top corporates issuing bonds with strong corporate governance (and) strong risk management.""
Many investors choosing such names cite their low levels of debt and healthy cashflow, allowing them to withstand the lira slump and a recession-plagued economy.
They're also favored because they're large exporters. CCI exports to several former Soviet and Middle Eastern countries.
""The overall thesis is the economy is weak and will remain weak ...and the export sector has become more competitive,"" said Julian Mayo, chief investment strategist at investment management firm Fiera Capital. 
He favors Turkey's only refiner Tupras, carmaker Tofas, a joint venture of Koc Holding and Italy's Fiat, and household appliance maker Arcelik. 
Financial adviser Lazard Asset Management already has overweight exposure to Turkish equity and is considering adding to its holdings. ""Along with Russia, Turkey is the cheapest market in the world among significant markets,"" said James Donald, its managing director for emerging markets equity. 
""...When you discount the risks we think there's still value... If the currency improved we might add other names with exposure to the domestic economy.""
'HIGHLY POLITICIZED'
Economic risks include a prolonged recession or sovereign default, while business relations with Erdogan and the Islamist-rooted AK Party constitute a political one.
Links between Koc Holding's eponymous family owners - prominent among Turkey's secular business elite - and the AKP have at times been testy, with some companies in its portfolio, including Tupras, in the past hit with fines.
""This a highly politicized situation where friends of the government are spared... and larger banks and larger companies (that) have a history of opposing Erdogan will probably take the brunt (of economic adjustments),"" said Jan Dehn, head of research at emerging markets investment manager Ashmore Group.
Many banks have been hobbled by a build-up of bad debt linked to the slumping construction and energy sectors, while Erdogan has harangued the sector for not cutting borrowing costs.
But some see value.
""We have an acquisition in some of the private sector banks but at a senior level (that)... looks quite interesting in terms of value,"" said Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management.
He declined to specify those banks but highlighted Akbank and Garanti Bank as favored names, in part due to their conservative approach to risk management. 
Their senior dollar bonds offer 7-8% yield, compared to 4.5-5% for the subordinated bonds of leading Brazilian banks, he noted.
""Turkey is not Brazil. It's in a tough spot but if you don't think they're going to the wall then its quite interesting as you're well compensated."" Alloatti said.

Dergachev's Union Investment bought Akbank dollar bonds this month. ""In terms of liquidity, even assuming there's no rollover, they (Akbank) have liquidity for at least mid to end 2020, so they have good liquidity,"" he said.

1337,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>","New York City Ride-Sharing Cap Fails to Slow Uber, Lyft Rides","(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s efforts to curb traffic from ride-sharing apps may have pushed up prices for passengers but demand remains strong.
In March, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), Inc. completed 17,248,340 trips in NYC, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of data from the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission. That’s the highest number of rides Uber has completed in any given month based on TLC data for the past three years. Rival ride-hailing service  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). completed 4,699,040 rides in March, also marking the company’s largest trip per month yet. Trip data for April and May is not available yet.
Record months for Uber and Lyft came despite efforts from NYC to curb the congestion caused by ride-hailing apps. In August, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a package of bills to limit new licenses to ride-sharing drivers. And earlier this year, NYC passed a rule requiring passengers to pay congestion surcharges on top of the fee for a ride. NYC also set a minimum wage for Uber and Lyft drivers, putting further upward pressure on prices.
The congestion surcharge rule targets passengers of all ride-hailing vehicles and could further damage the taxi industry which has already suffered from the rise of ride-sharing firms. The number of yellow taxi rides per day has plunged 22% in the two-year period ending December 2018.
NYC’s new ride-sharing rules were implemented less than 12-months ago so it may take time to see the full effects."
1338,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>","S&P investors sold in May. Now, will they go away?","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - ""Sell in May and go away"" is a popular saying on Wall Street based on the S&P 500's historical underperformance from May through October. With a host of uncertainties fuelling fears of a global slowdown, this could be one of the years when the adage holds true. 
Since many investors take time off during the summer, there tends to be lower trading volume and less appetite for stocks during the period. Lower participation can also increase volatility, strategists say. 
Added to the summer effect this year are an escalating trade war between the United States and China, U.S.-Iran tensions and Britain's uncertain exit from the European Union.
graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WsxbBG 
There's also the stock rally in the first four months of this year. After surging 17.5% January through April, the benchmark S&P index reversed course in May as hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal faded on pledges for more tariffs from President Donald Trump.
With one trading day left in the month, the S&P 500 has declined 5.3% so far, in what is likely to be its first May decline since 2012. 
""The fact we had a big first four months and May has been weak tells us the market is behaving very close to seasonal historical patterns,"" said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac, a handbook for investors.
Hirsch says the S&P could see a slight rebound in June, but he expects weakness from July through October. 
The May-October period has shown an average 1.4% gain for the S&P 500 compared with a 7.1% gain between November and April going back to 1950. And in that timeframe, the S&P's performance was stronger from November to April than May to October 65% of the time, according to data from Hirsch. 
He pointed to 44 S&P declines between May and October compared with 15 declines between November and April since 1950. The last S&P May through October decline was in 2015.
A big decline in May doesn't necessarily point to big losses in the summer, however, according to Bespoke Investment Strategist co-founder Paul Hickey. 
Bespoke's data shows that if an investor bought the S&P 500 index at the start of November and sold at the end of April every year starting in 1928, they would have seen a 4,661.6% gain by April 30, 2019, against a gain of 185% in the May-October period. 
The difference starting in 1945 is even more dramatic, according to Hickey, with a 8,670.8% gain for Nov-April compared with 101.5% for May-October. 
REFLEX 
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, is hoping for a ""reflex rally"" in June but expects stocks to ""trade sideways or lower"" in the third quarter.
""Trade discord could be the catalyst for why the third quarter is weak,"" said Stovall. ""A lot of people are worried it could throw us into global economic softness if not outright recession.""
This year, many investors say that concerns about the tit-for-tat U.S.-China trade tariffs will put far greater weight on stock markets than the typical seasonal pressures.
""The path of least resistance is likely lower for a while because we think the trade war will go on for some time,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. ""But when you have an overwhelming macro-economic influence like a trade war or a recession, that's going to overwhelm seasonal patterns.""
After May's sell-off, investors are laser-focused on trade and any clues on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, said Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco in New York. 
""Whether investors go away for the rest of the summer has a lot to do with two factors: trade news flow and what the Fed does,"" said Hooper. 
Since the S&P rose so much in the first four months, Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, is betting that monthly declines will continue.
In the four years out of the last 50 that the S&P has dropped by more than 5% in May, it also dropped that amount twice in June, he said.
""We're not out of the woods in terms of market weakness. Investors should still be on heightened alert for more of a pullback,"" said Detrick.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Global funds recommend stashing cash in face of trade war: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds became more cautious in May, shunning equities, recommending increasing cash holdings to their highest in three months and raising bond allocations to a level not seen in nearly two years, a Reuters poll showed.
That underscores worries over conflicting comments on U.S.-China trade talks and U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on Mexico that risk tipping the global economy into recession.
""We believed the U.S. and China would resolve their differences over trade in a reasonable amount of time. But that confidence has been shaken. Policymakers are running with scissors and that may lead to self-inflicted wounds,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.
The trade battle has rattled financial markets this month, with the S&P 500 down over 5%, after it rose more than 17% through the first four months of the year, and Treasury yields slipping to multi-month lows.
The yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes has not only inverted, but the inversion is now the widest in nearly 12 years, as the Great Recession approached, a clear sign recession risks are rising again.
A majority of fund managers and chief investment officers polled by Reuters said the most likely change to their portfolios was a reduction in riskier assets or, at best, that they would roughly maintain current risk positioning over the next six months.
The average recommended exposure for stocks in May was the lowest since February, down to 46.7% from 47.0% the previous month, according to the latest poll of 41 funds in the U.S., Europe, Britain and Japan conducted May 13-30.
""The breakdown in U.S.-China trade negotiations in May has become worrisome in that the disagreements appear to have evolved into a defense of national policy and values, particularly for the Chinese. This suggests that an agreement may take longer than expected, and we reduced equity exposure accordingly,"" said Via Nova's Gayle.
A recommended cash increase to 6.0% was the highest since February, up from 5.2% in the previous month. Suggested bond allocations for a model global portfolio were also increased, to the highest since August 2017, to 40.8% from 40.5%.
The more defensive approach of long-term investors does not align with the approach of more than 200 equity strategists in a separate Reuters poll, who expected global stocks to keep rising. But they did say an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war poses the biggest hurdle.
However, some fund managers in the latest poll did argue that expectations for solid U.S. economic performance this year and expensive government bonds will keep their preference for equities intact.
""We started positioning more defensively, but we still prefer equities over bonds. Over the next six months, I anticipate we will get more constructive again on cyclical stocks and equities in general,"" said Benjamin Suess, director at UBS Asset Management.
A breakdown of regional allocations showed recommendations for North American assets - both stocks and bonds - rose to the highest since at least the beginning of 2013, at the expense of euro zone holdings, according to a smaller sub-set of fund managers in the poll.
""We believe the U.S. has the best growth prospects within an increasingly challenged global economy. If policymakers can avoid self-inflicted wounds such as trade wars, the equity markets can continue to move higher,"" Gayle said.

1340,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 31, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",BMW's $1 Billion Factory Caught in Trump's Mexican Standoff,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s vow to impose a 5% tariff on Mexican goods comes just in time to hit exports from a $1 billion BMW AG (DE:BMWG) factory that opens in the country next week.
A swathe of the 3-Series sedans to be made at the plant in San Luis Potosi are destined for U.S. dealers. Higher duties mean a hard choice for the Bavarian automaker -- raise sticker prices or take the hit to profits on its best-selling model.
It’s not the kind of calculation executives were expecting to make when they chose to build BMW’s first factory in Mexico, with its low labor costs and zero duties on exports to the world’s second-biggest car market. The tariffs will take effect on June 10, the U.S. President said in a Twitter post on Thursday night.
It’s another blow for a company whose sales are falling as German rivals challenge its dominance of the premium car segment, pushing profits to decade-lows. BMW spent years surfing on demand for prestige vehicles among China’s emerging middle class, leaving it brutally exposed as Washington and Beijing erect new tariff barriers in an escalating trade dispute.
The Mexican factory is expected to account for one-fifth of BMW’s North American production. BMW currently produces most of its cars for North America in South Carolina but leans heavily on components imported from Mexico. It bought $2.5 billion worth of parts from Mexican suppliers in 2015.
BMW is now expected to ramp up Mexico output slower than originally planned, said Juergen Pieper, head of automotive research at Bankhaus Metzler. In a research note Friday, Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said the tariffs could be a “major blow” for BMW and other carmakers.
“MAGA clearly does not stand for ‘Make Auto Great Again,”’ he wrote.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Friday it would price its China-made Model 3 vehicles from 328,000 yuan ($47,529), 13% cheaper than those it currently imports as it pushes sales in the fast growing market. 
The carmaker has been building a factory in China since January where it its initial output will be Model 3 cars. Pre-orders for the vehicles will also start on Friday, the company said on its website.
The ""standard range plus Model 3"" is 49,000 yuan cheaper than China's current cheapest version, also standard range plus, even though it remains unclear whether the carmaker will qualify for China's subsidies for new energy vehicles.
The starting prices for five different versions of China-made Model 3s range from 328,000 to 522,000 yuan. Customers can expect to receive the car in 6-10 months, the company said in a press release. 
It also said buyers will only need to put down a deposit of 20,000 yuan and that financing options on offer meant that monthly payment instalments will start from 1,100 yuan.
""The price drop is to make Tesla more accessible,"" it said.
The higher-end version of the Model 3 will still be imported from the United States.
Investors are focused on whether the gross profit margin on the Model 3 will remain around 20% in China.
CRUCIAL PRODUCTION
Doubts about the Model 3's production rate and sales performance have hit Tesla's share price in recent months.
Producing cars locally is likely to help Tesla minimize the impact of Sino-U.S. tit-for-tat import tariffs, which has forced the EV maker to adjust prices of its U.S.-made cars in China. 
Keeping prices in check will also help Tesla fend off competition from a swathe of domestic EV startups such as Nio Inc, Weltmeister and XPeng Motors, as well as established carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Tesla's so-called Gigafactory is China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant and is seen as a reflection of the country's broader shift to open up its car market.
Pictures of the Shanghai plant posted on Tesla's social-media account showed construction of its main section was nearly done. The company also held a recruitment event this week for car manufacturing and logistics workers. 

Tesla forecast its deliveries in 2019 would reach 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles and said it may produce as many as 500,000 vehicles if its China factory reaches volume production in the fourth quarter.

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. each fell more than 3%.
The latest blow in the trade disputes adds to a month that has trimmed 12% from the 24-member S&P Supercomposite Automobiles and Components Index, shaving $18.4 billion in market value in May through Thursday. It was on track to be the worst month for the sector since December’s 14% slump, although Friday’s declines could push the group to its worst month since November 2016.
Citi analyst Itay Michaeli sees tariffs having a bigger impact on GM than on Ford, due to its higher production from Mexico on higher-margin vehicles. A 5% tariff could become a “several-hundred-million-dollar” hit to annual earnings for GM, he said. GM fell 4.9% on Friday, while Ford slipped 4.3%.
Among parts makers, Delphi Technologies plunged 8%, Adient fell 4.2%, Goodyear Tire & Rubber lost 2.85, and Aptiv dropped 2.7%. Michaeli also named American Axle, Lear, Magna International and Visteon among suppliers with the biggest exposure to Mexico.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Netherlands on Friday became the latest euro zone state to see its 10-year yields fall below zero percent, joining a pool of negative-yielding euro government bonds that grew in May to encompass 48% of the bloc's outstanding debt.
This proportion, the latest sign of the pessimism gripping world markets, is the highest since September 2016, according to data from Tradeweb.
Bond yields across major developed markets have plunged this year as weak data, trade tensions and a dovish policy shift from major central banks boost demand for fixed income.
That trend has accelerated in May on signs of increasingly bitter trade tensions, heightened Brexit uncertainty and fears that Italy is set for another budget clash with Europe.
Of around the 7.69 trillion euros ($8.57 trillion) of euro area government bonds in the Tradeweb system, the proportion of debt yielding less than zero rose to 3.71 trillion euros or 48% of the total in May, data from the trading platform as of the close of trade on Thursday showed.
It is up from 3.44 trillion euros or roughly 45% in April. It is the largest share since September 2016, a year when deflation risks and global growth worries last drove bond yields in the bloc deeply negative.
""Bond markets are telling you that disinflation is coming,"" said Tim Graf, chief macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in London.
""It speaks to a situation where markets are discounting more of a global slowdown than maybe we had previously thought,"" he said, referring to the deepening pool of negative-yielding government debt.

Friday's sharp drop in euro zone debt yields following U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods -- suggests the pool of government bonds carrying sub-zero yields has only deepened.
Worldwide, analysts reckon more than $10.5 trillion in bonds now carry negative yields. That essentially means that in secondary bond markets, investors are willing to pay governments for holding their debt.
In Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy and its benchmark bond issuer, yields on 10-year government bonds fell to record lows at minus 0.21%.
The yield on the triple-A rated Dutch 10-year bond yield, teetering close to 0% for days now, turned negative for the first time since 2016. It was last trading down 3 basis points at minus 0.014%.
Tradeweb data also showed almost 29% of euro zone government bonds -- some 2.2 trillion euros worth -- now yield less than the European Central Bank's deposit rate of minus 0.40 percent, the highest since December 2016. The proportion was 25% at the end of April.
""It is not a surprise that the pool of negative yielding bonds has risen,"" said Jan von Gerich, chief market strategist at Nordea. ""There is no sign of a bottoming out in yields yet.""

BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which have plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and U.S. trade deals with its southern neighbor, were down by as much as 2.9 percent by 0800 GMT.
Shares in Asian auto makers dropped overnight.
Trump said he would hit goods coming from Mexico with a 5% tariff and would hike that levy each month until it hits 25% on Oct. 1, unless Mexico takes immediate action against illegal immigration across the U.S. border.
A spokesman for VW subsidiary Audi said the company was watching developments very closely but it was too early to speculate on outcomes.
A note by car analyst Arndt Ellinghorst described German carmakers as exposed, noting BMW's new plant at San Luis Potosi represented nearly 20% of its production for North America.
An auto industry source said the situation was puzzling in that the migration issues belonged to the political stage and came despite an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the making for this summer.
It also came as the EU and the United States are working to avoid an escalation in trade conflicts.

Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann said: ""The U.S. trade policy has taken a qualitatively different turn. Using tariffs as a tool for non-economic goals is something which brings a new quality to proceedings.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - KKR & Co has appointed former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as a global senior advisor, the global investment firm told Reuters on Friday.
The appointment is effective from June 1, KKR said in a statement.
Turnbull, 64, served as Australia's 29th prime minister from September 2015 to August 2018, when he was ousted in a leadership battle.
The appointment marks a return to the world of finance for Turnbull, a former lawyer who held a host of high-profile corporate roles before entering politics as a local member of parliament in 2004.
In the 1990s, Turnbull was the local managing director of global investment bank  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). He was also an investor in one of Australia's first internet service providers, OzEmail, reportedly buying a stake for A$500,000 ($345,450) in 1994 and selling it for A$57 million to MCI Worldcom five years later.
In office, Turnbull had several Cabinet ministries and shadow ministries for the conservative-leaning Liberal-National coalition, before orchestrating a leadership coup and becoming prime minister in September 2015.
He was himself unseated as prime minister in another leadership challenge in August 2018, one of four Australian prime ministers to be overthrown by their own party in a decade.
Turnbull's first appointment since leaving the government puts him in the company of several Australian prime ministers and senior politicians who have take up financial advisory roles after leaving office.
Former Prime Minister Paul Keating became an adviser to investment bank Lazard Australia, while former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr became a consultant to the country's biggest investment bank, Macquarie Group Ltd.
KKR counts around 18 senior advisors and 27 industry advisors who provide counsel on investment implications of trends and developments in public policy, regulation, societal needs and technology around the world.
Among the senior advisors with experience in the Asia-Pacific region are the former group chairman of  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC, John Bond, former chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd Leigh Clifford and former Singaporean minister Lim Hwee Hua, KKR's website showed.

SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shanghai wine importer Alex Chen has spent the last 10 days moving all his American wines - from chardonnays to zinfandels - out of warehouses in the city's free trade zone before they are hit with an extra tariff that kicks in on Saturday.
On both sides of the Pacific, importers and exporters are scrambling as further tariffs of 15% come into effect, on top of the 10% duties imposed last September. The new tariffs will force them to raise prices, take a further hit on margins, or, if they can, find alternatives.
Chen figures he has stock to last three months, after which - barring an easing in the increasingly bitter U.S.-China trade war - he plans to focus on partnerships with wine suppliers from places such as Chile or Australia. 
China's added tariffs on American wines would leave no margin for importers like his firm, Alexander Wine Co., he said.
""This will collapse the market for U.S. wines.""
The 10-month-old trade war between the world's two largest economies escalated early this month, with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing a new round of tariffs, prompting China to respond and forcing companies in the cross-fire into a scramble to raise prices or shift strategy. 
Harlan Stone, chief executive of Connecticut-based Metroflor, said he sent e-mails to his distributors to inform them of his plans to raise prices on his China-made vinyl flooring by 13.5% after Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese goods on May 9. 
Stone said he and his distributors had shouldered the initial 10% tariff last year.
""Over the long term, we believe the market can absorb the 10%, but we know the marketplace can’t absorb the additional 15,"" said Stone, who sources the luxury vinyl tile he sells in the United States from factories on China's eastern coast. 
""This will go straight to the consumer and no one knows whether their buying habits will stay the same. There is risk.""
FINDING ALTERNATIVES
The trade war is changing the flow of global goods, with U.S. companies shifting purchases of affected products including furniture, refrigerators and car tires to countries such as Vietnam and South Korea, analysis by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva showed last month.
Trump, incensed by a surge of illegal immigrants across the southern border, vowed on Thursday to impose a tariff on all goods coming from Mexico, threatening to further disrupt global trade flows.
Chinese purchases of U.S. products have also suffered. Total U.S. agriculture product shipments to China dropped 44%, or $2.1 billion, in the first quarter of 2019 versus the same period in 2018, according to United States Department of Agriculture data. 
Those figures include a 45% drop in U.S. breakfast cereal shipments, and a 34% decline beef imports, and a 20% cut in U.S. pork purchases. Imports of pet food dropped 35%, wine and beer fell 20%, and Chinese purchases of U.S. tree nuts such as almonds dropped 47%.
(GRAPHIC: China's purchases of U.S. products drop as trade war intensifies - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WAebBk) 
Some importers in China told Reuters they were opting to source more pork and beef from countries including Argentina or Spain, as selling U.S. products grew less competitive. 
Shanghai-based wholesaler Gusto Fine Foods scrapped plans to put Berkshire pork from the United States on the list of produce it offers to high-end restaurants and hotels in China last year after the tariffs hit. 
""The importer told us right away that due to tariffs, the next time you buy it from me, my cost is going to go up 30-40%,"" said Dmytro Soroka, Gusto's operations manager. 
""And we were like, forget about that one, there are other pork suppliers out there. There's Spain, there's South America ... The price going up will only make other products that we carry from different origins more interesting to our customers."" 
MARKET SLUMP 
Others, such as U.S. wine distributors with a focus on China, said they were finding it tough to be optimistic in the current climate. 
Michael Honig, president of Napa Valley's Honig Vineyard & Winery, said prior tariff increases undid 10 years of investment in China. In 2016, his small family winery sold about 1,000 cases in China. That dropped to zero last year.
""We had this wonderful trajectory up, now it’s down in the basement,"" said Honig, who worries U.S. producers could be locked out of the competitive Chinese market for years.
U.S. wine exports to China were $59 million in 2018. That was down 13% in volume and off almost 25% in value compared to 2017, according to the Wine Institute.
David Amadia, president of Ridge Vineyards, which sells about 2% of its 90,000-case production to China, said the suddenness of the latest round of retaliatory tariffs left him no time to send shipments ahead of the deadline.  

Instead, he may work with his importer to shift supplies to Hong Kong, where wine is duty free and 2018 U.S. exports totaled $130 million. ""That's become the fall-back for wineries,"" Amadia said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is interested in buying prepaid cellphone wireless service Boost Mobile from U.S. carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Amazon is considering buying Boost - currently one of Sprint's prepaid brands - mainly because the deal would allow it to use the new T-Mobile's wireless network for at least six years, one of the sources said.
New T-Mobile is the name used by T-Mobile and Sprint to refer to the new entity that will result from their potential merger. 
Amazon would also be interested in any wireless spectrum that could be divested, the source said. 
Amazon declined to comment. T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
It was not immediately clear why the largest U.S. online retailer would want the wireless network and spectrum.
Amazon has already been building experience by offering phone calls through its Echo Connect product, which uses a person's home phone service and allows an Alexa-enabled voice-activated speaker to make phone calls. 
Amazon, which started out selling books, has a long history of exploring new ventures, such as making original TV shows for Amazon Prime members. It is now one of the Big Four technology companies along with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and is a leading cloud services provider.
T-Mobile and Sprint have already pledged to sell Boost as part of measures to reduce their market share in the prepaid wireless business and gain regulatory approval for their planned $26 billion merger.
The U.S. Justice Department would need to scrutinize the buyer of a divested asset to ensure it would stay viable and preserve competition.
The carriers are also considering divesting wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, in order to push the merger through.
The merger, if approved, would leave the United States with three wireless carriers instead of four. Some consumer advocates have raised concerns that the merger could raise prices for wireless users and have called for an additional competitor. 
The sale of Boost could fetch up to $3 billion, potential bidders previously told Reuters.
This month, analysts at Cowen estimated Boost has 7 million to 8 million customers and a transaction could be valued at $4.5 billion if the deal included wireless spectrum, or the airwaves that carry data, and facilities. 

Sprint has not disclosed the number of Boost customers.

China’s official manufacturing PMI for the month of May fell to 49.4 from 50.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics showed. Analysts previously expected the figure to drop to 49.9 in May.
A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.
The service PMI for May was 54.3, in line with expectations and unchanged from April.
The weaker-than-expected data came amid the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Former governor of the People’s Bank of China Dai Xianglong said on Friday that he expected no major trade breakthrough when Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump next month at the G-20 meeting.
Citing people familiar with the matter, a Bloomberg report said China has halted purchases of American soybeans and is not expected to resume buying due to the disagreement over trade.

The structures have run into trouble as volatility has taken off. As measured by 3-month/10-year swaption volatility, a benchmark, it plunged to near record lows in early May. Structures initiated at that point have fared poorly as the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions moved yields away from the targeted strikes and the volatility benchmark back toward its highest levels of the year.
CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) open-interest data for Wednesday suggest that a large purchase of a bond strangle -- combining a lower-strike put and a higher-strike call -- was done to exit a short-volatility position at a loss of as much as $12.6 million on the options. To be sure, if it was hedged with a long in Treasury futures, the trader’s net result was better, if not good.
Such structures became popular in early May, and their accompanying hedges bear some responsibility for the drop in Treasury yields to multimonth lows. If others follow in dumping them, that could help put the brakes on the rally.

1358,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>",Anxiety Plagues China's Stock Traders After Five Weeks of Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- A brutal month for China’s stock traders is ending with a lingering sense of unease.
Investors remain on edge even as the Shanghai Composite Index heads for a weekly gain, following a five-week losing streak that turned it into the world’s worst-performing major benchmark. It’s down 5.6% in May, with foreigners fleeing at a record pace and mainland investors reluctant to buy the dip. The correction was so unexpected, it triggered an unprecedented rush to buy the scarce hedging tools available to onshore stock investors.
While souring trade relations ground China’s bull market to a painful halt this month, stocks are now meandering through their longest streak of calm since February. But investors will have no rest in June, with a key meeting between China’s President Xi Jinping and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump to watch out for.
Any indication of how China’s economy is coping will also be crucial. The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for May dropped to 49.4, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, worse than the 49.9 forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
“Short-term noises can still overwhelm even the staunchest long-term investors – especially in a market where fund managers are measured and ranked daily,” Bocom International Holdings Co. strategist Hao Hong wrote in a note Thursday.
While May is rarely a good month for onshore equities, this one has been its worst since 2011. After passing the bull-market threshold in February, the index is down 11% from last month’s peak. A small consolation: traders in Hong Kong actually fared worse this month, and those in the U.S. didn’t do too well either.
The uncertainties have turned the market quiet: average daily turnover on mainland exchanges sank for a seventh week last week, the longest stretch of declines since at least 2010, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Volume was just 452 billion yuan ($65 billion) on Thursday, about 38% of the amount traded during this year’s busiest day in March.
Investors in China are scaling back the amount of leverage in the stock market, a sign that risk appetite and buying momentum are deteriorating. They’ve cut margin debt by 63.5 billion yuan from an April high, according to China Securities Finance Corp. data as of Tuesday. Leverage has been a key indicator of sentiment after it fueled China’s boom-and-bust cycle in 2015.
Investors based overseas, who have previously timed their exit successfully, keep dumping yuan-denominated stocks as the currency weakens. They’ve sold a net 53.1 billion yuan of the shares via exchange links with Hong Kong this month, beating April’s record almost three times over. Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. -- one of the tech firms targeted by the U.S. for potential blacklisting -- is among the most sold.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 08:23PM ET</span>","FedEx aims to boost service, profit more from online shopping","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said on Thursday it will begin offering Sunday residential delivery and handoff fewer e-commerce packages to the U.S. Postal Service, as it works to bolster service and wring more profits out of the online shopping boom.
FedEx said it will offer year-round, seven-day U.S. ground delivery starting in January 2020. It now offers Sunday home delivery in the United States only during the peak holiday season.
Memphis-based FedEx and rivals ranging from  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are seeking to reduce the cost of delivering packages the so-called ""last mile"" to online shoppers' doorsteps by increasing the number of packages they drop of at each stop. 
""We're going to be the premium, low-cost delivery provider"" for the last mile, said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx's president and chief operating officer. 
FedEx aims to do that by shifting the delivery of nearly 2 million FedEx SmartPost packages from U.S. Post Office (USPS) mail carriers to the service providers who handle FedEx Ground residential package deliveries.
FedEx since 2016 has used technology that allows it to put a FedEx SmartPost package into the FedEx Ground network when another package is destined for the same or nearby address.
It is accelerating that matching effort and expects the vast majority of FedEx SmartPost package volume to be integrated into FedEx Ground operations for final delivery by the end of 2020. 
""We believe this makes sense for (FedEx) as costs at the USPS are rising and FedEx continues to focus on improving margins and efficiency in its networks,"" Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker wrote in a client note.

Shares in FedEx closed down 1% at $158.01 on Thursday.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 08:20PM ET</span>",Major Hollywood studios may reconsider Georgia business over abortion law,"By Kenneth Li and Lisa Richwine
(Reuters) - The producer of the hit television series ""The Walking Dead"" and other major Hollywood film and TV studios said on Thursday they would reconsider locating productions in Georgia if a new state law restricting abortions takes effect.
WarnerMedia, CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS), Viacom Inc, NBCUniversal and ""Walking Dead"" producer AMC Networks Inc weighed in a day after Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's chief executive, Bob Iger, told Reuters that many people will not want to work in Georgia if the law is implemented, making it ""very difficult"" for the company to film there. 
The state law would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, at about six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law is due to take effect on Jan. 1, if it survives court challenges.
A Georgia tax credit has made the state a major hub for Hollywood productions, luring blockbuster movies such as Disney's ""Black Panther"" and ""Avengers: Endgame,"" and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) series such as ""Stranger Things."" The state currently employs more than 92,000 people in the entertainment business, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.
The long-running zombie hit ""The Walking Dead"" has made the town of Senoia, Georgia, a tourist destination for fans.
CBS, owner of cable channel Showtime and the most-watched broadcast network in the United States, said the ability to attract talent was an ""important consideration"" and noted that ""creative voices across our industry have expressed concern"" about the Georgia law.
It is not the first time that Hollywood studios and other deep-pocketed organizations have opposed a state measure.
A North Carolina law passed in 2016 that restricted bathroom use by transgender people sparked a major business boycott. The state repealed the law in 2017 after the boycott cost its economy hundreds of millions of dollars and saw the National Collegiate Athletic Association pull championship games and the National Basketball Association its All-Star Game from the state.
Georgia is one of nine U.S. states that have passed strict limits on abortion this year, moves that activists on both sides of the debate have said were aimed at prompting the U.S. Supreme Court to review and strike down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy.
Louisiana Governor John Edwards signed his state's new abortion bill on Thursday, a spokeswoman said.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBCUniversal unit said that while it expects many of the laws will face court challenges, ""If any of these laws are upheld, it would strongly impact our decision making on where we produce our content in the future.""
AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's WarnerMedia, which owns HBO and the Warner Bros movie studio, made similar statements, as did the other media companies.
""This is likely to be a long and complicated fight and we are watching it all very closely,"" AMC Networks said.
Abortion is one of the most socially divisive issues in U.S. politics, with opponents often citing religious beliefs to call it immoral, while abortion-rights advocates say the bans amount to state control of women's bodies.

Netflix has gone farther than other media companies, saying on Tuesday it would work with the ACLU and others to fight the abortion law in court. Like the other companies, it is continuing productions in Georgia in the meantime, but said it will ""rethink"" its investment in the state if abortion law takes effect.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said that technology would be used to improve the efficiency of flight paths and speeds, and the changes could see planes reduce the fuel they burn by the equivalent of 400,000 fewer flights a year.
""We need to keep our infrastructure in the sky up to date to keep people moving,"" said Aviation Minister Charlotte Vere. ""It hasn't fundamentally changed since the 1950s and, without action, one in three flights could face delays of half an hour or more by 2030.""
""It is a complex and pressing task, but it will make flying cleaner, quieter and quicker as we make our aviation sector one of the greenest in the world,"" she added in a statement.
The DfT said that the modernization of Britain's airspace would help cut circular queues in the sky above busy airports as aircraft wait to land, known as stacking, helping to reduce carbon and noise.
Last month, activist group Extinction Rebellion disrupted London and have called for people to fly less. Travel firms like Thomas Cook have cited high-profile environmental campaigns as one factor reducing the demand to fly this year.
Intense competition between airlines has also created overcapacity, another factor putting pressure on the sector. 
The DfT said that Friday could mark the busiest ever day for Britain's airspace, with over 9,000 flights, as soccer fans travel to Madrid for an all-English Champions League final between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 07:01PM ET</span>","Uber loses $1 billion in quarter as costs grow for drivers, food delivery","By Alexandria Sage and Arjun Panchadar
SAN FRANCISCO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc reported a $1 billion loss on Thursday as the ride-hailing service spends heavily to build up its food delivery and freight businesses, sending revenues up 20% in its first quarterly report as a public company.
Revenue of $3.1 billion matched the high end of the range Uber forecast for the quarter and the loss of $1.0 billion compared with the company's forecast of $1.0 billion to $1.11 billion. 
Shares rose 2.6% following a conference call with executives in which Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi cited business improvements, such as fewer consumer promotions in the second quarter, but called 2019 an ""investment year.""
With its share price trading more than 10% below its IPO price of $45, Khosrowshahi will have to convince investors Uber can turn a profit, given its reliance on rider incentives and competition in all parts of its business, from its core business of ride hailing to food delivery to freight.
""Our story is simple. We're the global player,"" Khosrowshahi told analysts on his first earnings call after the company's IPO earlier this month. ""Our job is to grow fast at scale and more efficiently for a long, long time."" 
The results indicate the newly public company was able to hit its own financial targets, likely to offer some assurance to investors. 
Costs went up 35% in the quarter, as the company spent heavily in the run-up to its IPO earlier this month. Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 34% from a year ago to $14.6 billion. Bookings were up 3.4% from the previous quarter, showing the difficulty of recruiting new riders in saturated markets. 
But Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said he was encouraged by improvements in take rates, and accelerating revenue growth. Uber's take rate is the revenue pocketed by the company after subtracting driver or restaurant pay and incentives.
""We're still a while away from profitability, but Uber is expecting strong signs of improvement across many of its key metrics and that is an important sign for investors.""
Uber was the biggest of a group of Silicon Valley startups that have gone public this year against the backdrop of a global stock market sell-off sparked by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China. Uber also faces increased regulation in several countries and fights with its drivers over wages.
In the mature U.S. market, where Uber's main rival is  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), Khosrowshahi said two levers for growth were the expansion of rides into suburbs and a generational wave, in which millennials show little interest in car ownership.
Executives said signals from Lyft during its recent earnings call that its rival was focused less on price and more on brand and product was a positive. Khosrowshahi called it a ""healthier mode of competing than just throwing money at a challenge."" 
Overall, incentives paid to drivers more than doubled from a year earlier, outpacing revenue growth, as the company invested in its growing food delivery service, Uber Eats. In that unit, driver incentives tripled to $291 million while revenue rose 89 percent. 
Uber was ""very early in the stages"" of exploiting how ride-hailing can help its Eats business, where take rates would improve over 2019, he said. 
The company had begun to ""upsell"" riders to Eats deals, with encouraging early signs, Khosrowshahi said. 
Uber said its monthly active users rose to 93 million globally, from 91 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
A net loss was $1.01 billion, or $2.26 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 compared with net income of $3.75 billion, or $1.84 per share, a year earlier, when results were helped by its sale of operations to Grab and Yandex. 
In its fourth quarter, Uber's net loss was $887 million and revenue was $2.97 billion.

Uber previously said it expected first-quarter revenue in the range of $3.04 billion to $3.1 billion while seven analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES on average expected revenue of $3.04 billion.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 07:00PM ET</span>",Gap cuts profit forecast after 'extremely challenging' quarter; shares slump 11%,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) cut its 2019 profit forecast and posted the biggest drop in same-store sales in at least three years at its Gap brand, underscoring its struggles to compete with fast-fashion retailers in the face of changing customer preferences.
Shares of the company, once a trendsetter with its casual logo emblazoned hoodies and khaki cargos, fell 11% in after-hours trading on Thursday.
Chief Executive Officer Art Peck called the quarter ""extremely challenging"" and cited unusually cold weather in February, late spring breaks, a delayed Easter and lower tax refunds as reasons for the dour performance.
Unseasonably cold weather has been a drag for most U.S. apparel retailers in the first few months of 2019, with Gap Inc's Old Navy especially hit as most of its apparel is tailored toward warmer weather.
However, analysts were unconvinced and felt the absence of in-fashion products was weighing on Gap brand's turnaround efforts.
""Every quarter management claims that products are improving and that the (Gap brand) is responding to changing consumer demand,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. ""And yet every season, Gap churns out the same bland range of undifferentiated product which has barely changed over the past 20 years."" 
On a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll acknowledged the lack of strong products at both Old Navy and Gap in the first quarter and said the company had held back on marketing until designs and assortments improved.
Sales at established Gap brand stores fell 10% in the three months ended May 4, steeper than the 4% decline analysts had estimated.
Peck replaced Gap brand's head last year and hired a new marketing chief, in efforts to turn around the unit with more appealing products, shorter response times in bringing designs from sketchpad to stores and better advertising.
But those efforts are yet to succeed. Quarterly same-store sales at the brand have risen only once since the start of 2016, according to Refinitiv data.
Adding to the worries, Old Navy, a bright spot for the company in recent years and which is being separated as a publicly listed company, reported a surprise drop in same-store sales. 
Peck said he remained confident in Gap's plan to separate into two independently companies in 2020 and had hired a dedicated team to manage the separation.
Overall same-store sales fell 4%, bigger than the 1.2% drop analysts had expected.
The San Francisco-based company cut its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast to $2.05 to $2.15 per share, from a previous range of $2.40 to $2.55.

(Reuters) - The maker of Kona beer agreed to offer partial refunds to settle a lawsuit claiming it misled consumers in the continental United States into believing the craft brew was actually made in Hawaii, causing them to overpay.
Settlement papers were filed last week with the federal court in San Francisco, and require a judge's approval.
Craft Brew Alliance Inc, which makes Kona, said on Thursday it has taken a $4.7 million pretax charge for the expected overall cost.
The Portland, Oregon-based company was accused of deception for putting hula dancers, surfers, the Kilauea volcano and other Hawaiian images on beers with such names as Big Wave Golden Ale, Fire Rock Pale Ale and Longboard Island Lager.
Beer drinkers claimed they were confused despite disclaimers that Kona was brewed in New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington state. Kona draft beer sold in Hawaii was brewed there, they added.
The settlement offers refunds of $1.25 to $2.75 for purchasers since Feb. 28, 2013 of four-, six-, 12- and 24-packs of Kona, with maximums per household of $20 with receipts and $10 without receipts.
Lawyers for the consumers plan to seek up to $2.9 million to cover legal fees and costs, court papers show.
Craft Brew Alliance also owns the Redhook and Widmer Brothers brands, and is nearly one-third owned by an affiliate of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, according to Refinitiv.
In 2015, Anheuser won U.S. court approval for a roughly $20 million settlement of claims it tricked consumers into thinking its St. Louis-brewed Beck's beer was actually a German pilsner.
The case is Broomfield et al v Craft Brew Alliance Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-01027.

(Reuters) - Investors rattled by U.S.-China trade tensions pulled roughly $22 billion from U.S.-based equity funds in the week ended May 29, according to data released by Refinitiv's Lipper research service on Thursday.
U.S.-based investment-grade bond funds, which move in sympathy with equities, posted more than $5 billion of outflows in the week ended Wednesday, the largest weekly outflow since December 2015, according to Lipper.
At the lower end of the quality spectrum, U.S.-based high-yield junk bond funds posted $1.27 billion of cash withdrawals in the week ended Wednesday, Lipper added. 
Investors sought shelter in their favorite safe havens in the latest week. 
U.S.-based money-market funds attracted more than $17.5 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their sixth straight week of inflows, according to Lipper. 
U.S.-based government-Treasury funds attracted over $1.4 billion in the week ended Wednesday, their third consecutive week of inflows, Lipper figures show.
Overall, U.S.-based taxable bond funds posted $5.1 billion of outflows in the week ended Wednesday, according to Lipper.
""Outflows for both equities and bonds were influenced by two significant liquidations during the week,"" said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper. 
He said the Fidelity Total Market Index Fund, class F, accounted for $17.1 billion of the net equity outflows for the week, while Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund, class F, accounted for $6.5 billion of the fixed income net redemptions. 
""So if one removes those from the picture, it was a fairly tame week, with the risk-off trade really being the net flows into money market funds,"" Roseen said. 
""That said, we did see authorized participants being net redeemers of equity ETFs to the tune of $3.2 billion, which is their third weekly redemption in four, while being net purchasers of fixed income ETFs for the third consecutive week, this week injecting $1.1 billion.""

1372,By Investing.com,"<span>May 30, 2019 05:20PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Uber Meets Its Own Targets
Uber (NYSE:UBER) shares could be active tomorrow following the company’s first earnings report as a public company.
Uber reported revenue of $3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, just a tad higher than the $3.09 billion expected according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com. It reported a net loss of $1.01 billion, near the high end of its guidance, or $2.26 per share.
Uber rose more than 3% in after-hours trading.
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) fell nearly 1% postmarket, despite reporting results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
2. Personal Spending, Income Seen Rising
Economic indicators kick off with the most recent numbers on personal income and spending before the bell tomorrow.
The Commerce Department will report the April spending and income numbers at 8:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Personal spending is forecast to have risen 0.2% last month, with personal income up 0.3%, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, core personal consumption expenditures, which exclude food and energy, is expected to post a 0.2% rise for the month, but remain at an annual rate of 1.6%.
At 9:45 AM ET, the Chicago purchasing managers index (PMI) for May comes out, with economists looking for the measure of Midwest manufacturing activity to tick up to 55.1.
And at 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan releases its revised consumer sentiment index for May. The index is seen edging down slightly from the preliminary measure to 102.
3. Oil Rig Count on Tap
Oil prices sank 4% today as the lower-than-expected drawdown of crude inventories added to the bearish outlook caused by the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
Traders will get some more insight on how U.S. production is going when Baker Hughes issues its active oil rig count at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
Last week the rig count dipped below 800 to 797, but the EIA said today U.S. crude production output bounced back up to record highs of 12.3 million barrels per day."
1373,By Investing.com,"<span>May 30, 2019 05:19PM ET</span>",Costco Shares Dip Despite Earnings Beat,"Investing.com - Shares of Costco Wholesale were off slightly in after-hours trading, even as the company's fiscal third-quarter results beat estimates.
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) shares at first moved lower in postmarket trading, then recovered to flat and dipped a second time to a 0.8% decline. They were up 0.35% ahead of the earnings report. There were several explanations for the decline.
Comparable-store sales were up 5.5% overall before accounting for currency effects and changing prices for gasoline. With those adjustments, comparable sales were up 5.6%. But, said Barron's, Wall Street was looking for a 5.62% gain before exchange-rate adjustments. There was also some disappointment that revenue from membership renewals (up 5.3% to $776 million) missed estimates, according to Seeking Alpha.
Costco reported an adjusted $1.89 a share profit in the quarter, ahead of the estimate of $1.82 a share from analysts polled by Investing.com. The earnings were net of a $73 million tax benefit in the quarter that boosted earnings per share by 16 cents. Revenue was $34.74 billion, up 7.35% from a year ago. Analysts had expected $34.65 billion.
Costco's stock has been an elite performer among retailers this year. With today's close, Costco is up 18.6% year to date after a 9.5% gain in 2018. The performance is better than Walmart (NYSE:WMT), up more than 9%, and Macy's (NYSE:M), down around 22%."
1374,By Investing.com,"<span>May 30, 2019 04:45PM ET</span>","Uber Posts $1 Billion Net Loss, in Line With Guidance","Investing.com - Uber (NYSE:UBER) reported a first-quarter loss and revenue in line with its previous guidance after the bell Thursday.
In its first earnings report since going public, the ride-sharing company reported revenue of $3.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, just a tad higher than the $3.09 billion expected according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
It reported a net loss of $1.01 billion, near the high end of its guidance, or $2.26 per share. It said its adjusted loss was $869 million, but did not provide a per-share figure.
In after-market trading, shares were up more than 1% at 4.48 p.m. ET (20:49 GMT).
Gross bookings rose 34% from the year-ago period to $14.65 billion, ahead of its guidance of $14.5 billion. Bookings were up 3.4% from the previous quarter, showing the difficulty of recruiting new riders in saturated markets.
Monthly active platform consumers rose to 93 million, right in line with the company’s forecast.
With its share price trading more than 10% below its IPO price of $45, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi will have to convince investors Uber can turn a profit, given its reliance on rider incentives and competition in all parts of its business, from ride hailing to food delivery to freight.
The results indicate the newly public company was able to hit its own financial targets, likely to offer some assurance to investors.
Costs went up 35% in the quarter, as the company spent heavily in the run-up to its IPO earlier this month.
""Seems largely uneventful,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said. ""The lack of Q2 or (fiscal year) guidance is a little disappointing – will be interesting to see if there is any forward commentary on the call.""

The S&P 500 rose 0.21%. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.27% and the Dow rose 0.17%.
With just a day to go until month end, stocks swung between gains and losses as traders continued to digest the latest headlines on trade amid increasing expectations for a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. 
""We oppose a trade war but are not afraid of a trade war,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanhui said Thursday in Beijing when asked about the tensions with the United States. ""This kind of deliberately provoking trade disputes is naked economic terrorism, economic chauvinism, economic bullying.""
Energy stocks, which have been under pressure from escalating trade tensions, fell more than 1% as oil prices slumped following a smaller-than-expected draw in domestic crude stockpiles.
But there were some corners of the market that offered hope, with consumer discretionaries climbing, led by a rally in retailers, including Dollar General and Dollar Tree.
Discount retailer Dollar General (NYSE:DG) surged 7% on the back of first-quarter results that crushed estimates from Investing.com on both the top and bottom lines. Dollar General's same-store sales of 3.8% also topped expectations for a 2.9% rise.
Dollar Tree's (NASDAQ:DLTR) better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and same-store sales sent its share more than 3% higher, helping the retail sector pare some of its losses from a day earlier.
In financials, banking stocks fell as Treasury yields continued to stutter amid mixed economic data. Expectations for a decline in trading revenues also hurt banks.
Bank of America indicated trading revenue would likely be 10% lower for the quarter, while Citigroup also warned of declining revenue.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) closed lower.
In other company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 0.9% after Barclays cut its price target on the electric automaker's stock, warning that the company is ""stalling as a niche automaker.""
On the economic front, a second reading of U.S. GDP showed the economy expanded by 3.1% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, a downward revision from 3.2% estimates previously, but in line with expectations.
Following the malaise in May, in which stocks have lost about 5%, Morgan Stanley warned that markets are likely entering a slow growth cycle, suggesting equities have room to slide.

The company also swung to a profit, reporting net income attributable of $293 million, compared with a loss of $636 million a year earlier.
Dell, one of the top players in the PC market, returned to public markets on Dec. 28 after it bought back interest tied to the performance of software maker VMware, and shares have surged nearly 50% since then.
Client Solutions Group, which consists of Dell's desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, as well as its branded peripherals business, reported a 6% rise in revenue to $10.91 billion. 
Analysts had expected the segment to report revenue of $10.58 billion, according to FactSet.
Revenue from commercial customers rose 13% and contributed $8.31 billion to the Client Solutions Group, boosted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's decision to end support for its Windows 7 operating system early 2020.
Separately, Dell's unit VMware reported a 13% jump in revenue to $2.28 billion.
Dell's total net revenue rose 2.6% to $21.91 billion in the three months ended May 3. On an adjusted basis, Dell reported revenue of $21.99 billion.
Analysts on average expected the company to report revenue of $22.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On a per share basis, the company earned 38 cents in the quarter. Excluding certain items, earnings were $1.45 per share.
Dell did not report earnings per share for fiscal 2019 due to certain transactions.

Revenue in its Infrastructure Solutions Group fell 5% to $8.20 billion, largely due to a 9% drop in the server and networking side of the business.

In a letter addressed to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, the senators said a commodity purchasing program that was part of a $12 billion aid package last year included contracts with Smithfield Foods, a subsidiary of China's WH Group, and JBS USA, owned by Brazil's JBS SA.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a new $16 billion farm aid package last week, including $1.4 billion in food purchases.
The letter, signed by 2020 presidential hopefuls Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand and dated Wednesday, underscores the political sensitivity of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a top buyer of U.S. agricultural products like soybeans and pork. 
The USDA terminated a $240,000 purchase contract with Smithfield Foods at the company's request last year after the agreement was criticized as subsidizing a competitor.
The senators said, however, that the government had awarded to JBS USA nearly $62.5 million in contracts to buy pork products. 
""The Department awarded numerous contracts to JBS and has not established sufficient procedures to ensure that taxpayer-funded trade assistance for American farmers is not ultimately benefiting foreign companies,"" the letter said.
The senators said ""subsidizing our competitors through trade assistance"" was ""unacceptable."" 
Perdue said payments to JBS were not a concern in a recent interview and that only U.S. produced agricultural products would be purchased. 
""These are legal companies operating in the United States,"" Perdue said in a statement provided by USDA. 
JBS SA has bounced back from corruption scandals in Brazil involving its former chairman and chief executive, who admitted to bribing scores of Brazilian politicians. The company saw its first-quarter profit soar 116 percent from a year earlier.
JBS USA said in a statement it was a U.S.-based company that employs more than 63,000 U.S. workers. U.S. farmers are the true beneficiaries of the program, the company said. 

""Our sole intent for participating was to support U.S. producer prices and help our American producer partners,"" JBS USA said. ""It was not a bailout.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks lost ground again on Thursday, as conflicting comments on trade talks from President Donald Trump and Beijing reinforced investor nervousness that a lengthy battle could be in the offing and harm global growth. 
Trump said talks with China were going well but those comments were countered by a senior Chinese diplomat who said provoking trade disputes is ""naked economic terrorism."" [nL2N2360GR]
The lack of clarity around the trade battle has rattled investors of late, after the S&P 500 had risen more than 17% through the first four months of the year on optimism a trade deal between the two countries could be reached. 
That optimism has faded, however, as the escalating dispute between the two countries has weighed heavily on Wall Street in May, with each of the three main indexes declining at least 5% for the month. The benchmark S&P 500 is nearly 6% lower from its closing high on April 30. 
""The market is coming to that realization that we are not getting really clean or clear information and it is going to be a lot of noise and just prepare for that,"" said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at Even-star's in Newport Beach, California. 
""It is a difficult market right now. There are a lot of macro signals that are starting to roll over and the question is the trade dispute causing that or is it other factors."" 
A government report on Thursday showed U.S. inflation was much weaker than initially thought in the first quarter on a sharp slowdown in domestic demand, while growth was also slightly lower than estimated in April.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.59 points, or 0.11%, to 25,098.82, the S&P 500 lost 2.11 points, or 0.08%, to 2,780.91 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.19 points, or 0.12%, to 7,538.12.
The trade jitters helped sustain demand for safe haven debt, as U.S. Treasury yields held near 20-month lows. The yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes remained inverted, the inversion the widest in nearly 12 years. [nL2N23619I]
That, in turn, weighed on interest-rate sensitive bank stocks, which dropped 1.5% and were on track for a third straight day of declines, while the broader financial sector declined 0.8%.
The energy sector fell 1.3%, as oil prices continued their slump in part due to a smaller-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories. The sector has fallen more than 10% this month.
Among stocks,  Dollar General Corp  (NYSE:DG) jumped 7.2% after the discount retailer's same-store sales and profit topped expectations. 
Viacom's Inc climbed 3.6% after report that CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) is preparing for merger talks with the media company. CBS rose 2.5%. 
PVC Corp plunged 14.2% as the worst performer on the S&P 500, after the Calvin Klein owner cut its annual profit forecast as it grapples with tariffs and slowing retail growth. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 had 1 new 52-week high and 25 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite 25 new highs and 119 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's chief executive said on Thursday he was ""really stunned"" to learn that a major factory had only recently started using lean manufacturing techniques. 
""It put me back a little bit to go to our Greenville, South Carolina, plant last summer and to have the team regale me with a really good lean production (project) that had just been implemented,"" Larry Culp said at an investor conference in New York. 
""They did a very nice job. But just -- it really stunned me (to) be there in the summer of 2018 and have such an important plant at GE beginning its lean journey or re-beginning its lean journey.""
Lean techniques are widely used to reduce manufacturing costs while increasing efficiency and quality. GE's Greenville factory makes large, gas-fired turbines that generate electricity in power plants around the world. GE's power business has been losing money and is the top priority in Culp's efforts to turn around the company.
""No business consumes more of my time right now,"" Culp said.
Culp also affirmed on Thursday that GE expects negative free cash flow in the second quarter, and said GE's power division plans to cut costs by about 20% over the next two years as it tries to become leaner. 

Culp said GE cut $800 million in costs at the power unit last year, and has plans to cut another $1.6 billion.

The company has not made a final decision on the stores, which would only admit people aged 21 and above, the source added, asking not to be named as the matter is confidential.
Juul, along with other vaping device makers, has been under pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which laid out plans in March to clamp down on the use of e-cigarettes among teens.
The company, in which Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) has a 35% stake, has already pulled popular flavors such as mango and cucumber from retail store shelves and shut down its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Altria is not involved in the company's plans, the source said. 
The company plans to only sell tobacco, mint and menthol flavors in its stores. The first store would open in Texas, if the company were to go through with its plan, the source said, adding that Juul is eyeing cities with high smoking rates.
Juul, whose e-cigarettes resemble USB flash drives and work by vaporizing a nicotine-laced liquid, is also exploring opening stores in overseas markets including one in South Korea, according to the source.

(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp are considering divesting wireless spectrum, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as the companies work to gain regulatory approval for their merger.
The $26-billion deal won support from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last week, but still needs approval from the U.S. Department of Justice, which is looking at the merger on antitrust grounds.
It was not immediately clear what the sale process would be for the spectrum, or airwaves that carry data. Bloomberg reported earlier on Thursday that T-Mobile and Sprint were considering divesting spectrum back to the government, which would then sell it to help establish a fourth carrier, citing sources.
The two carriers had previously offered concessions to get the merger approved, which includes selling prepaid brand Boost Mobile, in order to reduce the combined company's market share in the prepaid wireless business.

But some analysts and consumer advocates have raised concerns that wireless prices could rise if the merger is approved, which would leave the U.S. with three carriers from four.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 02:25PM ET</span>","Brazil government, Petrobras lobby ahead of key privatization court ruling","By Ricardo Brito
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras and sectors of the government are mobilizing in the lead-up to a Supreme Court session next week that could have a profound effect on privatizations in the country.
In recent days, lawyers for Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as well as Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy and the federal solicitor-general's office, known as the AGU, have been lobbying the top court to overturn injunctions suspending divestitures by Petrobras, according to several sources with knowledge of the matter.
Brazil's Supreme Court, the STF, was initially scheduled to rule at 2 p.m. Brasilia time (1700 GMT) on whether the sale of state-run companies and their subsidiaries needs the approval of Congress and whether they need to be sold in an auction format.
However, at the beginning of the hearing, STF President Dias Toffoli delayed a ruling until Wednesday next week, saying the court would dedicate the Thursday session to testimony from interested parties.
Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras turned negative after the STF delayed its decision, and were down 0.5% in afternoon trade.
The hearing follows a decision by a single justice on Tuesday to suspend the $8.6 billion sale of Petrobras' TAG pipeline unit to France's Engie SA, and stems ultimately from a similar decision made by a different judge last year.
A ruling upholding the injunctions would be a blow to Petrobras, which is counting on asset sales to reduce its hefty net debt load of roughly 372 billion reais ($93 billion). Among the asset divestitures that would likely be affected by the ruling is the sale of eight refineries that the company has said could fetch some $15 billion.
Privatizations are also a major pillar of President Jair Bolsonaro's economic program. His economy minister, Paulo Guedes, has said privatizations could bring 1 trillion reais into public coffers.
As part of the government's full court press, the AGU has sent a memorandum to STF justices defending the sale of assets without congressional approval, according to the sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media.

1386,By Investing.com,"<span>May 30, 2019 02:04PM ET</span>",First Canadian Outdoor Cannabis Growing Operation Gets Going,"Investing.com - The first licensed outdoor cannabis growing operation in Canada, which is estimated to be the biggest in the world, is preparing to go into operation this week in southern Ontario.
After receiving final approval from Health Canada earlier this month, the 100-acre cultivation site in Brant, near Hamilton, operated by  48North Cannabis  (TSXV:NRTH) is expected to produce about 40,000 kilograms of dried cannabis. 48North, which is headquartered in Toronto, also has two indoor growing facilities, one in Kirkland Lake, Ont. and another in Brantford, Ont.
The company’s outdoor facility, known as Good Farm, will allow it to produce cannabis at the lowest cost per gram in the country.
“Receiving the outdoor cultivation licence from Health Canada for our Good Farm is an absolute game-changer for 48North and the cannabis industry,” said co-CEO Jeannette VanderMarel in a statement. “Overnight, the company expands its annual expected capacity from 5,000 kilograms to over 45,000 kilograms. As a result, I am confident that 48North will deliver on its promise to produce high-quality, low-cost organic cannabis for the next-generation of cannabis products and the dried flower market.”
The outdoor facility will not only drive down the cost of growing the plants compared to indoor growing facilities, it allows for the production of larger and taller crops, increasing the yield from each plant.
“They call it weed for a reason,” VanderMarel put it in a television interview.
The growing area will be tightly secured. Surrounded by fencing, the fields will also be equipped with motion sensors and about 100 cameras.
With its expanding operation now going into production, 48North will be looking to fulfill the commitment it has made after signing three recent agreements, including a contract to supply 1,200 kilograms dried cannabis from its fields to the Société québécois du cannabis, the exclusive government controlled distributor in Quebec; an agreement to supply 2,460 kilograms to the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Corp, the official crown corporation wholesaler in that province; and 6,000 kilograms to Humble + Fume, a leading distributor of cannabis accessories in Canada.
Shares of 48North spiked to an all-time high earlier this month on news of the approval of the outdoor growing licence, jumping to C$1.25, a 24% jump, but later dropped in the following two weeks. Today, they were trading at C$1.01, flat on the day and 2 cents above the value before the announcement of the company securing its outdoor-growing licence.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deposit growth at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, is slowing as customers withdraw some of their money and stash it with competing banks that pay higher interest rates, a bank executive said Thursday.
Most big U.S. banks have been slow to raise the interest rates they pay customers on their savings and deposits, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve setting current rates at between 2.25% and 2.5%. 
This has left an opening for some smaller and online-only banks that are trying to capitalize on customer frustration by offering savings accounts and other products that pay between 2% and 2.45% interest.
Gordon Smith, co-president and chief operating officer for JPMorgan Chase, said that though customers are taking out money, and this is contributing to slowing in the bank's deposit growth, most of those customers still keep Chase as their main bank.
""People are taking a component of their deposits. They're parking those deposits with a high-yield competitor, whomever they may be,"" said Smith, also head of JPMorgan's consumer and community banking.
""That money is very liquid,"" said Smith. ""It'll then move from that high-yield competitor to another ... but that high-yield competitor is not winning the primary bank relationship, which is obviously what's critical.""

Smith said the bank constantly reviews its deposit pricing and that interest rates are only part of what customers want from the bank.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 11:49AM ET</span>",Staley defies Bramson in Barclays' Asian investment bank revival,"By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is plotting a revival of its Asian investment bank, defying activist Edward Bramson just weeks after he failed to convince fellow shareholders to back radical cuts to the British bank's trading arm.
Chief Executive Jes Staley wants to make Barclays Europe's premier investment bank and then take on its global rivals by building up beyond its core European and U.S. markets.
""Our commitment to the capital markets platform has meant we may be pulling away from the pack of European competitors now,"" the 62-year-old American-born banker told Reuters. 
""Today we see our peers and principal competition as being the U.S. banks – and we can, and do, compete with them,"" Staley says of the business he hopes will be his greatest legacy. 
Staley and his executive committee (ExCo) want to regrow Barclays' Asian markets business with dozens of hires in the next two to three years, expanding its global banking business there and reversing a 2016 regional retrenchment.
As Europe's economic fortunes wane and competition in the U.S. tightens, selective expansion in Asia might be Barclays' best shot at increasing market share. 
""If you want to be relevant to global clients, you have to be in Asia,"" Stephen Dainton, head of global markets at Barclays, told Reuters.
Staley has been ruthless in his mission to preserve and promote the Barclays corporate and investment bank (CIB) since Bramson appeared on its shareholder register two years ago, moving closer to the day-to-day operation of its business after ousting investment bank boss Tim Throsby in March.
""That clear and unequivocal backing from the top really matters to colleagues in the CIB and I'm glad to give it,"" said Staley, who has also driven fresh forays into higher-risk, higher-reward businesses including leveraged finance and global securitization. . 
'BIGGER WAY'
Staley's direct approach is translating into investment in technology and new hires, Barclays executives said.
Barclays' head of global banking Joe McGrath says his business could hire up to 200 staff in the next two to three years, although this could be fewer if deal flow is slower and the plan depends on improving profitability in the UK and U.S.
""I want to invest in Asia and we will invest in the near term on a very measured basis but at some point, we'll need to take a harder look at what we want to do in a bigger way,"" McGrath told Reuters, adding that growth markets like China and Southeast Asia will offer investment banking opportunities.
The move to expand the global footprint of the Barclays investment bank is gutsy in view of its recent underperformance.
First quarter returns in the investment banking business fell to 9.5% from 13.2% a year ago, leaving group targets for 9% returns on tangible equity close but unachieved.
Investors also want to see Staley's talk of progress better reflected in its share price, which has fallen 30 percent since he took the top job in December 2015.
Despite this slump, Barclays has been the second-best performer among European investment banks since Staley's arrival. 
""We've still got a way to go to get to the returns we should be generating, and I want to more directly support that effort,"" Staley said of the demands ahead.
Barclays wants to grow its Asian headcount in the markets business by 10-11%, or around 60 people, over the next two to three years, Dainton said, adding that in the medium term Asia could deliver between 15-20% of the group's total revenues, up from 10% now.
But it is sidestepping the Asia cash equities business it closed in 2016 and hiring in other trading businesses that play more to Barclays' traditional strengths. 
These include emerging markets-focused business in Singapore, its Hong Kong-based credit trading desk, foreign exchange, and electronic trading capabilities.
""It's critically important for us that we have good connectivity across the three financial centers, Europe, U.S. and Asia,"" Kristen Macleod, managing director of Barclays' forex sales business in New York, said.
""The markets business has outperformed our U.S. peers for six consecutive quarters …. we are one of the few banks on the street right now that are investing and growing this business.""
'MISSION CRITICAL'
Insiders say they like Staley's hands-to-the-pump attitude, sharing anecdotes of him pitching clients and jumping on aeroplanes to seal deals and poach talent from other banks. 
But as demands of the investment bank grow, Staley is relying on the likes of McGrath, Dainton and his inner circle to quell calls he might be neglecting other parts of the bank.
Although fallout from last month's shake-up in the investment bank's pay structure, tying bonus payouts to profits generated in a given time period, could tarnish Barclays' year, Staley's lieutenants are in no doubt what they have to do.
""The overarching theme in these ExCo meetings is that it is mission critical we drive results and generate returns for our shareholders, sooner rather than later,"" Macleod said.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 10:54AM ET</span>",Nissan's technology could pay in Renault-FCA deal: sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Naomi Tajitsu
BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan's advanced technologies including platforms and electric powertrains could give it leverage in a merger involving  Renault  and Fiat Chrysler, thanks to a royalty system it has with the former, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
A merged Renault-Fiat Chrysler could face an extra hurdle each time it uses technology developed by Nissan Motor Co or Mitsubishi Motors Corp, while the two Japanese automakers stand to gain a client in Fiat Chrysler (FCA), one of the people said. 
Both sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Nissan's technology, particularly in electrification and emissions reduction, could give it some sway in the $35 billion potential tie-up between Renault and FCA, even as its stake in the newly formed company would be diluted.
Currently Renault SA (PA:RENA) pays less for technology developed by Nissan than the Japanese automaker pays for French technology, a third person said. 
This has long been a sticking point for Nissan, and an area where Nissan could seek more favorable terms.
""Whenever Nissan transfers platform, powertrain or other technology to Renault, there is a margin or royalty which Renault has to pay for use of that tech,"" one of the people said. 
""In that sense, FCA, if everything went well, would become another 'client' of ours and that's good. More business for us.""
    A Nissan spokesman declined to comment on its royalty system.
The potential Renault-FCA deal has complicated the Japanese automaker's already uneasy alliance with Renault. A further deal with Fiat Chrysler looks likely at least in the near term to weaken Nissan's influence in the 20-year-old partnership.
Renault owns a 43.4% stake in Nissan and is its top shareholder. Nissan holds a 15% non-voting stake in Renault and would see that diluted to 7.5% after the FCA deal, albeit with voting rights. The imbalance between the two has long rankled Nissan, which is by far the larger company. 
ALLIANCE IMBALANCE
Renault had previously angled for a merger with Nissan but has been rebuffed by CEO Hiroto Saikawa. 
Securing benefits from the merger deal will be important for Saikawa, who is grappling with poor financial performance while he struggles to right the company after the ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn last year.
By joining forces, Renault and FCA hope to consolidate what would have been two electric vehicle development programs into one, and then deploy the resulting technology across a much larger range of vehicles, reducing costs.
FCA, which foresees trouble in meeting with increasingly stringent emissions regulations in both Europe and China, would likely benefit significantly from Renault powertrain technologies.
Much of these technologies have been beefed up by R&D led by Nissan, the first automaker to launch a mass-market all-battery electric vehicle (EV).
The Nissan Leaf is the world’s top-selling EV, with sales of more than 400,000 since its launch in 2010.
The company has also found unexpected success with its e-Power gasoline hybrid system. It could use its technology as a negotiating tool with Renault and FCA.
Technically, any deal between Renault and FCA would not involve any structural change in Renault's confidential partnership agreement with Nissan, the Restated Alliance Master Agreement, although FCA would join Renault as a counterparty to the pact.
But Nissan does stand to benefit from a more balanced capital structure in the merger. 
As the combined Renault-FCA company would be domiciled in the Netherlands, the French government would lose its double shareholding permitted under France's Florange Law.
As a result, the French government would be left with a 7.5 percent voting stake in the new company, potentially easing a source of tension between Nissan and Paris, as the current arrangement effectively hands the government outsized influence over the Japanese automaker.
REGIONAL COMPETITORS 
There is also the issue of regional overlap. FCA and Nissan are rivals in the North American truck and SUV market, where Nissan has struggled with poor margins. 
""Nissan is struggling in the United States. Will pairing up with Chrysler help? Not really."" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama. He said Nissan could seek compromises in other areas if Renault-FCA were to seek consolidation in the region.
Southeast Asia, where the third member of the Renault-Nissan alliance - Mitsubishi Motors - dominates vehicle sales, could also be a area for potential horse-trading with Renault and FCA as they expand their presence in the fast-growing market. 
Here, Mitsubishi could negotiate hefty concessions in return for distribution in Indonesia, Thailand and other countries.
""Our main market is the ASEAN countries, so we would like to know how cooperation would look in this region,"" Mitsubishi Motors Chairman Osamu Masuko said on Wednesday.

""There are areas where making decisions may be difficult.""

1403,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 09:45AM ET</span>",Standard Bank shareholders vote down climate-risk resolution,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Standard Bank shareholders on Thursday voted down a resolution that would have required the South African lender to report climate risk in its activities, although they passed another forcing it to disclose its coal financing policies.
It was the first time a South African company had tabled a resolution on climate-related issues, according to shareholder group Just Share, which supported the motion.
But the bank, Africa's largest by assets and a major player in the oil and gas sector, advised investors not to back the proposal and just over 60% of shareholders voted against it at the lender's annual general meeting in Johannesburg.
Just Share executive director, Tracey Davies, said the motion had received far more support than expected.
""It's fair to say South African shareholders are pretty conservative and not very vocal on climate issues,"" she said. ""It shows there is a lot more awareness and understanding of climate risk in our investment industry than might be apparent from what's publicly available.""
A number of big institutional investors backed the proposal, she said, such as Old Mutual Investment Management. However, some of the lender's most significant shareholders, including its third-largest, fund manager Allan Gray, did not.
The resolution was put forward as climate activism increases. Recent high-profile protests from environmental groups have paralyzed parts of major cities like London, while a wave of school strikes saw children and teenagers accuse adults of failing to tackle the issues.
South Africa is one of Africa's worst polluters, home to a number of big, listed firms in carbon-intensive industries like mining. Like many of its peers on the continent, it is still reliant on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs.
Earlier this week it passed a long-delayed carbon tax law, but campaigners say it doesn't go far enough.
The resolution would not have required Standard Bank to change any of its policies, but the bank would have had to report on how its lending, financing and investment activities exposed it, and in turn its shareholders, to climate risks.
Shareholders did however pass a resolution, with 55% of the vote, to force Standard Bank to disclose its policies on coal financing.
While the lender has published some information on the parameters guiding its financing of coal projects, Davies said this did not amount to a comprehensive, board-approved policy and also did not cover its approach to coal mining.
A number of big international banks have released comprehensive information on their coal financing policies, but it is still unusual among South African lenders.

The Dow Jones gained 66 points, or 0.3%, to 25,192.39 points by 9:37 AM ET (13:37 GMT), while the S&P 500 rose 11 points, or 0.4%, 2,794.30 points and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 33 points, or 0.4%, at 7,579.12 points.
Escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have sent the S&P 500 lower in four of the previous five sessions and the global benchmark is on track for a monthly loss of more than 5%.
Investors remained focused on trade related developments after China’s Vice Foreign Minister said Thursday that provoking trade disputes amounted to “naked economic terrorism”.
It came a day after Chinese newspapers warned that Beijng could use rare earth exports to strike back at the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he was ""not yet ready"" to make a trade deal.
Little sign of an imminent end to the ongoing trade dispute convinced investors to remove money from riskier assets such as stocks and rotate to safe haven assets such as government debt. Concerns are that the negative impact from the continuing rift between the world’s two largest economies could exacerbate the current global slowdown, leading to recession.
Amid the flight to safety, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which trade inversely to prices, hit 2.210% overnight, their lowest since the middle of September 2017.
The yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes also remained inverted, a phenomenon often considered to be a leading indicator of a pending recession.
Yet economic data released Thursday remained solid. The updated data for U.S. gross domestic product met forecasts for a slight downward revision to 3.1%, still a healthy level of growth.
The labor market also remained strong with weekly jobless claims beating expectations.
Pending home sales, out at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), are forecast to have risen 0.9% in April.
Federal Reserve officials have maintained their stance that the current level of interest rates is appropriate, but markets have grown more skeptical in the face of that standoff between China and the U.S.
Fed fund futures now price in a 25-basis-point cut for September with an additional quarter-point decrease at the beginning of 2020.
Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida will have the opportunity to present his outlook when he speaks in New York on the topic of ""Sustaining Maximum Employment and Price Stability"" at 12:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT).
Outside of equities, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, advanced 0.1% at 98.14 by 9:39 AM ET (13:39 GMT), while the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged forward 2.3 basis points at 2.264%.
In commodities, gold futures fell $1.30, or 0.1%, to $1,279.70 a troy ounce, while crude oil gained 21 cents, or 0.4% at $59.02 a barrel."
1405,By Business Insider,"<span>May 30, 2019 09:32AM ET</span>","Corporate America is narrowly avoiding an earnings recession, but signs of weakness are lurking within the data","Public companies had a long list of worries in the first quarter.
The stock market was emerging from the severe  late 2018 sell-off that gave way to a shaky start to 2019. Trade tensions between the US and China were simmering (and relations have only  deteriorated since then). Signs of  slowing growth were cropping up  across the market at a late stage in the economic cycle. 
Amid the waves of uncertainty, Morgan Stanley strategists  told investors in February an earnings recession was imminent, defining that by two or more quarters of flat or negative growth. The consensus called for a 2.4% earnings-per-share decline,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in April. 
Now, with nearly all of S&P 500 companies' results in the books this week, the numbers have come in slightly better than expected.
A bottom-line downturn appears likely to be narrowly avoided with a first-quarter earnings gain of 1.5%, according to Bloomberg data. That's compared with a rise of about 0.5% for companies in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East, according to Credit Suisse.
So the headline numbers look OK. But a closer analysis reflects fragility under the surface as investors and companies alike grapple with  slowing global growth and the perpetual uncertainty of US-China trade negotiations. 
""While the approximate 1.5 percent year-over-year earnings growth for the first quarter is above expectations, it pales in comparison to the double-digit year-over-year growth rate experienced over the past two years,"" Terry Sandven, the chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, told Markets Insider.
Several measures of corporate earnings' health show significant weakness on a sector-by-sector basis. Here's a quick rundown of where things stand.
While the first quarter's earnings growth is the 11th straight quarterly year-on-year rise, that's a significant decline from the fourth quarter's 16.8% rise and the third quarter's 28.4% growth, according to a Yardeni Research report.
Meanwhile, the firm said just six of the S&P 500's 11 sectors have reported positive year-on-year earnings growth — with only one rising at a double-digit percentage rate. That compares with a respective 10 and seven sectors in the fourth quarter.
More granularly, real estate and utilities are the only sectors to have recorded stronger quarter-over-quarter growth.

And notably, earnings growth is trailing sales growth for the first time since the first half of 2016, a particularly  volatile period for the financial markets, according to Yardeni Research. 
S&P 500 sales have increased by 4.4% during the first quarter compared with the same period last year, with sales in the healthcare sector leading the pack, according to Oppenheimer.
That compares with profits growth of a tepid 1.5% the same time last year. 
And Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Michael Wilson, aren't backing off their call for an earnings recession.
""With 'Better than Feared' 1Q earnings now complete, our concerns about a 2H recovery remain,"" the strategists led by Wilson wrote in a Monday report.
When all is said and done, it looks like first-quarter earnings-per-share growth will have declined 43 basis points, according to Wilson. He continues to be broadly cautious about the stock market and has a year-end target of 2,750 on the S&P 500, just 0.8% below current levels.
""We continue to recommend a combination of defensive and reasonably priced quality stocks at this stage of the economic and volatility cycle,"" they wrote. ""However, we expect the winners to get narrower as volatility picks up.""
They think the next bout of volatility in the equity market will come from ""weaker growth and earnings misses from stocks that are not priced for it.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's state-run ""bad bank"" expects to post a surplus of at least 4 billion euros ($4.45 billion) over the next two years, up from an earlier estimate of 3.5 billion, thanks to a surge in demand for Irish real estate.
The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was seen as a major liability for Dublin's finances when it was established in 2009 during a crash that halved Irish property values.
NAMA used 32 billion euros of senior and junior debt to rid Ireland's nationalized banks of risky property loans with a face value of 74 billion euros, crystallizing state losses of more than 40 billion euros in the process.
Critics at the time said NAMA had overpaid and would make a loss, but the agency said on Thursday it now expects to provide a minimum surplus to the state of 2 billion euros in 2020 and at least 2 billion in 2021.
That forecast was up from a combined forecast of 3.5 billion euros a year ago and NAMA's chief executive Brendan McDonagh said the number could rise further. 
""If we get a couple of hundred million more, great. But I don’t see it being much more than that,"" he told journalists.  
Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said he planned to use the funds to pay down debt, a move he said would have a material effect on the state's prospects.
While NAMA is due to be wound down by 2021, Donohoe described that as the final phase its ""current existence"" and said Dublin would consider ways to use the agency's remaining assets to help develop housing and other facilities.
The agency has already been given additional roles by the government, including the construction of 20,000 homes on land it controls and building a new business district.
In its annual report published on Thursday, NAMA reported an after-tax profit of 795 million euros for 2018.

1408,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",Unfinished Business Awaits Liberty Holdings’ CEO,"(Bloomberg) -- Liberty Holdings Ltd. Chief Executive Officer David Munro has unfinished business to complete if he is to get investors to take notice of his efforts to accelerate profit growth at the South African life insurer.
This includes exiting some businesses and markets, improving digital offerings and rebuilding a trackrecord of delivering returns for policyholders.
While profit margins on Liberty’s sales have more than doubled, and outflows stemmed, the share price has lagged behind its larger peers since the 48-year-old career investment banker started two years ago. Munro is looking past the stock’s performance as he reorganizes a business that can no longer rely on double-digit equity and bond market returns to buoy its earnings.
“The game we’re playing here is not a flash-in-the-pan turnaround,” he said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Johannesburg office. “You could pull some levers fast and create some high-impact quick wins. But the legacy will be down the line in a few years time.”
Since moving from parent company Standard Bank Group Ltd., Munro has overhauled the insurer’s call center to make it simpler for clients to get help and formed closer ties with the 3,500 agents that sell its products. He also reduced the number of funds overseen by Stanlib on top of a revamp of the money manager’s leadership.
Back to Its Roots
Bringing the company back to the principles of founder Sir Donald Gordon, 88, who started the firm in 1958 after watching his father struggle financially after his retirement, is also part of Munro’s mission. Liberty was the first South African insurer to list its shares, and, in 1965 introduced the first mutual fund. Liberty lost its luster during the 2000s as customers canceled policies, reducing its market share, and a cost-cutting strategy backfired by depleting the insurer of skills.
The stock is down more than 2% since Munro was seconded to the insurer on May 30, 2017, compared with an almost 13% increase in the five-member FTSE/JSE Africa Life Assurance Index.
“The environment hasn’t given us any tailwinds, but more headwinds,” Munro said. Tepid economic growth in South Africa, unemployment of almost 28% and increased competition are making it harder to retain clients, especially in Liberty’s affluent target market. That’s meant Liberty has had to contain costs and improve efficiencies while modernizing its digital platforms.
The leadership team is aiming to reduce the 30% discount that the stock trades at relative to its equity value by running the “business well,” Munro said. It is still in the process of selling its health unit and businesses in Africa that don’t fit its strategy, he said, adding that returns from Stanlib’s equity and balanced funds are also improving after underperforming in the five years prior to 2018.
Liberty is now well positioned to benefit from any upswing in markets, currently weighed down by a U.S.-China trade dispute, the CEO said.
“He was able to stabilize the business, strategically he identified what was important, and where they would focus,” said Warwick Bam, the head of research at Avior Capital Markets, who has an outperform rating on Liberty. “He has embarked on a digitization strategy to get Liberty into a more competitive position from a servicing ability, especially to brokers, and that will feed into the customers’ experience of Liberty.”

He added that Citigroup has the lowest sensitivity in Goldman’s coverage to “both short-end rate movements and to the long end of the curve, suggesting their return improvements are the least dependent on fluctuations in the yield curve.” And he noted that Citigroup’s valuation discount versus its peers is the widest since the financial crisis, factoring in an improvement in Rotce.
Those aren’t the only things prompting the upgrade. The bank’s “global footprint and on-shore presence in Asia positions them relatively well to benefit from a potential shift in trade flows should trade tensions escalate further, causing companies to diversify supply chains,” Ramsden said.
Citigroup’s shares gained 1.4% in pre-market trading on Thursday. U.S. equity futures were climbing with European stocks, while bonds were steady, with 10-year Treasury yields unchanged at 2.26%. Citigroup has outperformed so far this year, rising 22% compared with an 11% gain for the S&P 500 and a 10% increase for the KBW Bank Index, and it’s the best performer in the bank index.

1414,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla woes send Panasonic's U.S. solar cells to Philippines,"By Nichola Groom and Makiko Yamazaki
LOS ANGELES/TOKYO (Reuters) - Most of the solar cells made by Panasonic at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's New York manufacturing plant are being purchased by H.R.D. Singapore's factories in the Philippines, a chief supplier of panels to Japanese eco-homebuilder Ichijo Co Ltd, two sources familiar with the arrangement said.
Reuters reported on May 15 that Panasonic planned to ship most cells from the plant overseas, instead of selling them to Tesla for its trademark Solar Roof as initially intended, because of low demand from Tesla and a trade loophole that had fired up new foreign interest. That loophole allows companies outside the United States to ship solar panels into America duty-free provided the panels are made with U.S.-built cells.
Until now, the identity of the buyer of the Panasonic cells, which Panasonic is producing at the Tesla facility under an agreement struck in 2016, has not been published. 
The demand for U.S. solar cells abroad is striking because there are very few American producers and the components are typically far cheaper when sourced in Asia, reflecting the lengths to which some companies would go to sidestep President Donald Trump's tariffs on solar imports. It was unclear what H.R.D. and Ichijo's plans were for the Panasonic cells.
The export of the cells also underscores the depths of Tesla’s troubles in the U.S. solar business, which the electric car maker acquired in 2016 with its $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity, but which has been shrinking since. 
The sources said H.R.D.’s factories in the Philippines were now taking the lion’s share of the solar cells from the Buffalo plant, presumably to assemble them into solar panels. They did not provide estimates on the volume or value of the cells going to H.R.D., saying only the shipments accounted for most of the cell production from the facility.
H.R.D.’s factories primarily supply Ichijo, a company to which H.R.D. is closely affiliated, according to posts by Ichijo on social media. Ichijo markets its homes as energy efficient and technology-focused, and many are offered with solar panels. The company had roughly $3.7 billion in sales last year focused mainly in the Japanese market, but for the past 10 years it has also been building in the United States Pacific Northwest.
Representatives from Panasonic, Tesla and H.R.D. declined to comment. An Ichijo official at the company's Japan headquarters also declined to comment.
Panasonic partnered with Tesla in 2016 to make solar cells, as well as full solar panels, at the Buffalo facility after Tesla inherited the plant in its acquisition of SolarCity. 
The companies said Tesla would make a long-term commitment to buy the cells - key components in panels that convert the sun’s light into electricity - to use them in Tesla's Solar Roof product.
LOW-CARBON LIFESTYLE
Musk had billed the Solar Roof, designed to look like conventional roof tiles, as a cornerstone of the company’s strategy to sell a low-carbon lifestyle to eco-conscious consumers who could use the power from a Solar Roof to charge their Tesla electric vehicle.
But the company has installed them on just a handful of rooftops so far after production line troubles and a gutting of Tesla’s solar sales team, according to Tesla sources. Tesla has not provided official sales figures for its Solar Roof.
Panasonic was forced to find other buyers due to low demand from Tesla, whose purchases of the cells have been sporadic, an employee at the Buffalo factory said. The automaker does not have an exclusive supply arrangement with Panasonic.
Panasonic said in a filing with the U.S. Department of Commerce last year that it expected to sell the majority of the cells from the plant abroad, citing the new foreign demand for U.S.-made cells that arose after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on panels in 2018.

Panasonic's Buffalo operation is one of few U.S.-based solar cell producers, putting it in a unique position to serve that foreign demand.

(Reuters) - Dallas-based Greyhound was put up for sale by Britain's FirstGroup on Thursday as the North American bus line battles to compete with growing pressure from low cost airlines.
Greyhound has been a household name in North America since it was founded in 1914, with prominent roles for its buses and their running dog logo in movies, music and motorcycle stunts.
FirstGroup, which bought Greyhound for $3.6 billion including debt from Laidlaw International in 2007, plans to sell the bus line and spin-off its UK operator First Bus to head off shareholder pressure, lifting its shares by as much as 13%.
Changing travel trends have meant a bumpy road for Greyhound from the highs of featuring in Frank Capra's 1934 movie ""It Happened One Night"" and Simon and Garfunkel's ""America"" in 1968 to the low of filing for bankruptcy protection in 1990.
Greyhound survived and is now the only operator of scheduled intercity coaches in North America, carrying around 17 million passengers a year and serving some 2,400 destinations.
FirstGroup invested in expanding and modernizing the Greyhound fleet and terminals as well as marketing, but this has not proved enough to give it the returns shareholders expect. 
""The issues at Greyhound have revolved around the impact of low cost airlines coming into some of our markets and (the) relatively low oil price over the year, which in the U.S. means more people get into their cars,"" FirstGroup Chief Executive Matthew Gregory told reporters on a call. 
Gregory said FirstGroup had appointed investment bankers to launched a formal sale process, but declined to place a price tag on Greyhound, which reported revenue of 645 million pounds in the year ended March 31.
'ICONIC BRAND'
""It's not really in my interest to tell you what I think the value might be for the business, but its a iconic brand, has the biggest intercity network of coaches in the U.S., so I think its something a lot of people will be interested in,"" he added. 
FirstGroup, which also runs tens of thousands of yellow school buses in the United States, said Greyhound has limited synergies with its predominantly contract-based businesses in North America and shareholders would get best value if it was sold.
Its emphasis will now be on First Student and First Transit, its core contracting businesses in North America.
""Greyhound is in long term structural decline and absorbs considerable management time without offering upside potential, and therefore disposing of it is optimal,"" Investec said.
FirstGroup, which replaced its chief executive last year and has not paid a dividend since 2013, has rejected two approaches from private equity firms and has been targeted by Canadian activist investor West Face Capital.
Coast Capital, its second-largest shareholder, has been seeking to replace six of its eleven directors. 
FirstGroup, whose shares fell by 23.3% in 2018, also cast doubt on its future in British railways, saying it had ""reduced expectations"" for its two most recently awarded franchises due to timetabling, infrastructure issues and strike action.

""Any future commitments to UK rail will need to have an appropriate balance of potential risks and rewards for our shareholders,"" it added.

It came a day after Chinese newspapers warned that Beijng could use rare earth exports to strike back at the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he was ""not yet ready"" to make a trade deal.
Investors were turning their attention to the second estimate of U.S. first-quarter growth, due out later in the day, along with the weekly report on jobless claims and pending home sales data for April.
""As the United States isn't likely to fall into a recession anytime soon, there's a likelihood that risk sentiment may improve based on the economy's strength,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.

(Reuters) - Jumps for two of Europe's biggest newspaper publishers helped European stocks gain early on Thursday, recovering from a more than 3-month closing low a day earlier as U.S.-China trade concerns continued to weigh on stock markets.
Germany's Axel Springer SE shares jumped to the top of the pan-European STOXX 600 after it said it was in talks with private equity firm KKR about a potential investment in the company.
Britain's Daily Mail also gained over 8% after it reported a better-than-expected 19% rise in first-half adjusted pretax profit and reaffirmed its forecasts for the full year.

""It looks like a small bounce after weeks of negative sentiment,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics in London. 
""I'm not sure how long it will last"" as concerns over Italy's budget dispute with the European Union still remains and trade situation also doesn't seem to be getting any better.""

1420,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",Takeover of little-known Baoshang casts doubt over other small Chinese banks,"By Ryan Woo and Cheng Leng
BEIJING (Reuters) - A rare government takeover of a little-known Chinese bank has revived concerns about the true health of hundreds of small lenders in the country as a slowing economy and souring loans test their capital buffers and drain their reserves.
Regulators seized Baoshang Bank last week, citing serious credit risks. The sudden takeover of the Inner Mongolia-based lender has fanned worries about other banks with substantial borrowings.
There are almost no public details about Baoshang's current credit profile. Its ""AA+"" rating has not been adjusted since 2015 and the bank has not disclosed any financial data since 2017. According to Refinitiv data, Baoshang has 206 outstanding bonds worth a total of 73.83 billion yuan ($10.69 billion).
The circumstances around the Baoshang case, however, have turned the spotlight on other banks that have similarly delayed disclosures. Over a dozen small lenders, including Bank of Jinzhou and Bank of Jilin, have not published their annual or quarterly reports this year, stirring concerns about worsening asset quality and capital adequacy.
The Bank of Jinzhou and Bank of Jilin did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
""The life of some smaller banks is hard,"" said Felix Zhang, founder and chief executive of Bairong Inc, a third-party risk management firm backed by sovereign fund China Reform Holdings Corp.
He said three rural banks with bad-loan ratios between 20% and 30% had approached him and wanted Bairong to buy them out.
So far in 2019, the credit ratings of two rural banks - Jilin Shuangyang Rural Commercial Bank and Anhui Tongcheng Rural Commercial Bank - have been downgraded, for reasons ranging from bad loans and inadequate bad-loan provisions to poor corporate governance.
Last year, the ratings of 11 city and rural commercial banks were cut, according to a Reuters analysis of reports issued by domestic ratings agencies. That compares with just two downgrades in 2017.
TOUGH TIMES
China's city and rural commercial banks face higher risks as they inherently lack the ability to diversify in terms of geography, industry or clients, analysts say.
Their cozy ties to local governments also add pressure for them to support opaque local financing entities.
Jilin Shuangyang Rural Commercial Bank, in the northeastern rustbelt, was downgraded to ""A"" in April from ""A+"", with ratings agency China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI) citing weaker local economic conditions and the lender's risky off-balance sheet business.
Stricter classification rules since last year on bad-loan reporting are also expected to further increase the number of bad loans at small banks that had previously put them under the ""special mention"" category.
The bad-loan ratio of Anhui Tongcheng Rural Commercial Bank jumped to 12.25% at end-2018 from 3.03% a year earlier. The lender was downgraded to ""A"" from ""A+"" by CCXI in January. The ratings agency cited surging bad loans and a low loan-loss provision ratio.
The provision ratio of Anhui Tongcheng slumped to 25.2% in 2018 from 145.26% in 2017, according to CCXI. The lender's capital adequacy ratio also dropped sharply to 2.28% at end-2018 from 14.06% a year earlier.
The market is closely watching any reassessment of the credit conditions of smaller banks that haven't been downgraded but could be on the verge of a credit crisis.
China's credit ratings industry is dominated by six domestic agencies whose reports do not necessarily disclose as many details about their ratings decisions as those of their major counterparts abroad.
One problem is a general reluctance among Chinese agencies to give their ""five-star"" clients unfavorable ratings, for fear of losing business, or being accused by the authorities of causing market disturbances with ""negative"" news.
Even when a bank is given a rating downgrade, the ratings agency might not publicly offer a reason for the cut, citing confidentiality clauses.
Almost 700 city and rural commercial banks are rated at least an ""A"", according to a Reuters analysis.
""The Baoshang takeover is a clear signal that regulators are motivated to speed up the cleansing of poorly operated rural and city commercial banks,"" said Dexter Hsu, a Taipei-based analyst at Macquarie Research.
""There could be more consolidation of small banks. Looking back on this, you'll find it's actually good for economic health.""

“We expect shares to remain choppy,” analysts led by Katy L. Huberty wrote in a note. “Near term, the greatest risk to Apple is that Chinese consumers meaningfully slow their purchases of Apple products, which would likely cause another round of estimate cuts.”
The analysts estimate that the iPhone giant could see a 23% hit to fiscal 2020 earnings in a worst-case scenario of the U.S. placing a blanket 25% tax on all Chinese imports. A profit reduction of around 19% is, however, more likely, given that Apple may raise prices to mitigate the impact, they said. Morgan Stanley doesn’t expect China to formally ban iPhone sales, given that the devices are produced in the country.
Analysts have been seeking to quantify the potential impact that Chinese retaliation could have on the company, with Goldman Sachs last week estimating a 29% hit to earnings if China were to ban sales of Apple’s products, and Cowen saying that fiscal 2020 profit could fall 26% on an iPhone ban.
Morgan Stanley on Thursday reiterated its overweight recommendation on Apple, though the analysts trimmed their price target to $231 from $240, citing peer multiple contraction."

1423,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 04:17AM ET</span>","Trade gloom, rising oil, Boeing 737 MAX woes to cloud aviation summit","By Heekyong Yang and Tracy Rucinski 
SEOUL (Reuters) - Global airlines are meeting under a storm pattern of trade tensions, rising oil prices and a two-month-old grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jetliner - threatening to put a halt to five years of strong profits in the cut-throat air travel industry.
The sector's bosses converge on Seoul for a summit this weekend, but what might have been a celebration of growth in one of the world's most vibrant regions now risks being thrown off course by a crippling U.S.-China trade spat and growing environmental pressures spreading from Europe.
""The last six months have been pretty tough for airlines,"" the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said ahead of the annual meeting of the body, which groups 290 airlines representing over 80% of air travel.
""Rising costs, trade wars and other uncertainties are likely to have an impact on the bottom line,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac added.
The June 1-3 summit is a chance to examine passenger and cargo trends: key barometers of consumer confidence and trade amid a faltering global economy. 
IATA's most recent projection for $35.5 billion in industry profits this year now looks unsustainable due to the falling cargo market and weaker passenger growth, and de Juniac has given a strong steer that the group would trim the forecast at the upcoming Seoul meeting.
The cargo slump, with volumes down 3.7% in April including a 7.4% fall in the Asia-Pacific, is a concern for big freight carriers like Cathay Pacific and the IATA summit host Korean Air Lines.
""We have really since the end of last year seen quite a deterioration of cross-border trade following the earlier round of tariff increases,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said. 
The meeting of some 200 CEOs is the largest gathering since the industry was plunged into crisis over the grounding of the 737 MAX in March following two crashes. IATA members have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the MAX and are anxious to contain any public or regulatory backlash.
Aviation leaders maintain flying remains remarkably safe relative to other forms of transport.
But the decision by China, the European Union and others to ground the MAX before the United States opened an unusual split in the regulatory system, worrying airlines and planemakers.
737 MAX CUSTOMER TALKS
IATA, which is taking an increasingly central role in the crisis by hosting talks of MAX customers, believes the aircraft could return to service in August. But that is too late to prevent significant disruption to summer schedules.
Pressure on Boeing grew ahead of the IATA meeting as the China Air Transport Association estimated losses to Chinese airlines of some 4 billion yuan ($579 million).
IATA began in 1945 as a quasi-regulator and price-setter. It is now mainly a lobbying group but retains a special role as a clearing house for financial transactions and common standards.
Its perennial list of concerns includes high airport charges and what IATA calls ""scandalous"" air traffic delays in Europe.
But it is also wrestling with a rapid surge in anti-aviation sentiment in parts of Europe and calls in the Netherlands and elsewhere for new taxes to curb airliner emissions. 
The aviation industry says it has plans to contribute to climate efforts through a carbon-offset scheme called CORSIA, but critics say the initiative is too timid.
Local airlines seem to encapsulate this year's subdued tone.
Korean Air is mourning the death of long-time chairman Cho Yang-ho from a chronic illness in April, weeks after shareholders ousted the tycoon from the board of the country's largest airline. 
The carrier, now led by his son Walter, has been receiving negative media attention since an incident dubbed ""nut rage"" went viral in 2014, when Cho's eldest daughter Heather lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class and ordered the plane to return to its gate at a New York airport.
Rival Asiana's top shareholder Kumho Industrial Co said last month it was selling its stake in the debt-laden carrier which has been slashing routes to improve profitability.

""It seems there is not much of a celebratory mood given the circumstances at our major carriers,"" said Kim Ik-sang, a senior analyst at BNK Securities.

1426,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>",Renault's Senard Says Jobs and Nissan Will Be Safe in Fiat Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Convincing the stakeholders of  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) on the merits of a merger may be the easy part. The hard task is selling the deal to Renault’s alliance partner Nissan Motor Co., (T:7201) as well as labor groups and politicians wary of job cuts.
Jean-Dominique Senard, who’s been tapped to lead the combined Franco-Italian carmaker, is in Tokyo to make what may be the sales pitch of his career. In an interview on Thursday, he painted a picture of a grand alliance making and selling cars across the globe, keeping people employed and churning out profits.
“It can only happen if people are open to it,” said Senard, 66, who attended a meeting for the board overseeing the alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He came to explain the merits of the Fiat-Renault deal to the Japanese executives, who started Wednesday’s meeting with many questions. By the end, the mood lightened and they were positive, he said.
“A closer partnership can only improve the alliance,” Senard said. Nissan, which has pushed back in the past at attempts for closer integration, “understood the message I brought here, although obviously they can’t digest it in one night,” he added.
After spending three days in Japan, Senard will return to Europe to work on bringing Fiat Chrysler and Renault together. He doesn’t anticipate any serious regulatory hurdles for the merger. Asked whether the joining of two European automakers would result in job cuts, Senard said the deal ""doesn't call for human sacrifice.""
The merger won't involve any plant closures, according to Fiat, although it didn't mention any potential job cuts when the deal was announced. The combination also has the blessing of the Italian and French governments, which are constantly on guard against the risk of labor unrest.
The transaction would be structured as a 50-50 ownership through a Dutch holding company, with Renault shareholders, including the French government, getting an implied premium of about 10%. Renault’s board is expected to give preliminary approval to the proposal as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter have said. Senard said on Thursday that the deal will take about a year to complete.
Behind the push to consolidate are the various headwinds the industry is facing. Sales are decelerating in the world’s biggest car markets — China, the U.S. and Europe — bringing fresh urgency to consolidate. Automakers worldwide are facing intense pressure to spend heavily on electrification and autonomous vehicles, and adapting to trends such as car-sharing.
Renault and Fiat Chrysler estimate cost savings of more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) from the merger. The automakers will focus on reducing platforms, simplifying product lines and focusing on quality and branding, Senard said. ""All of the brands are very famous,"" he said. ""Some have to be re-enhanced.""
In order to sell more cars, Senard indicated profit-eroding price cuts in North America by Nissan and Chrysler would have to end. ""It needs to be about quality boosting market share,"" he said.
Asked about recent comments by Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Peugeot owner Groupe PSA and former Ghosn protege, calling the deal a ""virtual takeover"" of Renault and that it could weaken or unwind the alliance with Nissan, Senard said: ""Everyone is free to say what they think.""
Nissan could be a key part of forging a global group that could produce 15 million vehicles a year. The Yokohama-based company would complement the merged entity because of its strong presence in China, Japan and the rest of Asia, as well as its electric-car technology.
There are signs that Senard’s charm offensive is yielding some results. Following the meeting, Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa said he saw potential opportunities for the existing alliance in Fiat Chrysler’s merger proposal, though he plans to study the matter further. As Saikawa put it, “we don’t consider this as a minus.”
As to Senard, he said Nissan is already benefiting from the proposed merger given the increase in the Japanese carmaker’s shares on news of the deal. Nissan, 43% owned by Renault, would also finally have more tangible influence by gaining greater say in the alliance, he said.
Under the proposed merger of Fiat Chrysler and Renault, Nissan would get 7.5% of the combined entity. The Japanese carmaker would be able to vote with those shares, unlike with its current holdings, which carry no voting rights. A merger would also dilute the French state’s control over Renault, and indirectly over Nissan, easing a concern it has had for years.
Nissan needs some good news. The company recently forecast weak operating profit and cut its dividend for the first time in a decade. Senard said Nissan currently needs to focus on its profitability and that it’s in Renault’s interest for its Japanese partner to turn itself around.
Fiat also said the combination would help cut costs by an additional 1 billion euros for Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.
The alliance was destabilized late last year with the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its architect and chairman, for alleged financial crimes during his time as leader of Nissan. Ghosn has denied all charges and is preparing for his trial next year. Although Nissan and Renault have been partners for two decades, the Japanese automaker isn’t in a position to block the deal because the merger wouldn’t breach terms of their partnership.
Senard, who replaced Ghosn as chairman of Renault and the alliance, has sought to restore stability following his predecessor’s arrest. The former  Michelin  (PA:MICP) CEO worked earlier this year with Nissan to craft a new governance structure to oversee the partnership, giving up concessions over board seats to assuage the Japanese firm’s concerns.
""With Nissan, this is the first truly global car alliance,"" Senard said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks tracked Wall Street losses on Thursday as the latest exchanges between Beijing and Washington signaled the heightened risk of a prolonged trade war, stoking investors' concerns about the impact on global economic growth.
European stock futures were higher in early trade, trimming some losses after falling sharply the previous day. The pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.46%, German DAX futures edge up 0.34% and FTSE futures gained 0.25%.
""We oppose a trade war but are not afraid of a trade war. This kind of deliberately provoking trade disputes is naked economic terrorism, economic chauvinism, economic bullying,"" Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanhui said, when asked about the trade war with the United States.
His comments followed reports from Chinese newspapers that Beijing could use rare earths to strike back at Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump remarked he was ""not yet ready"" to make a deal with China over trade.
As investors switched out of equities, safe-haven assets such as government bonds found favor, with yields on German benchmark debt approaching record lows.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.4%.
Japan's Nikkei was down 0.5% and Australian stocks shed 0.85%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped to a fresh four-month low before finding a bit of traction to edge up 0.1%.
""The equity markets are in the midst of pricing in a long-term trade war, with participants shaping their portfolios in anticipation of a protracted conflict,"" said Soichiro Monji, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.
""The upcoming G20 summit could provide the markets with relief, as the United States and China could use the event to begin negotiating again over trade.""
The G20 meeting is set for June 28-29 in Japan.
Observers elsewhere expressed less optimism toward the G20 meeting.
""It seems to us that a Trump-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the G20 meeting is more wishful thinking than hard political reality,"" wrote Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. ""This is a moment that defines before and after.""
Amid the flight-to-safety, Germany's 10-year bond yield fell to a three-year trough of minus 0.179% overnight. A drop below minus 0.200% set in 2016 would take the yield to a record low.
Spanish and Portuguese 10-year yields fell to record lows as deeply negative German Bund yields have encouraged investors to look elsewhere for returns. [GVD/EUR]
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 2.267% after falling to a 20-month low of 2.210% on Wednesday.
Notwithstanding lower Treasury yields, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 98.085 and in reach of a two-year peak of 98.371 set last week, with the greenback serving as a safe haven.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.1137, pulling back slightly following three successive days of losses.
The dollar was little changed at 109.660 yen after bouncing back from a two-week low of 109.150 brushed on Wednesday.
Oil prices rose modestly after an industry report showed a decline in U.S. crude inventories that exceeded analyst expectations. 
The rise followed volatile trading on Wednesday, when oil prices fell to near three-month lows at one point as trade war fears gripped the commodity markets.
U.S. crude futures were up 0.66% at $59.20 per barrel after brushing $56.88 the previous day, their lowest since March 12.
Brent crude added 0.37% to $69.71 per barrel.

Trade worries have weighed on oil but supply constraints linked to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output cuts and political tensions in the Middle East have offered some support.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>","In Macau's non-gaming race, analysts pick Sands China, Galaxy as winners","By Farah Master
MACAU (Reuters) - Macau's casino operators have pledged billions of dollars to develop non-gaming attractions in a bid to secure new licenses, but analysts predict only the more efficient like Sands China and Galaxy will be able to curb losses and emerge winners.
The spending frenzy comes as Beijing pushes to rebrand Macau as a family-friendly destination. Operators are plowing $10 billion into mostly non-gaming, which has traditionally been hard to monetize, before their licenses expire in 2022 amid warnings new permits will be linked to efforts to diversify.
These expenses - together with slowing gambling revenues as a boom in new regional casinos lure Macau's high rollers to places such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Russia's Vladivostok - mean it will be tough for operators with poor efficiencies like SJM Holdings to promise high returns, analysts said.
A blanket 20% return on invested capital for casino resorts, easily achievable in previous years, is no longer guaranteed, industry experts said.
""It will be the best and brightest gaming operators to be able to defend themselves,"" said Grant Govertsen, managing director at research firm Union Gaming in Macau. 
Sands China, which has roped in British soccer star David Beckham as ambassador, and Galaxy Entertainment have proved the most successful so far at developing non-gaming offerings, Govertsen said. 
Sands' themes of Italy and France and Galaxy's attractions including a cinema and wave pool have been popular, according to Govertsen. Sands hopes to boost footfall with a London-themed project, plans for which were unveiled earlier this month amid much fanfare with Beckham playing a starring role. 
SJM, however, is likely to lag given its limited non-gaming amenities and poor operational efficiency, other analysts say.
While it is planning to open a $4.6 billion 1,900-room resort in Macau with a bigger non-gaming focus, the significant foray and increase in hotel rooms will hike SJM's execution risk in initial stages, said Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.
Sands made $1.8 billion revenue from non-gaming in 2018, while Galaxy raked in $675 million and SJM $93 million from non-gaming in the same period. 
A GAMBLE
Non-gaming is a key condition of operating in Macau, said Ben Lee, managing partner at IGamiX. Companies have mainly stuck to developing add-ons such as accommodation, food, beverage and retail but officials are pushing for more such as entertainment, art and business conventions.
""The return on invested capital will be less efficient unless they are very clever in making it work,"" Lee said. 
Non-gaming revenue currently accounts for 2-20 percent of operators' total net revenue in Macau. Officials want that to reach 40 percent, more comparable to Las Vegas which makes over 60 percent of its revenues from non-gaming. 
To that end, Sands, Wynn Macau, MGM China, Galaxy, SJM and Melco Resorts are working with the government to create Macau's largest Art and Culture fair which starts in June.
Analysts are bullish on Macau's long-term fundamentals given it is China's only legal casino hub, its greater connectivity to the mainland and massive growing middle class, but they see the development of non-gaming as increasing execution risk. 
The latest five resorts to open have all seen lower property earnings and only two made a return on investment of 20 percent or more, said Govertsen. Also historically, operators have struggled to make non-gaming successful. 
Sands in 2012 severed its 10-year contract with Cirque du Soleil after three years; Melco closed a series of attractions - including its Taboo cabaret show in 2016 after losing $3 million annually; and Wynn's Tryst nightclub shut four months after opening in 2007 with the space converted into baccarat tables.
Melco, which has made significant efforts to diversify with shows, nightclubs and a trampoline park, is constantly having to adjust its offerings, with revenues from the casino subsidizing the non-gaming attractions, CEO Lawrence Ho said.

""Non-gaming is hard in Macau. That is the simple truth of it and you really have to try very hard,"" Ho said.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 11:18PM ET</span>",Global stocks to keep climbing but trade war a major hurdle: Reuters Poll,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks will continue their march to higher ground but an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war poses the biggest risk, Reuters polls of over 200 equity strategists, analysts and fund managers from around the world found.
Last year was not a good 12 months for long speculators as only three of the 17 top global indexes ended 2018 higher than they started it. Of the 14 that made losses only five are expected to recoup them by end-2019.
However, all 17 indexes polled by Reuters are up so far this year, with some having posted double-digit gains. While the pace of gains will largely slow, all but two are predicted to end this year higher than where they finished last week.
""The trade war is the primary issue, with recent softness in U.S. macro - where resilience had been accepted wisdom - a product of the uncertainty it is creating,"" said Robert Griffiths, global equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Still, respondents to the quarterly Reuters poll were generally upbeat and stuck to their guns in the May 13-29 poll in expecting nearly all major bourses covered to make solid gains through to the end of next year.
End-2019 projections for 13 of the 17 indexes were raised from a February poll, along with eight mid-2020 median forecasts. Eight mid-2020 forecasts were downgraded and one was unchanged.
When asked what the biggest risk to their forecasts was in the coming year almost 60% of over 100 respondents to an additional question said it was an escalation in the trade war between the United States and China.
In second place, with 22% of economists picking it, was a worse-than expected slowdown in U.S. economic growth. In third spot was the 17% who said a slowdown or stall in corporate earnings growth. 
(Reuters Poll: Global stock markets outlook link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wipkre).
MOSTLY UPS
U.S. stocks will build on this year's already strong gains over the rest of 2019 and the benchmark S&P 500 index will finish 2019 at 2,925, up about up about 3.5% from last week's close. 
Although the S&P 500 remains up about 12% for the year so far, stocks have sold off recently amid persistent worries over the trade battle.
Shares on the neighboring Toronto exchange will nudge higher over the rest of the year but investors will need to wait until the second half of 2020 for the index to better April's record peak. 
Brazilian stocks are expected to post double-digit gains this year, outperforming the Mexican market, as President Jair Bolsonaro's new government pushes ahead on key economic reforms. 
European shares are seen mostly moving sideways until end-2019 and making just modest gains later on, as investors refrain from big bets on a region whose export-oriented economy makes it vulnerable to trade war risks. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark is seen ending the year at 380 points, just 1% above the level it was at when the poll closed last week. However that would be a 12.5% rise for the year, its biggest yearly gain since 2013. 
Germany's DAX and Italy's FTSE MIB, the main stock indexes for the euro zone's biggest and third biggest economies, are expected to stall or decline slightly from where they closed the end of last week. 
London's FTSE, will manage only modest gains in the second half as the nation's tortuous exit from the European Union hangs over the market, deterring investors despite share valuations being attractively cheap. 
For next year, respondents gave fewer forecasts for the FTSE 100, reflecting deepening uncertainty over the direction the UK market will take as there is little clarity as to how, when or even if an already delayed Brexit will happen.
""Another postponement of Brexit would likely hurt UK growth and shares,"" said Ireneus Stanislawek, equity strategist at Vontobel Asset Management. ""The quicker Brexit is resolved the better.""
Indian shares are expected to reach a new record high by end-year, drifting up from a pre-election rally in which investors correctly bet the ruling party would retain power and continue current economic policies. 

And Shanghai's Composite index, which closed last week up over 14% this year after shedding a quarter of its value in 2018, will add another 4% by year-end despite investor concerns over a slowing economy and Beijing's trade dispute with Washington.

""The property market last year, before the cooling measures were put in place, we saw prices rising very sharply,"" Wong said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin in Singapore. ""There was a very real risk that prices would outpace fundamentals, and I think if that had happened then eventually it would lead to a destabilizing correction and I think everybody would be worse off.""
Singapore’s government introduced cooling measures to slow price increases in July 2018, including raising stamp duties for second homes and entities, and tightening loan-to-value limits for housing loans granted by financial institutions.
""It was, as we had stressed then, not to bring down prices but to stabilize and moderate the cycle, and I think we have achieved that effect,"" Wong said.
Asked if he was concerned about property buyers moving focus from Hong Kong’s ever-rising property market to cheaper Singapore, Wong said there will always be foreign investors looking to buy in Singapore because they think it’s a good investment. However, he said Singapore will continue to monitor prices and has a suite of available tools at its disposal to ensure stability.
""We welcome investors to our property market, but what we want to ensure is that demand, regardless whether it’s local demand or foreign demand, doesn’t cause the prices to move at a pace that outstrips fundamentals.""

“The probabilistic risk is the equity markets have more downside than upside,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie in Beijing Thursday. “The magnitude is not so big. I don’t think we’re looking at a collapse.”
Gorman said that the inversion of part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve was worrying, given that it’s been a leading indicator for recessions over the past half century. But with unemployment at 3.6% and inflation modest, U.S. fundamentals are solid, and any recession would likely be “shallow and short,” the banking chief said. He’d be surprised to see the Federal Reserve lower interest rates this year.
“I wouldn’t encourage people to move one way or the other” on stocks, Gorman said. “There’s too much uncertainty. There’s nothing to be gained from trying to be clever at this point” for retail investors, he said.
Much of the risk of the U.S. moving to full-blown 25% tariffs on all Chinese imports is now “priced in” to markets, Gorman said. While “the market psyche is fragile,” sentiment could shift quickly if U.S.-China trade talks get back on track, he said.
Read more here about Gorman’s take on U.S.-China trade talks.
By year-end, Gorman said he’d expect 10-year Treasury yields to be back between 2.5% to 3%, allowing people to conclude that “what we’re seeing now is a short-term funk.” He also played down any worries over credit markets, saying leveraged loans weren’t a major risk. “I know systemic” dangers, he said. “There’s a bigger bubble in student credit.”

1434,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 10:12PM ET</span>","FCA, Renault face tall odds delivering on cost-cutting promises in merger","By Edward Taylor and Ben Klayman
FRANKFURT/DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) promise huge savings from a mega-merger, but such combinations face tall odds because of the industry’s long product cycles and problems translating deal blueprints into real world success, industry veterans told Reuters.
BMW AG's 1994 purchase of Rover, and Daimler AG's 1998 merger with Chrysler Corp both made sense on paper. The companies promised to hike profits by combining vehicle platforms and engine families. Both combinations proved unworkable in reality, and were unwound.
Renault and Nissan Motor Co, which have been in an alliance since 1999 designed to share vehicle components, have only managed to use common vehicle platforms in 35% of Nissan's products despite an original target of 70%, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
FCA and Renault have raised the stakes for themselves by ruling out plant closures. That increases the pressure to achieve more than $5 billion in promised annual savings from pooling procurement and research investments. 
The two companies have yet to fill in many of the blanks in the merger plan put forward by Fiat Chrysler. Renault's board is expected to act soon to accept the proposal, but that would lead only to a memorandum of understanding to pursue detailed operational and financial plans. A final deal and the legal combination of the two companies could take months to complete if all goes well.
Pressure to cut automotive pollution is driving the latest round of consolidation. Automakers are looking at multibillion-dollar bills to develop electric and hybrid cars and cleaner internal combustion engines. Fiat Chrysler and Renault are betting they can design common electric vehicle systems, then sell more of them through their respective brands and dealer networks, cutting the cost per car.
Developing all-new electric vehicles can bring more opportunities to share costs from the outset, industry experts said.
""With the emergence of connected, autonomous, electric and shared vehicles, carmakers face immediate investments, so new opportunities for sharing costs have emerged,” said Elmar Kades, managing director at Alix Partners.
However, most electric vehicles lose money. This is a challenge for city car brands in Europe in particular. Both Renault and Fiat rely heavily on this segment for sales.
“The economics of cheap small cars are getting harder,"" said Carl-Peter Forster, an auto industry veteran who has worked on numerous transformational car deals, including Tata's management of Jaguar Land Rover, BMW's attempted integration of Rover and Geely's management of Volvo cars. 
""Hybrid technology is too expensive in the small value segment and with electrification there is the dilemma of having a large battery which is too expensive or having a battery which is cheaper and small, but offers only limited operating range,” he explained.  
He is a former director of Volvo Cars Corp, a non-executive director of Geely Automobile Holdings, a former head of manufacturing at BMW and the former chief executive of Opel.
Forster declined to comment on FCA and Renault's proposal but he said in general synergies from sharing platforms and engines take time to translate into tangible benefits for both partners.
“The Opel Fiat partnership to develop a new platform for the Fiat Punto and Opel Corsa shows it is possible to do cooperation on architectures and powertrain, but it takes a minimum of three to four years before you even start reaping the benefits,” Forster said. 
Fiat Chrysler needs to reduce its European fleet average emissions of 124 grams (4.4 oz) of carbon dioxide per kilometer to 93 grams to meet European regulations, a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst said this week. Renault has cleaner engines and thanks to fewer sales of sports utility vehicles, fleet average emissions of 113 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer.
Fiat Chrysler said it believes it will meet European fleet average emission thresholds, including by spending up to 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion) to acquire regulatory credits from rivals. 
Investors initially cheered the proposal to combine Renault and Fiat Chrysler. Executives at other companies are cautious of mega-mergers. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG are discussing partnerships across a range of products, geographies and technologies, but are not discussing a full merger.
Daimler and Renault-Nissan have shared technology in 13 different projects resulting in cost savings in excess of 2 billion euros. Former Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche, who fought to salvage his company's merger with Chrysler before deciding to unwind the deal in 2007, said he saw no need for large, transformational mergers. 
""Both of us had multiple experiences in cooperation, in capital integration, not all of them being positive,"" he said at one of his last joint press conferences with then Renault chief Carlos Ghosn.
People will be critical to the merger's success, said Thomas Stallkamp, a former top executive at Chrysler Corp during the stormy period that followed the Daimler takeover.
“The real issue is going to be the integration of management and who’s in control and who controls the capital,” Stallkamp said. Adding Nissan and Mitsubishi to the mix would make management's task much harder, he added.
""You’d have Renault, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Fiat and Chrysler, that’s just mind boggling. No one in their right mind would try that.""

1435,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 09:10PM ET</span>","PVH cuts profit forecast as CEO sees retail softness, shares tank","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH) cut its annual profit forecast by 10 cents a share on Wednesday as the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands owner grapples with tariffs and slowing retail growth, exacerbated by weak spending from overseas shoppers in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, sending its shares down 12% after hours.
Escalating trade tensions between China and the United States have emerged as a new headache for U.S. retailers, with a clutch warning that additional tariffs would thin their earnings and margins.
""Looking ahead, the volatile and challenging macroeconomic backdrop has continued into the second quarter, with particular softness across the U.S. and China retail landscape,"" Chief Executive Emanuel Chirico said in a statement.
Tariffs on Chinese imports are a concern, as PVH sources a majority of its apparel, footwear and accessories from the Asian country. In 2018, the company imported about $400 million of inventory from China. 
Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump escalated the trade war by raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. This was in addition to the 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports already in place.
Chirico, in an interview on CNBC, said the latest discussions on tariff and trade issues, which includes proposed tariffs on a further $300 billion worth Chinese imports, was not his main concern.
""That (tariffs) is not the issue going forward... What we're seeing is a slowdown in growth and a slowdown in retail sales,"" he told CNBC, highlighting a slowdown in international tourism in the United States and a strong dollar. 
""We've really seen some softness in the business,"" he said. 
PVH projected a 10 cent cut in its full-year adjusted profit per share due to the strong dollar. It now expects 2019 adjusted profit between $10.20 and $10.30 per share, which includes the impact of the latest round of tariffs. Wall Street was expecting $10.42 per share, on average. 
""Of course the CEO's comment is making investors nervous. And he didn't really mince words, beyond avoiding the tariff subject,"" Paula Rosenblum, co-founder of retail research firm RSR Research said. 
PVH's first-quarter revenue rose 1.8% to $2.36 billion, but fell short of analysts' estimate of $2.37 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Excluding items, the company earned $2.46 per share, a cent above the average estimate. 
Investors will likely hear more comments from Chirico on the analysts call on Thursday. 

""We expect the focus for the conference call will be on the cadence of earnings in the remainder of the year,"" Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. money market fund assets rose for a fifth consecutive week, bringing its total to more than a nine-year high as investors pour cash into low-risk funds on concerns about escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, a private report released on Wednesday showed.
U.S. money fund assets increased by $17.26 billion to $3.110 trillion in the week ended May 28, the Money Fund Report said.
During this five-week span, total fund assets increased by $101 billion.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. money fund assets link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Em6sNq).
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not yet ready to make a deal with Beijing.
On Wednesday, a Chinese Communist Party newspaper warned the United States that Beijing was ready to use rare earths - used in high-tech consumer electronics and military equipment - to retaliate on trade.
Taxable money market fund assets increased by $18.95 billion to $2.972 trillion, while tax-free assets decreased by $1.69 billion to $137.58 billion, according to the report, published by iMoneyNet.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day simple yield for taxable money funds slipped to a five-month low at 2.02%. The weighted average maturity among taxable funds shortened to 29 days from 30 days.
The iMoneyNet average seven-day yield for tax-free and municipal funds held at 0.99%, the lowest since late January. The weighted average maturity of tax-free funds remained at 22 days.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 08:25PM ET</span>",Brexit debacle will continue to hinder FTSE 100 after strong 2019: Reuters Poll,"By Helen Reid and Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 will only manage modest gains in the second half of the year as the nation's tortuous exit from the European Union hangs over the market, deterring investors from scooping up attractively cheap shares, a Reuters poll found.
The top stock index will reach 7,499 points by the end of 2019, rising just 3% from current levels, according to the median forecast from a survey of nearly 30 fund managers and analysts taken in the past two weeks.
That would see the FTSE 100 gain 11.5% in total over 2019, higher than predicted in the previous survey, carried out at the end of February during a global stock market rally. That would be the index's best annual performance since 2016.
But a new flare-up in the U.S.-China trade war early this month has dashed investors' hopes of a sustained rebound in markets after a surprisingly strong first quarter.
At the end of last week, the FTSE 100 was up more than 8% since the start of the year, while Europe's STOXX 600 was up about 11%.
A breakdown in trade talks and higher tariffs imposed by the U.S. on some Chinese imports have thrust fears of a global economic slowdown back into the spotlight.
For Britain specifically, a further delay of the Brexit date to Oct. 31 and domestic political turmoil have cast clouds over the country's economic prospects. 
Poll respondents see the FTSE 100 losing steam after this year, estimating the index would reach 7,712 points by mid-2020 and 7,735 points by the end of 2020.
If they're right, 2020 will be a much slower year with the FTSE 100 advancing just 3% as the British economy digests the divorce - if there are no further delays.
""Another postponement of Brexit would likely hurt UK growth and shares,"" said Ireneus Stanislawek, equity strategist at Vontobel Asset Management. ""The quicker Brexit is resolved the better.""
Respondents gave fewer 2020 forecasts for the FTSE 100, reflecting deepening uncertainty over the direction the UK market will take. 
Investors predicted the STOXX 600 would outperform the FTSE 100 this year, rising to 380 points and sealing a 13.1% gain for 2019. 
(Graphic: FTSE predictions link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2IaG5dI).
BREXIT STILL A HIGH-STAKES GAMBLE
Investors have continued to steer clear of UK stocks as Britain narrowly avoided a no-deal Brexit in March and Prime Minister Theresa May ultimately resigned over a failure to create consensus within parliament on a deal with the EU.
The Reuters poll was conducted largely before May announced her resignation. 
""Appetite for the UK is unlikely to reverse anytime soon as the Conservative leadership battle could lead to a harder Brexit stance, but the probability of a 'no deal' has not necessarily increased in our view given unchanged Parliament arithmetic,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau.
Investors repeatedly point out the UK is home to multinationals with resilient earnings, trading at depressed prices because of the Brexit debacle.
The FTSE 100 trades on lower valuations than its European counterpart, at 12.3 times forward 12-month earnings against the STOXX 600's 13.6 times forward 12-month earnings.
The overall market is also cheap compared with world stocks. The FTSE All-Share index was trading at a near 20% discount to the MSCI World in December - its biggest discount since 2009 - and was last at an 18.4% discount.
(Graphic: FTSE discount May 29 link: https://tmsnrt.rs/2I6tl7Z).
""The value likely won't be unlocked until there is some progress on the Brexit negotiations, but that should be a catalyst for international allocators to start putting money back to work which would benefit these stocks enormously,"" said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management. 

Though valuation is cited as a draw by many, investors are still shunning the region, with a net 28 percent of fund managers underweight UK equities according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's May fund manager survey.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 08:22PM ET</span>","European shares seen treading water, but forecast range wide: Reuters Poll","By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares are seen moving sideways until end-2019 and making just modest gains thereafter, a Reuters poll showed, as investors shy away from big bets on a region whose export-oriented economy makes it vulnerable to trade war risks. 
A darkening political outlook following a European Parliament election that made Brexit more complicated and revived concerns about fiscal slippage in Italy is also curbing appetite for equities in Europe, even though earnings show signs of stabilizing. 
Europe's main index ended last week up around 11% so far this year, but it has pulled back from a nine-month peak hit in April before escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing drove investors to dump equities globally.
""It's all about the U.S.-China trade war and Europe is trapped in the middle of it,"" said Stefan de Schutter, portfolio manager at Alpha Trading in Frankfurt.
With visibility over trade and politics low, shares' prospects for coming months are uncertain. 
According to the survey of 29 brokers, fund managers and analysts taken May 20-28, the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark is seen ending the year at 380 points, just 1% above the level it ended last week.
That would be a 12.5% rise for the year, its biggest yearly gain since 2013. Compared with the previous quarterly poll carried out in February, the current forecast is just 9 points above what was indicated then. 
But the forecast range is 100 points wide - from 320 at the lowest estimate to a high of 420. 
""The outlook is somewhat binary,"" said Robert Griffiths, equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in London. 
""If the trade discussions deteriorate, there could be significant further downside and defensive leadership. Should there be de-escalation, then there is scope for equities in Europe to regain momentum thanks to some recovery in domestic growth numbers and improving earnings momentum,"" he added. 
This is the second quarterly poll in a row that has revealed a broad range of forecasts and only modest changes from current levels. That suggests investors are still struggling to interpret the impact of the trade battle between the world's two largest economies and recent mixed economic data. 
Particularly exposed to trade, Europe could suffer from a slowdown in global business activity in the event of greater tariff barriers. 
Among investors with a mid-point forecast for end-2019 and who expect mild gains next year is Tomas Hildebrandt, senior portfolio manager at Evli Bank in Helsinki. 
""The global uncertainties don't speak for overweighting Europe, but positioning seems already to be very careful. This leaves room for positive surprises,"" he said. ""Nevertheless Europe needs to overcome the political issues nagging its outlook. We trust common sense will prevail"". 
European equities have witnessed continued fund outflows and while that indicated a lack of conviction over the bounce seen at the start of the year, it could also help any future rebound gather pace once trade and political clouds clear up. On top of that, a run of downgrades to European companies' profit estimates has slowed, while valuation multiples show a discount relative to the United States. 
By end-2020 the STOXX should rise slightly to 400 points, staying however below its January 2018 peak, while the euro zone blue-chip index is seen at 3,370 and 3,570 points in 2019 and 2020, respectively, according to the poll.
There were fewer estimates for 2020 compared to 2019, possibly reflecting the depth of uncertainty beyond six months. 
(Graphic: STOXX 600 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Wc9RJ1)
GERMANY MOST VULNERABLE 
The only major European index which could post declines at mid-2020 compared to Friday levels is the trade-sensitive German DAX benchmark. The median forecast sees the equity index of Europe's biggest economy, which is particularly sensitive to trade tensions, at 12,000 and 11,900 points by end-2019 and mid-2020, respectively. In Italy, where political worries are heating up, the FTSE MIB is forecast to end 2019 at 20,200 points, below last week's levels. The index should recover in the first half of 2020 to end the year at 21,500 points. 
Among other country benchmarks, France's CAC is seen at 5,439 points by end-2019 and at 5,500 by end-2020, while Spain's IBEX is seen at 9,393 and 9,773 points in the same years, according to the poll.

In Britain, the FTSE 100 will only manage modest gains in the second half as the nation's tortuous exit from the European Union hangs over the market.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 07:35PM ET</span>","Pence, Trudeau to discuss Huawei and China trade issues in Ottawa: official","By Roberta Rampton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will discuss their countries' joint dispute with China over Huawei during a meeting in Ottawa on Thursday, a senior U.S. administration official said.
Pence, known for taking a hard line against China, will travel to the Canadian capital to discuss trade issues, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's largest telecoms network gear maker, which Washington has moved to isolate.
""Canada has been a close ally in the way that they've approached their relationship with China - and there could be some conversation about Huawei,"" the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Washington has accused Huawei of being tied to China's government, and has effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with the company for national security reasons.
The dispute spilled into Canada last year, and Ottawa has expressed frustration at what it sees as a lackluster U.S. response to harsh Chinese measures.
In December, Canada arrested Huawei's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wangzhou on a U.S. warrant. She faces extradition to the United States on charges she conspired to defraud global banks about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran. She and the company have denied the charges.
Shortly after her arrest, Canadian businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were detained in China, and were formally arrested for espionage earlier this month. Canada has called the Canadians' detentions arbitrary.
China has also cut off imports of key Canadian commodities, hurting farmers.
""Expect some very tangible outcomes from their discussion with regard to China that we'll share with you tomorrow,"" a second U.S. official told reporters. The officials declined to say whether Pence would offer Canada assistance on the detentions and the trade stoppages.
Pence also plans to make a separate address in the coming days about the ""current state of affairs"" in China, the officials said.
The speech is seen as a sequel to one Pence gave in October, when he accused China of reckless military actions, cyber attacks and human rights abuses, as well as ""malign"" efforts to undermine Trump's reelection campaign in 2020.
The Huawei issue is the latest trade-related snafu to rock the relationship between the United States and Canada - normally two of the world's closest allies - since President Donald Trump took office.
One of Trump's first actions was to overhaul the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he commonly refers to as one of the worst trade deals ever made.
But now that the three countries have agreed to a replacement, Pence has been traveling around trade-dependent U.S. states to urge its passage through the Congress. He will put the new deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA - front and center during his first trip to Canada as vice president.
The two leaders are also expected to discuss the political crisis in Venezuela. Pence has played a major role in the Trump administration's diplomatic and economic efforts to force out President Nicolas Maduro.
Both Washington and Ottawa have backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, who invoked Venezuela's constitution in January to declare himself interim president, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

The Trump administration has threatened a harder line against Cuba for its support of Maduro, but Trudeau has reached out to Havana to seek its help in settling the political conflict in Venezuela.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 07:34PM ET</span>","U.S. imposes new anti-dumping duties on Chinese mattresses, beer kegs","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it had determined that Chinese-made mattresses and stainless steel beer kegs were being dumped in the U.S. market at less than fair value, and that it would impose preliminary anti-dumping duties.
German and Mexican-made stainless steel kegs are also being hit with new duties, the Commerce Department said.
The U.S. government is imposing duties of up to 79.7% on Chinese-made kegs and up to 1,731% on mattresses. Major U.S. mattress firms had petitioned for relief, including Serta Simmons Bedding LLC, Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) Inc and Tempur Sealy International Inc. American Keg Co had also sought relief.
The duties are 8.6% for German kegs and 18.5% for Mexican kegs. In 2017, imports of refillable stainless steel kegs from China, Germany and Mexico were valued at an $18.1 million, $11.8 million, and $5.7 million respectively, the department said.
Pennsylvania-based American Keg's website says that it is the only U.S. manufacturer of stainless steel kegs. But to meet the demand for a variety of keg sizes and styles, it will ""continue to source and import kegs from abroad while we grow our domestic keg manufacturing capabilities,"" it added.
In 2017, the United States imported $436.5 million in Chinese-made mattresses, the Commerce Department said. The duties cover adult mattresses ranging from twin to California king size and crib or youth mattresses.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection will begin collecting cash deposits from importers of mattresses and beer kegs before final determinations are made by November.

Since the Trump administration took office, the Commerce Department has initiated 168 new anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations, more than twice the number for the comparable period in the previous administration.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 06:30PM ET</span>",Boeing aims for first flight of 777X in late June: sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is looking to make the first test flight of its 777X twin-aisle jet as soon as late June, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, slightly later than the planemaker had planned, but still on track for putting the plane into airline service in 2020. 
Boeing hopes the new jet will extend its grip on the 'mini-jumbo' market, which it shares with rival Airbus SE's 365-seat A350-1000, and perhaps scoop up fresh orders following the demise of Airbus' A380 superjumbo.
The test flight will likely be too late for Boeing to hit its previous target of flying the 777X to the Paris Air Show, which takes place June 17-23, where it had hoped to make a marketing splash in Airbus' backyard. 
Boeing declined to comment on its flight schedule for 777X or its plans for the air show. The company has previously said the 777X would fly for the first time in 2019 and will start to be delivered to airline customers in 2020.
Development of the plane has been slowed by the partial U.S. government shutdown earlier this year and assembly delays on its carbon-composite wings and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's new GE9X engines.
Boeing has also diverted resources from the program and others to focus on getting its grounded 737 MAX back in the air after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
The company had been working toward a first flight as early as June 21, effectively overlapping with the air show in Le Bourget, a few kilometers north of Paris, according to two people familiar with the matter. Both people cautioned that the date should be thought of as a window that could stretch into early July. 
A third person familiar with the matter said late June was Boeing's current target but added the flight could happen in the United States at the same time as the air show.
The first two 777X flight test aircraft have left Boeing's Seattle-area factory and are in integrated system testing on the ground, while the next two flight test airplanes are in final assembly, Boeing's Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told a conference on Wednesday. 

""We still expect to achieve entry into service in 2020,"" Muilenburg said.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 05:29PM ET</span>",Engie tells Brazil court it raised $3 billion for suspended deal,"By Ricardo Brito
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Engie Brasil Energia informed Brazil's Supreme Court that it had already raised $3 billion abroad to buy Petrobras' TAG pipeline unit when the top court suspended the $8.6 billion acquisition last week, according to a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
A consortium led by the subsidiary of French gas and power group Engie had already closed the purchase of Transportadora Associada de Gás, or TAG, from state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA in April and received approval from Brazil's antitrust regulator for the deal. 
Engie told the court its decision had ""created a situation of extreme juridical insecurity"" because it had already begun an operation involving ""significantly"" costly financial resources to buy a 90% stake in TAG.
Supreme Court judge Edson Fachin issued an injunction on Friday suspending some major divestments by Petrobras at the request of an oil workers union.
The full court will debate the injunction on Thursday.

Under the deal agreed with Petrobras, the oil company would retain a 10% stake in TAG, which operates 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) of gas pipelines. Engie and its subsidiary will control 58.5% and Quebec pension fund CDPQ will hold 31.5%.

1449,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2019 05:14PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Uber to Report Debut Earnings
Uber (NYSE:UBER) will issue its first earnings report as a public company after the bell tomorrow, with investors hoping some impressive number to boost the stock out of its malaise. Share performance has disappointed since the ride-sharing company went public earlier this month, sitting 11.2% below its $45-a-share IPO price.
The IPO was another high-profile disappointment following the debut of competitor  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT). Lyft's shares are off 21.9% from their IPO price of $72 a share. Analysts are predicting Uber will report a quarterly loss of 78 cents per share on revenue of about $3.1 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) will also issues results post-market. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.82 per share on sales of about $34.7 billion. The shares are up 18.2% this year.
Before the bell, discount retailers Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) will report earnings.
2. Pending Home Sales Expected to Rise
Housing numbers arrive shortly after the start of trading tomorrow. The National Association of Realtors will release its figures on April pending home sales at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). On average, economists expect that pending home sales rose 0.9% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Before the bell, the Labor Department will release its weekly initial jobless claims numbers. Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are forecast to have edged up to 216,000.
3. U.S. Crude Stockpiles Set to Fall as Driving Season Starts?
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its weekly petroleum report tomorrow with many keen for a change in the narrative as oil price action has been dominated by escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.
Crude oil futures fell 0.6% to $58.81 a barrel today.
China upped the ante in its ongoing trade feud with the U.S., signaling that it could block exports of rare-earth metals, vital commodities used in production across a number of U.S. sectors.
Ahead of the EIA report, the American Petroleum Institute released data estimating crude stockpiles fell by 5.265 million barrels last week. The EIA is expected to report a draw in crude stockpiles of 857,000 barrels for the week ended May 24 that would mark the first weekly draw in three weeks.
U.S. weekly production, which remains at near record highs of 12.2 million barrels a day and has been offsetting OPEC’s ongoing output cuts somewhat, will likely also attract attention."
1450,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Slumps as China's Rare-Earth Threat Buries Shares,"Investing.com - U.S. stocks tumbled Wednesday as the U.S.-China trade war intensified after Beijing signaled it was ready to retaliate against Washington by halting exports of rare-earth metals.
The S&P 500 slumped 0.69%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.79%, and the Dow plunged 0.87%.
China is ""seriously"" mulling a ban on exports of rare-earth exports to the U.S. and may also implement other countermeasures, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a newspaper associated with China's Communist Party, said in a tweet.
A ban on exports of rare-earth metals, 17 vital commodities used in production across a number of U.S. sectors, including oil refining, electronics and the glass industry, will likely trigger a response from Washington and prolong the trade war between the two nations.
Trade-sensitive stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) reflected the jitters on trade, closing lower on the day. Boeing, off 1.7%, trimmed 41 points from the Dow.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, added to losses from a day earlier as oil prices settled modestly lower. Investors weighed the impact on prices of a prolonged trade war against ongoing tensions in the Middle East and OPEC output cuts.
With the prospect of tit-for-tat tariffs between Beijing and Washington on the horizon once again, U.S. government bond yields extended their losses, exacerbating a key inversion - shorter-term rates rising above longer-term rates - in the curve, stoking fears of a recession.
The inverse spread between the 3-Month and 10-Year Treasury yields, the most important part of the yield curve, is at its widest since the financial crisis.
If there was any good news out of the day's declines it was that, at the close, the indexes had reclaimed nearly half of their losses at their worst levels. Still, the indexes' declines were their fourth in five days. The Dow is off 6.2% so far in May with the S&P 500 down 5.5% and the Nasdaq down 6.8%.
The FAANG stocks (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix and Google) also swung out of favor, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leading the decline, dragging broader tech deeper into the red, as investors reined in their bullish bets on growth stocks.
Consumer discretionaries were also under pressure amid a decline in retailers, led by 31% slump in Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) after the outdoor apparel company delivered mixed earnings and downbeat guidance.
In other company news, Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) surged 12% on a Bloomberg report that the chipmaker will explore a potential sale after attracting suitors.
The political front also soured sentiment on risk assets after Special Counsel Robert Mueller, summarizing the findings of the report into Russian interference into the 2016 U.S. election, said that ""if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" That prompted calls from Democrats to impeach President Donald Trump.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Helmerich and Payne (NYSE:HP),  CenturyLink  (NYSE:CTL) and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), L Brands (NYSE:LB) and PVH (NYSE:PVH) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."
1451,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",Cboe wins dismissal of Wall Street 'fear gauge' manipulation lawsuit,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit in which investors accused the parent of the Chicago Board Options Exchange of letting anonymous traders rig Wall Street's main gauge of future stock market volatility at their expense.
U.S. District Judge Manish Shah in Chicago said investors in the proposed class action failed to show that Cboe Global Markets Inc intended to defraud them by allowing manipulation of options and futures tied to the VIX, known as the U.S. stock market's ""fear gauge.""
""Though Cboe may have designed a process with features that made it vulnerable to manipulation,"" the investors did not show that it ""knew about these flaws at the time it designed the VIX enterprise or that it purposefully designed the market to facilitate manipulation,"" Shah wrote in a 32-page decision.
Lawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cboe's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The VIX, short for Cboe Volatility Index, measures expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks based on Standard & Poor's 500 options, and often rises when stock prices fall.
Investors had accused Cboe in the lawsuit of knowing for years about systemic manipulation of VIX products but doing nothing in an effort to boost profit and market share.
Cboe called the lawsuit an ""unprecedented attempt"" to hold a regulator liable based on speculation it allowed manipulation ""by unidentified persons on unspecified occasions, leading to unspecified losses by unspecified market participants.""
The VIX became a focus for investors in February 2018 when the prices of two products tied to it plunged more than 80 percent, and an anonymous whistleblower alleged manipulation in letters to U.S. financial regulators.
Shah dismissed the investors' claims under federal antitrust, securities and commodity exchange laws without prejudice, meaning they can be brought again.
He dismissed a negligence claim with prejudice because federal law pre-empted it.
The case is In re Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index Manipulation Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 18-04171.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. stocks fall as trade concerns spark growth fears,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing just above key support levels, as worries that a lengthy U.S.-China trade war would crimp global growth pushed investors into the safety of government bonds.
Trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world showed little signs of relaxing as Chinese newspapers warned that Beijing could use rare earth elements to strike back after President Donald Trump remarked on Monday that he was ""not yet ready"" to make a deal with China over trade. Rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements used in everything from high-tech consumer electronics to military equipment. 
Adding to worries, China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government late on Tuesday in its latest bid to fight sanctions from Washington. 
""It is trade and the effect of trade. The problem is right now it is what I call an 'unquantifiable potential outcome' - so nobody really knows what is going to happen,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
""All we know is there is increasingly heated rhetoric regarding trade and if we are not careful we end up in a trade war that will definitely slow economic growth and possibly push us into recession,"" he added. 
Each of the major U.S. indexes suffered their fourth decline in five sessions. The S&P is down 5.5% from its April 30 closing high. However, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq managed to close just above their 200-day moving averages, seen as a key level of support.
The uncertainty in markets has pressured investors to dump equities and seek safety in U.S. government debt, which has led to an inversion of the yield curve between 3-month bills and 10-year Treasury notes, a precursor to a possible recession. Benchmark U.S. 10-year note yields touched a low of 2.21%, the lowest since September 2017. 
Federal funds futures indicated that traders saw a nearly 58% chance the U.S. central bank would lower policy rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, compared with a 50% likelihood late on Tuesday.
Each of the 11 major S&P sectors were in negative territory, with utilities the worst performer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 221.36 points, or 0.87%, to 25,126.41, the S&P 500 lost 19.37 points, or 0.69%, to 2,783.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 60.04 points, or 0.79%, to 7,547.31.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its lowest level since Feb. 11, while the S&P and Nasdaq ended the session at their lowest closing levels in nearly three months. 
The benchmark S&P index briefly fell below its 200-day moving average, a key indicator of long-term momentum during the session.
Among other stocks, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) dropped 4.19% after a lawsuit that accused the drugmaker of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic entered its second day of trial, pulling healthcare stocks down 1.20%. 
Capri Holdings Ltd plunged 9.85% as the worst- performing S&P 500 component after the Michael Kors fashion business owner issued a disappointing first-quarter profit forecast as it spends more on marketing.
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) dropped 5.56% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the cereal maker's stock to ""sell."" 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 40 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 213 new lows. 

About 7.31 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.04 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

""While our demand is strong, we have a lot of vehicle deliveries to catch up to in order to have a successful quarter,"" Musk wrote in the mail.
""Per my earlier email, if we execute well, Q2 will be an all-time record for Tesla vehicle deliveries and an awesome victory!!""
Tesla was on course to deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year, Musk said in an internal email last week.
The company, which has struggled to keep up with Musk's delivery promises, had on average produced 900 Model 3 cars per day last week, according to last week's email, bringing it closer to a target of 7,000 per week. 
Musk in the latest email said he will start holding calls with Tesla's delivery teams around the world every two days in order to know ""what's needed to accelerate our rate of deliveries.""
Demand for Tesla's Model 3 sedan and other cars has moved to the top of investors' list of worries after the company reported slack first-quarter demand against a backdrop of U.S.-China trade tensions. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
News website Electrek had earlier reported about Musk's leaked email to the employees. 
Tesla's shares closed up nearly 1% at $189.86.

Leonardo, a major Italian defense group, bought DRS Technologies in 2008 and last year said it was not yielding adequate returns. The United States represents about 28% of Leonardo's total sales.
""It (DRS) is growing significantly, mainly thanks to the fact that the defense budget is growing,"" Profumo said in an interview on the sidelines of a security and defense conference in Ottawa.
""We are going at a faster pace than the defense budget and we are winning a huge number of small and medium programs so we are very diversified,"" he said.
By end-2022 Leonardo is aiming for close to a double digit compound growth rate for DRS and a double digit return on sales.
""Today we are close to 7% and we want to go up at least to 10% in terms of return on sales,"" said Profumo.
Leonardo is also diversifying into services and by the end of 2022 wants 25% of total revenues to come from that sector, up from the current level of between 18% and 19%.

Profumo said he was ""pretty confident"" Leonardo could meet the 25% target.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 02:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canada told drugmakers it would limit scope of some new price rules,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian government has assured the pharmaceutical industry that new features of its plan to cut drug costs would apply only to new medicines, Health Canada said, offering some relief to drugmakers even as other regulations could still lower prices of medicines already on the market.
Drugmakers have argued that new regulations should only apply to newly approved drugs. The Health Canada clarification comes after draft rules published in 2017 sowed confusion over how the government would implement its plan.
The new features of the government's proposed regulations, which would take into account cost-effectiveness of medicines and their likely impact on government budgets, would be limited to new drugs, Health Canada told Innovative Medicines Canada (IMC) and BIOTECanada, the patented drug industry's main lobby groups, in a letter dated April 8, 2019.
It added that other parts of the same draft regulation, changing the list of countries Canadian officials use as a basis for comparison when setting maximum prices, would apply to all drugs. 
Health Canada described the contents of the letter in response to questions, but Reuters has not seen the letter.
Canada, like governments around the world, is grappling with the rising cost of drugs, particularly expensive new specialty medicines for cancer and rare diseases. A new national prescription drug program is one of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's key promises ahead of an October federal election, making tackling prices a priority. 
""The overall intent of the regulatory proposal is prospective application to new drugs,"" Health Canada said in a statement. ""There is some scope for this information to affect the prices of drugs already in the marketplace,"" it added.
The department acknowledged that as originally written, the draft regulation would have involved all prescription drugs, new and old, but said that is not its intention.
Global drugmakers have campaigned against the Canadian plan, which would change the way a little-known federal agency called the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board decides whether high drug prices are legal. Canada's patented drug prices are among the highest in the world.
PLAN DELAYED
The regulations, originally expected to go into effect in January, were delayed so the government could spend more time reviewing comments. The plan could still be softened or even scrapped. But earlier this month, Minister of Health Ginette Petitpas Taylor said final regulations would be ready soon.
IMC, whose members include Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and others, was not satisfied by assurances in the letter.
""We remain concerned that changes to the group of comparator countries and other aspects of the amendments may be applied to both new and existing products,"" the organization said in a statement. Applying any new rules to already marketed drugs would create ""significant uncertainty"" for companies whose business planning is based on existing prices, it added.
The industry has said it believes the reforms duplicate processes that already exist, and could hurt Canadians' access to new drugs as well as spending on research and development.
""We remain committed to working with the government to find alternative solutions that balance the need for more affordable medicines with a competitive regulatory environment for health research,"" IMC said.
Health Canada described the letter as ""re-confirming"" details it had stated publicly before. Asked where those details had been disclosed, a spokesman pointed to a cost-benefit analysis cited in the 2017 draft regulations, and an expert review of that analysis that was not made public until Reuters reported on it in February.
Patented drug sales in Canada were C$16.8 billion ($12.4 billion) in 2017, according to government data.
The original cost-benefit analysis estimated the new regulations would cost drugmakers C$8.6 billion ($6.4 billion) over 10 years. As an alternative to the proposed changes, drugmakers offered to voluntarily give up C$8.6 billion in revenue over the same period, Reuters reported in February.
Exactly how much the new rules will reduce prices depends on implementation details that have not yet been decided.
Lower prices in Canada could have a ripple effect on drugmakers' most lucrative market - the United States - given recent proposals there to lower medical costs for U.S. consumers. 
The United States is mulling basing drug prices paid under its government Medicare health program on the cost of medicines in other countries, including Canada. And some U.S. lawmakers and states are looking into allowing importation of less expensive prescription drugs from Canada.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors jumped back in to the U.S. stock market for the first time since mid-April by sending roughly $3.7 billion into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that hold domestic equities last week, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. 
The net inflows into U.S. stock funds ended a four-week retreat from the domestic equity market that pulled a net total of roughly $32 billion out of the category. For the year to date, investors have taken a net of $35.8 billion out of funds that hold U.S. stocks. 
The move back into U.S. stocks came as benchmark stock indexes have fallen from record highs due to lingering concerns that the trade war between the United States and China could dampen global economic growth. For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 10.5 percent, after rising as much as 15 percent for the year in early May. 
Taxable and municipal bond funds continued to swell, adding another roughly $4.6 billion in net assets. Bond funds have notched positive inflows every full week of the year to date, adding a net total of nearly $173 billion over that time. 

World stock funds, meanwhile, added a net of $105 million, following a $1.8 billion net outflow the week before.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Wednesday the bank's board of directors had elected former Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executive Charles Noski to join the board. 
Noski's appointment, effective on June 1, expands the board to 13 seats. He will serve on its audit and examination committee. 
Wells Fargo's board has been shuffled many times since the bank became mired in scandal roughly 2-1/2 years ago. More than half of the company's independent directors joined the board after 2016. 
Noski joined Bank of America in 2010 as chief financial officer while the bank was still trying to turn itself around and recover from the financial crisis. He retired in 2012 after helping the bank change its mortgage lending business model.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>",Boeing surprised Canada changed rules of jet competition to allow Lockheed Martin bid,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is surprised Canada softened the rules of a competition for new fighters to allow  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) to submit a bid, but is still confident it has a chance, a top executive said on Wednesday.
Following a U.S. complaint, Ottawa this month said it planned to drop a clause stipulating that bidders in the multibillion dollar race to supply 88 jets must offer a legally binding guarantee to give Canadian businesses 100% of the value of the deal in economic benefits.
The original clause would have excluded Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, the plane the Canadian air force wants. The contract is worth between C$15 billion and C$19 billion ($11.1 billion to $14.1 billion).
""I was surprised by the recommended change ... why would you deviate from a policy that's been so successful to accommodate a competitor?"" said Jim Barnes, the Boeing official in charge of trying to sell the company's F-18 Super Hornet jet to Canada.
The change in the rules around economic benefits was the latest wrinkle in a decade-long troubled-plagued effort to replace Canada's CF-18 jets, some of which are 40 years old.
The final list of requirements for the new fleet of jets is due to be issued in July.
""Right now we feel like we can put a very compelling offer on the table even with this change,"" Barnes told reporters on the margins of a defense and security conference in Ottawa.
Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains - in overall charge of the benefits aspect of procurement - said in response to Barnes's comment that Ottawa would ensure the competition was fair.
Compelling bidders to offer watertight guarantees of economic benefits contradicts rules of the consortium that developed the F-35, a group to which Canada belongs.
Boeing is offering a binding commitment and Barnes said the firm would stress to Canadian officials the potential economic disadvantages of entertaining a non-binding bid.
An official from Sweden's Saab AB, another contender, told reporters that Canadians could lose out by ignoring contenders that had made firm investment commitments. 
""I am concerned that the ability to respond to a non-binding environment may not necessarily give Canadians the best value at the end of the day,"" said Patrick Palmer, head of sales and marketing for Saab Canada.

Airbus SE, the fourth firm in the race, declined to comment.

MARANELLO, Italy (Reuters) - Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) presented a luxury car with a difference on Wednesday -- a hybrid model that can cruise silently through city streets on electric power as well as hitting a top speed of 340 km per hour.
Fitted with a 1,000 horsepower engine developed from Formula One, the new 4WD SF90 Stradale hybrid sports car was proudly displayed at the company's historic base in Maranello, near Modena, in northern Italy.
Chief Executive Louis Camilleri described the new car as ""astounding, fast and completely revolutionary"".
As well as offering the traditional thrill of high speed and performance, the new car permits 25 km of electric-only power, allowing drivers to leave home quietly and pass through city centers free of noise or dirty emissions.
""It will be silent, we don't want to hide that this car can run electric too,"" Chief Technology Officer Michael Leiters said.
Smartphones of the 130 journalists attending the launch were taken away to prevent unauthorized photos of the new model leaking out.
Ferrari has already made one hybrid model -- the limited series LaFerrari -- but the SF90 Stradale will be its first to be more widely produced.
The unveiling comes in the same week that former Ferrari parent Fiat Chrysler pitched a merger deal with French peer  Renault  (PA:RENA) in part to catch up in electric vehicles.
Ferrari was spun off from Fiat Chrysler and listed separately. The two companies share the same top shareholder, the Agnelli family's Exor holding.
Hybrid power units where introduced into Formula One racing in 2014, helping to facilitate the transfer of technology to Ferrari road cars.
About 2,000 selected customers from all over the world have been invited to Ferrari between Wednesday evening and Friday to view and reserve the new car, which will be delivered within 12 months. Its price will be announced this week.
Other buyers will have to wait more than a year. Ferrari sells over 65% of its cars to clients who already own one.
There is also an emerging new breed of premium or high-performance electric sports cars. These so-called supercars include Tesla's upcoming Roadster Founder Series, which will sell for over $200,000 and the Rimac Concept Two, priced in the region of $2 million.
Ferrari said last year it planned 15 new models, including hybrids, a utility vehicle and special editions, in its drive to hit mid-term earnings target.

1463,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2019 01:40PM ET</span>",Israeli Cannabis Company Breath of Life to Launch Toronto IPO,"Investing.com - Cannabis companies continue to flock to the Toronto Stock Exchange, including an Israeli grower looking to export to many parts around the globe.
Last week, Breath of Life International became the first Israeli marijuana cultivator to apply to launch an initial public offering with the TSE.
The company, which is commonly known as BOL Pharma, grows medical cannabis and produces cannabinoid products that are supplied to patients and pharmacies in Israel. It is aiming to produce for export markets in Europe, Canada and Australia. It is focused on becoming a global leader in pharmaceutical drugs intended to address “unmet medical needs of patients in therapeutic areas, including central nervous system disorders, pain and palliative care management, and inflammation and autoimmune disorders,” the company said in a statement.
The marijuana company is working with researchers in Israel and has several products currently under development.
BOL Pharma has 377,000 square feet of greenhouse space and manufacturing operations in Revadim, Israel. It is also expanding existing operations in Portugal.
Another Israeli cannabis company, Kalytera Therapeutics (TSXV:KLY), is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.
In a separate announcement, the large American hemp company Charlotte's Web Holdings (CSE:CWEB) has announced it will be moving to Canada’s largest stock exchange at the end of trading tomorrow.
The manufacturer of hemp-based cannabidiol, or CBD, wellness products will graduate to the TSE from the Canadian Securities Exchange, where its shares are currently traded.
This move comes in the wake of the recent federal legalization of hemp production in the United States. The TMX Group, which operates the TSX and the TSX Ventures exchange, restricts companies from listing on the exchange where cannabis and cannabis-related production is federally restricted. The passage last December of the U.S. Farm Bill, which legalized hemp production in the U.S., removed that hurdle.
Charlotte’s Web will be simultaneously delisted from the CSE at the end of trade tomorrow.
The company, which is headquartered in Boulder, Colo., issued its first-quarter earnings yesterday, reporting a 66% jump in revenues to US$21.7 million, compared with US$13.1 million the same quarter last year.
Net revenues for the quarter were US$2.3 million, down from US$3.1 million in the same period the previous year.
Shares of Charlotte’s Web were trading down Wednesday morning in both Canada and the U.S. amid a broader market slump."

The cash registers at retailers are not ringing to the beat of a seemingly strong consumer. And efforts to ride the e-commerce wave to offset the ongoing malaise in brick-and-mortar retail have come up short.
That's the message from a host of apparel companies, including Canada Goose and Capri Holdings, both of which are sharply lower after delivering a downbeat outlook.
Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) delivered a mixed fiscal fourth-quarter report with earnings of C$0.08 a share beating consensus from analysts polled by Refinitiv, but revenue of C$156.2 million fell short of estimates for C$159.2 million.
Worryingly, the company's full-year outlook also undershot expectations, anticipating revenue growth of at least 20% and adjusted earnings per share growth of at least 25%. Its shares tumbled nearly 30%.
Clothing company Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) delivered an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines, but its below-consensus guidance was punished, sending its shares more than 11% lower before rebounding slightly.
The company reported earnings of $0.63 on revenue of $1.34 billion, beating estimates from Investing.com for earnings of $0.61 a share on revenue of$1.33 billion.
For the first quarter, Capri Holdings guided total revenue of about $1.36 billion and earnings of $0.85 to $0.90 a share, short of analysts' estimates for revenue of $1.44 billion and earnings of $1.23 a share.
The weaker outlook from the duo of sent shockwaves throughout retailers, with  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) falling 5% ahead of its quarterly results due June 5. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) fell 2.5%."
1465,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",Fraught Franco-Italian relations a roadblock risk for Renault-FCA,"By Richard Lough and Giuseppe Fonte
PARIS/ROME (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler's proposed $35 billion merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA) has cheered investors, won conditional support from Paris and Rome and even earned cautious backing from trade unions.
Beneath this veneer, however, the bold attempt to create the world's third largest carmaker risks becoming rapidly embroiled in the fraught relationship between France's europhile President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's euroskeptic leaders.
For while Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini hailed the proposal as a ""brilliant operation"", Italy's creaking, state-subsidized Fiat factories are likely to bear the brunt of any production-related cost savings.
FCA and Renault said this week that more than 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of annual savings would come mainly from combining platforms, consolidating powertrain and electrification investments and the benefits of increased scale.
Salvini and France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who called the deal a ""good opportunity"" to build a European industrial champion able to compete with China and the United States, have both said they want guarantees on local jobs.
""It's not every day that I agree with Salvini,"" said Le Maire, whose government appears to hold the trump cards.
When it comes to where any job cuts fall, France will be helped by its existing 15 percent holding in Renault, whose superior efficiency at its five French plants makes it better placed to handle a supply glut, the demise of the petrol engine and the investments needed for electric and autonomous vehicles.
""It will take many, many years to find real savings and ugly political and operational realities can often swamp the potential of such new entities,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said of the FCA-Renault plan to rival Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
ADVANTAGE FRANCE?
As well as Italy's government having to cope with the aftermath of European elections which coincided with news of the FCA-Renault plans, political leaders in Rome were only informed shortly before the deal was made public, an FCA source said.
This contrasted with the way the French government was treated, with Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann, a fluent French speaker, letting it know of his merger proposal to Renault weeks ago, a French government official said. 
It is not clear how advanced the secret talks between the automakers were at this stage or what opportunity Le Maire had to lay down any red lines, but it reflects FCA's need to have President Emmanuel Macron on side.
And it gave France time to prepare its position, with Le Maire on Tuesday laying out four conditions for state approval, including protection of French blue-collar jobs.
Meanwhile, Italy's Salvini said Rome might buy a stake the new entity to defend domestic interests.
Corporate France has been the biggest overseas investor in Italian companies over the past decade with deals totaling $43.3 billion, Refinitiv data shows.
Some are closely scrutinized by Rome, which is fretting over the vulnerability of corporate champions such as  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT), in which Italian state lender CDP took a direct holding after  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) took a controlling stake.
Under the FCA proposal, Elkann, scion of the Agnelli family, would chair the merged group while Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard would likely become CEO, sources say.
'ECONOMIC FANTASY'? 
While Le Maire has appeared well briefed, Italy's leaders seemed blindsided and Salvini's suggestion that Italy could mirror France's stake signaled concerns over Rome's influence. 
With cash-strapped Italy locked in a renewed row with Brussels over euro zone budget rules, some French officials dismissed talk of an Italian stake as a bluff, with one describing it as ""economic fantasy"".
There are signs the effort to save jobs will focus on the factory floor. Le Maire is demanding that no ""industrial jobs or industrial plants"" are axed in France, leaving scope for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as downsizing plants.
Indeed, the merger plan dovetails with Macron's push for cross-border industrial champions that have the muscle to compete with Chinese and U.S. rivals of today and the future. 
Le Maire urged trade unions to look at job creation potential in a company with the financial clout to be a global player in electric battery and self-driving car technology.
Macron has stared down unions before, including over the proposed Franco-German merger of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and Siemens rail businesses, which was derailed by antitrust concerns. 
Even so, it is unclear how realistic the demands for blue-collar job protection are, with ""substantial product and platform overlap in Europe"", UBS analyst David Lense said.
Renault has improved the competitiveness of its French plants, shedding 8,000 jobs via voluntary departures since 2013 and paring back production lines to curb excess capacity. 
It employs 48,000 people in France, with its plants operating at about 70 percent capacity, while Fiat's six plants in Italy struggle. 
Turin's historic Mirafiori plant, which makes the Maserati Levante SUV, is expected to operate at just 5 percent capacity this year. Only two plants producing between them the Fiat Panda, Fiat 500 X and the popular Jeep Renegade top 50 percent capacity, research group LMC Automotive said. 
Higher carbon dioxide emissions may also focus attention on FCA's plants as the combined company looks to tackle tightening emissions regulations and far-reaching technological changes.

""These challenges are potentially big push backs and are bigger issues for FCA than for Renault, which doesn't need to restructure in France and which has much lower CO2 emissions,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said in a note.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>",Italy's top court acquits ex Monte Paschi executives in derivative case,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Supreme Court acquitted three former managers at bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena who had been accused of misleading authorities in relation to a 2009 derivative trade that prosecutors said was used to conceal losses.
The Tuscan bank was bailed out by the state in 2017 under an 8 billion euro rescue plan which handed Rome 68 percent of the world's oldest lender.
Former chairman Giuseppe Mussari, ex-chief executive Antonio Vigni and one-time finance boss Gianluca Baldassari had already been acquitted by a court of appeal in December 2017. That verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court on Wednesday, whose decision cannot be appealed.
The first-grade ruling by a court in Siena, home town of Italy's fourth-biggest lender, in October 2014 had called for jail terms of three years and six months for each of the men, for allegedly hiding a document relating to the transaction with Japanese bank Nomura.
Defense lawyers have said that regulators had access to all the necessary information to understand the scope of the operation.
A separate, higher-profile trial against the same defendants and former employees at Nomura and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) for alleged false accounting, market manipulation and misleading regulators is ongoing in Milan.

Shell's vice president for taxation Alan McLean made the promise at a hearing on taxation of multinationals called by parliament after reports emerged last year that Shell does not pay any corporate tax in the Netherlands, despite being headquartered in The Hague.
Ahead of Wednesday's panel, Shell disclosed that it does not pay Dutch corporate taxes apart from at its NAM gas subsidiary, a joint venture with Exxon (NYSE:XOM).
Worldwide, Shell reported it paid $10 billion in corporate tax in 2018 and that it had an effective tax rate of 33 percent.
However, in the relatively small Dutch market it was able to use deductions on loss-making operations elsewhere to reduce its corporate tax bill to zero.
""When there's a loss there's no profit tax to be paid, so the arithmetic is simple,"" Alan McLean told skeptical lawmakers.
""I understand that for many people... being seen to make profits here in the Netherlands and not having any profit to pay tax on can be odd.""
Among other Dutch multinationals, healthcare company Philips confirmed at Wednesday's hearing that it did not pay any Dutch taxes in 2018, though it said it expects to pay around 100 million euros a year starting in 2021. 
Paint maker Akzo Nobel, which also attended the hearing, did not disclose what portion of the 118 million euros in tax payments it made in 2018 went to the Netherlands.
 Unilever  (LON:ULVR), which did not attend the hearing, routinely discloses its per-country taxation. It paid 2.29 billion euros in corporate tax in 2018, including 30 million euros in the Netherlands. 
Asked by a lawmaker whether he thought it was moral that Shell paid no Dutch corporate tax, McLean said morality was ""a very difficult word"". 
""We understand at Shell that we have to have the support of the communities in which we operate,"" he said. 
""I think we also understand at Shell that some of the support that we've had from the broader Dutch community has diminished over time, and we're working hard to rebuild that.""

He said the company adheres to the letter of tax rules in all jurisdictions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan sees no major downside to partnering with a combined  Renault  and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), it said on Wednesday in a lukewarm endorsement of the proposed $35 billion tie-up, which would complicate an already uneasy alliance.
The leaders of Nissan Motor Co, France's Renault SA (PA:RENA) and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp gathered at Nissan's headquarters in Yokohama for a scheduled alliance meeting which was overshadowed by FCA's proposal this week for a merger-of-equals with Renault.
Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard arrived in Japan on Tuesday to discuss with Nissan the FCA-led proposal to create the world's third-largest automaker. The plan raises difficult questions about how Nissan, which is 43.4% owned by the French automaker, would fit into a radically changed alliance.
""Overall, we don't see any particularly negative aspect"" to the planned merger, which was for Renault and FCA to decide, Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa told reporters on Wednesday.
The alliance members confirmed in a statement that they had ""an open and transparent discussion"" on the proposed deal, which looks designed to tackle the costs technological and regulatory changes, including a shift to electric vehicles.
Nissan, which has rebuffed overtures by Renault for a merger despite a 20-year alliance, was blindsided by the talks, sources have told Reuters, stoking concerns that a deal with FCA could weaken Nissan's relations with its French partner.
But Mitsubishi Chairman Osamu Masuko said the Japanese partners had not been left in the dark - even as he acknowledged that he was only directly told by Renault for the first time on Wednesday, two days after the deal was announced.
The tie-up also poses an additional challenge for Nissan's Saikawa, who is grappling with poor financial performance and an uneasy relationship with Renault after Nissan led the ousting last year of long-standing alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn.
There have long been tensions over the imbalance of power in their alliance with Nissan, the bigger company, holding a 15% non-voting stake in Renault.

Credit ratings agency Moody's said it was vital for Nissan to stabilize its partnership with Renault to expand operational synergies and improve margins.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>","Outside of Tesla, future EV sales in U.S. may be thin for most brands: study","By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - U.S. demand for electric vehicles, including hybrids, could rise to 1.28 million by 2026, a new study projected on Wednesday, but most brands will struggle to make money on the new models.
Research firm IHS Markit forecasts that more than 130 models in the U.S. market, from 43 brands, will offer electrified propulsion systems, either pure battery electric or hybrid gasoline-electric.
But two-thirds of those sales will be registered by the top 10 brands, dominated by segment leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) which will take up more than a quarter of those sales, according to IHS automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley.
The remaining brands will account for an estimated 392,000 units, an average of just 11,900 cars per brand, she said. 
""In the near-term, EV competition will be extremely high,"" Brinley said. ""Increased choice and availability will drive sales growth, but the number of vehicle introductions is initially outpacing demand for the electric propulsion option.""
The market for EVs is growing fast, IHS Markit projected. 
In 2026, 48 brands will sell a total of 16.8 million vehicles (including EVs), which works out to an average of 350,000 sales per brand in the overall market. 
Pure electric and hybrid vehicles will account for 7.6% of those sales, compared with only 1.2% in 2018.
Tesla was the No. 20 brand in overall U.S. sales last year, according to trade publication Automotive News. But new competition is coming from a gaggle of global automakers, notably Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Tesla, which delivered 240,000 EVs to global customers last year and expects to sell 360,000 to 400,000 this year, will continue to dominate the market in 2026, IHS Markit predicts, with average sales of other brands at about 25,000 units each.
But even Tesla has struggled to make money for most of its nine years as a public company. It reported a first-quarter loss of more than $700 million on sales of 63,000 vehicles. Shares were down at $188.10 in mid-day trade Wednesday.
Much of the industry's planned $300 billion investment in electric vehicles and batteries over the next decade is targeted at China, which is projecting EV and plug-in hybrid sales in 2025 of at least 5 million, or up to 20% of total vehicle sales.

The structure of the EV market in the United States is not unlike the broader market, just on a smaller scale. Last year, the top 10 brands in the United States accounted for nearly three-quarters of the 17.3 million vehicles sold, according to Automotive News.

(Reuters) - The father of a university football player who died of a drug overdose provided emotional testimony about the personal cost of the nationwide opioid epidemic on Wednesday during the second day of trial in a lawsuit by the state of Oklahoma accusing drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) of fueling the crisis.
The testimony in a state court in Norman, Oklahoma, came during the first trial to result from more than 2,000 similar lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers nationally seeking to hold them responsible for the opioid abuse crisis.
Those cases by state and local governments seek to hold the companies responsible for a drug abuse epidemic that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says led to a record 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017.
Craig Box, an Oklahoma attorney, testified that he never suspected his son Austin was abusing prescription painkillers until after he was discovered unconscious at a friend's house in 2011 and was taken to a hospital.
Holding back tears, Box said he only learned after the death of the 22-year-old University of Oklahoma linebacker, who had a herniated disk the year before, that his son had once been prescribed opioids and must have turned to the streets to get more.
""We had no idea about the prevalence of these drugs and the dangers of these drugs,"" he said during testimony streamed online by Courtroom View Network.
Box was called as a witness to support claims by Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter that J&J helped cause the epidemic by marketing opioids as safe and effective for everyday pain while downplaying their addictive qualities.
Hunter alleges that deceptive marketing campaigns carried out by J&J, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, led to an oversupply of addictive painkillers in the state.
Oklahoma resolved its claims against Purdue in March for $270 million and against Teva on Sunday for $85 million, leaving J&J as the only defendant in the nonjury trial before Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman.
J&J denies wrongdoing, arguing that its marketing efforts were proper and that the state cannot prove it caused the opioid epidemic given the role doctors, patients, pharmacists and drug dealers played.

The state claims that J&J's actions created an oversupply of painkillers and a public nuisance that will cost $12.7 billion to $17.5 billion to remedy over the next 20 to 30 years.

New York (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has ordered seven U.S. stock exchanges to face proposed class-action claims that they defrauded ordinary investors by quietly enabling high-frequency traders to trade faster and at better prices.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman on Tuesday said claims against BATS Global Markets, Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and other defendants had ""nudged themselves across the line from conceivable to plausible"" and should not be dismissed.
Furman had dismissed the claims in 2015, saying the exchanges were absolutely immune from liability, but a federal appeals court overturned that finding in December 2017.
The exchanges were accused of violating federal securities law by developing and selling high-priced services to provide advantages to favored high-frequency trading customers, while concealing these services from ordinary investors.
High-frequency traders were allegedly afforded access to enhanced data feeds, a greater ability to process complex orders, and permission to locate their servers near the exchanges' own servers so trading signals would be sent faster.
Investors claimed they lost money as a result of the exchanges' manipulative conduct.
""A manipulation complaint must plead with particularity the nature, purpose, and effect of the fraudulent conduct and the roles of the defendants,"" Furman wrote. ""Plaintiffs' complaint ... does just that.""
The investors were led by the city of Providence, Rhode Island, pension plans for the city of Boston and the Virgin Islands, and the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, court papers show.
Lawyers for the exchanges did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. The investors' lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX is unlikely to return to service before August, the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday, adding that the final say on the timing rested with regulators.
The 737 MAX was grounded globally in March after a crash in Ethiopia killed all 157 people on board, the model's second deadly crash in five months.
""We do not expect something before 10 to 12 weeks in re-entry into service,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters in Seoul. ""But it is not our hands. That is in the hands of regulators.""
IATA plans to organize a summit with airlines, regulators and Boeing in 5 to 7 weeks to discuss what is needed for the 737 MAX to return to service, he said.
The airline industry has had a tough six months with fuel, labor and infrastructure costs increasing and trade tensions rising in addition to the 737 MAX grounding, de Juniac said.
IATA's December forecast for $35.5 billion in industry profits in 2019 is expected to be lowered in an update at its annual meeting in Seoul on June 2.
At an IATA meeting for 737 MAX operators in Montreal last week, airline members said they wanted regulators to cooperate closely on the decision for the plane's re-entry to service, de Juniac said. 
""We hope that they will align their timeframe,"" he said of regulators.
Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday reiterated the planemaker was focused on safely returning the MAX aircraft to service.
Speaking at a Bernstein conference in New York, Muilenburg said the company continues to expect to ramp up its long-term production rate to 57 a month after cutting monthly output to 42 planes in response to the groundings.
""We're making clear and steady progress, and that includes the work that we're doing on the airplane update, the software update, working through the certification process with the FAA,"" he said.
Sources have told Reuters that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expects to approve the jet's return to service as soon as late June.

U.S. operators United Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and American Airlines have removed the planes from their flight schedules until early to mid August.

1487,By Business Insider,"<span>May 29, 2019 09:32AM ET</span>","A senior partner at Baillie Gifford shares what Tesla, Amazon, and the firm's other wildly successful investments have in common — and how it identifies them early on","Name any large, hyper-growth company that erupted during the past decade, and chances are that Baillie Gifford is invested in it.
From Facebook to Amazon, Tesla,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), the $292 billion investor has its tentacles in companies that have delivered the goods for those who got in early and stuck with them through thick and thin. 
This slate of successful companies wasn't assembled randomly. And in an interview with Business Insider, Andrew Telfer, a joint senior partner at Baillie Gifford, discussed the traits that tie them all together.
These companies tend to have ""visionary founders,"" Telfer said, from the likes of Tesla's Elon Musk to Alibaba's Jack Ma. 
Besides their own visions, founders are usually better positioned to serve their companies if they have the right support network around them, he added.
Baillie Gifford often steps in to provide a support system, with a view to helping management teams focus on the long term. 
""It's remarkable how unusual that is when the job of capital markets is to provide long-term capital, to encourage businesses to grow,"" Telfer said during a exclusive interview with Business Insider.
Read more: MORGAN STANLEY: These 15 large companies are most likely to get acquired within the next 12 months
Another trait that Telfer sees across many of Baillie Gifford's most successful investments is that they use technology to disrupt big pools of profits.
""It's been a good 10-year run, but we still see changes and disruption,"" Telfer said. 
From a geographical perspective, he said west-coast US and east-coast China were the obvious clusters where the next big ideas are being generated. 
Stuart Dunbar, a partner at Baillie Gifford, previously told Business Insider that the firm was investing in health innovation through Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and artificial vision through ASML.
To arrive at such decisions, Baillie Gifford engages the founders of prospective investments about their company culture — something the 111-year-old firm is internally adamant about handing off from generation to generation. Telfer recalled meeting with a founder who, in the thick of an initial public offering roadshow, said Baillie Gifford was the first firm to ask about their company's culture. 
""We spent much more time talking about the long-term strategy, talking about capital allocation, plans for the future, R&D — rather than what's next year's earnings going to be and how much is revenue going to grow by,"" Telfer said.
These conversations then inform whether Baillie Gifford decides to invest. 
The firm's long-term focus seeps through other aspects of its own culture, from how it retains talent to its compensation structure. For example, remuneration for asset managers is linked to five-year performance in the vast majority of cases. This puts its investors' focus in line with the kinds of companies that can achieve consistent returns for their clients, Telfer said.
Another long-term strategy Baillie Gifford has adopted is investing in more companies while they're still private. Not only does the firm get a longer timeline for compounded gains, but it can coach management teams on the importance of the long-term view, well before hordes of investors become obsessed with every quarter."

Here's how 2019's mega IPOs have performed so far.,"It has been a particularly active year for mega initial public offerings, with four companies, including Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), raising more than $1 billion.
While tech unicorns, or tech companies with private valuations north of $1 billion, were responsible for most of 2019's high-profile initial public offering, other sectors were also represented. These include share offerings for companies as like Levi's (NYSE:LEVI) and Beyond Meat, which has been the top-performing IPO of 2019.
As of Tuesday's close, Beyond Meat had gained 244% since its May 1 IPO, while Uber and Lyft, the two most-anticipated debuts of they year, have left investors in the red with losses of 9% and 21%, respectively.
Lead underwriter  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) blamed the poor performance of Uber's IPO on the recent stock-market volatility. The ride-sharing giant went public on a day where  renewed trade tensions caused the Dow to fall as much as 700 points. Shares of the company fell 8% on their first day of trading, and have not yet recovered.
 CNBC reported that Morgan Stanley employed the rare tactic of  naked short selling to support Uber's IPO. This involved the bankers selling more shares than what was allotted in the IPO, and then buying them back as effective ""support"" in the open market. Morgan Stanley and Uber declined to comment on the report.
Other unicorns expected to go public this year include Slack, Casper, and WeWork.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 09:25AM ET</span>","Sabadell gets bids from Cerberus, Oaktree for real estate business: source","By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Banco Sabadell has received binding bids from U.S. private equity funds Cerberus and Oaktree for a real estate company owned by the Spanish bank and is expected to assess them on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 
The company, SDIn, owns a portfolio of foreclosed assets of mainly land and real estate developments with a gross value of around 1.3 billion euros ($1.45 billion). 
The sale is the latest move by Sabadell to shed non-core banking assets. 
Sabadell's board will analyze the bids from Oaktree and Cerberus on Thursday though a final decision to sell SDIn may not be taken until later in June, one of the sources said.
A second source confirmed Cerberus had made a bid.
Cerberus, Oaktree and Banco Sabadell declined to comment.
Spanish banks are shedding real estate assets that went bad in the economic slump that followed the bursting of Spain's real estate bubble at the end of 2007. Along with other European banks, they are also under pressure from the European Central Bank to clean up their books.
""As part of the deal, the buyer would also take on around 80 staff SDIn currently employs,"" the first source said, without giving any detail about the price. 
Sabadell's chief executive officer Jaime Guardiola last month said ISDn's real estate development portfolio had a net asset value of between 700 million to 900 million euros. This would imply a discount of 46% to 31% on its gross value.
If Sabadell sells the real estate business for more than the capital set aside to cover the risk related to the asset, the bank may be able to book a capital gain.
Sabadell's capital or coverage ratio on a similar portfolio of foreclosed assets stood at 43.8% at end-March.
Sabadell is in the process of selling non-core assets as it looks to strengthen its solvency, which was hit by extraordinary costs of 460 million euros ($517 million) related to an IT glitch at its UK TSB unit in 2018.
In July last year, Sabadell agreed to sell mostly non-performing real estate assets with a gross value of around 12 billion euros to U.S. fund Cerberus and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Sabadell's shares fell 40 percent last year, in part because of the TSB crisis. So far this year, shares are slightly up around 1 percent.

As of end-March, Sabadell put costly IT troubles at TSB behind it as the Spanish bank reported a quarterly net profit almost unchanged against the same quarter in 2018.

1490,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Says U.S. Yield Curve Now Clearly Spells Downturn,"(Bloomberg) -- Make no mistake, the Treasury yield curve really is flashing recession angst -- and the trade war is merely a sideshow.
While a key slice of the curve has inverted this month for the first time since March, an “adjusted” curve that accounts for quantitative easing and tightening has been persistently inverted for the past six months, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
In fact, the bank’s metric inverted back in December, well before the most recent escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions, and has maintained its shape ever since, strategists led by Mike Wilson point out.
That suggests investors who are looking to a trade resolution as a salve for the world’s economic woes may be pinning their hopes in the wrong place.
“Get ready for more potential growth disappointments even with a trade deal,” the strategists wrote in a May 28 report. They see a risk of the S&P 500 Index falling to 2,400 from around 2,800 thanks to the softening data.
Cited culprits for falling bond yields range from tensions in global commerce, relentless hedging demand to growth angst. Nearly $11 trillion worth of fixed income securities are now yielding below zero, the most since 2016, Bloomberg data show.
There’s no shortage of evidence pointing to economic woes, Morgan Stanley points out. U.S. data from durable goods to capital spending and PMIs lagged market consensus last week -- all of them reflecting activity in April, before the latest round of trade escalations.
In China, the economic outlook deteriorated this month after April’s weaker-than-expected performance. Expectations for price growth, as proxied by five-year, five-year forward inflation swaps, are falling in the U.S. and the euro area.
“We think this means the U.S. economic slowdown and rising recession risk is happening regardless of the trade outcome,” the strategists write.
The gap between 3-month and 10-year rates dipped to minus 12 basis points on Wednesday, the most negative since March, when this closely watched segment of the curve inverted for the first time since 2007.
Morgan Stanley warns its adjusted yield curve also suggests stock volatility is set to rise. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is sitting at around 18, above its one-year average of 16.
The curve “generally does a good job of telling us what to expect for the VIX,” according to the report. “Recession or not, we believe U.S. equity market volatility is likely to pick up significantly over the next 6 months.”"

(Reuters) - Abercrombie & Fitch Co forecast second-quarter sales below estimates on Wednesday after the apparel retailer posted its slowest rise in quarterly same-store sales at its surf-themed Hollister brand in two years, sending shares down 18%.
Hollister has been a bright spot for the company over the last few years as its more casual and fun apparel gained popularity among young shoppers, who had previously abandoned flagship brand, Abercrombie, after its logo-emblazoned tees fell out of fashion.
However, the company's most recent results showed that demand for Hollister was slowing, with its same-store sales rising just 2% in the quarter ended May 4, missing the average analyst estimate of a 3.3% increase, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
A year ago, Hollister's quarterly same-store sales rose 6%.
""Expectations were really high for Hollister, that has been their shining star ... (So) Hollister's numbers falling short and potentially slowing, is a red flag for investors,"" Gabriela Santaniello, analyst at A line Partners, said.
Overall same-store sales in the first quarter rose 1%, below estimates of a 1.33% increase.
Abercrombie also said its international business took a hit from not taking advantage of some promotional events in Asia. Sales abroad fell 6% in the quarter. 
The company has decided to close three flagship stores, including a Hollister store in SoHo, New York City. 
Abercrombie forecast second-quarter net sales to be flat to up 2%, below estimates of a 2.8% increase. The company blamed its disappointing forecast on a $10 million hit from a stronger dollar.
The company also forecast comparable sales to be flat, well below expectations of a 2.3% rise.
Net sales rose marginally to $734 million. 
Net loss attributable to the company narrowed to $19.12 million, or 29 cents per share, from $42.5 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected a loss of 43 cents per share on net sales of $733.4 million.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Bombardier delivered three double-decker trains to Switzerland this month for a total of 15, it said on Wednesday, but declined to comment after the Swiss rail boss said the company was losing money on the overdue contract.
Faulty doors, software and questions over ride comfort on the first trains to be delivered have complicated the 2010 deal, which is about five years behind schedule. Switzerland's largest-ever trains contract now calls for most of the 62 trains on order to be delivered by the end of 2020.
""For Bombardier, the FV Dosto (double-decker) trains are ...a loss-making business deal,"" Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) Chief Executive Andreas Meyer told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung (NZZ) newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday. 
""Bombardier will try to minimise these losses. But the contractual requirements are relatively clear and comfortable for us.""
Without giving specifics, Meyer said the contract provided for financial penalties against Bombardier for not living up to its obligations. 
Bombardier has cut its forecast for profit and revenue as its railcar unit struggles, but said on Wednesday it would not break out how problems with the Swiss order might contribute to that.
""We do not comment on the profitability of our projects,” a Bombardier spokesman said. ""The FV-Dosto is a unique high-tech product tailored to the needs of Switzerland. The development of a new product is naturally associated with high investment costs."" 
SBB and Bombardier said on May 1 that the problems with the first 12 trains were being ironed out.
""We are making rapid and strong progress,"" the Bombardier spokesman said on Wednesday. 
Meyer conceded that SBB was responsible for one year of the delays due to changing requirements, but said Bombardier was to blame for the remainder, as well as the time taken to fix problems that have plagued the initial 12 deliveries. 
Meyer predicted a potential disagreement over which side is responsible for what share of the damages. ""The conflict will come,"" he said. 

Bombardier said it was committed to working out any disputes. ""We are confident that we will find constructive solutions with SBB on all aspects in the foreseeable future,"" its spokesman said.

1494,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Treasuries Eye 2% as Trade Tension Spurs Increased Fed Cut Bets,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasuries are in the vanguard of a bull run in global bonds, bringing into sight the prospect of benchmark 10-year yields dropping to 2% for the first time since late 2016 as traders ramp up bets on monetary-policy easing by the U.S. central bank.
Escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and faltering global growth have seen U.S. 10-year yields tumble almost 40 basis points since mid-April to as low as 2.22% on Wednesday, while fed funds futures showed about three quarter-point central bank cuts priced in by the end of next year. Yields on 10-year securities in Australia and New Zealand both dropped to records, while those in Japan matched a three-year low of minus 0.1%. Equivalent German bund rates dipped as low as negative 0.17 percent, within a few basis points of their 2016 low.
“The overarching theme of slower global growth, inflation not hitting the mark of central bank targets, and the uncertainty of a protracted trade war are all contributing to that rally,” said Tano Pelosi, portfolio manager in Sydney at Antares Capital, which oversees the equivalent of $22 billion. “I can see U.S. 10-year yields heading toward 2% if the pressure from the trade war continues.”
The renewed bout of risk aversion, brought on by U.S. President Donald Trump’s comment that a deal with China isn’t imminent and tensions between Italy and the European Union, reflects increasing bets major central banks will cut rates to revive growth. Traders are now focusing on a planned meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Group-of-20 summit in June, even as recent rhetoric from both sides indicates a hardening of positions.
Treasury 10-year yields slid as much as four basis points Wednesday to the lowest since September 2017, after falling five basis points Tuesday. The spread between U.S. three-month and 10-year yields fell to as low as minus 13 basis points, the most negative since 2007.
Australia’s 10-year bond yield slipped as much as five basis points to 1.48%, dropping below the central bank’s cash rate for the first time since 2015, while New Zealand's declined five basis points to 1.70%. Japan's declined two basis points.
Bond auctions are further illustrating investor demand for fixed income. Australia’s sale of A$3 billion ($2.1 billion) of 2031 debt Wednesday drew bids for A$10.8 billion, above the A$8.5 billion offered at a similar auction last year. A $40 billion offering of two-year Treasuries on Tuesday was awarded a basis point below the level in pre-auction trading.
“If policy makers just stand by and growth falls too sharply, then 2% could happen” for U.S. 10-year yields, Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings in Singapore. S&P modeling shows the probability of a U.S. recession has risen to 25% over the past few months from about 20%, he said.
Fed funds futures are now fully pricing in three rate cuts by the end of next year. Markets are also signaling two to three moves by the Reserve Bank of Australia amid concern Chinese demand for commodities is weakening.
“If the Fed cuts, will they cut by 25 basis points?” said Rajeev De Mello, chief investment officer at Bank of Singapore Ltd., whose base case remains that the U.S. and China will come to a compromise. “Unlikely -- they probably will cut by 50 basis points, and that’s what we’re starting to see priced into markets.”

1495,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 08:00AM ET</span>",Asia hedge funds struggle to benefit from investor enthusiasm,"By Noah Sin and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian hedge funds are struggling to benefit from strong investor interest in the region in the face of patchy liquidity, country-level restrictions and general market jitters over the U.S.-China trade war.
The Asia Pacific was the top region identified by investors globally in 2018 and 2019 for increased exposure to hedge fund investments, a JP Morgan survey showed, reflecting demand for exposure to strong economic and demographic trends.
But the promise isn't turning into growth of assets under management (AUM) in Asia. Since the industry in Hong Kong started its annual Sohn conference in 2014, where hedge funds pitch investment ideas, AUM at Asia's hedge funds have fallen 10% to $108 billion, according to HFR Research. Globally, similar assets have increased 11.8%.
""There is a large amount of demand from international investors for Asian alternatives, and China in particular, but this is not fully flowing through into investment decisions or checks being written,"" said Jonathan Jenkins, head of equity sales and prime distribution for Asia Pacific at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Hedge fund managers said this is in part because of limited liquidity in Asia-Pacific financial markets outside of North Asia, and a shortage of hedge funds with both capacity to take in additional funds and which meet the stricter due diligence standards of some global investors.
The U.S.-China trade war is also acting as a dampener for market investment overall, serving as another drag on the ability of the industry to grow.
Headline-grabbing ideas pitched at Sohn conferences, held globally, have included a suggestion to short Lehman Brothers four months before the bank's collapse precipitated a global financial crisis.
The 2019 Hong Kong conference takes place on Thursday.
""At the first conference two people pitched this little company called  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which they said attendees might be able to get exposure to in public markets in the future,"" said Seth Fischer, founder of Oasis Management, who set up a hedge fund conference in Hong Kong in 2013 that became the Sohn conference the next year.
CHINA AND JAPAN
Managers and advisers are bracing for more financial market volatility - which can benefit hedge funds if they have sufficient market tools to trade the price swings.
Deep markets are key, so China and Japan tend to dominate trading and hedge fund discussions, although China has restrictions on the ability to short securities - or bet on falling prices.
""We're preparing for clients to show interest in hedge funds with low or negative correlation to risk assets, such as macro strategies, which did well during the global financial crisis, but they haven't asked for these yet,"" said Thor Monsen, Asia Pacific head of hedge funds at Citi Private Bank.
Vivian Chang, chief executive at China-focused hedge fund WT Asset Management, sees potential opportunities as China struggles to revive economic growth. The economy may be growing much faster than developed economies, but the pace of expansion has dropped to its lowest in almost three decades. [nL3N1ZL4KV]
""We try to identify the inflection point, where we can find opportunities on the short side,"" said Chang, whose firm invests in onshore and offshore-listed Chinese companies.
""But at the same time, China is still developing and growing, so there are abundant opportunities on the long side too.""
Taking a short position on securities in China is highly restricted by regulators, leaving hedge funds to focus on Chinese companies listed overseas, such as in Hong Kong, if they want to employ bearish strategies.
Even in Japan, the region's deepest and most accessible market, the presence of hedge funds is modest compared to Europe and North America.
""Asia feels a little different to the U.S. where there are so many analysts and hedge funds looking at every company and every announcement,"" said Aaron Stern of Fir-Tree Partners in New York, which hit the headlines last month after raising its stake in Kyushu Railway Co and urging the company to buy back shares.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 07:26AM ET</span>",Main shareholder in Russian homebuilder LSR to keep control,"By Tatiana Voronova and Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Andrey Molchanov, the main shareholder in Russian homebuilder LSR, plans to keep control over the company even though he reduced his stake last month.
Molchanov, who founded LSR and is chairman of the board of directors, reduced his stake by 9.71 percent via a sale to investors last month, leaving him with 50.33 percent of the company. 
""We decided that it would be rational to sell a certain stake to increase the free-float,"" Molchanov, also a big collector of the modern art, including Russian artists, told Reuters. 
But he is not about to give up control.
""I do not consider a possibility of reducing my stake further - the controlling stake will be kept by me,"" said Molchanov, 47, whose wealth is currently estimated at $950 million by Forbes magazine.
Before sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea, Russian companies, many of which have a controlling shareholder or shareholders, were looking at increasing their free float on the stock market to make them more attractive to outside investors. 
But their appetite for larger free floats has waned following the sanctions because of the volatility they have caused in financial markets.
Molchanov said that some fund managers had suggested that he sell even more LSR shares to increase the free float to at least 60% but he decided to keep control. 
""Everyone understands that a big free float makes the company sensitive to the market volatility,"" he said.
But he also said: ""If lets say tomorrow the market falls fivefold, a buy back could be considered."" 
LSR's current market capitalization stands at $1.1 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The company's shares are up by around 14% this year. 
LSR is one of the top three real estate developers in Russia's fragmented homebuilding sector, competing with two other big players, PIK and Etalon. LSR focuses on Moscow and St Petersburg, building 1 million square meters a year.
OLIGARCH LIST
Molchanov last year was added to the so-called ""U.S. oligarch list"" of people close to the Kremlin but which did not automatically lead to any sanctions.
Molchanov said being on the list had caused some - but not big - problems for his business, for example, when he wanted to get financing for a foreign project. 
""Foreign banks did not want to lend to companies where I am a shareholder. But situation started to improve,"" he said. 
Molchanov said being on the list did not stop foreign investors, including from the United States, from buying LSR shares last month. That deal was led by U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan and Russia's VTB Capital.
NEW RULES 
Russia has designed new rules for homebuilders to protect buyers. From July, companies have to use bank loans to fund construction rather than relying on cash from selling homes before they are completed. 
The previous system allowed Russians to save money by buying apartments ""off-plan"" at a cheaper rate. But some properties were left unfinished, triggering protests. 
Molchanov said the new rules would squeeze out some players from the real estate sector and could also potentially slow the pace of new home construction from the current 40 million square meters a year. 
The only thing which might help the market, he said, would be lower mortgage rates. LSR's share of mortgage sales out of the company's total sales of apartments amounted to 53% last year compared to 47% in 2017. 
""An increase (of mortgage loan rate) by 0.2-0.5 percentage points trigger a fall in (apartment sales) by around 26 percent,"" Molchanov said. The Russian central bank's key benchmark rate stands at 7.75%, with average mortgage rates at above 10%.
On dividends, Molchanov said LSR did not plan to change its policy of paying generous dividends. For the last couple of years, LSR has paid half of net profit as dividends, or sometimes more. 

LSR's policy calls for dividend payouts of no less than 20% of annual net profit.

LONDON (Reuters) - The global bond rally accelerated on Wednesday, sending 10-year U.S Treasury yields to 20-month lows, as investors fearful of the fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade war sold shares and scurried for the safety of German and U.S. government debt.
U.S. 10-year yields are down almost 30 basis points this month, while German yields slipped deeper into negative territory to the lowest in almost three years. 
Wall Street was set to open lower, with S&P500 futures down 0.7%, still feeling the effect of U.S. President Donald Trump's comment that he was ""not yet ready"" to make a deal with China over trade.
Chinese newspapers responded on Wednesday with a warning Beijing could use rare earths to strike back at the United States. China is a major producer of rare earths, which are used widely in electronics and military equipment. 
The prospect of a prolonged standoff between the world's two biggest economies and the likelihood of Europe and Japan getting dragged in, are making investors seriously worried about economic growth. 
Recent data, such as purchasing-manager surveys, have disappointed and another round of tariffs would sharply raise U.S. recession risk, said Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management. 
""The market is simply calculating what the impact will be of the next set of tariffs as it doesn't look like the rhetoric is calming down,"" Onuekwusi said.
""Then we have a weaker growth outlook ... so we have the negative shock of trade added to lower growth, and the cushion of protection isn't as good as it was eight to nine months ago.""
Those concerns pushed MSCI's global equity index 0.5% lower to 2-1/2-month lows <.MIWD00000PUS and put it on track for its first lossmaking month of 2019.
Asian markets too fell while in Europe, Germany's exporter-heavy index slumped 1.4% and a pan-European benchmark lost 1.3%.
U.S. bond and equity volatility is also on the rise. 
(GRAPHIC: Bond and equity vol on the rise - https://tmsnrt.rs/2IiffRh) 
On the political front too, many fear eurosceptic parties' strong showing in EU elections could allow them to hamper crucial legislation; Austria and Greece face elections; and Italy's dispute with the European Commission over its budget may be escalating.
BOND RALLY ACCELERATES
All these concerns have given fresh legs to the rally in government bonds, which will also benefit from interest rate cuts if the growth outlook worsens.
U.S. 10-year yields are now about 13 basis points below 3-month rates, an inversion typically seen as a leading indicator of a recession. 
(GRAPHIC: U.S. Yield Curve - http://tmsnrt.rs/2zUqXiW)
The inversion is the deepest in almost 12 years, exacerbated by recent weak U.S. data on manufacturing and industrial output. 
U.S. rates futures are pricing two interest rate cuts by mid-2020.
""Typically when the yield curve inverts you get central bank easings. So the question about recession would be: would the U.S. Fed ease enough to avoid a recession?"" said Chris Rands, portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management.
""The fact that you have got a bit more noise around the trade war now at the same time as manufacturing is rolling over -- it's getting people to think that things are a little bit worse than they had expected,"" he said.
The gap between two and 10-year German Bund yields was the narrowest in almost three years. Ten-year Bunds now yield minus 0.17% and are down 10 bps since the start of May.
Bunds are benefiting also from tensions between Italy and the EU, which is said to be considering punishing Rome for excessive spending.
Regardless of Italian risks, the rally spread to the riskier southern European countries, where Spanish and Portuguese 10-year yields hit record lows and Italian yields fell five bps.
Onuekwusi said he preferred Italian and Spanish bonds over their negative-yielding German counterparts. The EU is unlikely to impose too severe a punishment on Italy, he argued. 
""If you look at Europe's political landscape, the last thing the (EU authorities) would want to do is to stir up any more negative EU sentiment,"" he said.
(GRAPHIC: Investors pile into Southern (NYSE:SO) European debt - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WaH7QR)
On currencies, the dollar index was set for a fourth straight month of gains, benefiting from flows away from markets such as Asia that are considered at greater risk from a trade war.
The euro was unchanged at $.1.117 after falling two straight days. The British pound held at $1.2643.

Commodity markets were also dominated by fears of economic downturn, with Brent crude off almost 2% at $68.79 per barrel. But gold benefited from the safe-haven bid, rising 0.3% to $1.282 an ounce .

By approving the payments, Blume and other Porsche staffers may have contributed towards a misuse of corporate funds, the Stuttgarter Nachrichten said, without citing sources.
The Stuttgart prosecutor's office declined to comment. Porsche declined to comment on whether Blume, who is also a member of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) board, was being probed, saying it never discusses details of an investigation.
Stuttgart prosecutors said on Tuesday they had searched Porsche's offices as part of a broader probe involving 176 police and tax inspectors as well as 10 state prosecutors.
Porsche managers are being investigated on suspicion of having granted ""disproportionate"" payments to a member of Porsche's works council, the prosecutor's office said on Tuesday, without elaborating.
Stuttgarter Nachrichten said on Wednesday Blume's offices were searched in connection with this probe. 
A severe breach of fiduciary trust for potential misuse of funds is a criminal offence and can carry a penalty of up to 10 years in jail.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets regulator has banned Terry Farr, one of six former brokers unanimously acquitted by a London jury over their role in the Libor scandal, for dishonesty and lacking integrity over so-called ""wash"" trades.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday that Farr, a former Martins Broker employee, was not fit and proper to perform any job in financial services.
Wash trades are risk-free trades with the same party that cancel each other out, serve no legitimate purpose but generate brokerage payments.
Farr, a former manager on the Japanese yen desk at Martins, arranged nine such trades between September 2008 and August 2009, after persuading a UBS trader he could influence benchmark Libor (London interbank offered rate) interest rates. 
Farr, who was aware that the wash trades were improper and sought to conceal them, earned almost 260,000 pounds ($328,000)for Martins from UBS and RBS (LON:RBS), increasing the bonus pool available for Farr and the other brokers, the FCA said.
""There was no legitimate reason for Mr Farr to make these trades and his actions were motivated by greed,"" said Mark Steward, the FCA's head of enforcement.
""His actions mean he has no place in financial services.
Today's ban reflects our commitment to making sure that people working in financial services act with integrity,"" Steward added. 
London-based Martins, which was rapped by the FCA in 2014 for its role in the Libor scandal and for having inadequate systems and controls, was dissolved in 2015. 
The FCA had no immediate comment on whether it would pursue similar actions against the other five brokers prosecuted alongside Farr three years ago.

Libor rates help set borrowing costs for about $450 trillion of loans globally. Authorities have fined some of the world's most powerful banks and brokerages around $9 billion over rate manipulation allegations and overhauled how benchmarks such as Libor are policed.

1503,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, May 29:
1. Risk aversion rises on reports China to restrict rare earths exports
Global stocks traded lower and bonds rallied on Wednesday on fears of possible Chinese countermeasures in the ongoing trade war with the U.S.
China’s state-run media suggested that the country could limit its exports to the U.S. of rare earths, used in everything from high-tech consumer electronics to military equipment, in a move to exert pressure on Washington.
U.S. futures pointed to a lower open. Dow futures fell 197 points, or 0.8%, by 5:28 AM ET (9:28 GMT), S&P 500 futures lost 22 points, or 0.8%, while Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 73 points, or 1.0%.
The flight from risk also impacted the bond market as investors pivoted to safety. The yield on the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury (which moves inversely to prices) fell to its lowest level since September 2017. German yields fell deeper into negative territory and inched toward record lows around minus 0.2%
Asian stocks closed mostly lower although China’s Shanghai Composite eked out gains of 0.2% as rare earth mining stocks surged.
European shares were off more than 1% across the board as trade concerns added to negative sentiment from Italy’s dispute with the European Commission over its budget. Further dampening spirits, Germany, the euro zone’s largest economy, saw unemployment increase for the first time in two years in May.
2. Huawei challenges legality of U.S. defense bill
China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd filed a motion for summary judgment in its lawsuit against the U.S. government, in the telecoms equipment maker's latest bid to fight sanctions from Washington that threaten to push it out of global markets.
Huawei is asking to declare the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) unconstitutional. The NDAA placed a broad ban on federal agencies and their contractors from using Huawei equipment on national security grounds, citing the company's ties with the Chinese government.
The motion comes amid an escalating trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, exacerbated by separate accusations of bank fraud and corporate theft that the U.S. made against Huawei and its chief financial officer.
3. Boeing’s 737 MAX may not return to service until August
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) suggested that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX may not be cleared to return to service until August.
The 737 MAX was grounded globally in March after a crash in Ethiopia killed all 157 people on board, the model's second deadly crash in five months.
“We do not expect something before 10 to 12 weeks in re-entry into service,” IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac told reporters in Seoul. “But it is not our hands. That is in the hands of regulators.”
IATA plans to organize a summit with airlines, regulators and the manufacturer in five to seven weeks to discuss what is needed for the 737 MAX to return to service, he said.

4. Oil prices dive on global demand worries, U.S. inventories on tap
Oil prices registered a sharp decline on Wednesday as President Donald Trump's more conciliatory tone towards Iran eased fears of a supply crunch and focused minds on the demand consequences of the U.S.-China trade war.
U.S. crude oil futures lost $1.37, or 2.3%, to $57.77 by 5:31 AM ET (9:31 GMT), while Brent oil traded down $1.50, or 2.2%, to $67.17.
Ahead on the economic calendar, weekly data on U.S. crude inventories was delayed one day this week due to Monday’s holiday. The American Petroleum Institute will release its figures late Wednesday, after five straight builds, while the Energy Information Administration’s official report is due Thursday amid expectations for a draw of 0.8 million barrels.
5. Retail earnings set ahead of the open
With no major U.S. macro data scheduled for Wednesday, retail earnings will be in focus ahead of the opening bell.
Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is expected to report a profit of 59 cents per share on sales of about $1.9 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Analysts also expect the retailer, which is vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods, to register a decline of 1.3% in comparable sales, according to Briefing.com.
Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is expected to post a loss of 43 cents per share, with sales coming in at about $733.4 million.
And Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS), the maker of outerwear, is forecast to earn 3 cents per share for its latest quarter on sales of $119.4 million."
1504,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 05:30AM ET</span>",Strategists see Wall Street moving higher despite trade war risks: Reuters poll,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks will build on this year's already strong gains over the rest of 2019 despite growing U.S.-China trade tensions that represent the biggest threat to the market, according to a Reuters poll of strategists.
The benchmark S&P 500 index will finish 2019 at 2,925, up about 4.4% from Tuesday's close, based on the median forecast of 50 strategists polled by Reuters in the last two weeks. It would represent a gain of 16.7% from the end of 2018.
Most strategists in the poll cited further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war as the biggest potential negative over the coming year, followed by a worse-than-expected U.S. economic slowdown and slower earnings growth. 
Rising intensity in the trade war is likely the biggest risk since it could affect so many other areas, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
""It could have a cascading effect on the global economy and corporate profit growth, which could cause shares to become overvalued,"" Stovall said.
The overwhelming majority of strategists in the U.S. poll also said the risk for stocks is skewed more toward the downside than the upside.
Although the S&P 500 remains up about 12% for the year so far, stocks have sold off recently amid persistent worries over the trade battle. The Dow Jones industrial average last week registered its fifth straight week of declines, its longest such losing streak in eight years.
Adding to tensions, Washington effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's largest telecoms network gear maker, citing national security concerns.
""Companies are getting more worried about the sanctions in the ramp up in this trade war than they are about tariffs,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Troy, Michigan, noting technology companies could be hit the hardest.
Still, strategists were slightly more optimistic about the S&P 500's potential gains in 2019 than they were in a Reuters poll in February, when the median target for the index was 2,900.
Many investors remain hopeful of an eventual trade agreement, and some expect the market to weather the turbulence well.
""It's kind of the risk du jour. Ultimately, the likelihood it actually hurts the economy enough to drive stock prices meaningfully lower is limited. The market right now is still quite healthy,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.
Signs earlier this year that the trade war would be over soon and signals from the Federal Reserve that it will not raise interest rates anytime soon have driven much of this year's gains. 
Few strategists cited valuations as a big concern at this point.
Stock valuations recently climbed to levels reached just before Wall Street's 2018 plunge, but have eased in recent days. The S&P 500 index peaked last year on Sept. 20, before sliding nearly 20% over the next three months.
At 16.5, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the index, which compares stock prices to estimated earnings over the next year, remains above its historic average of about 15, according to data tracked by Refinitiv.
The first-quarter U.S. earnings season has been mostly better than expected and has eased worries among some investors that the S&P 500 would have a ""profit recession"" of at least two straight quarters of declining earnings this year, but profit growth still is expected to remain well below 2018's levels.
With results in from almost all of the S&P 500, first-quarter earnings now are expected to have risen 1.5% from a year ago versus a 2.0% decline estimated at the start of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For all of 2019, analysts are forecasting profit growth of just 3.0%, down sharply from 2018's tax-cut fueled earnings growth of 24.1%. 
Investors expect tariffs could lift corporate costs and lower profit margins, while continued uncertainty surrounding a trade deal will hinder the ability of companies to plan or make capital expenditures.

The poll also showed the Dow finishing 2019 at 26,000. That would represent a gain of 2.6% from Tuesday's close and an increase of 11.5% percent from the end of 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - A tussle between Britain and the European Union over where thousands of shares would be traded in the event of a no-deal Brexit escalated on Wednesday after Britain's financial watchdog accused its EU counterpart of risking disruption by restricting market access.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it would partially relax proposals to limit trading outside the bloc in a policy update but Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the changes did not go far enough.
ESMA stunned exchanges in March when it said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, 6,200 mostly EU-listed shares, but also 14 UK stocks, could only be traded on platforms inside the bloc.
The European watchdog said on Wednesday it would slightly soften the scope of the rules to enable EU banks and investment firms to trade all UK shares in Britain, including the 14 blue chip stocks including  BP  (LON:BP) and  Vodafone  (LON:VOD).
However it did not relent on the trading of shares issued by firms incorporated in the EU.
The FCA said the changes still risked disruption and would limit companies' ability to access major investors and their freedom to choose where to list on public stock markets.
London is Europe's biggest share trading center and is used by fund managers from across the continent, who would be forced to accept less attractive prices if market access from Britain is restricted.
The FCA said it was committed to open markets, but had not yet decided whether to recpirocate by restricting trading of shares in Britain. 
The regulator said it would set out its approach ""if it is clear there will be a no-deal exit"".
It said it would consult with ESMA and other market participants on ways to minimize disruption.
An ESMA spokesman said the regulator had engaged ""extensively"" with the FCA but this had not progressed.

Commenting on the FCA holding off making a decision on market access, the spokesman added: ""This may be very late and we prefer to inform market participants on time to support preparations.""

1506,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Arbitration court rejects India's plea in case against Nissan - sources, document","By Aditi Shah and Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Permanent Court of Arbitration in Singapore has rejected India's argument that the court does not have the jurisdiction to rule on a case brought against India by Japan's Nissan Motor, according to two people and documents reviewed by Reuters.
If India had won the plea, the entire case would have been thrown out, said one of the people who has direct knowledge of the matter, adding that the Indian government is now likely to file an appeal with Singapore's Supreme Court.
Nissan sent a legal notice to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration in 2016 claiming more than 50 billion rupees ($720 million) in a dispute over incentives it said were due from Tamil Nadu as part of a 2008 agreement to set up a car manufacturing plant in the southern state.
The Japanese car maker brought the case against India for alleged violation of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) the country has with Japan. The CEPA gives some protections to Japanese firms investing in India and vice versa.
India, which according to the source agreed to have the arbitration in Singapore, filed a plea in 2017 saying the arbitration court in Singapore does not have the authority to rule on the case for many reasons, including that it was a tax-related matter outside the purview of the CEPA with Japan.
The international tribunal, in a 140-page order dated April 29, denied India's objections, saying it has the authority to rule on the matter and would hold the final hearing in February 2020 after submission of evidence and arguments from both sides.
The order has not previously been reported. 
Nissan said in a statement it ""continues to work with the government to resolve this matter"". 
The case is one of a string of arbitration proceedings against India by investors including  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD), Cairn Energy and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) over issues ranging from retrospective taxation to payment disputes.
Though India has lost investment treaty arbitration cases in the past, there is no clarity yet on the legal position when it comes to enforcement of awards or rulings, said Moazzam Khan, head of global litigation at law firm Nishith Desai Associates. 
In the past, however, India has either voluntarily complied or settled the dispute prior to the award, said Khan.
If India loses, the final cost to the country would depend on the merits of the case but there have been instances where it has had to pay the entire claim amount and legal costs, he said. 
SETTLEMENT TALKS
In 2008, when Nissan and its partner France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) agreed to set up a car plant in Chennai, the state government promised several incentives, including tax breaks.
Nissan and Renault have invested 61 billion rupees to set up the factory which has an annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles and has created more than 40,000 jobs. 
Earlier this week, Italian car maker Fiat Chrysler said it has proposed merging with Renault, in a deal which risks leaving Nissan out in the cold.
The Japanese car maker in its 2016 notice claimed 29 billion rupees in unpaid incentives from Tamil Nadu and 21 billion rupees in damages, plus interest and other costs.
The Tamil Nadu government, meanwhile, has been trying to settle the matter with Nissan since last year but has failed to come to an agreement on the final terms. 
""All obligations would be honored,"" said N Muruganandam, principal secretary to Tamil Nadu government's industries department, adding he hopes to finalize a deal within a month.
If the two decide to settle, Nissan, which has only about 1% share of India's passenger car market, has the option to withdraw its arbitration case against India.

1507,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>","StockBeat - A Triple-Whammy of Trade War, German Jobs and Salvini","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are tumbling again in early trade on Wednesday, after China hinted that it may escalate its trade dispute with the U.S. by choking off the export of raw materials vital for many of the world’s high-tech goods.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 1.4% at 371.14 by 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), after the Global Times, an English-language mouthpiece for Beijing, tweeted that China was seriously considering cutting exports of rare earth metals in response to the U.S.’s recent imposition of higher import tariffs on its goods and an effective boycott of telecoms giant Huawei.
The U.K. FTSE 100 was down 1.0%, the French CAC 40 down 1.5% and Germany’s Dax down 1.1%.
There was more gloomy news closer to home, too, as Germany’s Federal Labor Office announced a shocking 60,000 rise in seasonally-adjusted unemployment in May, as the extended slump in manufacturing over the winter finally took its toll on payrolls. There had already been hints of layoffs in IHS Markit’s purchasing managers’ index last week, but the figures still surprised the market, which had been expecting a drop of 8,000.
Germany’s labor market miracle has been one of the biggest props to the European economy for the last 10 years, with the number of people in work setting a series of all-time highs. But its economy is more dependent than most on manufacturing, and its manufacturers are highly dependent on exports to the U.S. and China (and, to a degree, Britain, which is struggling with its own self-generated slowdown).
At the opening, markets were still under pressure from signals yesterday that Italy’s nationalist Lega party will take a more aggressive line in its budget dispute with the EU. The risk premium offered by Italy's 10-year government bonds over their German equivalents rose to its highest since February at 286 basis points after Lega head Matteo Salvini, the big winner in the weekend’s elections to the European parliament, said he would press for changes to the EU’s budget rules and called for the European Central Bank to guarantee all Eurozone government debt.
The FTSE MIB was down 1.4% and is now down 8.7% over the last month, the worst performing of Europe’s big markets."

WINDHOEK (Reuters) - Namibia's mines and energy minister said he has no objection to Rio Tinto's sale of its uranium mine stake to China provided it respects the African nation's laws.
Rio, which is seeking to divest less profitable assets, said last November that it was selling its 69% stake in the world's longest-running open pit uranium mine to China for up to $106.5 million and expected the deal to be completed in the first half of 2019.
Asked whether the sale would be cleared, Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo told Reuters: ""We have no objection to the sale provided that the buyer abides by what's expected of him by our laws.""
China already owns stakes in Namibian uranium production, which, along with diamonds, is the mainstay of the Namibian economy.
Addressing concerns among Namibians that China will bring in foreign nationals to replace local employees, China National Uranium Corporation (CNBC) Vice President Lib Yowling told a public hearing last week that was not the case.
There was ""no intention to replace local Namibian employees with foreign nationals solely as a result of this transaction,"" he told the hearing in the coastal town of Swakopmund.
""In fact, CNBC has a strong commitment to maintain the current level of local employees."" 
 Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) is selling its stake in Ros sing Uranium mine to CNBC in a deal dependent on approval from the Namibian competition commission.
The Namibian government holds a 3% stake in Ros sing and 51% of voting rights. The Iranian Foreign Investment Company also holds a legacy 15% stake that goes back to the original funding of the mine, which could have deterred some potential buyers.
The other shareholders are the Development Corporation of South Africa (10%) and individual shareholders (3%).
    China is targeting nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels. It was the only obvious buyer of the shares in the Ros sing mine.
    Ros sing has been operating since 1976 and has produced more uranium than any other mine. It employs around 1,000 workers and can carry on producing until 2025.
    The sale agreement comprises an initial cash payment of $6.5 million, payable at completion, and a contingent payment of up to $100 million following completion.
    The contingent payment is linked to uranium spot prices and Roofing's net income during the next seven years.
While China is a big source of uranium demand, the market has languished as Western countries turn away from the energy source and trade tensions between the United States and China are generally disrupting commodities trade.

    A spokesman for Rio Tinto declined to comment.

PARIS/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Airbus prepared on Wednesday to celebrate its 50th anniversary with a private flypast for staff at its Toulouse base and low-key publicity as a new management seeks a break with the company's turbulent and theatrical past.
Europe's jetmaker was launched at a meeting between French and West German ministers on May 29, 1969, in a bid to revive struggling aircraft industries and seal post-war reconciliation.
After battling to overcome American domination of the commercial market with its A300 twin-aisle jet, which first flew in 1972, Airbus eventually became a globally recognized symbol of European ambition, despite chronic in-fighting.
But as it turns 50, Airbus is embroiled in soul-searching and management upheaval amid an ongoing corruption investigation and an austerity drive that has seen the budget for the birthday celebrations slashed and perks like executive dining reduced.
Airbus invited Toulouse staff to a ""special celebration"" on Wednesday at which jetliners and the Patrouille de France display team were due to fly past factories and the group's plush headquarters, built under former CEO Tom Enders.
But plans for a huge PR drive have been scaled down and German staff are being invited to a more homely celebration with a souvenir key fob and free ice cream, employees said.
That's in stark contrast to a lavish gathering of heads of state and hundreds of media in 2005 to mark the world's largest airliner, the A380, which is now being axed due to weak demand. 
The emphasis now is on the smaller but more nimble A350 and repeated upgrades to its stalwart single-aisle A320 series which is expected to get a new variant at next month's Paris Airshow.
NEW STRUCTURE
The low-key nod to Airbus's heritage differs from a stage-managed PR event in Toulouse a week ago, which focused on future technology and data in front of 130 journalists and bloggers.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury, who took up his post last month, paid tribute to past generations of Airbus employees.
""It's fair to say that many people doubted our chances of success but here we still are 50 years and 12,000 commercial aircraft later,"" he told reporters.
But observers say the muted ceremony reflects a conviction among new Airbus leaders that the more significant date was 2012, when a turbulent power-sharing system between governments and industrial owners gave way to a more market-led structure.
Analysts say efforts to ""normalize"" the company underpin soaring share prices, but some who witnessed its growth bemoan a loss of passion as industrial problems persist and sales falter, masked for now by a grounding crisis at rival Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""It is a beginning but also the end,"" said one industry veteran, asking not to be named.
Still, Airbus has overcome early airline scepticism, shareholder turmoil and price battles to share control of the $150-billion annual jetliner market with rival Boeing, securing some 130,000 jobs. An A320 takes off or lands every 2.5 seconds.
""The idea was to pool expertise in a single project. They had to fight the reticent impulses of national governments that were not yet sure if they wanted to co-operate politically,"" said Nicola Clark, author of ""Airbus: The first 50 years"".
""The Franco-German relationship ... eventually became the core of Airbus,"" she said. Britain and Spain also joined early on.
Some experts say Britain's relationship with Airbus, with successive investments and withdrawals, echoes its uneasy stance towards the continent as it prepares to exit the European Union.

""Britain could never really decide if it wanted to be part of it. Industrially it has been consistent but governments were not able to decide if they want to be in or out,"" Clark said.

""The relocation will further integrate (Infiniti) with global design, research and development and manufacturing functions based in Japan,"" Nissan said in the statement, adding that Infiniti would continue to ""operate independently"".
The move also was ""crucial"" for Nissan to follow through on its strategy to electrify the Infiniti lineup, the document said, with plans for every premium model launched from 2021 to be either all-electric or “e-Power” hybrid. 
A Nissan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while there was a ""fair amount of platform and other base technology sharing"" between Infiniti and the main volume brand Nissan, ""there could be more"".
Nissan's global operating profit plunged 45% in the last fiscal year and would likely drop another 28% to “rock bottom” in the current one, according to company filings earlier this month.
Infiniti's move back to Japan will reverse a decision made under ousted leader Carlos Ghosn to dilute the premium brand's Japanese origins in order to foster a more global image.
Its Hong Kong headquarters has about 180 employees who were told about the move back to Yokohama earlier on Wednesday, according to the Nissan official.
The Hong Kong headquarters and the global image it was intended to promote were seen as critical for Infiniti to make inroads in China, where being Japanese can sometimes be a handicap because of historical animosities.
In 2012, Infiniti and other Japanese brands took a battering in the wake of diplomatic spats over disputed islets known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.

Since then, Japan’s bilateral relationship with China has steadily improved and Japanese automakers including Nissan and Toyota are seeing their businesses expand, even as China’s overall auto market has slumped over the past year.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto's stock market will nudge higher over the rest of the year, but investors will need to wait until the second half of 2020 for the index to better April's record peak as global trade tensions weigh on company earnings, a Reuters poll found.
The median forecast from a survey of 26 portfolio managers and strategists polled was for the Toronto market to rise 1.3% from last week's close to 16,445 by December. 
""It looks like we have moved into a common seasonal soft patch that could run through to October depending on how long it takes to get U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit sorted out,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management. ""The longer uncertainty drags, the more of a negative impact tensions could have on stocks.""
No further gains are seen in the first half of next year, but the index is then expected to move above the April 2019 high of 16,673 to reach 17,200 by the end of 2020.
A protracted trade war between the United States and China could hurt the Toronto market because the index has a heavy weighting in energy and mining shares that are sensitive to prospects for global growth. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, has fallen well over 10% since April.
""Earnings expectations still remain too high, and estimate revisions have started to move lower in the past several weeks, which should put further pressure on index returns,"" said Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments.
Even after pulling back since April, the TSX has climbed more than 13% since the start of the year, outpacing the S&P 500. It has included a 40% gain for the technology group, led by a near-doubling in the share price of commerce platform company Shopify Inc. The health care sector, which includes cannabis producers, has done even better, up 43%.
But investors say the pace of gains for the TSX so far this year would likely not continue. 
""We are defensively positioned favoring sectors with higher visible earnings and lower volatility such as utilities,"" said Manash Goswami, a portfolio manager at First Asset ETFs. ""The biggest risk to the markets in my opinion is a combination of a slowdown in global growth and corporate profits.""
Chances of a recession in Canada, where household debt loads are at record levels, in 12 months were 20%, rising to 27.5% in the next two years, a Reuters poll taken in April found. 
The Bank of Canada lowered in April its 2019 growth forecast for Canada to 1.2% and abandoned language pointing to further interest rate hikes. Economists see a 40% chance the central bank will cut rates by the end of 2020, a Reuters poll showed last Friday. 
Meanwhile, money markets expect a rate cut from the Federal Reserve as early as December. Should central banks ease that could help stocks..
""Central banks will support markets with rate cuts,"" AGF's Archibald said. ""Markets will likely bottom in early 2020 as earnings expectations completely reset and focus turns to year-end elections.""
The United States will hold the next presidential election in November 2020.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 03:26AM ET</span>",Brazil stocks to outperform Mexico but pension reform anxiety clouds 2020,"By Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks are expected to post double-digit gains this year, outperforming the Mexican market, as President Jair Bolsonaro's new government pushes ahead on key economic reforms, according to a quarterly Reuters survey.
The poll showed Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rising 27% in 2019 to end the year at 112,000, according to the median of 17 forecasts from traders, brokers and strategists.
That estimate is down from 120,000 in a February poll but still would bring the Bovespa's rally to about 160% since the end of 2015, making Brazil one of the world's best-performing stock markets during the period.
However, growing uncertainties about the timing and size of a long-awaited pension reform promised by Bolsonaro are clouding prospects for the market in 2020.
Only seven of the 17 forecasters consulted by Reuters provided estimates for Brazilian stocks next year due to the lack of visibility both domestically and abroad, as a global economic slowdown and U.S.-China trade dispute add to market jitters.
On average, the forecasts point to a mid-2020 level of 115,000 points for Bovespa, down sharply from 132,500 points in the previous poll. Their year-end 2020 forecast is 125,000, or a 33.5% rise from last week's close of 93,627.80 points.
""The market has already priced in the likelihood of a pension reform approval this year and now needs something concrete to further rise,"" said David Beker, chief Brazil economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Rafael Passos, analyst at digital investment broker Guide, noted most of recent gains in the Brazilian stock market were triggered by local investors. ""The foreigner is still on the sidelines, waiting to see if Bolsonaro has the political support needed to pass these economic reforms,"" he said.
The overhaul of Brazil's costly pension system is the backbone of the government's effort to close what most economists call an unsustainable public deficit and spur stronger growth after the deepest recession in decades. 
Investors have cheered the prospect, even if the final law is likely to be diluted compared to an initial plan of save more than 1 trillion reais ($250 billion) in a decade. 
A consensus among equity strategists is that, once approved by the Congress, the pension reform could set off a broad rebalancing of emerging market portfolios.
""The Bovespa is considerably undervalued compared to its peers, including Mexico,"" said XP Investimentos equity research head Karel Luketic.
The outlook for Mexico's benchmark S&P/BVM IPC index at the end of 2019 faced a smaller revision in the Reuters poll, edging lower to 47,395 points from 48,300 in February, according to the median of 12 traders and analysts surveyed by Reuters. That would mark a rise of 11% from last week's close and 14% in 2019. The S&P/BVM IPC fell 15.6% in 2018. 
Almost a year after his July election, investors still fear Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador could turn his back on fiscal responsibility to pursue populist policies hurting further stock market gains.
""Outflows are not significant yet, which gives the impression that investors are giving Mexico the benefit of the doubt,"" said Citi strategist Guilherme Assis.
He added, however, that Mexico is much more vulnerable than Brazil to downside risks related to U.S. protectionist policies, including ongoing turmoil caused by a trade dispute with China.

""If the U.S. economy slows down, it brings Mexico along,"" Assis said.

Taking the biggest hit from the risk aversion were Europe's auto and mining stock indexes, down 1% and 1.7% each while technology were weighed down by semiconductor shares.

The elation they felt in late April when TSMC climbed to a record has turned to disappointment as it is now poised for its worst month since 2008. The slide comes as the Trump administration banned companies from supplying U.S. tech to Huawei Technologies Co.
The slump by Taiwan’s biggest stock is dragging down Taiwan equities. Foreign investors have sold a net $3.5 billion of the island’s shares so far this month, the most among Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. It has also helped weaken the Taiwan dollar, which is trading near its weakest since early 2017.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) have cut their price targets on TSMC this week. The foundry could lose $1.1 billion in smartphone sales and $200 million from a slower infrastructure build-out due to the Huawei ban, Credit Suisse said. Huawei accounts for about 6.4% of TSMC’s revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Taiwanese firm said on May 23 there’s no “need to change our exports to Huawei” and it won’t change its second quarter earnings forecast.

Casino’s board decided to eliminate an interim payment this year at a meeting Tuesday, following the downgrade by Standard & Poor’s by two levels to B.
The company’s dividend yield had increased to as much as 10%, one of the highest in its sector, as Casino shares have fallen over the past two years. Short sellers have bet against the stock amid concern that the grocer’s parent firms have too much debt and use opaque accounting to mask their true financial condition.
Rallye SA and the other holding companies entered a “safeguard” procedure in France last week, giving them a respite on paying back debt as they come up with a new plan to compensate creditors.
S&P said it has concerns about Casino’s governance, given that Jean-Charles Naouri controls both Rallye and Casino as chairman.
“Mr. Naouri has an interest in maximizing dividend payments from Casino to service Rallye’s debt and receive dividends on behalf of Rallye rather than use them to deleverage at Casino,” S&P said. “The outcome could ultimately be at Casino’s expense, given it is the main asset and generator of virtually all profits and cash flows for the wider group.”

1519,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2019 01:30AM ET</span>",Rare Earth Stocks Give Abundant Returns as Investors Pile In,"(Bloomberg) -- Returns for investors in Chinese rare earths stocks are looking anything but scarce.
Investors are piling into the sector on speculation the materials may be weaponized in China’s tit-for-tat trade war with the U.S. President Xi Jinping’s visit to a rare earth facility in Jiangxi last week fueled an initial rally, with shares surging again on Wednesday after a slew of Chinese media reports advocated the threat of using rare earths as retaliation against the U.S.
Analysts say domestic producers are the big winners as any curb may boost rare earth prices enough to counter a decline in demand. China Rare Earth Holdings Ltd (HK:0769). jumped more than 40% and  Jl Mag  Rare-Earth   Co Ltd (SZ:300748)., the plant Xi visited, climbed by the 10% daily limit for the seventh time in eight trading sessions. Other companies posted more muted gains, with China Northern Rare Earth Group High-Tech Co. (SS:600111) adding 5% and Xiamen Tungsten Co. (SS:600549) advancing 2.8%.
“Prices and margins rising as a result of a decrease in supply would far outweigh the impact of a dent in demand from the U.S.,” said Wang Daixin, fund manager at Bristlecon Pine Asset Management Ltd. in Guangzhou. “I don’t think the price moves in the sector are anything near rational by this point.”
Rare earths are the latest focus of the escalating trade spat after China raised tariffs to 25% from 10% on American imports, while the U.S. excluded the materials from its own list of prospective tariffs. Xi’s visit to Jiangxi and this week’s salvo of media reports has been seen by some investors as a sign that China could be preparing to impose curbs on exports to the U.S. and bolster its domestic industry.
Dependence
The People’s Daily, a flagship newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary that the U.S. shouldn’t underestimate China’s ability to fight the trade war. The country is “seriously” considering restricting rare earth exports to the U.S., the editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party, said in a tweet. An official at the National Development & Reform Commission told CCTV that people in the country won’t be happy to see products made with exported rare earths being used to suppress China’s development.
The U.S. relies on China for about 80% of its imports of rare earths, the group of materials that are used in everything from electric cars to high-tech military equipment. Rare earths, which include elements such as cerium and dysprosium, are relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust but mine-able concentrations are less common than other ores.
China produces about 70% of the world’s mined rare earths and its industry is dominated by a handful of producers including China Northern Rare Earth, China Minmetals Rare Earth Co. (SZ:000831), Xiamen Tungsten and Chinalco Rare Earth & Metals Co. Some of the country’s listed rare earths stocks are small caps, making them easy targets of speculation.
The country has taken a proactive approach to managing the global market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a report, citing steady exports in the 1990s that depressed prices and a 40% reduction in its export quota in 2010 that led to a spike.
Price Boost
The latter move, which the World Trade Organization said in 2014 violated trade rules, helped highlight how dependent the global manufacturing sector was on China, according to BofAML. It led to companies finding ways to use fewer rare earths when manufacturing goods and some countries developing their own supplies. In Australia, Lynas Corp., the biggest producer of rare earth products outside China, rose to the highest intraday level in a year.
“It’s unlikely that China will impose a total ban on rare earth exports to U.S., but it can boost the prices of the resources by imposing stricter production quotas at home,” said Dai Ming, a Shanghai-based fund manager with Hengsheng Asset Management Co. “It won’t hurt demand much as the materials are irreplaceable in some high-tech industries, meaning the U.S. will just have to stomach the higher costs. No matter what kind of curbs China will consider on rare earths, domestic miners would be the biggest winners. ”
Producers may also benefit from a rise in rare earth prices after China was reported to have halted imports of rare earth ore from Myanmar on in mid-May. CICC said companies that are set to benefit from rising prices include China Northern Rare Earth, Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co. (SS:600259) and permanent magnet makers like Ningbo  Yunsheng  Co. (SS:600366), Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech Co.(SZ:000970) and Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material (SZ:300224).

1520,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 11:20PM ET</span>","Japan stocks to rise 6% by year-end, trade spats seen easing: Reuters poll","By Ayai Tomisawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Expectations that the U.S.-China trade dispute will eventually ease should help Japanese stocks recover by end-December to show a gain of 6% from last week's closing level, a Reuters poll found.
Median estimates from 28 analysts and fund managers polled in the past week put the Nikkei benchmark at 22,375 by the year-end.
Forecasts ranged from 19,500 to 25,000, or a fall of 8% to an 18% gain from where it closed last week at 21,117.
Worries the trade war between the United States and China could derail global growth have hurt stocks this month, with chip-related stocks battered by Washington's blacklisting of Huawei Technologies.
Still, a majority of market players expect U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will reach a deal in the end.
""Trump is giving China a difficult time, but the market thinks that he would not push China too far to the point where his own economy slides into a correction,"" said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief executive of Investrust, who forecasts the Nikkei to trade at 24,500 in December.
""It looks like we are seeing the worst now, so the market expects that it will only become better from now on,"" he said.
Takashi Ito, an equity market strategist at Nomura Securities, noted that not all industries are affected by the trade war and Japanese earnings are not expected to deteriorate sharply.
Ito estimates the Nikkei's earnings per share (EPS) to be around 1,750 yen for the year ending March 2020, which would be little changed from current levels. He expects the Nikkei to end the year at 22,500, marking a rise of 7% from last week's close.
Even if a deal to end the trade war was reached next month, just how unscathed the U.S. economy emerges from the trade war remains a big risk for the global economy and the share market, analysts said.
""Although I expect the U.S. and China will reach an agreement at the G20 in June, the global economy is seeing a slowdown and it's highly possible that the Japanese stock market will enter a downward trend,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, senior fund manager at Dalton Capital Japan.
He expects the Nikkei to trade at 20,000 at the year end, a fall of 5% from now, before it will rise to 22,000 in June next year.
Market observers say another main focus is whether the government will proceed with a sales tax hike planned in October and its impact on consumption. 
On Friday, Kyodo news reported Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was ""basically"" not considering seeking voter consent with a snap election if the government were to delay a planned sales tax hike.

While the deal awaits a ruling from the U.S. Department of Justice, interested parties are already preparing bids. The sale process is expected to begin after the Justice Department's review.
Q Link Wireless, a prepaid brand and the third-largest provider of federally assisted wireless plans, is putting together a package to bid for Boost with private equity backing and could pay between $1.8 billion to $3 billion, founder and Chief Executive Issa Asad told Reuters. 
The price will depend on the quality of Boost's customers, such as their level of churn, or the rate of customer cancellations, the devices they are using, and what type of phone plan they are on, none of which the companies have disclosed, he said. 
This month, analysts at Cowen estimated Boost has 7 million to 8 million customers and a transaction could be valued at $4.5 billion if the deal included wireless spectrum, or the airwaves that carry data, and facilities. Sprint has not disclosed the number of Boost customers. 
Stephen Stokols, chief executive officer of prepaid wireless company FreedomPop, said an undisclosed private equity group he is speaking with have placed Boost's future value at about $4 billion, such as in an initial public offering.
While FreedomPop is not a bidder, Stokols said he is advising a private equity group preparing a bid. If that bid succeeds, he believes the group would combine their acquisition with FreedomPop and have him lead a combined company with the Boost assets.
Peter Adderton, founder of Boost Mobile who sold the U.S. business to Nextel in 2004, which was then acquired by Sprint, has also said he is interested in buying back Boost. He declined to comment on his valuation for the business. 
Adderton said he and his lawyers have urged regulators to require T-Mobile and Sprint to also divest wireless spectrum to ensure Boost will be a viable competitor in the market.
Adderton added that regulators must also ensure the new T-Mobile does not employ anticompetitive practices to harm Boost, and the contract between the companies should be non-exclusive, which would allow Boost to buy network access from other carriers.
The current sale agreement is devoid of details, but with the right terms, ""we can create a dynamic player that will compete in the market,"" Adderton said of Boost.
T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",HSBC plans retail wealth headcount boost; eyes Singapore expansion,"By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC plans to boost its Asia retail wealth management staff by about 300 by end of this year, with Europe's biggest lender by assets sharpening its focus on Singapore to add to its presence in core markets of Hong Kong and China.
London-headquartered HSBC, which makes more than 80% of its profit in Asia, will boost its wealth staff in Singapore by 50 and launch new digital offerings this year, said Kevin Martin, Asia Pacific head of retail banking and wealth management.
While HSBC did not disclose its wealth management headcount in Singapore at present, the bank's business of offering advice and investment products to affluent clients in the city-state is smaller compared to its presence in China and Hong Kong.
""It's fair to say that our entire business in Singapore underperformed, and we haven't hidden from that fact,"" Martin told Reuters in a recent interview, referring to the bank's retail banking and wealth management unit.
""As we build Asia wealth ... there is a really significant opportunity in Singapore, not just onshore Singapore, but offshore Singapore,"" he said, adding the bank expects the country to be a ""growth engine"" over the next few years.
HSBC's retail banking and wealth management division serves clients with less than $5 million of investable assets, while those with more than that threshold are taken up by the bank's private banking unit.
Chief Executive John Flint last year said building a leading wealth management business, mainly in Greater China and Southeast Asia, was key for accelerated revenue growth in Asia, where individual wealth is growing at the fastest pace globally.
Singapore's high net worth population, those with investable assets of $1 million or more, rose 11.5% in 2017, as per consultant Capgemini's latest wealth report, ahead of China's 11.2%, Japan's 9.4% and Australia's 9.2%.
Of respondents in a survey conducted by trade publication Asian Private Banker in July last year, 58% ranked Singapore as the most preferred offshore wealth management hub, followed by Hong Kong, Switzerland and London.
HSBC is looking to target both onshore as well as offshore clients, with a large number of rich individuals in China, India and other Southeast Asian nations looking for wealth management services in Singapore, Martin said.
In Singapore, HSBC will compete with global rivals such as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) PLC, as well as Southeast Asia's biggest lender DBS Group Holdings Ltd which has a strong presence in the mass-affluent wealth management business.
As part of its plans to grow its Asia wealth business, HSBC also intends to ramp up its insurance distribution and product offerings in Hong Kong, China and Singapore this year, Martin said.
HSBC's life insurance business within the wealth management unit posted 66% growth in revenue to $793 million in the first quarter of this year compared to the year-earlier period.

""We are not even partly done in terms of the upside for insurance ... And as we have increased distribution, provided all products and put digital capabilities in place and promoted the brand, the growth you see will continue.""

1528,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",Fingerprints and finances: next Wells Fargo CEO will be under regulatory microscope,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From submitting their fingerprints to giving up their tax records,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's next chief executive will go through a vetting process that could rival that of top U.S. government officials.
    Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said last week he would invoke a little-known law to review Wells Fargo's board pick to replace Tim Sloan, who in March became the second CEO to leave the bank amid a series of customer abuse scandals. 
    Created during the savings-and-loan crisis, the 1989 law allows regulators to vet and veto candidates for senior roles at banks, but that power is typically reserved for financially troubled firms.
Regulatory sources said the review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was so unusual because Wells Fargo, the nation's fourth-largest lender, is both financially sound and so big. 
The CEO candidate must complete a 17-page document detailing their work history, qualifications, finances and business dealings. They must also agree to hand over their tax records, provide copies of their fingerprints and possibly submit to a background check, according to public OCC documents. 
Otting will have some discretion, however, as to just how far the agency goes in using its extensive powers to dig into the candidate's background. 
    The unusual burden underscores how much work the San Francisco-based bank still has to do to regain the trust of its regulators and further raises the bar for its CEO search.
""Finding a new CEO was going to be difficult before, but this has made it even harder,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research & Trading. ""The difficulty was upped to 10.""
    Regulators expect bank CEOs to be suitable for the top job and do not typically become involved in the selection process. 
    ""That reflects a lack of trust in the institution's ability to solve their problems,"" said Thomas Vartanian, a law professor at George Mason University and former OCC official. 
    Another former OCC official who spent decades with the agency said he could not recall a comparable case.
    ""What makes it unusual is it's in a bank of this size,"" said the former official, who requested anonymity to discuss an enforcement matter. ""It shows the OCC is taking this seriously.""
    Wells Fargo and the OCC declined to comment. Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm hired to find Sloan's replacement, did not respond to requests for comment.
    If Otting decides to use all his powers, the vetting process could resemble that undergone by Senate-nominated officials. 
    Candidates would have to detail a range of firms they are or have been associated with, and any parallel discussions with potential rival employers. 
    They would also have to disclose if they have been involved in a failed regulatory application, such as for a merger or license, or associated with a firm that failed, defaulted on an obligation, or was subject to enforcement actions, criminal action, litigation or other legal woes.
    The background probe could also draw on information provided by the FBI, state regulators, the Treasury's anti-money laundering bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Homeland Security, among others. Minor traffic violations need not be included.
    The regulatory and political scrutiny ""is going to discourage some candidates,"" said Steve Potter, CEO of Odgers Berndtson US, an executive search firm that has helped other banks hire CEOs.
    Extensive vetting has claimed candidates for government posts, including Andrew Puzder, U.S. President Donald Trump's first pick for Labor Secretary. He withdrew from consideration in 2017 after it emerged he had employed an undocumented housekeeper.
    The OCC has up to 90 days to screen the bank's pick and discretion to reject them if they do not have the ""competence, experience, character, or integrity"" for the job, according to the OCC documents. Wells Fargo can appeal a rejection.
    Otting has not said if he will use all his vetting powers and can waive those he feels are redundant. 
But he is unlikely to cut corners amid pressure from congressional Democrats, who have frequently accused the OCC of being too soft on the industry, Boltansky said.

    ""Why would Otting use up any of his limited political capital to help a bank that continues to trip on its own shoelaces?""

1529,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",'Toxic cocktail' brewing for U.S. asset managers: hedge fund investor Kass,"By Jennifer Ablan
(Reuters) - Hedge fund investor Doug Kass said on Tuesday that he is shorting several investment managers, including T. Rowe Price Group Inc and Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE:BEN), as they could be ""the next group to feel disruption"" and may be headed for large share price falls.
Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, said in a note to clients that he does not believe investors are aware of how commoditized the money management business has become. ""As an example, a year ago, a boutique fund manager, Salt Financial, began to pay clients five basis points a year to manage their money!"" Kass wrote. 
""More and more money is going to passive products and strategies and away from active managers - who have failed to meet the returns of the indices,"" Kass said. ""Passive products are by definition not as energetic - it is a strategy that trades less actively - compared to active managers."" 
More importantly, the fee differential between active and passive managers is wide - with passive providing an attractive low-cost fee alternative to active, Kass said.
Overall, a ""toxic cocktail may loom ahead for investment managers,"" he said. 
Kass predicted lower stock market prices; less volume and activity as low-cost passive strategies continue to replace high cost active strategies; lower transaction pricing (commissions) provided by online services like E-Trade and Fidelity Investments; reduced investment management fees, reflecting the continued share gains of passive products and strategies over the active ones. 
Even many of the larger money management firms, including Fidelity and The Vanguard Group are offering some no-fee based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), he said.
""I expect the competitive challenges to active managers like T. Rowe and Franklin to intensify in the coming years,"" Kass said.

Kass warned that larger brokerages such as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) which are moving their business mix towards the retail investor and have very high cost fee-based wrap products ""are particularly vulnerable to the trends discussed.""

1530,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:45PM ET</span>",New York court dismisses whistleblower's libel suit against UBS,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - A New York appeals court has dismissed a U.S. whistleblower's $20 million libel suit against Swiss bank UBS, his former employer, concluding that statements the Zurich-based bank made about him were at least ""substantially true"".
Court documents dated May 21 showed that the appeals court upheld an earlier ruling dismissing claims that Bradley Birkenfeld brought against the bank in 2017, in which he accused UBS of acting with malice in making statements about him to the media.
Birkenfeld spent 2-1/2 years in prison for helping a billionaire client evade taxes, but got a $104 million award from U.S. tax authorities for his role as a whistleblower. He had provided tips that led to UBS being fined $780 million in 2010 by U.S. authorities for helping wealthy Americans hide up to $20 billion.
In his libel lawsuit in the New York state court in Manhattan, Birkenfeld contended that UBS sought to block his efforts to expose the bank's ""decades-long wrongdoing"" and to undercut credibility and sales of a book he had written. 
In statements to U.S. media, UBS had called Birkenfeld's book an ""often unsubstantiated recollection"" and said he had been convicted of ""having lied to U.S. authorities."" 
The appeals panel, in its decision this week, concluded that UBS's statements were not inaccurate.
Birkenfeld ""admitted to illegal conduct, including, inter alia, that he 'prepared false and misleading IRS Forms' and assisted 'wealthy U.S. clients in concealing their ownership of the assets held offshore,'"" the judges wrote. 
""These admitted facts support the conclusion that (UBS's) quoted statements... were, at a minimum, substantially true, if not absolutely true.""

A spokeswoman for UBS declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Quentin Koffey, who joined D.E. Shaw & Co two years ago from Elliott Management Corp to lead its shareholder activism strategy, has left to join Senator Investment Group LP, the firms told Reuters on Thursday.
The move is a setback for D.E. Shaw, which is seeking to emulate Elliott as a generalist hedge fund with strong activist leanings, advocating for major changes at companies, such as putting themselves up for sale.
Some funds are using activism to distinguish themselves with strategies that cannot be replaced by cheaper index funds, as investors spurn hedge funds with high fees and lackluster returns, pulling out billions from the $3 trillion industry. 
Koffey left D.E. Shaw this week and no replacement has been announced internally, people familiar with the matter said. He will start work in July at Senator, an 11-year-old hedge fund which specializes in so-called event-driven investing such as mergers, one of the sources added.
""We do not expect any material changes to our activist positions due to Quentin's departure,"" D.E. Shaw spokesman Randall Whitestone said by email. ""Activism is an important tool that we will continue to use when necessary to create shareholder value.""
""As the pace of change in business accelerates, there is a compelling opportunity for us to work collaboratively with management teams to help them strengthen their businesses and create value for shareholders,"" Senator founders Alexander Klabin and Douglas Silverman said in an emailed statement.
Koffey could not be reached for comment.
D.E. Shaw, known for its computer-driven trading, became a bigger presence in shareholder activism under Koffey. With bets on home improvement retailer Lowe's Companies and grain trader Bunge Ltd, Koffey convinced these companies to shake up their boards.
Senator is less than one-fifth the size of D.E. Shaw, with about $7.7 billion in assets. Senator has been looking to hire someone for over a year to boost its shareholder activism, according to the sources.
At Senator, Koffey will work with a research team, staffed by former McKinsey consultants, who are seeking to invest major stakes in companies with managements it can work with to make improvements, one of the sources said.
Koffey spent seven years working at Paul Singer's Elliott, widely viewed as one of Wall Streets most successful activist investors, before moving to D.E. Shaw in 2017.

The net inflow into equities totaled $900 million in the week to Wednesday, the first in 10 weeks, the bank said, citing EPFR data. That is eclipsed by the $135 billion that has left stocks year to date.
Some $3.9 billion left emerging market equities, the biggest since June last year.
Global equities, which rallied 15% until U.S. President Donald Trump upped the ante in early May, have retreated as tit-for-tat tariffs kicked-in and fading hopes of a trade deal with China in the near-term kept investors away from risky assets.
Washington's Huawei ban added to trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and triggered worries about a prolonged standoff over technology.
""U.S.-China tech cold war to run for years, political shift to protectionism and redistribution well underway in West,"" BAML said.
Global bonds saw inflows of $6.4 billion, adding to the $158 billion that's already gone into safe-haven debt this year.
Despite growing worries over a trade war, BAML said it still expects new highs in risk assets this summer and cannot see ""Trump escalating China trade war from here"".

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched the first batch of 60 small satellites into low-Earth orbit on Thursday for Musk's new Starlink internet service.
A Falcon 9 rocket carrying the satellites blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at about 10:30 p.m. local time (0230 GMT Friday), clearing a key hurdle for a business venture that Musk hopes will generate much-needed cash for his larger ambitions in space.
The launch came a week after two back-to-back countdowns for the mission were scrubbed - once due to high winds over the Cape and the next night in order to update satellite software and ""triple-check"" all systems.
The 60 satellites flown into space were released into orbit as planned about an hour after Thursday's launch, and the Falcon 9's main-stage reusable booster rocket flew back to Earth for a successful landing on a barge floating in the Atlantic.
SpaceX said it would probably take another day to learn whether all the satellites deployed were functioning properly. Each weighs about 500 pounds (227 kg), making them the heaviest payload carried aloft by SpaceX to date.
They represent the initial phase of a planned constellation capable of beaming signals for high-speed internet service from space to paying customers around the globe.
Musk has said he sees the new Starlink venture as an important new revenue stream for his California-based Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, whose launch service income he expects to top out at around $3 billion a year.
He told reporters last week that makes Starlink pivotal in helping pay for his larger goals of developing a new spacecraft to fly paying customers to the moon and for eventually trying to colonize Mars.
""We think this is a key stepping stone on the way toward establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the moon,"" said billionaire Musk, who is also chief executive officer of automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
At least 12 launches carrying similar payloads are needed to achieve constant internet coverage of most of the world, Musk said. For now, Starlink is only authorized for U.S. operations.
Musk faces stiff competition. Airbus SE-backed OneWeb launched its own clutch of satellites in February, while LeoSat Enterprises and Canada's Telesat are also working to build data networks. 
In each network, the tiny satellites orbit closer to Earth than traditional communications satellites, a technological shift made possible by advances in laser technology and computer chips.

Musk said SpaceX would begin approaching customers later this year or next year. As many as 2,000 satellites will be launched per year, with the ultimate objective of placing up to 12,000 into orbit.

Gartner also said Huawei continued to reduce the gap with Samsung (KS:005930), but warned that growth could be limited in the near term.
The United States on May 15 blocked Huawei from buying U.S. goods saying the company was involved in activities contrary to national security. The Trump administration softened its stance last week by granting Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19. 
Gartner said Samsung retained its top spot in worldwide smartphone sales, achieving a 19.2% market share in the first quarter of 2019. Huawei achieved the highest year-over-year growth among the world's top five - Samsung, Huawei, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Chinese smartphone makers OPPO and Vivo.
Huawei sold 58.4 million smartphone units in the quarter, with growth across all regions, the report showed.
Total global sales of smartphones to end users fell 2.7% in the quarter, with 373 million units sold 
Huawei did particularly well in two of its biggest markets, Europe and Greater China, where its smartphone sales grew by 69% and 33%, respectively. Huawei has a 29.5% market share of Greater China's smartphone market.
But the impact of the U.S. action against Huawei is likely to spook buyers. PriceSpy, a product comparison site that attracts an average of 14 million visitors per month, said last week that Huawei handsets were drawing fewer clicks from online shoppers. 
""Unavailability of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) apps and services on Huawei smartphones, if implemented, will upset Huawei's international smartphone business which is almost half of its worldwide phone business,"" Anshul Gupta, senior research director at Gartner, said. 
""Not the least it brings apprehension among buyers, limiting Huawei's growth in the near term,"" he added. 
Companies that have either shunned Huawei completely or restricted buying from the company include Google, Softbank's ARM,  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI), U.S. chipmakers  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Japanese electronics maker Panasonic Corp and BT Group's EE.

PARIS/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Airbus is mobilizing staff from outside Germany to assist with a tricky production ramp-up of A321 passenger jets at its plant in Hamburg, industry sources said.
The planemaker has faced a string of industrial problems at the plant, which is responsible for the in-demand A321 model - the largest member of the best-selling single-aisle A320 family.
Although single-aisle jets are increasingly standardized, manufacturing has been complicated by the fact that planes like the 180-240-seat A321 are in demand for long-range trips of up to eight or nine hours as airlines test out new markets.
Such long trips require new multi-class cabins, compared to short- or medium-range trips for which the A321 was originally designed, and Hamburg is the Airbus factory responsible for handling this type of work on the company's important cash cow.
Airbus is moving workers from other locations to help in the industrial recovery and to prepare for higher production. 
""There are staff shortages in Hamburg,"" a person familiar with the matter said.
""The long-range variant has three-class seating. This is a completely different technique and requires a lot more work... The management has miscalculated the number of hours required for the aircraft,"" a union source told Reuters separately.
Airbus is offering redeployment to some of the 3,500 staff who face losing jobs as output of the A380 superjumbo ends in 2021. It is upgrading some temporary workers to permanent contracts to work on the complex A321 ""Cabin Flex"" variant. 
""The A320 production generally, and especially in Hamburg, is ramping up,"" an Airbus spokesman said. 
""A321 Head of Versions (the first edition of a new cabin design) are exclusively built in Hamburg. To address the above challenges, attention and resources are shifting to Hamburg.""
Hamburg has felt the brunt of a race to meet growing jet demand because it is introducing new versions of the A321 just as overall production is running faster than ever. 
Production has however improved compared to last year, the company's new operations chief told reporters last week.

Airbus aims to increase production of single-aisle jets to 63 a month in 2021 from about 60 now and has been studying the possibility of 71 a month. Airbus says it will decide in the second half on any future output hikes.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",Asia's billionaires develop taste for boutique wealth managers,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Growing demand by Asia's rich for independent advisory services and access to a wide variety of investment products is spurring the surge of boutique wealth managers more associated with the established wealth hubs of Switzerland and London.
The boutiques, or so-called external asset managers (EAMs), mainly tap small-and-mid-level business owners and executives, who are typically out of reach for private banks, by leveraging their locally based advisers' contacts and family ties.
As a result, more and more private banks are also leaning on boutique managers to boost their assets in a region which is seeing the fastest billionaire population growth in the world.
While it is a long-established practice in developed wealth centers, with Switzerland and London home to over 2,000 EAMs each, industry officials say Asia has scope to multiply the current pool of less than 200 such boutique wealth managers.
Hong Kong-based Chi Man Kwan - a former private banker with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), who set up an independent asset management firm three years ago - is one of the beneficiaries of the growth.
""We are, as an industry, a lot younger than our counterparts in Europe,"" Kwan said. ""But if you benchmark us against the amount of wealth that is being created in Asia, it's the tip of the iceberg.""
Having started out by managing his parents' wealth, Kwan's Raffles Family Office now has 35 staff, $2 billion in assets and more than 70 clients. Kwan said his start-up would double the headcount and assets over the next two to three years.
EAMs offer investment advisory, tax and succession planning services to clients, and partner with the large wealth managers such as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and UBS to open accounts and execute deals.
As they are not tied to any particular private bank, they are free to offer bespoke and independent advisory services, a flexibility that Asia's rich find increasingly attractive.
EAMs account for up to 6 percent of total wealth management assets in Asia, according to a survey by trade publication Asian Private Banker. That will double over the next three to four years, industry executives told Reuters.
GROWING ROLE
The trend is getting a foothold in Asia at a time when the overall individual wealth is expanding.
Asia Pacific saw total household wealth grow 3% last year to $114.6 trillion from a year ago, making it the largest wealth region globally, a Credit Suisse global wealth report shows.
""EAM accounts are relatively low-maintenance accounts for private banks,"" said Alexander Florsheim, chief investment officer at Carret Private, which manages more than $1 billion in assets in Asia.
""Private banks don't have to spend much and pay incentives to in-house relationship managers for originating the business.""
 Schroders  (LON:SDR) Wealth Management announced in February it was acquiring the wealth management business of Singapore-based independent asset manager Thirdrock Group, which had $3 billion of assets. 
RISING COSTS 
Besides UBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer, who work with EAMs in Asia, Bank of Singapore set up a desk last year to work with independent asset managers covering Greater China and North Asia.
The head of that desk, Jeffrey Peng, said partnering with independent managers helped it access clients in different markets, and saved costs as the work was split between the bank and boutiques.
Noah Kan, head of Julius Baer's intermediaries business in Southeast Asia, said working with EAMs was as profitable as the Swiss private bank's direct business, and it would remain relevant to its growth strategy in the region.
Credit Suisse, which provides services to over 1,000 EAMs globally, said in the past three years it had sharpened focus on working with the local asset managers in Asia Pacific (APAC) instead of the ""satellite offices"" of their European peers.
""Moreover, the EAM penetration in APAC is still lower than that in other regions and the industry is expected to grow as a result of the local wealth creation and increasing awareness,"" its Greater China head of EAM business Franck Chen said.
UBS did not respond to a request for comment.
Many rich individuals prefer to work with boutiques due to their transparent fee model, primarily a management fee charged as a percentage of the client assets.
""Only if a client's portfolio does well, then your firm earns more and if clients suffer, then your firm will share the pain. So it's your firm's incentive to ensure that you do well for your clients,"" Singapore-based AL Wealth Partners co-founder Anthonia Hui said.
The rising cost of hiring wealth advisers from bigger global private banks and meeting compliance requirements are however a challenge for boutiques, even as they run operations with 20-100 people and avoid flashy office locations.
Most of the smaller independent managers are not equipped to make huge investments in systems, compliance, and people, said Olivier Mivelaz, who started wealth management platform Swiss Asia in Singapore in 2004 and now manages $3 billion in assets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors continued a four-week long retreat from the U.S. stock market last week by unloading a net of nearly $9.6 billion in assets from domestic mutual and exchange-traded funds, according to data released Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute. 
The nearly $9.6 billion in outflows came on the heels of a $10.1 billion decline in net assets from the week before, prolonging a streak in which investors have sold into a rising stock market. For the year to date, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 14%, thanks to the Federal Reserve's decision to pause its pace of interest rate hikes. 
Yet signs that the trade war between the United States and China - the world's two largest economies - could continue has made investors increasingly skittish that the stock market rally could be slowing. 
Since January, investors have pulled a net of nearly $40 billion out of domestic stock funds. Taxable and municipal bond funds, meanwhile, have grabbed slightly more than $168 billion in new assets over the same time, including approximately $1.6 billion in new assets last week. 

World stock funds lost approximately $1.8 billion in net assets last week, a reversal of the roughly $1.8 billion the category pulled in the week before. For the year to date, world stock funds have dropped $5.3 billion in net assets.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:35PM ET</span>",Hedge fund manager David Tepper plans to send investors' money back,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire David Tepper plans to turn his hedge fund Appaloosa Management into a family office where he will invest his personal fortune and return capital to outside clients at some point, a person familiar with his plans said on Thursday.
Appaloosa, which was founded by Tepper, has gained an average of 25% each year for more than a quarter century and manages $13 billion in capital.
Tepper, 61, is one of the $3-trillion hedge fund industry's most closely watched fund managers, having earned billions when he bet on banks during the tail end of the financial crisis.
His decision to stop managing money for clients comes at a challenging time for hedge funds and as some other prominent managers, including Highfields Capital Management's Jon Jacobson, have announced plans to scale back and concentrate on managing their personal fortunes.
Lackluster returns and lofty fees charged by hedge funds have prompted investors to head for the exits, and they withdrew $15 billion in the first quarter, according to eVestment data, in a fourth straight quarter of redemptions.
A year ago, Tepper bought the National Football League team, the Carolina Panthers, joining other prominent investors, like Avenue Capital Group's Marc Lasry, who have bought sports teams.
For years, Tepper has been careful about not letting his fund grow too large and has periodically sent cash back to his investors, often at the end of the year. 
Now, he is finalizing plans to give it all back, though he has yet to decide on the timing.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Huawei reviewing FedEx relationship, says packages 'diverted'","By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei is reviewing its relationship with FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) after it claimed the U.S. package delivery company, without detailed explanation, diverted two parcels destined for Huawei addresses in Asia to the United States and attempted to reroute two others.
Huawei told Reuters on Friday that FedEx diverted two packages sent from Japan and addressed to Huawei in China to the United States, and attempted to divert two more packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei offices elsewhere in Asia, all without authorization, providing images of FedEx tracking records.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the records. Shown the images of the tracking records, FedEx declined to make any comment, saying company policy prevented it from disclosing customer information. 
Huawei said the four packages only contained documents and ""no technology,"" which Reuters was unable to independently confirm. 
Huawei declined to elaborate on why it thought the packages were diverted. 
""The recent experiences where important commercial documents sent via FedEx were not delivered to their destination, and instead were either diverted to, or were requested to be diverted to, FedEx in the United States, undermines our confidence,"" Joe Kelly, a spokesman for Huawei, told Reuters.
""We will now have to review our logistics and document delivery support requirements as a direct result of these incidents,"" the spokesman said.
Huawei acknowledged to Reuters that one package originating in Vietnam was received by Friday, and the other was on its way, according to FedEx tracking records provided by Huawei.
FedEx spokeswoman Maury Donahue told Reuters the packages were ""misrouted in error"". She acknowledged in an earlier statement that the U.S. Department of Commerce had recently added Chinese companies and affiliates to its ""Entity List"", but did not elaborate.
FedEx was not requested to divert the packages by any other party, she added.
""This is an isolated issue limited to a very small number of packages,"" said FedEx, referring to the four parcels affected. ""We are aware of all shipments at issue and are working directly with our customers to return the packages to their possession.""
FedEx China on Tuesday apologized on its Chinese social media account for the ""mishandling"" of Huawei packages and confirmed there was no ""external pressure"" to divert packages. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce did not reply to a request for comment on whether the incident might be related to its move on May 16 to add Huawei to the so-called ""Entity List,"" preventing it buying certain items from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.
FORMAL COMPLAINT 
The United States believes Huawei, the world's largest telecom network gear maker leading the way in creating the next generation of wireless networks known as 5G, is a potential espionage threat because of its close ties with the Chinese government.
Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services.
The issue has become a flashpoint in an escalating trade battle between the world's two biggest economies.
The two packages sent on May 19 and May 20 from Tokyo, intended for Huawei in China, ended up in Memphis, Tennessee, the headquarters of the U.S. company, by May 23, according to images of FedEx tracking records shown to Reuters by Huawei. 
The two packages originating from Hanoi on May 17, destined for Huawei's Hong Kong and Singapore offices, were held up after arriving in local FedEx stations in Hong Kong and Singapore on May 21 for ""delivery exception,"" according to other images Huawei showed Reuters.
According to FedEx's website, the status ""exception"" means an unexpected event is preventing delivery of a package, for example a customs delay, a holiday, or no one being available to accept delivery. FedEx declined to give details on what the exception was in this case. 
According to Huawei, a FedEx customer service representative in Vietnam replied to their inquiry on May 22 when two expected packages did not arrive on time, saying: ""Please be informed that FDX SG received notification from FDX US to hold and return the package to US. Hence, the shipment is not deliver to consignee and now being hold at FDX station and under process to RTS it (return to sender),"" the representative wrote in broken English, according to an email Huawei showed to Reuters. 
Huawei told Reuters that both Vietnam packages were sent by its shipping agent, a contractor to Huawei whom it did not identify, and contained urgent documents. It said the shipping agent refused permission for FedEx to send the packages to the United States and instructed they be returned, Huawei told Reuters. Reuters could not confirm that. 
Huawei told Reuters it only learned that the Japan-originated packages, which were sent by suppliers that it did not identify, had been diverted to the United States after checking FedEx's tracking record. 

The company said it has lodged a formal complaint with China's postal regulator, which it said is investigating the incident. China's State Postal Bureau did not return a request for comment.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:32PM ET</span>",Exclusive: IKEA to revamp app as store strategy shifts,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - IKEA is launching a new app to allow customers to shop remotely for products they can visualize in the context of their own homes, lessening the need for them to travel to its vast network of self-service, out-of-town stores. 
The world's biggest furniture retailer is shifting its business model away from pushing customers through its suburban stores toward making shopping easier online, and downtown.
""It is a completely new experience,"" Barbara Martin Coppola, chief digital officer at IKEA, told Reuters in an interview. ""The app is combined with the store experience, with the online experience.""
The app will be launched first in France and the Netherlands and will be rolled out in IKEA'S top eight markets - including Germany, the United States and China - by the end of the year.
It will allow users to visualize how their homes could be furnished with IKEA products by inputting room dimensions and choosing from different tastes and life stages. They can then order those products through the app. 
IKEA originally launched an augmented reality app in 2017 which allowed customers to see how more than 2,000 items would fit into their homes, but they could not shop from it.
IKEA's main app carries its full range but products are still displayed in isolation, and customers can only add items to a shopping list for use during a store visit. Remote shopping can only be done through the IKEA website. 
Fast-growing British online furniture retailer Made.com last month launched a new interior design service for a fee, which uses artificial intelligence to recommend products and 3D technology to show what the furnished room will look like. 
Other players experimenting with augmented reality include Williams-Sonoma, which bought 3D imaging firm Outward in 2017, and U.S. startup Modsy, which raised $37 million this month to expand in 360-degree room and furniture imaging.
IKEA's new app will complement the group's move to trial smaller downtown stores with a narrower range, like the one it opened in the heart of Paris earlier this month.
""People who go to the stores might want to access the full range of IKEA, and that is when digital innovations come in handy,"" Martin Coppola said on the sidelines of the World Retail Congress earlier this month. 
The app will allow shoppers to point their phone at a chair to see other textures or colors, or to see it in the context of a room or alongside similar products in the same range.
IKEA has stepped up efforts to respond to the rise of e-commerce since Jesper Brodin took over in 2017 as chief executive of the Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores. 
IKEA has been trialing city-center formats including a dedicated kitchen showroom in Stockholm, a London store offering personalized planning for home renovations, and one for living room furniture in Madrid.
As e-commerce grows, Martin Coppola said IKEA might reconfigure its out-of-town sites, incorporating what it is learning from its downtown pilot stores and possibly using more of the space as dedicated warehouses to prepare online orders.
Meanwhile, Made.com is ramping up its offline presence as it expands in Europe. It launched a pop-up showroom in Stockholm this month just a block away from IKEA's kitchen store, and is displaying plush armchairs in Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.
""We are in discussions with other airports,"" Chief Executive Philippe Chainieux told Reuters. ""Every single customer journey starts online and ends online but they still need to have the capacity to touch and feel.""

Made.com is also being creative with the eight showrooms it already operates, such as offering online customers the opportunity to connect with a store manager by webcam so they can see a piece of furniture from all angles.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:31PM ET</span>","Walmart taps ex-Google, Amazon employee as new chief technology officer","By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc appointed Suresh Kumar, a former employee of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), as its new chief technology officer as it tries to fuel an internal tech transformation and boost its e-commerce business.
Kumar most recently worked as a vice president and general manager of display, video, app ads and analytics at Google. He will directly report to the retailer's chief executive, Doug McMillon, Walmart said on Tuesday. 
""Suresh has a unique understanding of the intersection of technology and retail, including supply chain, and has deep experience in advertising, cloud, and machine learning,"" McMillon said in a news release. ""He has a track record of working in partnership with business teams to drive results.""
Kumar's appointment comes as Walmart is undertaking massive investments in its e-commerce business to compete more effectively with Amazon and preparing for a big splash in the world of advertising. Reuters was first to report Walmart's planned meeting with large corporate ad buyers in New York this week.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer's e-commerce success has been erratic over the years, but sales growth in the past few quarters has shown signs of consistency. In February, Walmart said it expects its e-commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments, but that it is focused on increasing return customer visits and strengthening its online product assortment.
Kumar will have an expanded role and will be responsible for not just the United States but will oversee technology globally at Walmart, including the retailer's warehouse club chain Sam's Club. 
He will assume the responsibilities of former CTO Jeremy King, who left the retailer in March and was responsible for revamping Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce technology platform by making it faster, more competitive and customer-friendly - all of which have been key to the retailer’s fight against its e-commerce rivals.

Before Google, Kumar worked at  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and also spent 15 years at Amazon.com in various leadership roles, including vice president of technology for retail systems and operations.

1547,By Investing.com,"<span>May 28, 2019 04:48PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Slips as Trump Sparks Fears of Prolonged Trade War ,"Investing.com – U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday on rising fears of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war after President Donald Trump said the U.S. was ""not ready"" to make a trade deal.
The S&P 500 fell 0.84%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.39% and the Dow slumped 0.93%.
“I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it,” Trump said Monday at a joint press conference in Tokyo alongside Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. “They would like to make a deal. We’re not ready to make a deal.”
The latest update on trade comes in the wake of escalating U.S.-China tensions after Trump hiked tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.
Beijing hit back by raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of American products.
The increasing investor jitters over U.S.-China trade put U.S. Treasury yields on the back foot as they fell to their lowest level since September 2017, forcing banking stocks lower.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) closed lower, keeping the broader financials in the red.
Falling energy stocks also contributed to the slump, despite a rise in oil prices on expectations for reduced domestic supplies after flooding dented crude flow distributions from the main U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Okla.
In tech, chipmakers, which are particularly vulnerable to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, remained under pressure, though Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) proved an exception to the overall decline.
AMD rallied 9.8% after announcing the launch of several 7nm products across all markets within the next six months.
Rival chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell nearly 2.5% on the news, as Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsey said that with AMD set to launch 7nm Ryzen 3 PC and Rome server CPUs in mid-2019, Intel will ""no longer be able to rely on its n-node silicon advantage, and will instead lean on its incumbency and breadth of silicon as its 10nm chips are not expected out until late 2019 in PCs and 2020 in servers.""
In other company news, Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) accelerated 7% after proposing a merger with  Renault  (PA:RENA) in a bid to form the world's third-largest automaker. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) both fell.
In economic news, U.S. consumer confidence overshot economists' expectations, rising to a six-month high on the back of ongoing strength in the labor market.

Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is expected to report a profit of 59 cents per share on sales of about $1.9 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Comparable sales are expected to have fallen 1.3% for the quarter, according to Briefing.com. Dick's is believed to be vulnerable to tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods. The stock fell 2.3% on Tuesday. It is still up 14.7% this year but off 3.3% in May.
Last month,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) resumed coverage of the stock with a neutral rating and a $40 price target, noting that increased online competition will likely continue to weigh on margins.
Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is expected to post a loss of 43 cents per share, with sales coming in at about $733.4 million. Shares are up 24.7% this year but off 16.6% this year.

2. API Inventories Due as Driving Season Gears Up
The American Petroleum Institute's petroleum data, which showed a surprise fifth-straight build last week, will likely come under scrutiny on Wednesday, as the tug of war on oil prices between the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and escalating tensions in Middle East persist.
""The escalating trade war has helped pressure oil prices, yet tensions with Iran and attacks on oil tankers and other risks are keeping oil strong,"" said Phil Flynn at Price Futures in Chicago.
WTI crude rose 0.9 % to settle at $59.14 a barrel Tuesday on expectations for reduced domestic supplies after flooding dented crude flow distributions from the main U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Okla.
U.S. oil prices could be set to add to gains in the near future in the wake of the start of the U.S. driving season, which typically sees a rise in demand for fuel, generating bullish crude drawdowns.
Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA said that while concerns about the U.S.-China trade situation continue to linger, the summer driving season typically produces an ""overwhelming spike in demand in the U.S. and everywhere else.""
""It looks like there could be some upside,” Yawger added.

1549,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2019 02:30PM ET</span>",This Is What It Takes to Get $1 Worth of Venezuelan Bolivars,"(Bloomberg) -- I tried my fair share of ATMs in the past few weeks looking for cash. No luck. Most of the times I approach them only to see people walking out, putting their debit cards away and shaking their heads saying “no cash.”
One of those times, I tried to park in a lot near the ATM, and the attendant warned me the fee was 1,500 bolivars -- cash only. I spent some time explaining I was there to get cash in the first place and had no way of paying him if I wasn’t successful. He clearly heard this from others before and cut me short: “Cash only.” Begrudgingly, I parked a couple of blocks away.
That’s the thing about cash these days in Venezuela, it’s useless except for just a number of cases -- some parking lots, gasoline and public transportation -- in which it’s the only option you have. In some areas, like the airport, there are separate cash registers, which means having cash grants you the superpower of skipping lines made up of dozens of people using debit or credit cards.
This isn’t a new phenomenon in Venezuela, where cash has been scarce for about three years with few moments of respite, yet even with the influx of new bills after the government dropped five zeroes of the currency in August, we’re back to trying our luck at the ATMs.
I decided to visit a bank branch that’s tucked away in the second floor of a shopping mall in Eastern Caracas on Tuesday and I couldn’t believe my eyes. Not only was there cash being handed out, but the line was a manageable wait of about 10 people. After the usual chit-chat with the folks in line, where you mostly complain about prices (“Have you seen the price of soda these days?”), I walk up the bank teller. I hand her my ID and say: “I’m here for cash.”
She nods and hands me a wad of cash through the window, 6,000 bolivars consisting of 60 bills of 100-bolivar denomination, without even having told her how much I wanted. Cash is so worthless here -- that amounted to all of $1 -- they just assume you want as much as the government allows you."

Shares of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), which hit an all-time high of $95.95 last week, fell more than 5.5% after JPMorgan downgraded the company to equal weight from overweight, but maintained its $84 price target on the stock. The stock has tripled this year.
""Although we remain very positive on Roku as a long-term nexus play on growth in smart TVs and streaming/OTT video, we believe the recent run and higher valuation combined with raised expectations creates increased near-term risk,"" JPMorgan said.
The fundamental backdrop for Roku - brick and mortar retail positioning, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) best sellers, key OEM partnerships and AVOD channel partner commentary - continues to look strong, according to the bank.
The bank also cited several downside risks to its $84 price target on Roku, including a potential acquisition target, investor focus on active user growth, progress on the international front and scarcity of investible streaming names as the biggest risks to its ""tactical"" downgrade.
Roku's most recent all-time highs arrived on the back of better-than-expected earnings as customers continue to sign up to its platform, with two million accounts added in the first quarter.
The company estimated that more than a third of smart TVs sold in the U.S. in the first quarter were Roku TVs made by third-party manufacturers. It is also expected to benefit from Walt  Disney  's (NYSE:DIS) and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches of over-the-top streaming services this year.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 01:15PM ET</span>","UBS believes regulatory costs have peaked, compliance chief says","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS expects regulatory costs to remain significant over the coming years but to fall from the high levels the Swiss bank has faced since 2014, its compliance chief said on Tuesday.
Banks around the world have had to comply with a host of new rules brought in after the 2008 financial crisis to bolster the industry's health.
""We've had ten years of enormous regulation,"" Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer Markus Ronner said at a round table for journalists on Tuesday. ""That has tied up enormous resources."" 
From 2014 through 2018, UBS spent 3.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.48 billion) meeting new regulatory requirements, 1.5 billion francs of which were spent adjusting its corporate legal structure, in part to be able to wind down various parts of its business.
Further outlays related to reforming its derivatives business and meeting new European financial rules on investor protection and financial instruments that are part of regulations known as MiFID II. All of these costs came on top of the regular regulatory spending by the bank's operations.
Two new sets of financial rules will add to regulatory costs. These include a global deal on bank capital standards, known as Basel III, and adjustments to benchmark interest rate regulations following various scandals.
Ronner, who was promoted to the bank's executive board in November, does expect costs to normalize. 
""Those 3.5 billion francs were an exception,"" Ronner said. 

The bank expects to spend roughly 700 million francs annually on regulatory expenses.

1556,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",Hedge-Fund Titan Sees Brazil in a ‘Gray Zone’ Even With Reform,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s plan to overhaul its pension system has become a make-or-break issue for markets, which rally on signs of the bill’s progress and sink on its setbacks. But for one of the nation’s most revered hedge-fund firms, the biggest concern lies in what comes next.
“The government will probably deliver something acceptable in terms of pension reform, but I’m a little worried on what you’re going to get afterward,” said Leonardo Linhares, a partner at SPX Capital, Brazil’s biggest independent hedge-fund firm with almost 40 billion reais ($9.9 billion) under management. “I’m not optimistic about the next steps.”
Linhares, who runs the equities desk at SPX, says the government will likely burn through a lot of its political capital to push the unpopular reform through Congress. That means anything else on the economic agenda that depends on lawmakers’ approval will be tough to pull off. Without those micro-reforms, which include changing Brazil’s cumbersome tax system, privatizing state-owned companies and selling other government assets, it’s unlikely the country will have a growth spurt over the next years, according to him.
The pension system overhaul is the cornerstone of the government’s plan to trim the size of the state and shore up fiscal accounts. The reform has had a bumpy start in Congress, taking weeks to clear the first lower house committee amid fierce pushback from the opposition and a lack of coordination from the government’s base. Now, it’s before a so-called special committee, where it’s likely to undergo changes.
Gray Zone
SPX is expecting pension reform to be approved by the lower house late in the third quarter, with savings of less than 600 billion reais in a decade -- compared with an original proposal of more than 1 trillion reais. That should pave the way for the economy to grow around 2% a year in the short term. Latin America’s largest economy will expand 1.23% this year, according to the median forecast from economists surveyed by the central bank, half of what they expected three months ago.
“We don’t believe Brazil will go bust, but it won’t be a walk in the park either: We’ll get into a gray zone” said Beny Parnes, the fund’s chief economist. “I don’t see a big confidence boost coming. We’re masters of muddling through in Brazil.”
The reason for disappointing growth even with a long period of record-low borrowing costs is a bit puzzling to Parnes. Uncertainty may be part of the explanation, as the private sector is still holding back from filling the gap left by the government’s retrenching. But the former central bank director attributes part of the blame to some unknown factor he dubbed the “little phantom.”
“There’s something dragging down the economy, it should have been recovering at a faster rate. And we don’t know what this little phantom is,” he said.
Still, Parnes sees some bright spots ahead, especially from the flurry of deals set to happen in the energy sector as the government lines up several oil field concessions. He also praises the work of Bolsonaro’s economic team, led by minister Paulo Guedes, who he says “is doing three different jobs for a single wage:” the economic policy ideologue, the one coming up with ways to execute those views and the one negotiating with Congress -- an arena plagued by infighting between the government and key allies.
Not as Cheap
Weaker-than-expected growth, the back-and-forth on pension reform and trade war concerns have led Brazil’s benchmark equity index Ibovespa to pare its year-to-date gains. Since its peak in mid-March, the Ibovespa is down 11% in U.S. dollar terms.
Linhares says he’s taking a more neutral stance on domestic stocks now, with shares “not as cheap as some people say.” In a recent note to clients, SPX said it had scrapped its net long position in Brazilian equities, keeping only its bet that utilities and oil and gas firms will outperform the Ibovespa.
The firm’s flagship Nimitz fund has had a total return of 251% since its December 2010 inception, nearly double the benchmark.
“I’m not a pessimist, I think pension reform will guarantee Brazil two, three years of growth,” Linhares said. “But unfortunately we’re missing an opportunity for more.”"
1557,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",France wants FCA-Renault job guarantees and Nissan on board,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - France will seek protection of local jobs and other guarantees in exchange for supporting a merger between carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Fiat Chrysler, its finance minister said on Tuesday, underscoring the challenges facing the plan.
Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard arrived in Japan to discuss the proposed tie-up with the French company's existing partner Nissan - another potential obstacle to the $35 billion-plus merger of equals.
Renault and Italian-American rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are in talks to tackle the costs of far-reaching technological and regulatory changes by creating the world's third-biggest automaker.
Nissan found out about Renault's merger talks with Fiat Chrysler only days before they became public, four sources told Reuters, stoking fears at the Japanese carmaker that a deal could further weaken its position in a 20-year alliance with Renault.
A deal between Renault and FCA would create a player ranked behind only Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and target 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) a year in savings.
Some analysts, however, say the companies face a challenge to win over powerful stakeholders ranging from the French and Italian governments to trade unions and Nissan. 
Patrick Pelata, a former Renault chief operating officer, also criticized the deal plan for undervaluing Renault and threatening to overstretch its engineering resources.
By valuing Renault at its market price, the all-share offer attributes a negative 6 billion euro value to Renault operations after deduction of its 43.4% stake in Nissan and 3.1% Daimler holding, Pelata told BFM radio.
""That's hardly reasonable,"" he said. ""And I think that shareholders, including the French state, are bound to take issue with this sooner or later.""
Pelata added: ""FCA has big problem because they haven't invested for the future - they have no electric vehicle platform and they've done nothing in autonomous cars.""
French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told RTL radio on Tuesday that the plan was a good opportunity for both Renault and the European car industry, which has been struggling for years with overcapacity and subdued demand.
(global sales by brand 2018: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WaZc1h) 
CONDITIONS
Le Maire also said the French government would seek four guarantees in exchange for backing a deal that would reduce its 15% stake in Renault to 7.5% of the combined entity.
""The first: industrial jobs and industrial sites. I told the Renault chairman very clearly that it was the first of the guarantees I wanted from him in the opening of these negotiations. A guarantee on the preservation of industrial jobs and sites in France,"" Le Maire said.
The minister added that France wants to be well represented on the board of the new company, for it to be a leader in developing electric batteries and for the deal to take place ""within the framework of the alliance between Renault and Nissan"".
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that Renault and FCA had given commitments about maintaining industrial jobs and sites, leaving room for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as some plant downsizing.
Also on Monday, Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said Rome might need to take a stake in the combined company, balancing France's shareholding.
Le Maire said he had spoken to the Japanese about the proposed tie up. Asked how they had responded, he replied: ""I look at the reaction of Nissan president Mr Saikawa, and it's a reaction that is open.""
Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa is likely to have first caught wind of the merger plan through his own chief operating officer, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, who also serves on Renault's board, a source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
Analysts have said that Nissan, which has a 15% non-voting stake in Renault, might be reluctant to back an FCA-Renault tie-up that would probably use its technology less than the current Renault-Nissan alliance. 
Saikawa told Japanese TV on Tuesday that Nissan is ""open to constructive discussions"".
The Renault-Nissan alliance has been under strain since the arrest and ousting of former chairman Carlos Ghosn late last year on charges of financial misconduct, with Nissan recently rebuffing a merger proposal from its partner. 

Renault shares were up 1% by 1450 GMT, extending gains after Monday's 12% advance. Fiat shares slipped in Milan but the United States-listed stock jumped 7% after a public holiday on Monday.

The deal, Global Payments' biggest ever and the sector's third major acquisition this year, comes as payment technology companies consolidate to battle competition from banks making inroads into digital payments and fintech start-ups such as Adyen and Stripe chipping away market share.
The global payment market is set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as customers increasingly shift to digital payments from cash, according to consulting firm McKinsey.
""We believe the deal marks a shift from (Global Payments') pursuit of software and differentiated assets into more of a scale play,"" Jefferies analysts wrote on a note on Sunday.
""We do not believe a deal would face antitrust considerations nor do we expect another offer although we note that several banks have mentioned renewed focus on payments.""
After the deal Global Payments will process more than 50 billion transactions annually across the world, making it one of the biggest players in integrated payment technology, it said in a statement.
In March, Fidelity National Information Services Inc agreed to buy Worldpay for about $35 billion, months after  Fiserv Inc  (NASDAQ:FISV) announced a $22 billion takeover of First Data Corp.
Global Payments itself bought Heartland Payment Systems Inc in a $4.3 billion cash-and-stock deal in 2016.
The deal is expected to immediately add to Global Payments' adjusted profit by mid-single digits in 2020.
The combined company, which will take the name Global Payments and have dual headquarters in Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia, will be led by a 12-member board with six directors from each firm. 
Global Payments Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sloan will become the CEO of the merged entity and TSYS CEO Troy Woods will become chairman. Global Payments shareholders will own 52% of the combined company, and TSYS shareholders will own 48% upon closing of the deal.
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, the company said.
Reuters had reported about the possible deal on Friday, citing a source familiar with the matter.
BofA Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan Securities LLC are financial advisers to Global Payments, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is the legal adviser. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Greenhill are financial advisers to TSYS and King & Spalding LLP is the legal adviser.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",Wall St. propped up by gains in technology shares,"By Amy Caren Daniel
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose slightly on Tuesday, propped up by a rise in technology stocks, but the likelihood of a protracted trade war between the United States and China kept investors on edge.
Trump on Monday said he was ""not yet ready"" to make a deal with China but he expected one in the future. The back-and-forth on tariffs between the two sides has sparked worries that the trade war would lead to a global economic slowdown.
""There is not a lot of news and not a lot of hope on U.S.-China trade at the moment, but it's also not getting worse so that is what is helping the markets,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. 
The uncertainty has pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, which resulted in benchmark U.S. Treasury yields dropping to its lowest level since October 2017. 
The rate-sensitive banking sector dropped 0.26%, while the broader financial sector fell 0.09% and weighed on the S&P 500 index.
""What you're seeing is kind of an over-sold bounce, we'll see over the course of the day if that holds,"" said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
The benchmark S&P 500 index as of Friday's close was about 4% away from its record high hit on May 1, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial index posted its fifth straight week of decline. 
The technology sector, which is among the worst performing S&P sectors this month, rose 0.66%, helped by a 6.1% jump in Total System Services Inc (NYSE:TSS). 
Global Payments Inc said it would buy the payment technology company for about $21.5 billion in stock. Its shares declined 1.7%. 
Markets were also helped by gains in marquee stocks, including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), which rose over 1% each. 
At 12:14 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31.07 points, or 0.12%, at 25,616.76. The S&P 500 was up 5.40 points, or 0.19%, at 2,831.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.34 points, or 0.49%, at 7,674.35.
Among other stocks, Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) rose 3.6% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its shares to ""buy"" and said the videogame publisher would benefit from its recent releases.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 10.5% and also helped lift the tech sector, after the chipmaker launched new computing and graphics products on Sunday. Rival  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 2.0%.
FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) slipped 0.8% after Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said it is reviewing its relationship with the U.S. package delivery company, after it diverted two parcels destined for Huawei addresses in Asia to the United States. 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.08-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 12:39PM ET</span>",Trump foe Avenatti pleads not guilty to ripping off Stormy Daniels,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyer Michael Avenatti pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges that he stole from porn star Stormy Daniels, the client who propelled him to fame as an outspoken adversary of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Avenatti's attorney Sylvie Levine entered the plea to charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott in Manhattan. Cott ordered Avenatti released on a $300,000 bail bond, on condition that he notify authorities of any travel plans and have no contact with Daniels.
In an indictment made public last Wednesday, prosecutors in Manhattan accused Avenatti, 48, of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels to fund an extravagant lifestyle, including a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) automobile, after helping her secure a book contract. The new charges came on top of two separate criminal cases Avenatti already faced.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 from Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 presidential election to keep quiet about an affair she said she had with Trump in 2006. The president has denied having had sex with Daniels.
Avenatti represented Daniels in lawsuits related to the hush money and later in negotiating a book deal. 
Daniels' book ""Full Disclosure"" was published in October.
Prosecutors said Avenatti diverted two $148,750 installment payments from Daniels' $800,000 book advance by forging her signature in a letter to her literary agent and directing that the money be sent to his bank account.
Prosecutors said Avenatti eventually paid $148,750 to Daniels after obtaining the money from another source, but lied when she asked where the second payment was. Avenatti told Daniels the publisher ""owes me a payment"" and that he was ""on it,"" prosecutors said.
Daniels has not received that payment, prosecutors said. She dropped Avenatti as her lawyer earlier this year.
Avenatti was arrested in March and charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with trying to extort more than $20 million from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored. He is expected to be arraigned on those charges in federal court in Manhattan later on Tuesday.
Nike has denied wrongdoing, and helped prosecutors before Avenatti's arrest.
At the same time, Avenatti was charged by prosecutors in Los Angeles with stealing millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.
Before his arrest, Avenatti was a fixture on cable news channels as an outspoken critic of Trump, and briefly toyed with running for president in 2020.

Michael Cohen is about three weeks into a three-year prison term after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations related to the hush money payment to Daniels and other financial crimes.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 11:10AM ET</span>",Bombardier consortium named preferred bidder for $3.4 billion Egypt monorail,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc said its consortium has been named as Egypt's preferred bidder for a 3 billion euro ($3.4 billion) contract to build a monorail link out of Cairo, part a flagship project of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
If confirmed, it would be the largest project in recent years for Bombardier's rail division, the group's biggest business, which has recently faced challenges, and it would likely create jobs in the UK where the Canadian company builds rolling stock.
Bombardier said in a statement that Bombardier Transportation had teamed up with two Egyptian companies - Orascom Construction and the Arab Contractors - to bid for the contract to build a 54-kilometer (34-mile) monorail system connecting a new capital city with eastern Cairo. The contract also includes construction of a second, 42-kilometer line linking 6th October City with Giza.
The new capital is being built in the desert east of Cairo. Its construction has been delayed amid financing concerns but it is a top priority for Sisi. 
British Trade Minister Liam Fox said the deal would generate jobs in Britain and that work could start later this year. 
""We're now getting to the financing elements of the agreement,"" he said in an interview during a visit to Cairo. 
Bombardier are ""keen to get working if they can in the third quarter of this year. It's quite a tall order but it reflects I think their level of ambition for this project,"" he said.
""I think the government here wants to see quick results, I think the company want to see quick results.""
The monorail's design and build contract has a potential value of 1.2 billion euros for Bombardier Transportation, while a 30-year operations and maintenance deal has a potential value of about 1.1 billion euros, the company said.
Egyptian officials have said they expect the first civil servants to start working from the new capital in mid-2020. 
Bombardier's rail division has seen recent delivery delays and production problems on a handful of long-term projects, forcing the Canadian company to cut its first-quarter and full-year revenue targets for the division.
Earlier this month, the Canadian company said it would merge its corporate and regional jet units, besides selling off two aerostructures operations. 
Orascom, an engineering and building business, is controlled by Egypt’s prominent Sawiris family. Arab Contractors is a major state-controlled construction firm.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ten years on from the global financial crisis caused by a crash in bonds tied to U.S. home loans, Britain's  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is betting a return to that market can bring in bumper revenues to fortify its investment bank.
After the crisis, banks initially shunned the business of selling and trading slices of loans tied to residential property, autos or commercial real estate, as such securitizations were demonized for their role in the crash. 
But now Barclays is preparing to make its comeback, having assembled a team of over 140 securitization bankers and traders with plans to hire more as investors clamor for the higher returns such deals offer compared with traditional stocks and bonds.
Having pared back its securitization business in recent years amid a wider restructuring, Barclays' head of global markets Stephen Dainton said the time was right for the British bank to re-enter the market in force.
""This was a 500 million pound ($632.80 million) business for Barclays in terms of revenues last year, when global peers are making 1 billion pounds a year, so for us to get to 500 million pounds additional revenue over 3 years or 100-150 million pounds a year should be achievable at measured pace"", he said.
The success of that bid would be a huge fillip for Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley, who is in a race against time to increase investment banking profits and vindicate his faith in a business that an activist investor argues should be cut back.
Barclays' push is led by veteran securitized assets trader Scott Eichel, who had ringside seats to the highs and lows of the mortgage-backed securities market at Bear Stearns in the run-up to the 2008 crash, and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) afterwards.
Now head of securitized products for Barclays, Eichel has assembled a team of 144 bankers and traders who package up and sell everything from commercial and residential home loans to more esoteric assets such as media and sports franchise rights.
""The market has changed both outside and inside banks, both from a regulatory perspective and best practises inside firms,"" Eichel said.
""When you dissect the revenues, those years around the crisis were very heavily trading based, whereas now you are back to the banking model where about 80 percent of your revenues are coming from financing and origination.""
That means banks are primarily making money from the intended purpose of securitizations- providing companies and homeowners improved access to credit by pooling the risk of lending to them- rather than making bets on the market.
TRUMP
Barclays' return to the market is a bold gambit given it paid $2 billion in March last year to settle a U.S. probe into its alleged mis-selling of the mortgage-backed bonds that helped to trigger the 2008 crash.
The biggest attempt by a British bank to tap into the U.S. securitization market since that crisis is already showing signs of progress.
Barclays ranks sixth for sales of U.S. securitizations this year, up two places from the same period a year ago according to Refinitiv data. 
Only  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in third place, is ahead of Barclays among European banks in the U.S. market which is the world's biggest for securitizations.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) ranks ninth.
Barclays is also third overall for underwriting asset-backed securities in the United States, up one place from a year ago, according to the data and again behind top-ranked Credit Suisse.
Barclays is hopeful signs of softening U.S. regulations underpinning the securitization industry could help to consolidate and expand its burgeoning market share, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A report by the U.S. Treasury in October 2017 prompted by an executive order from President Donald Trump backed the view that post-crisis regulation of the sector went too far.
""The result has been to dampen the attractiveness of securitization, potentially cutting off or raising the cost of credit to thousands of corporate and retail consumers,"" the report said. It recommended loosening the capital requirements for banks underwriting securitizations.
Barclays plans to increase slowly the team under Eichel to around 177 bankers and traders, targeting not just the United States but also Europe where there is an active market for securitizing assets, including underperforming and capital intensive real estate loans bloating many banks' balance sheets.

""We're doing what regulators want banks to do, which is help customers to get financing so businesses can grow, and help investors who buy those bonds to get the liquidity they need,” Eichel said.

GE earlier said it was considering ways to cut costs and make its operations more efficient in France, and that while no details had been finalised the plan could result in up to 1,044 positions being cut.
GE's planned cuts would occur principally at its site in Belfort and the U.S. company is in talks with trade unions over the possible job reductions.
French industrial group  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) was Belfort's biggest employer until 2014 when it sold its gas turbine manufacturing business to GE, which pledged at the time to create 1,000 jobs to win backing for the deal from the French government.
However, the company has had to break that commitment as the gas turbine power plant market collapsed. It had to pay 50 million euros ($56 million) this year into a reindustrialization fund for failing to meet the target.
Speaking in the lower house of parliament, Le Maire said he wanted the money to be used in Belfort to support projects in aeronautics, dismantling nuclear plants and the hydrogen industry.
""We are ready to fight alongside you ... and local politicians and obviously alongside GE workers to ensure the industrial future of the GE site,"" Le Maire told lawmakers during a weekly questions to government session.
A Finance Ministry official said the site would not be shut down outright.

GE tamped down enthusiasm earlier this month about a quick recovery in its power-plant unit, which lost a staggering $22.8 billion last year, mainly due to a large goodwill writedown.

Bezos, whose former husband is the world's richest man, was one of 19 people on Tuesday to join the ""Giving Pledge,"" a campaign announced in 2010 by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's Buffett and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates. It calls for the super-rich to give away more than half their fortunes during their lifetimes or in their wills.
""In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,"" MacKenzie Bezos said in a statement dated Saturday. ""My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care.""
MacKenzie Bezos became the world's third-richest woman, according a Forbes Magazine, acquiring a 4% stake in Amazon worth about $36 billion when she and Jeff Bezos announced their divorce settlement on April 4.
The fortune of Jeff Bezos was estimated by Forbes magazine to be $131 billion this year.
The ""Giving Pledge"" has 204 wealthy signatories from 23 countries who come from a wide range of fields, including finance, technology, healthcare and real estate development.
While many of the wealthy people ranked by Forbes as the world's richest people have signed onto the pledge, Jeff Bezos, who tops the list, is not among them.

1575,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 10:15AM ET</span>","Blindsided by FCA-Renault talks, Nissan risks being left by the roadside","By Naomi Tajitsu and Norihiko Shirouzu
TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan found out about Renault's merger talks with Fiat Chrysler just days before they became public, four sources told Reuters, stoking fears at the Japanese carmaker that a deal could further weaken its position in a 20-year alliance with  Renault  (PA:RENA).
Nissan Motor Co Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa likely first caught wind of the merger plan through his own chief operating officer, Yasuhiro Yamauchi, who also serves on Renault's board, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Saikawa's actual notification from Renault most likely came a day ahead of a report over the weekend that the French company was in tie-up talks with Italian-American rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), the source said.
The plan, which would create the world's third-largest automaker, raises difficult questions about how Nissan would fit into a radically changed alliance. Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard arrived in Japan on Tuesday to discuss the proposed tie-up - and presumably to try to smooth over ties.
But the deal poses an additional challenge for Saikawa, already grappling with poor financial performance and an uneasy relationship with Renault after Nissan led the ousting last year of long-standing alliance chairman Carlos Ghosn. 
""All this put Saikawa under massive pressure,"" a second source said, referring to the fact that negotiations caught the CEO and senior management off guard.
Renault, which owns a 43.4% stake in Nissan, had previously angled for a merger with Nissan, but Saikawa has long opposed a full integration. [nL5N22Q90O]
New vehicle and powertrain platforms developed by FCA-Renault could also pose a dilemma to Nissan, challenging its jealously guarded independence in some areas of engineering, research and development.
    Nissan could find itself forced to choose between technology developed elsewhere or going it alone - between scale without autonomy and autonomy without scale, a source close to the Renault board said.
FCA has said a deal would embrace Nissan and another alliance member, Mitsubishi Motors, as ""valued and respected partners"".
""I have huge respect for Nissan and Mitsubishi, and their products and businesses,"" FCA Chairman John Elkann told the Nikkei. 
Still, there is awareness of friction between Renault and Nissan, which is perhaps why the Japanese company was not involved in talks at an earlier stage. 
""The relationship between Renault and its Japanese partners is not as constructive as probably anybody wishes,"" said a source familiar with the FCA-Renault talks. 
""The FCA view is that Nissan has a lot on its plate ... So the time is not right to consider anything other than enhanced cooperation.""
'A STRONG SIGNAL'
The French government, which owns shares in Renault, said on Tuesday it wanted Nissan to be on board with the deal.
But there have long been tensions between Paris and Tokyo over the imbalance of power in the carmaking alliance, with Nissan holding only a 15% non-voting stake in Renault. 
The Japanese automaker's clear advantage is in its technology, including vehicles that meet China's tougher emissions regulations. Renault and FCA, therefore, would need Nissan to help them meet increasingly tough fuel economy, emissions and electric vehicle (EV) quotas around the world.
An FCA-Renault tie-up would also raise questions about how to extract synergies in some markets where Nissan and FCA compete, such as in North American trucks and SUVs. 
The Japanese firm's line-up of Nissan and Infiniti brand SUVs competes with FCA's Jeep models such as the Cherokee. Nissan's Titan pickup is also competitor, albeit a weak one, to FCA's Ram pickup line.
The fact Renault is prepared to consider creating such challenges may be a sign of its frustration with Nissan's reluctance over a full merger.
""It sends a strong signal that Renault does not necessarily have to tie its fate to Nissan,"" said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA, about the proposed FCA-Renault tie-up. 
Saikawa told reporters on Tuesday that ""strengthening the alliance and constructive discussions are forward looking, and we are open to constructive discussions,"" according to Japanese broadcasters.
But unless Nissan can regain the initiative, it risks being marginalized even more. 
""If the Renault-Fiat merger happens and the status quo continues at Nissan-Renault, Nissan's position and influence within the alliance will fall behind Fiat,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama.
Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said there were theoretically stronger synergies for Renault with FCA than with Nissan, and a better cultural fit too. 

""It may be inevitable that Renault eventually exits Nissan,"" he said, adding the French company's stake in its Japanese partner was currently worth about 11 billion euros - ""plenty of capital to spend on EVs and new technology.""

The Tadawul All Share Index rose 2% on the day, after fluctuating throughout the session, with banks contributing the most to the increase. The Tadawul trimmed this month’s losses to 8%. MSCI is set to add the kingdom to its developing country benchmark, using Tuesday’s closing prices.
Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SE:2010), Al Rajhi Bank (SE:1120), National Commercial Bank, Saudi Telecom Co. and Samba Financial Group are expected to draw the most inflows from the first stage of the MSCI inclusion. Together, they should attract about $3.5 billion from money managers passively tracking the index, according to estimates by Mohamad Al Hajj, equities strategist at EFG-Hermes in Dubai.
Saudi shares have outperformed peers in developing economies since MSCI announced in June 2017 that it was evaluating an eventual inclusion of the country in its emerging-market category, which has about $1.8 trillion in assets benchmarked to the gauge. The decision was confirmed last year. The addition will take place in two stages, with the first phase following today’s close, the second in August.
But the Saudi benchmark lost ground this month, as rekindled political tensions may have “spooked” some investors in the Saudi market, Ahmed Badr, head of equities for the Middle East, North Africa at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Dubai, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.

1580,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>",Beyond Meat to start plant-based meats production in Europe next year,"(Reuters) - Vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc said on Tuesday it would begin making its plant-based meats in Europe next year, in an effort to expand production outside the United States.
With more health-conscious consumers choosing vegan or vegetarian diets, the popularity of plant-based meat substitutes has been surging, resulting in stiff competition between Beyond Meat and chief rival Impossible Foods in North America.
The two companies are looking to get their versions of vegan burgers in fast food chains, with Beyond Meat supplying Tim Hortons and Carl Jr., while Burger King sells Impossible Food's patty in its Whopper sandwich.
Beyond Meat's new production facility in the Netherlands, constructed by meat distributor Zandbergen, will give it a leg up on competitors in Europe where the market for vegan ""meats"" is even younger than the United States.
""Localized production is expected to reduce the brand's transportation footprint, while increasing the speed in which Beyond Meat can get products to customers across Europe,"" the company said.
Analysts at J.P. Morgan on Tuesday estimated the total addressable market for plant-based meat to be worth $100 billion in 15 years, with Beyond Meat taking a 5% share.

Beyond Meat, whose shares have risen 73% since their market debut in May this year, partnered with Zandbergen to distribute its products in restaurants and retailers across Europe last year.

1581,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2019 09:20AM ET</span>","GE Plans to Cut Up to 1,044 Jobs in France as Power Woes Deepen","(Bloomberg) --  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. plans to cut as many as 1,044 jobs in its beleaguered French power-equipment business, setting up another clash with political leaders after years of wrangling over manufacturing employment in the country.
The company presented union officials with a plan to “regain sustainable competitiveness” by eliminating positions in gas-power operations and support functions, GE said by email Tuesday. A spokesman said the actions would affect 792 gas-power and 252 support workers, primarily at the company’s Belfort site.
The decision underscores the severity of the downturn in the global market for fossil fuel-based power generation, which has been at the heart of GE’s troubles in recent years. The company said in late 2017 that it would cut 12,000 jobs in GE Power, and new Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has said fixing the unit is one of his biggest challenges.
Despite an industrywide slump, GE’s job cuts in France have been a particular flash point after the company pledged to create 1,000 net new positions in the country as part of its 2015 acquisition of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA’s energy operations. France, which has continuously pressured GE to hold to the commitments, fined the Boston-based company $57 million in February for creating just 25 new jobs.
The latest cuts represent about one-quarter of GE’s 4,300 workers in Belfort. GE said discussions over the jobs proposal would begin in mid-June and no action would be taken until the negotiations are complete."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Two of the world's biggest shipping groups will join a Maersk led blockchain platform aimed at boosting efficiency and limiting the enormous paper trail of global container shipping.
With Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) and CMA CGM, the second- and fourth-largest container shipping companies, joining the platform, nearly half of all cargo being shipped by sea - which accounts for 90% of traded goods worldwide - will be tracked using it.
More than 100 companies, ports or authorities, such as Procter & Gamble and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have signed up for the platform led by Copenhagen-based Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company.
Blockchain graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ye8oqd
The participation of key players in the platform, launched last year in collaboration with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), is seen as crucial for cutting costs in an industry that has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s.
""Still lots of processes in our industry actually predate the container,"" Maersk Executive Vice President Vincent Clerc said in an interview.
The blockchain platform, named TradeLens, helps customers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, port authorities and customs authorities manage and track the paper trail by digitising the supply chain process from end to end.
The technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.
""Even today customers live with the administrative burden of having to maintain the huge amount of paperwork and not having visibility of what is happening with their goods,"" Clerc said, calling MSC and CMA CGM's participation a game changer.
Each year, more than $4 trillion in goods are shipped, and more than 80% of the goods consumers use daily are carried by the ocean shipping industry, according to Maersk.
Paperwork accounts of about 20% on average of the cost of shipping a container from one place to another. A significant part of that administrative cost can be shaved off once the platform is used at full scale, Clerc said.
""Digital collaboration is key to the evolution of the container shipping industry,"" André Simha, chief digital & innovation officer at Swiss-based MSC, said in a statement.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>",Funds protest UK drive to disclose more on boardroom chats,"By Simon Jessop and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of Britain's biggest asset managers are protesting proposals that they disclose more details about their discussions with company boards on issues such as climate change and child labor.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which sets best practice for funds' oversight of the firms they invest in via the UK Stewardship Code, wants managers to be more open about how they tackle environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.
But some of the biggest money managers argue too much disclosure could damage efforts to change corporate behavior.
""There is ... a coherent distinction between what can reasonably be made public without undermining the trust on which the engagement is based, and what is best kept private between parties in order to best promote change,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said in its response to the FRC's proposals.
The FRC wants signatories to give more details about company meetings on ESG issues and produce an annual report on their efforts. The move follows stinging criticism of the FRC that suggested its code could be ditched if it was not toughened.
For managers it is an important issue, given signing up to the code can be a crucial part of winning investment mandates as more investors seek assurance on the ethical destination of their money. 
Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, part of Germany's Allianz, and Jupiter Fund Management were also among those warning overly prescriptive rules could weaken their impact, particularly if funds focus on short-term engagement wins at the expense of longer-term efforts that deliver greater shareholder value.
Engaging for change: https://tmsnrt.rs/2EmOl9u 
RISK ASSESSMENT 
Funds often meet with executives to discuss a company's financial and ESG performance, outlook and strategy.
While they need to ensure no market-moving information changes hands, the insights gained can help fund managers better assess risks that can ultimately impact a stock price. 
Some asset managers already produce an annual or even quarterly update on their engagements with companies, but the depth of detail varies wildly. Others produce no such report.
A Reuters analysis of disclosures from some of the world's biggest asset managers shows just a fraction of talks on issues like boardroom diversity and working conditions are published.
BlackRock, which manages around $6.5 trillion in assets and owns around 17,000 stocks, has one of the biggest engagement teams in the industry and is considered among the most open, producing quarterly public reports for each of three regions.
Yet a fraction of its engagements are detailed. Of just over 2,000 meetings in 2018, only two engagement reports contained the names of specific companies, while a further 90 were detailed without reference to a specific firm.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2EmOjOU.
As well as fearing they could lose access to candid boardroom chats, some asset managers are loathe to detail too much of their investment process to rivals.
Of the 102 respondents to the FRC's consultation, some of the strongest calls for more disclosure came from bodies representing retail investors.
CASE STUDIES
ShareAction, which lobbies worldwide for a responsible investment system, called for expanded use of detailed case studies and guidance on what to include.
""We are concerned that without clear guidance the reports will amount to window-dressing in which signatories cherry-pick their successful engagements and do not refer to challenges they have faced.
""We have also found ... that some investors focus on the number of engagements without explaining the impact or outcome these have had.""
Yet BlackRock warned some companies might look to list their shares elsewhere to escape the increased attention.
""There is a real risk not only that they will be disinclined to have those conversations, but also that they will not put themselves in a position of having to hold the conversations in the first place"".

The updated code is due out before the end of the summer and is expected to be tougher than the EU's Shareholder Rights Directive, which goes into law this quarter and also demands better disclosure from asset managers.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart are unlikely to fully participate in an Indian antitrust body's study of the e-commerce sector for fear of revealing trade secrets, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is engaged in what it describes as a ""fact-finding exercise"" aimed at better understanding the e-commerce sector, showed a document distributed to several e-commerce firms and reviewed by Reuters.
The CCI document features 88 questions over 12 pages requesting recipients volunteer pricing strategies, product information and the identities of their biggest-selling vendors.
Amazon and Flipkart are among India's largest e-commerce companies so their participation in any such survey could carry significant weight. Yet the pair are unlikely to answer questions in full as doing so would involve disclosing commercially sensitive information, the two people told Reuters.
""This survey is very detailed,"" said one of the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. ""Companies are worried because these are competitive, confidential things which are business critical.""
Amazon, Flipkart and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
CCI's study comes about four months after the government implemented new rules regulating foreign investment in e-commerce, including barring the sale of products on their platforms from vendors in which they have an equity interest. [nL3N1ZV4WU]
The rules saw scores of products vanish from Amazon's Indian website overnight, and shocked Walmart which just months earlier had bought the majority of Flipkart for $16 billion in the U.S. retailer's biggest-ever acquisition.
U.S. officials and e-commerce companies have protested the rules, which were widely seen as aimed at winning the support of small traders ahead of a general election. The incumbent government won the election this month by a landslide.
To better understand the e-commerce sector, the CCI in its document asks companies basic details such as the number of employees, but asks online marketplace operators more sensitive questions such as how they charge vendors on their platforms.
It also asks questions regarding contractual agreements struck between e-commerce companies and vendors.

There is no indication of compulsory participation in the survey, with the CCI in the document saying it ""does not form a part of any investigation and/or inquiry in any of the proceedings pending"" before the watchdog.

The Financial Services Agency said it had issued one of its ""business improvement orders"" against Nomura, a regulatory punishment that requires firms to submit a plan detailing how they will improve internal controls.
Nomura on Friday confirmed that information related to listing and delisting criteria now under review by the Tokyo Stock Exchange had been handled improperly. It has said that its chief executive would take a 30% pay cut for three months to take responsibility for the leak.
""We deeply regret for what had happened and take the business improvement order seriously,"" Nomura said in a statement. 
""We sincerely apologize for causing great trouble for our clients and other stakeholders and having caused them to worry."" 
Nomura had said an employee from its Nomura Research Institute affiliate leaked information about the expected changes to the chief strategist of its securities arm, who informed sales staff. The sales staff, in turn, told clients, Nomura has said.
While the punishment does not include a fine, the incident marks the latest headache for CEO Koji Nagai as he struggles to turn around the investment bank. Nomura last month reported its first annual loss in a decade and said it would not pay out bonuses to directors.

Nomura said it would submit its first plans to improve business practices by June 4.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:33AM ET</span>",Louis Dreyfus tries sustainable finance with $750 million loan,"PARIS (Reuters) - Agricultural commodity group Louis Dreyfus Company has agreed to renew a $750 million loan in North America that will be priced in relation to how the company performs in relation to a number of sustainability goals.
Known as Dreyfus, the company is the ""D"" of the so-called ABCD group of big agricultural commodity merchants alongside Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill. 
Under the new revolving credit facility, the interest rate will be linked to Dreyfus's performance on CO2 emissions, electricity consumption, water usage and solid waste sent to landfill.
The interest rate margin will reduce for each year Dreyfus's performance on these factors improves, the company said in a statement.
Some $36 billion in sustainability-linked loans were issued worldwide last year in a trend led by European companies, according to credit ratings agency Moody's. Global standards adopted by loan trade associations this year are expected to boost activity in these loans in the United States.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Mercon Coffee Group earlier this month announced sustainability-focused loan facilities, signaling the coffee market's growing emphasis on sustainability as climate change and low global prices threaten the future of the crop.
Soybean production in Brazil has been another focus of sustainability discussion in the agricultural sector and several commodity merchants including Dreyfus earlier this year agreed to monitor soybean supply chains for deforestation in the vast Cerrado savannah.
Dreyfus plans to use similar sustainability targets when its two other revolving credit facilities come up for renewal in Asia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, it said.
The company, which is headquartered in the Netherlands and has its main offices in Switzerland, is a global trader and processor of crops including soybeans, sugar, coffee and cotton.

The new loan facility is anchored by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), ICBC, ING, MUFG,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and SunTrust, with ING acting as sustainability structuring agent and BNP Paribas as sustainability coordinator.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:29AM ET</span>","Oklahoma, Johnson & Johnson face off in first opioid crisis trial","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is set to face trial in a multibillion-dollar lawsuit by the state of Oklahoma aimed at pinning the blame for the opioid epidemic on its painkiller marketing.
Lawyers for the state and J&J are scheduled to appear on Tuesday in a state court in Norman, Oklahoma, to deliver their opening statements at the start of the first trial to result from more than 2,000 similar lawsuits against opioid manufacturers nationally.
The lawsuits by state and local governments seek to hold the J&J and other companies responsible for a drug abuse epidemic that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says led to a record 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter alleges J&J, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, carried out deceptive marking campaigns that downplayed opioids' addictive risks while overstating their benefits.
Hunter alleges J&J, which marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, was ""the kingpin behind this public health emergency,"" growing and importing the raw materials other drugmakers used for their products.
The state claims the companies' actions created an oversupply of painkillers and a public nuisance that will cost $12.7 billion to $17.5 billion to remedy.
Oklahoma resolved its claims against Purdue in March for $270 million and against Teva on Sunday for $85 million, leaving only J&J as a defendant in the nonjury trial before Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman. 
""We believe our evidence is persuasive and compelling with regard to their legal responsibility for thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of addictions in the state,"" Hunter said.
J&J denies wrongdoing, arguing that its marketing efforts were proper and that the state cannot prove it caused the opioid epidemic given the role doctors, patients, pharmacists and drug dealers played.
""We acted responsibly in providing FDA-approved pain medications, and we are ready for trial,"" J&J said in a statement on Sunday.
But J&J also said it was open to an ""an appropriate resolution"" that would avoid the expense and uncertainty of a trial.
The case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly the 1,850 cases consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has been pushing for a settlement agreement ahead of an October trial.

Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.

(Reuters) - European shares dipped on Tuesday, dragged down by concerns about the budget deficit in Italy, while London markets were lifted by gains for mining shares.
By 0814 GMT, the pan-region STOXX 600 was down 0.2%, while Milan's FTMIB index fell 1%, weighed down by banks, who would take the brunt of any new leg in the euro zone's long-running sovereign debt crisis.
Italian bond yields rose sharply for a second day as its deputy prime minister hit back over what he said were European Union plans to impose a 3 billion euro fine on the country for spending too much.
The European banking index was the biggest drag on the index overall and Italian banks fell more than 2% to near four-month lows.
""For Italy, the potential for a doom loop is still looming in the background where you have an undesirable connection between the debt possession of the state and the banks,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior eurozone market economist, at Rabobank.
""Surely it will have an effect for Italy itself but for now the panic is not to the extent that the whole eurozone suffers.""
London's FTSE 100, reopening after a long weekend, inched 0.1% higher, with BHP and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) up 1 and 3% respectively as Chinese iron ore prices rose.
The exporter-heavy index also benefited from a weak pound as traders worried that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had grown after a stunning defeat for the governing Conservative Party in last week's European elections. (L)
As well as the mining gains, carmakers were a bright spot, with traders citing a report that China's prosperous southern province Guangdong has launched stimulus measures to boost car sales.
Peugeot and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) were top performers on the index. 

Shares in Fiat-Chrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA), who confirmed at the weekend they were in talks about a merger that would create the world's third biggest automaker, both turned negative after some initial gains.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>","Chinese developers' debt strains ease, but profit slowdown risks grow","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Clare Jim
BENGALURU/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's developers, the country's most leveraged sector, have finally got their rising debt piles under control and some even boast record amounts of cash, powered by strong earnings growth and restrained expansion, a Reuters analysis showed.
That should be a relief to investors worried about potential corporate defaults as China Inc faces a record $1.5 trillion of corporate bonds maturing in the next two years.
But it is also a warning sign that the country's buoyant property market is slowing down, with policy uncertainty keeping developers jittery and delaying investment.
Following a furious boom, China has tightened regulatory controls over its massive property market since mid-2016. But home prices have continued to go up, even as economic growth slows, and managing risks in the sector remains a priority.
""The amount of cash is high, because they have held back acquisitions and construction expenditures. They have to replenish their pipelines of projects going forward,"" said Phillip Zhong, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. The government's efforts to rein in excessive borrowing resulted in a record number of bond defaults in China last year, and market experts expect the trend to continue this year. However, they say major property developers, especially the Hong Kong-listed ones, are better equipped to handle the storm as their profitability and balance sheets have strengthened.
""The protection (against default risks) is higher due to lower inventory in the system and developers can easily deleverage if they slow down the land acquisition,"" said John Lam, head of Hong Kong and China real estate research at UBS.
A Reuters analysis of 45 Hong Kong-listed mainland developers' balance sheets showed their combined cash and short-term investments rose to a record 1.1 trillion yuan ($14.5 billion) at the end of 2018, while net debt-to-core earnings ratio fell to 5.14 percent, the lowest in four years.
Another analysis of 50 developers listed in mainland China showed their average debt-to-equity ratio fell to 1.73 at the end of March quarter, the lowest since 2013.
MARKET SLOWING DOWN? 
China's land sales by value rebounded 6% in the first four months of this year, according to real estate researcher CREIS, with the premiums developers paid for land rising sharply, as credit conditions and purchase requirements eased. 
The rebound took some firms by surprise and prompted caution, because in the second half of last year many land auctions failed to secure bids as developers faced tight credit conditions and thinning profit margins following the prolonged government campaign to rein in property prices.
With the market likely to see tapering growth -- UBS's Lam forecasts Chinese developers' earnings will rise 25% this year and 20% on average in the next three years. Experts says developers are likely to their keep debt ratios stable.
""Unless developers suddenly get very aggressive on landbanking, but that'd be unlikely because of the price caps,"" J.P. Morgan's head of China property research Ryan Li said, referring to the government restrictions on how much developers can set the selling prices in different cities. 

Chinese developers sold a record amount of offshore bonds in the first quarter and most of the proceeds went to refinancing rather than building up landbanks due to regulatory controls.

1595,By Investing.com,"<span>May 28, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Greek Markets Surge, Italy's Wobble After EU Election ","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- As the dust settles from elections to the European parliament at the weekend, it becomes clear that the biggest winner has been – Greece.
The Athens General Composite index rose nearly 6% on Monday while Greek government 10-year bonds yields – a rough barometer of political risk – fell to their lowest since the country joined the euro zone in 2002.
The ATG is now up 26% in 2019 to date, and less than 1% off the high for the year that it hit in April. Even so, it’s still down more than two-thirds from its peak before the debt crisis exploded in 2010.
The move came after radical leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the center-right New Democracy party of Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Tsipras responded by moving up to June national elections that were scheduled for October. That move was seen by analysts as an attempt to forestall four months of drifts that could have led to an even worse defeat.
A year ago, Greece’s 10-year bonds yielded 6.10%. Today they yield only 3.17%. That’s only 47 basis points more than Italy's, which have risen from 2.20% to 2.70% in the same timeframe.
That’s because Greece has been the mirror image of Italy politically. While Greece has given up its revolt against Eurozone budget discipline, Italy – under the populist coalition of Matteo Salvini’s Lega party and Luigi di Maio’s 5 Stars Movement - has declared war on it.
“If we need to break some limits, like the 3% or the 130-140%, we’ll go ahead,” Salvini said while campaigning, in a reference to Eurozone rules that limit budget deficits to 3% of GDP. Italy’s gross public debt is already 132% of GDP, a level that is unlikely to be sustainable if Eurozone interest rates ever rise again. The European Commission recently forecast Italy’s budget gap would hit 3.5% of GDP next year, putting Rome and Brussels clearly on a collision course.
No coincidence, then, that Italy’s FTSE MIB has been the worst performing index in Europe since Sunday, losing 1.1% by 4.30 AM ET (0830 GMT) on Tuesday, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down only 0.4%.

1597,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2019 03:30AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank’s Options Are Limited for a Turnaround,"(Bloomberg) -- These days, the path of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) feels a little bit like the final season of a long-running TV show. The latest plot driver: the lender’s stock regularly hitting new lows.
It was always clear that Christian Sewing would have much less time than his predecessors to get the bank’s problems fixed and tell the tale of a finally successful turnaround.
With the stock dive and with many issues like interest rates and the state of the European economy out of his control, his options are becoming limited.
It’s no surprise that during last week’s annual shareholder meeting he had to announce deeper cuts into the bank’s investment banking. While details about the next steps are not yet known, the history of investment banking restructurings shows that it often comes along with some sort of bad bank to wind down risk-weighted assets.
And it looks like Deutsche Bank is mulling an overhaul and may face the unfavorable option of yet another capital raise to handle this.
Meanwhile, management has to focus on the things it can control, mainly costs. Various problems arise on that front: first, cost-cutting campaigns are usually not sexy enough to lure new shareholders, it usually takes time to see the benefits of the cuts, and there is no guarantee of success as it almost always comes with further market share erosion, which can trigger more cuts, and so on.
It also might lead to an exodus of talented people, and some cracks are already showing up with key figures mulling plans to leave the lender.
It’s true, Deutsche Bank shares are cheap compared to its European peers, but the stock price needs more than pure valuation. It needs a good story to make people comfortable to invest in future returns.
Bankhaus Metzler analyst Jochen Schmitt wrote in a recent note following a meeting with Sewing that the first major cost savings were likely to kick in next year and that the bank’s ability to at least halt or reverse the revenue decline and regain earnings power is “still a key risk.” That means the stock might remain a joyless investment in the short term.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Tuesday, lifted by gains in China and as auto firms climbed on merger news, but broad uncertainties over trade and economic growth kept investor enthusiasm in check.
European equity markets were expected to open higher. In early European trade, pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.39% at 3,365, German DAX futures were up 0.39% at 12,112, FTSE futures were up 0.5% at 7,299.5, and France's CAC 40 futures were up 0.41% at 5,319.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.38%, and U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures rose 0.22% to 2,837.25, pointing to gains when U.S. markets reopen on Tuesday after a holiday.
Despite the day's gains, Joanne Goh, Asia equity strategist at DBS in Singapore, said broad market sentiment remained uncertain ahead of a possible meeting between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at the G20 summit next month.
""There's still a lack of direction in the markets in terms of all the different asset classes,"" she said.
""You actually see Chinese bond yields are ticking up, but that shouldn't be the case because we are expecting stimulus and bond yields should start to come off...there's quite a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now.""
Chinese blue-chips climbed 0.61% a day after data showed Chinese industrial firms' profits shrank in April, which could prompt more government stimulus to support the slowing economy.
A planned increase in the weighting of Chinese A-shares in MSCI indexes after the market close later on Tuesday also boosted shares.Seoul's KOSPI added 0.37%, while Australian shares gained 0.45%. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished 0.37% higher.
In China's debt markets, 10-year government bond futures for September delivery, the most-traded contract, rebounded 0.34% on Tuesday having dropped as much as 0.71% the day before, after China's takeover of a troubled bank sparked concerns of wider financial risks.
""With economic indicators mixed and trade war risks lingering, the bias is still tilted towards loose monetary policy to cushion growth. We think that the rise in longer-term (Chinese) govvie...yields is probably not warranted,"" DBS analysts said in a note.
The equity market gains in Asia followed a relatively light session in Europe on Monday, with UK and U.S. financial markets closed for holidays.
European auto shares had rallied after Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler confirmed it had made a ""transformative merger"" proposal to French peer  Renault  (PA:RENA) in a deal that would create the world's third-biggest carmaker. That sector rally spilled into Asia with Mitsubishi Motors Corp in Japan adding 5.95% and Nissan Motor Co gaining 2.31%.
Shares in Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd jumped 5.47%.​ Provisional results from EU elections also buoyed markets after pro-union parties kept a firm grip on power in elections to the European Parliament. The pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.22%.
""Although Eurosceptic and anti-establishment parties didn't win as many seats as expected, their influence has increased significantly. This could have implications for the political color of key EU positions,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank.
""The Parliament composition is also likely to have implications on the priority agenda for future EU reform, particularly with respect to things like immigration, fiscal spending and fiscal union,"" he added, noting a decrease in bond yields pointed to continued risk aversion. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year German Bunds fell to -0.147% on Monday, its lowest since September 2016.
On Tuesday, U.S. yields were also lower. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 2.3097%. The two-year yield touched 2.1724%.
Trade worries remain high on investors' list of concerns. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Washington was not ready to make a deal with Beijing but he expected one in the future, while at the same time pressing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to even out a trade imbalance with the United States. 
The dollar was flat against the yen at 109.50, and fell 0.13% against the euro, with the common currency buying $1.1182.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.17% higher at 97.782.
In commodity markets, oil prices extended gains after rising more than 1% on Monday on tensions in the Middle East and OPEC-led supply cuts, as well as continuing Russian supply disruptions after a contamination problem discovered last month.
Brent crude 0.29% higher at $70.31 per barrel, having earlier dipped below the $70 mark, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 1.16% to $59.31 per barrel.

Often referred to as the ""nuclear option,"" choosing to dump so large a pool of assets would likely destabilize world financial markets, drive interest rates higher and push tensions between the world's two largest economies into uncharted territory. 
China has been slimming its Treasury securities portfolio for some time, but most analysts see an aggressive reduction of its holdings as a remote possibility at most. There is no evidence Beijing is seriously looking to flood markets with its U.S. bonds. 
Here are some key points about China's Treasuries portfolio:
HOW MUCH U.S. DEBT DOES CHINA OWN?
About a decade ago, China overtook Japan as the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. 
Its holdings stood at more than $1.12 trillion at the end of March, according to U.S. Treasury department data. Japan is a close second with nearly $1.08 trillion.
China's holdings peaked in late 2013 at nearly $1.32 trillion and have come down by about 15% since then. In March they were the lowest in about two years.
Its share of the Treasury market has fallen even faster, due to the steady issuance of U.S. debt required to finance the growing federal budget deficit. 
The world's second biggest economy owns about 7% of the $16.18 trillion of U.S. public debt outstanding, its lowest share in 14 years, and down from a peak of 14% in 2011. Still, its slice of the pie is exceeded only by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which owns $2.15 trillion of Treasuries, or 13.5% of the market. 
Treasury issuance is expected to keep accelerating following a massive tax cut enacted in December 2017, so China's share of the market will likely drop even further.

WHY DOES CHINA OWN SO MUCH U.S. DEBT?
As a net exporter to the United States and the rest of the world, China has the world's largest stash of foreign-exchange reserves at more than $3 trillion. Much of that is denominated in U.S. dollars accumulated through its persistent trade surplus with the United States since the early 1990s. 
A natural place for China to park a lot of those greenbacks is the U.S. Treasury market, which is by far the largest and most liquid pool of safe assets in the world. 
Also, since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, U.S. Treasuries have consistently yielded more than bonds issued by other large developed economies such as Japan and Germany, which has been another lure.
(GRAPHIC: China's stake in U.S. Treasuries vs yuan - https://tmsnrt.rs/2HziSTz) 
WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE UNITED STATES IF CHINA SELLS?
Most analysts agree that large-scale selling by Beijing would disrupt the Treasury market and other markets. 
An abrupt shift in the balance of supply and demand could drive down Treasury prices, and drive up their yields, which move in the opposition direction to prices. That would cause a spike in borrowing costs for the U.S. government.
Also, because Treasury yields are a benchmark for U.S. consumer and business credit, interest rates on everything from corporate bonds to homeowners' mortgages would rise, likely slowing the economy.
Such a jarring move would also erode global investors' confidence in the U.S. dollar as the world's top reserve currency.
(GRAPHIC: Currency composition of FX reserves - https://tmsnrt.rs/2V2VgLt) 
WHAT IS THE RISK TO CHINA IF IT DUMPS TREASURIES?
Most analysts argue China has not opted to sell Uncle Sam's IOUs because a nosedive in U.S. bond prices also would bring down the value of China's remaining Treasury holdings.
Also, China's currency, the yuan, is not fully free floating. Beijing uses its Treasury holdings as a key tool to stabilize the yuan within a targeted range, against the dollar in particular.
Some critics have alleged China uses Treasuries and its other currency reserves to hold down the yuan, making its exports more attractive. At the same time, allowing the currency to cheapen too much risks other problems, such as foreign capital flight.
Any sharp depreciation in the greenback might force Beijing to defend the yuan, which may mean shedding more of its Treasuries stake. Back in 2016, China's Treasuries holdings fell sharply by some $200 billion from May to November of that year as the yuan depreciated on worries about the Chinese economy.
Lastly, any knock-on effect in the U.S. economy would also be felt in China because the United States is the destination for nearly a fifth of Chinese exports.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 12:45AM ET</span>",Asian stock-pickers bet on income growth over yield,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Investors in Asian stocks are picking companies and sectors that promise better long-term returns, overlooking the broader uncertainties around profits stemming from global trade and economic growth risks this year.
For some long-term investors in Asian equity markets, the evidence of a deeper change in the region's culture away from hoarding cash and towards rewarding investors with higher dividends is also a reason to stay invested.
That comes even as expectations grow among analysts that dividends per share by Asia Pacific companies, already on a downtrend since mid-2018, will fall more over the next 12 months than those doled out in North America and Europe, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts also downgraded their dividend forecasts for a larger proportion of Asia Pacific companies relative to numbers in North America and Europe, the data showed.
(GRAPHIC: Analysts' dividend per share forecast drops in Asia-Pacific in 2019 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ErqRA1)
(GRAPHIC: More downgrades than upgrades to dividend per share forecasts by Asia-Pacific firms - https://tmsnrt.rs/2M1a7Wx)
Yet despite this lacklustre outlook, investors are counting on a change in corporate culture in Asia that will drive companies to distribute their large cash piles.
In fact, with the risks from the U.S.-Sino trade war hurting stocks of export-reliant economies such as China, South Korea and Japan, hopes around dividends are one of the few drivers of investor optimism in the region.
For long, dividends were ""something that used to be a two-minute conversation at the end of a one-hour meeting. Now, it's number three or four on the agenda with every company we meet,"" said Sat Duhra, fund manager at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, who invests in firms with high dividend growth.
The total cash and short-term investments of more than 9,000 companies in the region grew to $2.84 trillion as of the end of December from $1.7 trillion five years earlier, an increase of 67%, Refinitiv data showed.
The S&P Pan Asia Dividend Aristocrats Index <.SPDGPAUP>, which consists of firms that have followed a policy of increasing dividends every year for at least seven years, has returned 6.8% this year compared with 3.2% for a broad Asian market index, S&P data showed.
Companies with a recent track record distributing dividends are now sought after, particularly as the prospect of a global growth slowdown and lower interest rates drives investors into defensive, income-paying stocks.
""Income is really something that has come into focus because of the low interest rate environment we've had since 2008,"" said Jim McCafferty, head of Asia-ex-Japan equity research at Nomura in Hong Kong.
""Given that traditional savings products would be in Treasuries or bank deposits and base rates remain close to zero, investors have got to look for more adventurous ways of providing an income.""
For Asia Pacific firms, the median payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings that a company pays in dividends, rose to 33% as of end-December, up from 28% at end-2014, Refinitiv data showed. That compared to 34% for U.S. companies and 27% for European firms as of end-December, according to Refinitiv figures.
Investors attracted to dividend growth see bright spots in Singaporean banks, Indonesian telecom firms, utility and infrastructure players in China and Thailand, and Australian energy names.
(GRAPHIC: Asia-Pacific median dividend payout ratios - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WGBnuf)
(GRAPHIC: Asia-Pacific median dividend payout ratios - https://tmsnrt.rs/2W3oBsG)
Companies with a history of growing dividends and setting aside a larger share of earnings for paying out dividends are doing well, though they were also helped by favourable macroeconomic factors, such as a recent recovery in chips or higher commodity prices.
For instance, the Sydney-listed shares of Australian mining giant Rio Tinto Ltd (AX:RIO) have rallied 36.1% this year, while those of smartphone maker South Korea's  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), gained 10.2% compared to a flat performance of Seoul's KOSPI stock index (KS11).
Both firms paid out more dividends in the latest year compared to the previous year, while seeing a rise in their payout ratios, respectively, to 72% at end-2018 from 67% a year earlier, and 22% at end-2018 from 14% the year before, Refinitiv data showed.

1603,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Alibaba's $20 Billion Share Sale to Pressure Hong Kong Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- A planned $20 billion offering by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. would likely squeeze liquidity in Hong Kong, pushing up borrowing rates in the city and strengthening the local dollar.
China’s largest company is considering a second listing in Hong Kong, people familiar with the matter said, potentially rivaling AIA Group Ltd.’s initial public offering in 2010 as the city’s biggest-ever share sale. Liquidity would tighten in the weeks around a listing due to demand for cash from subscribers. Alibaba raised a record $25 billion in its 2014 debut in New York.
“If it does raise such a huge amount of money in the Hong Kong stock market, then I think the Hibor, especially the front-end liquidity, would tighten around this period,” OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd. economist Carie Li said, using the term for interbank rates in the city. “It could push up the Hong Kong dollar by quite a significant magnitude, although it won’t last.”
A rise in Hibor affects the cost of everything from mortgages to corporate loans, and can linger after big share sales. Hong Kong borrowing costs climbed in the lead up to smartphone-maker Xiaomi Corp.’s IPO last year, with the one-month interbank rate hitting its highest since October 2008. Short-term rates then tumbled amid tepid demand.
Alibaba aims to file a listing application in Hong Kong as soon as the second half of 2019, the people familiar with the matter said.
A spike in borrowing costs could bring some welcome relief to the Hong Kong dollar. The currency has butted against the weak end of its 7.75-7.85 trading band versus the greenback several times this year, forcing the local monetary authority to intervene to defend the currency peg. The Hong Kong dollar was up 0.01% at 7.8487 per greenback at 11:16 a.m. local time Tuesday.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2019 11:25PM ET</span>",Meredith sells Sports Illustrated to Authentic Brands to further digital push,"(Reuters) - Media company Meredith Corp said on Monday it has agreed to sell Sports Illustrated to U.S-based entertainment company Authentic Brands Group LLC for $110 million, as it looks to scale its digital media business.
The companies also formed a strategic partnership to build a global media platform and develop broad-based licensing programs under the Sports Illustrated brand that will include product, original content and live events.
The purchase includes New York-headquartered Authentic Brands getting the intellectual property of the iconic magazine that will comprise of Sports Illustrated, Sports Illustrated Kids, Sportsperson of the Year, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, SI and SI TV, the companies said in a statement.
""As one of the most iconic brands in sports media, SI is a cultural centerpiece with massive opportunities for growth across its burgeoning digital, TV and social platforms and industry-leading print magazine,"" Authentic Brands Chief Executive Jamie Salter said in the statement.
Authentic Brands would take on the marketing, business development and licensing functions for the Sports Illustrated intellectual property and brand, which has over 120 million consumers, while the print magazine and SI.com would continue to function independently under Meredith and Editor-in-Chief Chris Stone and Publisher Danny Lee, the companies said.
Meredith National Media Group President Jon Werther said the company wants to fully integrate Sports Illustrated's print and digital products into Meredith's operations.
Meredith in turn will pay ABG a licensing fee to operate them for a minimum of two years.
Meredith, which acquired Sports Illustrated magazine as part of its $1.84 billion acquisition of Time Inc, had hired advisers to explore its sale along with considering options for Time, Fortune and Money magazines, as the company sees these titles as not playing to its core strength in women's magazines.
FanSided digital platform, which Meredith is currently in the process of selling, is not part of the deal, the statement added.
Houlihan Lokey acted as Meredith's financial advisor in the agreement.

The news came five years after Alibaba raised a record-breaking $25 billion through an IPO listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 as Hong Kong refused to approve its filing due to rules around company structure.
But the Hong Kong Stock Exchange launched a reform in listing rules last year which would allow dual-class share listings. Alibaba founder Jack Ma had previously said that the company would ""seriously consider"" a listing on its exchange.
Smartphone maker Xioami and food delivery service Meituan both became listed in Hong Kong in 2018 following the listing rules reform.
Alibaba is now working with financial advisers on the offering and is aiming to file an application as early as the second half of 2019, said the sources.
The fund will be used to help Alibaba “diversify funding channels and boost liquidity.”

China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.6% and 0.3% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also rose 0.3%.
The gain in Asian stocks came even after Trump said the U.S. is “not ready to make a deal” with China.
“I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it,” Trump said Monday at a joint press conference in Tokyo. “They would like to make a deal. We’re not ready to make a deal.”
Trump said American tariffs on Chinese goods “could go up very, very substantially, very easily.”
The President added that he thinks the two sides could eventually reach “a great trade deal” sometime in the future.
“Because I don’t believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don’t believe they can do that,” said Trump.
Trump unexpectedly raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods earlier this month.
Guo Shuqing, head of China’s banking and insurance regulator, said higher tariffs will have a “very limited” impact (on China’s economy), and would hurt the U.S. about as much.
Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) is considering a potential Hong Kong share offering that could raise $20 billion after its record-breaking 2014 New York IPO.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.4%. South Korea’s KOSPI was trading near flat. Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 climbed 0.6%.

1607,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",VW to Reshuffle $56 Billion Battery Push as Samsung Deal at Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG is making changes to its battery-purchasing plan worth about 50 billion euros ($56 billion) over concerns that one of its supply deals, with Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co. Ltd., might unravel, according to people familiar with the matter.
Samsung initially agreed to deliver batteries for just over 20 gigawatt hours, enough to power 200,000 cars with 100 kilowatt hour packs, before different views on production volume and schedule emerged during detailed negotiations, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential. The impasse cut pledged supplies to less than 5 gigawatt hours, they said.
Access to vast amounts of batteries to power a growing number of electric vehicles has emerged as a new battleground for global automakers amid capacity constraints, supply bottlenecks and limited access to raw materials. Producing batteries safe to use in cars is more complex than the technology used for consumer electronic devices like smartphones.
“VW ultimately needs 300 gigawatt hours of annual battery cell supply and without robust global multi-sourcing contracts this will be impossible,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said. “It’s one thing talking up electric vehicle volume numbers, building the necessary value chain remains a major challenge.”
Shares of Samsung SDI dropped as much as 4.9% in early trading on Tuesday in Seoul, their biggest intraday decline in more than two weeks. They were down 1.9% as of 9:21 a.m. local time.
VW is spending 30 billion euros on the industry’s biggest push into electric vehicles with a new range of purely battery-powered cars to challenge electric-car leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. The German manufacturer’s electric ID.3 hatchback will start rolling off assembly lines later this year.
“Samsung continues to be our battery cell supplier for Europe,” VW said in an emailed statement. Samsung declined to comment.
Tesla, beset by concerns over demand and its ability to make a profit, last month accused its battery supplier, Panasonic Corp., of being the culprit for tepid production rates of the affordable Model 3.
Earlier this month, VW outlined a project to build a domestic battery-cell factory in Germany together with Swedish startup Northvolt AB for almost 1 billion euros with capacity of 10 gigawatt hours. VW plans to take a final decision later this year.
VW’s electric rollout in the next ten years translates into battery demand of more than 300 gigawatt hours in Europe and Asia alone, outstripping current market capacities.
VW has picked LG Chem Ltd., Samsung and SK Innovation Co. as battery suppliers for Europe along with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. for China. It later added SK Innovation as partner for North America as well, starting in 2022.
The huge investments required to ramp up battery-production capacity have stoked intense rivalry, highlighted by a lawsuit LG Chem filed in the U.S. against SK Innovation over allegedly stealing secrets. SK Innovation has denied acting improperly.

The STOXX 600 index rose 0.2%, with most countries' bourses posting gains after results of European parliamentary elections showed strong support for pro-European Union parties.
However, with UK and U.S. markets closed for holidays, liquidity was shallow and STOXX 600 trading volumes were the lowest seen since late August.

""The prospect of a more pro-business government and enhanced investor prospects in Greece is helping the market play catch up.""

1617,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Elkann enlists Renault to drive Fiat family fortunes,"By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) - When John Elkann lost his ally last year with the sudden death of Sergio Marchionne, some questioned whether the softly-spoken scion of the Agnelli clan would be able to emerge from his shadow to ensure Fiat Chrysler's future.
But New York-born Elkann, who became Fiat chairman in 2010, acted decisively to fill the vacuum left by the larger-than-life Marchionne and get closer to the big merger deal the legendary executive was unable to deliver.
At just 28 Elkann was thrust into the role of Fiat vice-chairman after the deaths of his grandfather and great-uncle ""because there was really nobody else"" to take the wheel.
For Elkann, who got his first taste of the car industry as an intern at a factory producing headlights in Birmingham, England, the first 18 months with responsibility for the family-owned carmaker and its long heritage were ""terrible"".
But from that low point, Elkann, 43, is now trying to merge Fiat Chrysler (FCA) with French rival  Renault  (PA:RENA) to form the world's third largest carmaker and tackle new challenges facing the industry.
Elkann will become chairman of the merged FCA-Renault if the deal goes ahead, ensuring the Agnelli dynasty plays a central role in the next chapter of automotive history.
At an event in Milan on Monday, the usually-shy Elkann looked happy and confident. 
His first big break came with an instrumental role in persuading Marchionne, who was running one of the businesses owned by the Agnelli family, to become chief executive in 2004 and give Fiat ""a new start"", Elkann said in a ""Masters of Scale"" podcast last year.
Fiat was at the time almost on the brink of collapse.
This involved a ""very long night ... and many grappas"" but proved to be a turning point in the fortunes of the Italian company founded by Elkann's great-great-grandfather Giovanni Agnelli, which built its first car in 1899.
In 2005, Elkann backed Marchionne in negotiating the breakup of an alliance Fiat had entered into with General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2000, receiving $2 billion from GM in return for cancelling a deal that could have required GM to buy the remainder of Fiat Auto. 
Marchionne then used GM's money to fund a turnaround at Fiat, which involved taking the Italian carmaker into a transformation alliance and then full-blown merger with U.S. automaker Chrysler as Elkann agreed to the Agnellis loosening their grip.
If Elkann can deliver a deal with Renault - which will net the Agnellis about 725 million euros ($811 million) in a dividend payout - it will be partly thanks to his pick of new CEO.
Michael Manley was probably was not the obvious choice, but the transition to the post-Marchionne era has been smooth with no tensions or rivalries within the family or the FCA group.
The focus has been very much on the future as FCA, like its rivals, grapples with the challenges posed for the car making industry by fast-changing technology and regulation.
NOTHING 'IMPOSSIBLE'
Elkann, who is also Chairman and CEO of the Agnelli holding company EXOR, appears to be taking a leaf out of his great-great-grandfather's book.
""We must always look to the future. Foresee the future of new inventions. Be unafraid of the new. Delete from our vocabulary the word 'impossible',"" Elkann quotes the Fiat founder's mantra as being.
Elkann, whose French is better than his Italian, spent seven years at a lycee in France before studying Engineering at Politecnico, the Engineering University of Turin. He has often been portrayed more as a financier who has moved key elements of Fiat away from Italy.
His efforts to keep Fiat on the road, however, have not been rewarded with the popularity his grandfather, known as ""L'Avvocato"", enjoyed even though he has maintained the family's involvement with soccer club Juventus and chairs the Giovanni Agnelli Foundation.
Elkann has transformed EXOR's portfolio during his time in the driving seat of the family empire. He diversified into insurance - winning a bitter $6.9 billion takeover battle for Bermuda reinsurer PartnerRe in 2015 - and into media assets through The Economist magazine. 
Elkann, an admirer of Warren Buffett, also listed Juventus on the stock exchange, turning a hobby of Elkann's grandfather into a serious business.
During his watch, Fiat has also spun off Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and truckmaker CHNI, in line with his philosophy that companies need to adapt to survive in the long-run. EXOR is still the top shareholder in both companies.
After all these changes, Elkann is now at the top of a family empire less exposed to the cyclical and rapidly-changing auto industry yet with a potentially key role, with a stake of just below 15 percent, in a leading global carmaker.
This will mean Elkann has delivered on his promise of upholding the Agnelli family's pledge to the auto industry, which still employs thousands of workers in Italy, while at the same time bringing taking FCA onto a new stage.
And if he can keep to FCA's pledge not to shut plants, Elkann might yet become an Italian legend like his forebears.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2019 12:07PM ET</span>",Adjudicator says any security defense of U.S. auto tariffs at WTO 'very difficult',"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States will find it ""very difficult"" to defend President's Donald Trump's proposed car tariff against any challenge at the World Trade Organization, a veteran trade adjudicator who has ruled on a related case told Reuters.
Trump said this month that some imported vehicles and parts pose a ""national security"" threat, justifying tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the basis for tariffs put on steel and aluminum last year.
The car tariff of up to 25 percent, applying to vehicles and components from everywhere else in the world, would be automatically illegal were it not for a WTO exception granted in cases of national security.
Until 2016, using the national security clause was taboo because trade experts feared it could become a common way to get around the rules and erect the kind of trade barriers the WTO was designed to remove.
But it has arisen in disputes between Russia and Ukraine and between Qatar and several of its neighbors, as well as in Trump's tariffs.
In a rare comment by a senior trade arbitrator, Georges Abi-Saab, a former chairman of the WTO's Appellate Body, the world's top trade court, said he doubted the national security argument for cars would withstand a legal challenge.
""Frankly I think, if I were a lawyer (working on the case) I wouldn't accept to take such a case – not only on moral aspects, but I think it would be very difficult to make it prevail,"" he said.
The car tariffs have not yet materialized, since Trump has given the European Union, Japan and other major exporters 180 days to negotiate. A legal challenge from any of the parties cannot be considered until tariffs are active. 
ACTUAL WAR
Last month Abi-Saab chaired a dispute panel which issued the only ruling in WTO history on the national security question, settling the dispute in favor of Russia, which was found to have a bona fide legal defense against Ukraine because of an armed conflict recognized by the United Nations.
But the ruling set a high bar for national security claims, saying they needed to be based ""objectively"" on an emergency in international relations, and the less a claim had to do with actual war, the harder it would be to make the case. 
""I would say strategic raw materials may be easier to prove than a final product like a car,"" Abi-Saab said. ""The further you get away from it (armed conflict and the breakdown of law and civil order), the more you have to prove how this relates to national security.""
That contrasts with the U.S. view that national security claims are ""self-judging"" and WTO adjudicators must automatically dismiss any challenge. 
WTO rulings do not set formal precedents, but adjudicators routinely refer back to previous cases, so the Russia-Ukraine ruling could influence the handling of ongoing challenges to the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs by China, Turkey, Switzerland, Norway, the EU and India.
They reject U.S. claims that protecting metals output is needed for ""defense requirements and critical infrastructure"".

Two other complainants, Canada and Mexico, lifted their opposition this month after reaching a deal with Trump.

The commission had set a May 31 deadline for the submission of offers to build and operate a casino along with a luxury hotel, conference and recreation facilities on a sprawling disused airport in Hellenikon.
It extended the deadline to June 28, without giving a reason for the delay.
The casino license is key to the start of an 8 billion euro project by Lamda Development backed by China's Fosun and Arab funds to turn 620 hectares of wasteland at the former Hellenikon airport into a complex of luxury homes, hotels and a yachting marina.
Beset by serious delays, Hellenikon is part of a post-bailout agreement between Athens and its international creditors and is expected to boost state coffers by hundreds of millions of euros and create thousands of jobs in the coming years.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2019 10:49AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler and Renault pursue $35 billion merger to combat car industry upheaval,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Laurence Frost
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler pitched a finely balanced merger of equals to  Renault  (PA:RENA) on Monday to tackle the costs of far-reaching technological and regulatory changes by creating the world's third-biggest automaker.
If it goes ahead, the $35 billion-plus tie-up would alter the landscape for rivals including General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Peugeot maker PSA Group, which recently held inconclusive talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), and could spur more deals. 
Renault said it was studying the proposal from Italian-American FCA with interest, and considered it friendly. 
Shares in both companies jumped more than 10 percent as investors welcomed the prospect of an enlarged business capable of producing more than 8.7 million vehicles a year and aiming for 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in annual savings.
It would rank third in the global auto industry behind Japan's Toyota and Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
But analysts also warned of big complications, including Renault's existing alliance with Nissan, the French state's role as Renault's largest shareholder and potential opposition from politicians and workers to any cutbacks. 
""The market will be careful with these synergy numbers as much has been promised before and there isn’t a single merger of equals that has ever succeeded in autos,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said.
With these sensitivities in mind, FCA proposed an all-share merger under a listed Dutch holding company. After a 2.5 billion euro dividend for existing FCA shareholders - giving a big upfront boost to the Agnelli family that controls 29% of FCA - investors in each firm would hold half of the new entity.
The merged group would be chaired by Agnelli family scion John Elkann, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters, while Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard would likely become CEO.
Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the proposed merger could be good news for Italy if it helped FCA to grow, but it was crucial to preserve jobs.
He did not comment on the French government's 15% stake in Renault, but an influential lawmaker from the ruling League party said Rome may seek a stake in the combined group to balance France's holding.
A deal could also have profound repercussions for Renault's 20-year-old alliance with Nissan, already weakened by the crisis surrounding the arrest and ouster of former chairman Carlos Ghosn late last year. The Japanese carmaker has yet to comment on FCA's proposal. 
In a letter to employees seen by Reuters, FCA chief executive Mike Manley cautioned a merger with Renault could take more than a year to finalize. 
'BOLD DECISIONS'
A deal could help both companies address some of the shortcomings that have led their market valuations to lag major rivals, as well as the shift to electric and self-driving technologies amid tightening emissions regulations. 
FCA has a highly profitable businesses in North America with its RAM trucks and Jeep brand, but lost money last quarter in Europe, where most of its plants are running below 50% capacity and it faces a struggle with new emissions curbs.
Renault, by contrast, was an early mover in electric cars, has relatively fuel-efficient engine technologies and a strong presence in emerging markets, but no U.S. business.
A deal would do little, however, to address both firms' limited presence in China, the world's biggest auto market.
It would also create the challenge of managing a large number of brands, from high-end Maseratis to budget Dacias.
The huge cost of countering disruptive new entrants such as Tesla's electric cars or future autonomous vehicles from Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has pushed other automakers to collaborate, including Volkswagen and Ford. 
FCA-Renault, like almost every possible automotive pairing, has been studied intermittently for years by dealmakers. But the fractious relations between Ghosn and FCA's long-standing boss Sergio Marchionne made constructive talks impossible before Marchionne's sudden death last July, banking sources said.
Renault shares were up 15% to 57.46 euros at 1320 GMT, while FCA's Milan-listed stock was up 11.3% at 12.75 euros. PSA, widely seen as an industry consolidator, was off 3%.
PARIS AND ROME
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, supports a merger with FCA in principle but will need to see more details, its main spokeswoman said.
France will be ""particularly vigilant regarding employment and industrial footprint,"" another Paris official said, adding any deal must safeguard Renault's alliance with Nissan, which recently rebuffed a merger proposal from its partner. 
Seeking to soothe concerns, FCA said the deal plans ""are not predicated on plant closures, but would be achieved through more capital-efficient investment"".
The carmakers have given commitments to maintain industrial jobs and sites, one source said - leaving room for white-collar and engineering layoffs as well as some plant downsizing. 
Early areas for potential convergence include Renault's next electric car platform being launched at its Douai site in France, the source said, adding all of Renault's board members backed the decision to study FCA's proposal with the exception of the leftist CGT union, which abstained. 
In a sign of potential future tensions, the CGT demanded the French state retained a blocking stake in any merged group. 
Appealing to Nissan, which is 43.4%-owned by Renault, FCA said the Japanese carmaker would nominate a director to the 11-member board of the new company. Nissan and affiliate Mitsubishi would also benefit from 1 billion euros in cost and investment savings, it added.
Decision-making by such a board is unlikely to be straightforward, some analysts warned.
""We now have the French, the Italians, the Japanese and the Americans needing to find consensus on the board of a Dutch company, where the French state stands to lose its special status,"" Ellinghorst said.
""This requires quite a bit of creativity.""

1627,By Business Insider,"<span>May 27, 2019 10:33AM ET</span>",The rise and fall and rebirth of General Motors," 
The story of General Motors is one of rising, falling — and rising again.
Born from the wild early days of the Detroit car business, ""The General"" made it through the Great Depression and rose to become the model of an American corporation. At one point in the 1950s, one of every two cars sold the in US carried a GM brand name.
GM's decline wasn't swift. From the 1970s through the 2010s, it remained a force in business, not just in the US, but worldwide. 
But the changing global auto industry took its toll, and by 2009, when the financial crisis hit, GM hit a wall. The company had to be bailed out by the US government before entering bankruptcy.
A changed company emerged — leaner and more agile, determine to never again collapse under its own weight. Since its 2010 IPO, GM has been steadily profitable. And under CEO Mary Barra, the first woman to lead a major automaker, GM has invested in a future of electric cars and self-driving vehicles.
Here's how GM rose, fell, and rose anew.

1628,By Business Insider,"<span>May 27, 2019 10:31AM ET</span>",Your Uber ride could get 80% cheaper over the next decade,"The bank's evidence lab ran a massive simulation model to estimate the future of ride-hailing in New York City, and the impact robo-taxis could have on the space. Their conclusions point to a $2 trillion robo-taxi market by 2030.
For consumers and riders, perhaps the biggest takeaway of the real-time simulation is that fares could drop significantly over the next decade, by as much as 80%, meaning even more competition between car rides and public transportation.
""The average fare paid by passengers could fall by more than 80% and become cheaper than a metro ticket,"" the team of analysts wrote in their lengthy report to clients, published on May 22. ""In such a scenario, the robo-taxi fleet would still generate a healthy profitability margin of more than 30%.""
That's good news for Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), which are still heavily in the red as they continue to grow, but more bad news for public transportation systems.  Multiple studies have already shown that ride-hailing services are quickly siphoning off users from trains and buses.
Autonomy can also help Uber and Lyft cars increase a complicated but closely watched measure known as utilization rates. This fraction for the time a car actually spends carrying a fare-paying passenger was at the core of  Lyft's lawsuit to change New York City's minimum wage rules for ride-hailing drivers,  which it lost in early May.
""The utilization rate of the robo-taxi fleet would reach c50% over a 24- hour shift,"" UBS writes. ""That is twice as high as Uber/Lyft's utilization rates today, and 10 times higher than a private car.""
As the world slowly evolves to that of self-driving, there will be decades where companies must manage human drivers alongside  their eventual robot replacements. UBS expects that inflection point to begin in 2019, escalating over the next decade.
""Once the inflection point is reached, we believe the growth rate for robo-taxi adoption will be steep,"" the analysts said. ""We remain confident that the robo-taxi business model works both financially and technologically, although we delay our forecast for robo-taxi (L5/L4) penetration by 1-2 years, mostly to reflect higher efficiency of the fleet as shown in our simulation (i.e. fewer cars are required to cover demand)."""

1630,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2019 07:20AM ET</span>",KTM Hails ‘Sensational’ First Quarter Motorcycle Sales in Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Sales of motorcycles across Europe continue to be strong despite challenges ranging from Brexit to trade tensions to political turmoil, the region’s leading bikemaker says.
“I’ve been totally surprised,” said Stefan Pierer, chief executive of Austria’s KTM Industries AG, whose unit sales grew by 10% last year to 261,000. “Europe has been sensational this year.”
Pierer said he had expected concerns such as the Yellow Vest protests in France, Italy’s debt burden, and Britain’s departure from the European Union to cut into sales. But the industry’s growth in the region topped 21% in the first quarter, with KTM slightly outpacing rivals at about 22%, he said at the company’s headquarters in Mattighofen, Austria. The company says the data reflect robust consumer confidence, as most of its European sales are of bikes ridden for weekend fun rather than commuting.
In North America, dominated by Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG)., industry sales declined by 4.5%, with KTM posting a drop of 1.1%. April was somewhat softer than March, KTM said.
KTM, which also owns the Husqvarna brand, has doubled its annual unit sales over the past five years. Pierer had predicted revenue growth of 1% to 5% this year and next, before new models kick that up to about 10% in 2021. By 2022, Pierer aims to expand unit sales to 400,000 and revenue to 2 billion euros, including KTM bikes sold by Indian partner Bajaj Auto Ltd.
Earnings before interest and taxes will remain between 8% and 10% of sales, while capital expenditures likely peaked at 184 million euros in 2018 and will fall below 160 million euros annually from 2019 to 2021, he said. Free cash flow will improve as new models are introduce and spending on updated facilities winds down.
KTM’s new offerings include a 390 cubic centimeter, single-cylinder enduro bike this year and a touring model with a lightweight two-cylinder engine in 2020. Husqvarna will introduce an 800cc travel enduro for 2021, and Pierer is considering a 1300cc V2 similar to the KTM Super Duke.
Dealers have groused that they need steep markdowns to clear inventory after KTM imposed ambitious sales targets in recent years. To reduce the overhang, Pierer is trimming production in Mattighofen this year. And he’s accelerating plans to take over Pexco, a unit that makes bicycles and e-bikes, expecting full control by 2021.
“E-bikes have become a huge market,” Pierer said. “The market has exploded, and as a large manufacturer you have to be there.”

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday as investors snapped up automaker stocks following confirmation of merger talks between Fiat Chrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA), and after European parliamentary elections saw pro-Europe parties cling to a majority.
The gains followed a stronger showing in Asian markets, where shares rose but remained near 4-month lows. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was ahead by 0.1%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.4% with all major European indices in the black, although trading volumes were thin with markets in the United States and United Kingdom closed for market holidays.
Auto stocks climbed 1.8% as Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler confirmed it had made a ""transformative merger"" proposal to French peer Renault in a deal which would create the world's third-biggest carmaker. Shares of both companies rallied.
Markets were also buoyed as pro-European parties retained a firm grip on the EU parliament, provisional results from the bloc's elections showed, though eurosceptic opponents saw strong gains.
Investors had been worried about eurosceptic parties gaining a 30% vote share - the level at which they could seriously disrupt European governance and the region's ability to show unity in addressing key concerns like a global trade war.
But while far-right, nationalist or anti-EU groups came out on top in Italy, Britain, France and Poland, they failed to alter dramatically the balance of pro-European power in the EU assembly.
""The impression of a fragmented political system remains, but perhaps when all is said and done, the message will be that Brexit has reduced appetite to leave the EU,"" said Kit Juckes, FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The euro initially rallied above $1.12 but by 0920 GMT the single currency was struggling, down 0.1% at $1.1195.
The dollar index gained 0.1% in quiet trading.
""In the simple world of FX a possible crisis is averted, leaving us with familiar issues. Europe needs more growth and while EU leaders argue over who gets which top jobs, it needs easier fiscal policy perhaps most of all,"" Juckes said.
European government bond markets were little moved with the spread between the German 10-year bond yield, considered one of the world's safest assets, and the Italian 10-year government bond yield little moved after initially narrowing.
Spanish and Portuguese bond yields hit record lows - a sign of investor confidence after the election results.
Elsewhere, U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Japan was overshadowed by trade tensions. Trump pressed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to even out a trade imbalance with the United States.
Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China have rattled investors in recent weeks, pressuring stocks lower just as concerns build about weakening momentum in the world's largest economies.
The yen, often the currency of choice for nervous investors, fell 0.2% against the dollar to 109.495 but remained close to four-month highs hit earlier in May as traders looked for safety in the face of mounting trade-related woes. 
China's yuan rose to a 1-1/2 week high against the U.S. dollar on Monday, buoyed by a senior official's warning not to bet against the Chinese currency.
The pound held around $1.2703. Sterling had bounced back from a near five-month trough of $1.2605 after British Prime Minister Theresa May last week named a date for her to step down - triggering a leadership contest during which investors fear the risk of a no-deal Brexit will rise. 
Oil prices mostly fell, extending losses from last week when crude dropped the most this year. Concerns the Sino-U.S. trade war could trigger a broad economic slowdown have sent this year's oil rally into reverse, although OPEC's supply cuts provided some support. 

Front-month Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.1% to $68.80 per barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 0.5% to $58.33 per barrel.

1633,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>","As Leaders Quarrel, Fiat and Renault Seek Detente in Car Deal","(Bloomberg) -- French and Italian leaders have reveled in throwing mud at each other, but two of the countries’ flagship companies are now looking beyond the bad blood to cozy up to each other.
The prospective deal, a proposal by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) to merge with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), could create the world’s third-biggest carmaker. The prospect is already triggering contrasting responses from politicians, though the Italian company has said there won’t be plant closures as a result of the combination.
On hearing news of the tie-up, the rightist League party of Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, who has in the past clashed virulently with French President Emmanuel Macron, swiftly invoked Italy’s “national interest” and dangled the option of the Rome government stepping in. The League, after all, campaigned for Sunday’s European Parliament election on an “Italy First” platform.
“Given the state presence in Renault, the fact that two companies of this size plan to merge has to be looked at with special care,” the League’s Claudio Borghi, who heads the lower house budget committee, told La7 television. Borghi was quick to remind viewers that the French government fought tooth-and-nail against a bid by Italy’s Fincantieri for the France-based STX shipyard.
Italy will ensure “that the historic value of Fiat is guaranteed, otherwise we’ll intervene,” Borghi said, adding that could include the state taking a stake in Fiat to match the French holding in Renault.
Debt Mountain
A French government official said it would be surprising if the founding Agnelli family welcomed a state presence in the company. The official, who asked not to be named discussing confidential matters, also wondered aloud whether the Italian government -- already burdened with a mountain of debt -- would have the funds to pay for it.
Still, the official could not see any political risks to the merger, and insisted it would be a win-win for the two countries and their economies.
The merger will promote European “economic sovereignty,” French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye told BFM TV, adding the government favors the link-up, though it’s waiting to examine all the conditions.
With the League surging to become Italy’s biggest political force in Sunday’s European elections, Salvini could be more tempted than ever to fly the nationalist flag and take a provocative stand on the merger, especially if jobs are at risk.
“We welcome the FCA-Renault deal, as long as factories in Italy stay open,” the League’s Massimo Garavaglia, deputy finance minister, told Radio 24. “The market is always right.”
Recent cross-border transactions have inflamed nationalism in both countries.  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) SpA’s two biggest shareholders, French media company  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) SA and U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp., have been locked in a battle for influence at the carrier for more than a year.
Salvini has taken particular pleasure in launching folksy broadsides against Macron, last year calling him “a polite young man who drinks too much champagne.” Salvini has also accused Macron of protecting fugitives wanted by Italian authorities, including convicted members of the far-left Red Brigades.
Macron, who has spoken of “populist leprosy,” retorted that Italians “deserve a government worthy of their history.”
The sparring between the two neighbors has quieted down from its low point, when France recalled its ambassador for a week in February, although Salvini repeatedly took aim at Macron in the European election campaign, calling the French leader a symbol of the liberal, establishment class he pledged to overthrow."
1634,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>","Nasdaq pulls out of Oslo Bors battle, handing Euronext victory","By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Nasdaq withdrew its offer for Oslo Bors on Monday, giving pan-European exchange Euronext free rein to pursue its bid for the Norwegian stock market operator after a five-month battle.
Euronext secured approval from Norway's Ministry of Finance this month to buy more than 50% of Oslo Bors for 158 Norwegian crowns per share, effectively blocking Nasdaq's bid. Both had valued one of Europe's few independent stock market operators at around 6.8 billion Norwegian crowns ($783 million).
Both Euronext, which runs exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Dublin, and Nasdaq are looking to expand their portfolios but opportunities are scarce as market operators either already belong to international groups or their shareholders want to remain independent.
With technology speeding up trading and deregulation leading to market integration, size has become an important feature for bourse operators as big data allows larger players to squeeze costs and reduce transaction fees.
The Oslo Bors acquisition is expected to diversify Euronext's revenue from shares and derivatives trading, given the Norwegian operator's leading position in seafood derivatives as well as oil services and shipping.
Euronext's success blocks Nasdaq's ambition of completing a sweep of the Nordic-Baltic region, where the U.S. firm already owns the stock markets of Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, as well as those of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Nasdaq, which had won the support of the Norwegian market operator's major investors DNB and KLP, said it would now release those owners from their obligations.
'GOOD SOLUTION'
Norway had rejected Nasdaq's argument that no takeover should be allowed unless a two-thirds stake was obtained, a demand that could have blocked Euronext as the U.S. company had secured backing from around 35% of owners.
Neither Oslo Bors' management, nor DNB, which holds a 20% stake, or KLP, which holds 10%, had been consulted head of Euronext's surprise Dec. 24 bid, and the three immediately began searching for an alternative bidder.
While Nasdaq entered the fray in late January, eventually driving up the bid to 158 crowns from Euronext's initial 145 crowns offer, it was unable to overcome Euronext's early support of more than half the Oslo Bors shareholders.
DNB and KLP said they had not yet decided whether to sell their shares or not, but would meet to discuss the way forward.
""We've not yet decided what to do, but we hope to find a good solution with Euronext,"" DNB spokesman Thomas Midteide said, while a spokeswoman for KLP said the pension provider would coordinate its approach with DNB.
Euronext has said it aims to complete its transaction by the end of June, and to appoint the Oslo Bors chief executive to its managing board. It also promised to set up a hub in the Norwegian capital to supervise commodities transactions.
Shares in Euronext moved 0.1% higher at 0907 GMT, while those of Oslo Bors had not been traded.

1635,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>",Why Stock Market May Be Wrong to Rely on Trump and Powell Puts,"(Bloomberg) -- While the consensus of investors and stock strategists remains that the U.S. and China will reach a deal that ends the escalation in trade restrictions between the world’s two largest economies, a vocal minority has been warning about woeful over-optimism.
One of those Cassandras has been James McCormick, global head of strategy at NatWest Markets in London, who’s been monitoring markets for the better part of three decades. He says he’s heard two main objections to his warning about markets failing to discount a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.
“I had plenty of debates on this in the past few weeks, some a little heated,” McCormick wrote in a note Monday. “The pushback I get on the need for more discounting in global equities, the U.S. especially, boils down to the Trump and Powell ‘puts.”’
The first refers to the idea that President Donald Trump will come to the market’s rescue with a trade deal if needed, given the importance he places on equity performance as a yardstick for his administration. The second is the concept of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell coming to the rescue with interest-rate cuts.
A critical problem with both of the “put” arguments is their circularity, McCormick highlights. In other words, before Trump or Powell come to the rescue, there needs to be a big sell-off -- the kind of sell-off that McCormick's been warning about.
Another challenge is that it’s too soon to be making decisions based on the 2020 presidential campaign. For his own part, Trump hasn’t indicated any urgency about getting an agreement in coming months. On Monday, he said in Tokyo that “we’re not ready to make a deal” and that tariffs could go up “very substantially.”
G-20 Summit
As for the Powell put, “the Fed was far apart from the market on the possibility of a rate cut at its last meeting,” McCormick said. Suggestions of preparedness for the 2019 reduction that futures markets are discounting have so far been limited to regional Fed officials.
“The problem with the Powell put is that this Fed has a somewhat erratic reaction function. The longer it takes for the Fed to start squawking dovishly, the more vulnerable risk assets are likely to be,” McCormick's Natwest colleague John Briggs wrote in a separate note.
While global stocks have slumped the past three weeks, the retreat has been far milder than the fourth-quarter rout. The next hurdle will be whether the Trump administration proceeds with slapping tariffs on the remainder of Chinese goods imports, according to McCormick. And that should be clear by the end of June, he wrote -- after the conclusion of the G-20 summit in Osaka, where Trump and President Xi Jinping have the chance to set things back on track.

1636,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2019 04:39AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Spirit of Marchionne Lives on in FCA-Renault Deal,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Sergio Marchionne may be gone, but his spirit lives on.
The former Fiat boss would surely have applauded his successor’s plan for another transformative merger to address the problems of slowing demand and frighteningly large investment obligations as mobility becomes electric, autonomous and connected.
FCA's (NYSE:FCAU) strongest card is the extra efficiency such scale creates: it estimates annual synergies at over 5 billion euros, in addition to those that  Renault  (PA:RENA) currently enjoys with its merger partner Nissan (T:7201). A combined FCA-Renault would be the world’s third-largest automotive group behind Toyota (T:7203) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). But – more importantly – it could also convince Nissan and Mitsubishi (T:8058) that there is no long-term alternative to deeper integration with Renault. That could enhance the efficiencies of scale still further.
But as with so many of Marchionne’s grand designs, Fiat Chrysler’s move on Renault risks being bogged down by the details – and by the sheer number of moving parts in the deal.
First, there is the promise of no plant closures. This comes after a six-month period in which – according to Bloomberg calculations – global carmakers have announced 38,000 job cuts. Of those, only 1,500 have come from FCA and none from Renault. The two companies are behind in the race to trim costs and this promise reduces their ability to extract the maximum benefit from the deal (although it’s conspicuous that there’s no promise about the safety of white-collar jobs)
Second, there's the ownership question: the Financial Times has cited an unnamed French government official as saying the government isn’t opposed to the deal, but the French state’s stake would be diluted in a merged company, and it would only be the second largest shareholder behind Exor, the Agnelli family holding company now run by Johann Elkann. FCA has tried to address concerns of control by proposing an 11-member board with four members each from FCA and Renault, with one more from Nissan.
Either way, markets have decided they like the idea, and have pushed Renault 13.7% higher on Monday morning, while FCA is up 9.9%.  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), which could see its competitive position jeopardized, is down 2.6%. That’s helping the Italy lead Europe’s stock markets higher on a morning where the mood has been lifted by the reasonably strong showing of centrist parties in elections to the European parliament.
The FTSE MIB is up 0.9%, while the French CAC 40 is up 0.3%. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600, which includes a lot of U.K. stocks that aren’t trading today due to the local bank holiday, is up 0.4% at 377.32 as of 4.30 AM ET (0830 GMT)."

1638,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2019 03:30AM ET</span>","Citi, JPMorgan, UBS Face Australia Forex Cartel Class Action","(Bloomberg) --  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are among five banks named in a class action lawsuit in Australia seeking damages for colluding on foreign-exchange trading strategies.
UBS Group AG and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc were also named in the suit lodged Monday in the Federal Court by Maurice Blackburn Lawyers. The action claims the banks colluded to rig foreign exchange rates, boosting profits at the expense of Australian businesses and investors, the law firm said in a statement.
Spokespeople at Citi and JPMorgan in Sydney and Barclays in Hong Kong had no immediate comment on the suit. UBS didn’t return a call seeking comment. RBS didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry outside of regular business hours in London, where it is a public holiday.
Citi, RBS, JPMorgan and Barclays were among five lenders that agreed to pay European Union fines totaling 1.07 billion euros ($1.2 billion) earlier this month for colluding on foreign exchange strategies. UBS escaped a fine because it was the first to tell regulators about the collusion.
Traders allegedly used chat rooms bearing names such as “The Cartel,” “The Bandits’ Club,” and “The Mafia,” and communicated directly with each other to coordinate the manipulation of FX benchmark rates, control the pricing of spreads and to trigger client stop-loss orders and limit orders, Maurice Blackburn said.
The manipulation of benchmark foreign-exchange rates was exposed in 2013 via Bloomberg stories, triggering regulatory probes in the U.S., the U.K. and Switzerland. More than a dozen financial institutions have paid about $11.8 billion in fines and penalties globally, with another $2.3 billion spent to compensate customers and investors.
While the U.S. has won guilty pleas from JPMorgan, Citigroup, RBS and Barclays, three British traders in the group known as “The Cartel” were acquitted by a U.S. federal court last year of using a chatroom to coordinate trades and manipulate prices on the spot exchange rate for euros and U.S. dollars.
Maurice Blackburn’s suit claims Australian companies and investors, including importers, exporters, institutional investors and businesses with overseas operations have been affected by the distortion of currency markets by the five banks. The action is on behalf of customers who bought or sold more than A$500,000 ($347,000) of foreign currency between Jan. 1 2008 and Oct. 15, 2013, the law firm said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian law firm filed a class action lawsuit on Monday against five major international investment banks accusing them of colluding to rig foreign exchange rates during 2008-2013 to jack up profits at the expense of businesses and investors.
The case involved some of the same banks caught up in similar currency market scandals in Europe and the United States.
UBS AG,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank Plc,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc and JP Morgan AG are accused, according to Australian court documents, of colluding to increase the price clients paid for certain investment products in order to fix exchange rates at more costly levels.
Reuters emailed and called the banks named in the lawsuit.
JP Morgan declined to comment, while spokespeople for UBS, Citi and RBS acknowledged receiving Reuters' enquiries but were not immediately available for comment.
Maurice Blackburn, the law firm that has launched the case, alleged that traders from the banks, who were supposed to be competing with each other, shared confidential information like details of clients and their orders on internet chatrooms.
According to court documents, names given by the traders to those chatrooms included ""The Cartel"", ""The Mafia"" and ""A CoOperative"".
Several of the same chatroom names were identified in an investigation into foreign exchange rate rigging by U.S. regulators.
In a U.S. case, Barclays,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Citigroup, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS have entered related guilty pleas, and been collectively fined more than $2.8 billion.
Reuters reported earlier this month that EU anti-trust regulators investigating currency market rigging were set to fine seven banks, several of which were also accused in the case launched in Australia.
""Australian businesses and investors, particularly medium to large importers, exporters, institutional investors and businesses with operations overseas, have been affected by the distortion of the FX market by these banks,"" said Maurice Blackburn principal lawyer Kimi Nishimura in a statement.
""Such cartel behavior cheats Australian businesses in circumstances where they may already have been vulnerable to currency fluctuations,"" Nishimura added.
The lead plaintiff was a dental products importer called J. Wisbey and Associates, although the class action would represent any Australian customers of the five investment banks which had made cross-border transactions worth more than A$500,000 ($346,250) in the five-year period, Maurice Blackburn said.
Maurice Blackburn wanted the five investment banks to pay damages to the plaintiffs without specifying how much, according to the court documents.
The dust has barely settled from the previous scandal that roiled Australia's banking community in recent years after a market regulator launched a series of lawsuits against the country's ""Big Four"" banks.
The regulator accused them of rigging the Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) - a benchmark interest rate in Australia used to price trillions of dollars of assets - to inflate profit during the period 2010-2012.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX, National Australia Bank NAB.AX and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX - settled before hearings began. Westpac Banking Corp defended the case, and was cleared by a court a year ago.

The airline, which operated 14 737 MAX jets before the grounding, said the decision would lead to about 40 or 45 canceled flights daily.
United has not disclosed the financial impact of the 737 MAX grounding, which Kirby said the airline would ""worry about down the road"".

1644,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2019 07:35PM ET</span>",Cash stays king as nervous investors stash dough ahead of summer lull,"By Josephine Mason and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Cash is still king for investors heading into the summer slowdown.
Stashing cash started during the global rout across financial markets late last year as investors worried about a global economic recession.
Increasing a cash buffer is typical during times of economic and geopolitical strife.
But data and interviews with global wealth managers show that hoarding has continued at unusually high levels even as global stocks have rallied this year amid conflicting signals after the central banks' U-turns, mixed macroeconomic data and fresh tumult in Washington's spat with China.
The pan-European STOXX 600 and S&P 500 are up 11% and 12% respectively for the year to date.
However, many U.S. investors have still been lured by the outperformance of U.S. Treasury bonds compared with total returns in U.S. equities over the past six months.
Millionaires were hoarding as much as a third of their wealth in cash in March, up from less than a quarter at the end of last year, according to a client survey by UBS Asset Management.
UBS doesn't have historical data for global allocation, but Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti described cash levels as astonishing and said in March U.S. holdings were at records.
Global funds on average allocated 6.4% of their portfolios to cash in the first quarter, the highest on records going back to 2013, according to Reuters' survey. [ASSET/WRAP]
That level shrank to 5.2% last month, but it is still above historical levels, Reuters records show. 
Graphic: Cash stash, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2M1CyUr 
Reflecting the caution and uncertainty spreading across markets, most UBS clients said they were waiting to pounce on the next investment opportunity, holding cash as protection against a market downturn or keeping it for an emergency when asked what their rationale is for holding so much cash.
""One of the most common questions we get asked is 'when's the cycle going to end',"" said James Mulford, Head of UK Mandates & Investment Content at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
According to Morningstar data gathered for Reuters on more than 1,000 funds, net cash allocation has remained around 3% since late last year, above the historical average of 2.7%. 
Interviews with wealth managers at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC confirm the trend.
""Cash has been running meaningfully above average among clients,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. ""Typically cash would be 5-6% of their assets. Now it's 3 to 4 times more."" 
Investors wonder how much longer this year's stock market rally can last as valuations look stretched and Q1 corporate earnings growth slowed, but they are also struggling to find alternative markets as government bond yields weaken.
""Clients are questioning if there is value in this market,"" said Shalett.
Holding cash will also stifle activity and further hurt income for banks, which are struggling with lower trading activity in general. 
Late last month, UBS' Ermotti said the bank had seen some pick-up in client activity, but had previously described conditions as the toughest in years as revenues in its investment bank and wealth management fell. 
SELL IN MAY?
So much cash on the sidelines undermines the idea posed by many analysts over the past month that investors have been too complacent about the headwinds, such as a breakdown in the U.S.-China trade talks, that could threaten the stock rally during the quieter summer months.
The summer months to the end of September are often the weakest stretch in the year.
Instead, investors were unusually cautious even before U.S. President Donald Trump sent shudders through financial markets earlier this month by reigniting his spat with Beijing.
""There's a lot of cash on the sidelines that tells us investors don't have conviction, but it also means they're not exposed so they won't be forced to sell,"" said Willem Sels, chief market strategist at HSBC Private Banking.
""That gives me some confidence that we won't see a big correction in equity markets.""
While Treasuries have outperformed U.S. stocks over the past six months, the strategy may not pay off in the long term, UBS reckons.
The wealth manager expects a long-term annualized return of 7.8% for global stocks based on the MSCI All Country World Index, versus 2.8% for U.S. dollar cash, measured in 1- to 3-month Treasury notes.
But what could prise them out of their lethargy? Better economic and corporate data and an end to Trump's protectionist policies, asset managers say.
Until then, Christophe Donay, head of asset allocation at Pictet Wealth Management, said investors are stuck.
""Most investors are trapped in a prisoners dilemma. Whether to collaborate - follow the trend - or not collaborate. The optimal decision is do nothing,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Uniper's chairman on Sunday said talks with major shareholder Fortum to resolve a dispute between the two companies were on hold after two of the German utility's board members resigned.
Fortum and Uniper have been at loggerheads since the Finnish state-owned utility tried to take over the German group in 2017, a deal that Uniper's management opposed due to concerns it might get broken up.
Fortum, which has a 49.99% stake in Uniper, has claimed that Uniper's board actively tried to block its planned takeover, which Uniper denies.
The resignation of Uniper's Chief Operating Officer Eckhardt Ruemmler and Chief Commercial Officer Keith Martin came in response to Fortum's move last week to postpone a shareholder vote to endorse Uniper's management for the past two years.
""We must and want to work with our major shareholder in a trusting relationship. This trust has lost its foundation. Talks had been on a good path. In my view a major chance has been blown,"" Uniper Supervisory Board Chairman Bernhard Reutersberg told Reuters.
He said that talks with Fortum were on hold for now.
""I expect a clear signal from Fortum on how they think talks can be continued in light of the current developments.""
Uniper said Ruemmler and Martin -- which had led cooperation talks with Fortum since February -- had asked the group's chairman to terminate their contracts at the end of Nov. 30, 2019.
Russian regulators have barred Fortum from increasing its stake in Uniper because of a water-testing license owned by the German firm's Russian business Unipro. Uniper has so far held on to the license, effectively blocking a takeover.
Reutersberg said that external and internal experts had found no evidence that Uniper management violated any laws in its dealings in Russia, adding there were no findings that support Fortum's claims.
Fortum Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark said in a statement delaying the discharge vote on Uniper's management had been a result of the lack of transparency on management conduct during and after the takeover bid, not a sign of mistrust in management as a whole.
He said it was now Fortum's goal to establish a dialogue with Uniper's incoming Chief Executive Andreas Schierenbeck and Chief Financial Officer Sascha Bibert, which will both start their jobs on June 1.
""We are confident that together we can make a joint vision reality,"" Lundmark said.

Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, said the settlement ""does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company"" and denied contributing to opioid abuse in Oklahoma.
Claims against Teva focused on the branded opioid products Actiq and Fentora as well as generic painkillers it produced.
The trial against Israel-based Teva, along with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), was set to begin on Tuesday. The lawsuit alleged the companies' marketing of the painkiller was to blame for the opioid epidemic.
In a statement, Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a J&J subsidiary, said it had acted responsibly and was ready for trial. It said it disagreed with what it called Oklahoma's ""overly expansive theories"" of public nuisance law, and said they should not apply in this situation.
""At the same time, as with all litigation, if an appropriate resolution is possible that avoids the expense and uncertainty of a trial, we are always open to that option,"" the company said in a statement.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter has alleged that J&J and Teva, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, carried out deceptive marking campaigns that downplayed opioids' addictive risks while overstating their benefits.
The state also alleges the companies' actions created an oversupply of painkillers and a public nuisance that will cost $12.7 billion to $17.5 billion to remedy.
Oklahoma resolved its claims against Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million.
The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid cases, particularly some 1,850 mostly municipal and state governments that have sued the same drugmakers in the federal court in Ohio.
""Teva is pleased to put the Oklahoma case behind it and remains prepared to vigorously defend claims against the company, including the upcoming federal court trial in Cleveland where the majority of the cases are pending,"" the company said.
Attorney General Hunter's office said in a statement the money would be used to address the opioid crisis in Oklahoma and that the J&J case is still scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday before Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman.

""Nearly all Oklahomans have been negatively impacted by this deadly crisis and we look forward to Tuesday, where we will prove our case against Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries,"" Hunter said in a statement.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2019 03:06PM ET</span>",Carmakers FCA and Renault to go public on tie-up talks,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Laurence Frost
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are set to confirm tie-up talks on Monday, with the board of the French carmaker called to an early morning meeting to discuss the situation.
It comes after news broke over the weekend that two of the world's leading car companies are in talks on a comprehensive global combination that could address some of the main weaknesses of both.
The plan under discussion would involve some transfer of equity, according to a source close to the discussions. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the two companies are considering a merger of equals, among other tie-up options. 
Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard presented an FCA-Renault merger plan to French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Friday, Les Echos reported on its website. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault. 
The deal being discussed would include guarantees covering corporate governance and employment in France and Italy, the French daily said.
Pressure for consolidation among carmakers has grown with the challenges posed by electrification, tightening emissions regulations and expensive new technologies being developed for connected and autonomous vehicles.
Earlier this year FCA Chairman John Elkann - a member of Italy's Agnelli dynasty that controls the company - stressed the family's commitment to the automotive industry. But he also added that they were prepared to take ""bold and creative decisions"" to help build a solid and attractive future for the company.
A source said earlier an announcement from Italo-American FCA could provide some concrete although initial details but added the situation was still ""fluid"".
A separate source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that the Renault board will meet on Monday morning at 0800 local time (0600 GMT) to discuss the issue.
REGIONAL RATIONALE
FCA has a highly profitable North American RAM trucks business and Jeep brand but has been losing money in Europe, where it may also struggle to keep pace with looming carbon dioxide emissions curbs.
Renault, by contrast, is an electric-car pioneer with relatively fuel-efficient engine technologies and a strong presence in emerging markets, but no U.S. business.
Any tie-up would likely face political and workforce hurdles, particularly in Italy. However, most of FCA's European plants are running below 50% capacity.
A deal between FCA and Renault would not preclude a consolidation of Renault's alliance with Japanese carmaker Nissan Motor Co Ltd , a source told Reuters on Saturday. 
The Renault-Nissan partnership, underpinned by cross shareholdings, has been strained by the scandal surrounding former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was ousted after his arrest last year.
Speculation about the future of Fiat Chrysler, often seen as a potential M&A target, intensified after the sudden death of long-serving former CEO Sergio Marchionne almost one year ago. 
In October last year, just after three months he was picked to replace Marchionne, new CEO Mike Manley agreed to sell FCA's car parts unit Magneti Marelli to Japan's Calsonic Kasnsei, owned by U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc .
The sale was completed early this month for 5.8 billion euros.
According to reports earlier this year, the manufacturer had also restarted talks with France's PSA Group - which have been a recurrent theme over the years.
Fiat Chrysler and Renault together would have a combined market capitalization of more than 32 billion euros ($36 billion) and total global sales of 8.7 million vehicles.
Fiat Chrysler has a valuation of just under 18 billion euros and Renault around 14.4 billion 

An alliance that included Nissan would vault the ensemble to the rank of global No.1 carmaker with 13.8 million annual sales. It would also maintain a foothold in China, where both FCA and Renault are marginal players.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2019 06:42PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler in tie-up talks with Renault: sources,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Laurence Frost
MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and  Renault  (PA:RENA) are in talks on a comprehensive global tie-up that could address some of the main weaknesses of both carmakers, two sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters on Saturday.
The talks are at an advanced stage, the sources said. The Financial Times https://on.ft.com/2HRDghE earlier reported that FCA and Renault were discussing a deal to forge ""extensive ties"" to tackle structural challenges facing the global auto industry.
A spokesman for FCA declined to comment on the report. Renault spokesman Frederic Texier said the French carmaker had no comment.
Pressure for consolidation among carmakers has grown with the challenges posed by electrification, tightening emissions regulations and investment-thirsty technologies for connected and autonomous vehicles.
FCA and Renault have a combined market capitalization approaching 33 billion euros ($37 billion) and total global sales of 8.7 million vehicles. Besides bringing greater scale, a tie-up could help patch flaws on both sides.
FCA has a highly profitable North American RAM trucks business and Jeep brand but has been losing money in Europe, where it may also struggle to keep pace with looming carbon dioxide emissions curbs. 
Renault, by contrast, is an electric-car pioneer with relatively fuel-efficient engine technologies and a strong presence in emerging markets, but no U.S. business.
Any tie-up would likely face political and workforce hurdles, particularly in Italy. Most of FCA's European plants are running below 50 percent capacity.
It was unclear whether the FCA-Renault deal talks would conclude successfully, the sources said.
The plan under consideration could involve some transfer of equity, one source said. ""This isn't just another partnership - it's more than that.""
Both carmakers have also been exploring tie-ups with other partners.
While FCA has recently revived discussions with PSA Group - which have been recurrent over the years - Renault is seeking a merger with Nissan, its partner in a troubled 20-year-old alliance. [nL5N22Q90O]
A tie-up between FCA and Renault would not preclude a consolidation of the alliance with Nissan, one of the sources said. 
The Renault-Nissan partnership, underpinned by crossed shareholdings, has been strained by the scandal surrounding former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was ousted in the wake of a Nissan internal investigation.
A tie-up that included Nissan would vault the ensemble to the rank of global No.1 carmaker with 13.8 million annual sales. It would also maintain a foothold in China, where both FCA and Renault are marginal players.
The discussions follow weakening U.S. auto demand that has prompted cutbacks at several carmakers. FCA reported a 29 percent decline in first-quarter operating profit as sales and margins weakened in its North American profit centre. Sales dropped 5 percent to 24.48 billion euros. [nL5N22F3AD]

The couple were taken into custody by immigration officers, the Indian Express reported, citing sources.
The airport official did not confirm that the couple had been detained.
It was not immediately clear why the couple had been prevented from traveling, or whether it was related to reported regulatory probes into the airline.
It was not immediately possible to reach either the Goyals or Jet for comment late Saturday.
Local media said the Goyals had been traveling to Dubai for a connecting flight to London.
Local media, citing sources, reported earlier this month that the ministry of corporate affairs had been looking into Jet's books and had asked for a corporate fraud investigation into the airline, suspecting that its promoters siphoned off funds.
Jet said at the time that it had complied with all regulations. The Goyals did not comment on the reports at the time.
Once one of India's largest carriers, Jet was forced to ground all flights last month after running out of money and failing to secure funds, crippled by mounting losses as it attempted to compete with low-cost rivals. 

The carrier is saddled with some $1.2 billion in bank debt, and Goyal and his wife stepped down from the airline's board in March amid the crisis.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state lender Caixa Economica Federal has picked investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) as co-advisor to help it find insurance partners, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
Morgan Stanley will manage the process alongside Caixa's investment banking unit, the source said. Caixa Seguridade Participacoes, the insurance unit of the state lender, on Friday launched four processes to select insurance partners to sell health, dental, assistance and large risk policies. 
Caixa had already sent invitations to insurers to offer other kinds of policies on May 10.
The insurance partners will have the right to underwrite policies for 20 years and sell them to Caixa's 93 million clients through its more than 4,000 branches. 
The bank intends the deals to increase Caixa Seguridade's revenue before its initial public offering. The planned IPO is part of Caixa's plan to raise up to 100 billion reais from the sale of assets it owns or manages.

Caixa and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1653,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 25, 2019 08:10AM ET</span>",Trump’s Throttling of Huawei Could Backfire on U.S. Tech,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration widened its dragnet this week on Chinese companies barred from selling to the U.S. or buying components from American firms in a push to slow China’s technological advances. After crippling Huawei Technologies Co., China’s biggest telecommunications company, the administration followed up by threatening to cut off U.S. components or software to five Chinese video surveillance firms. But the plan might backfire, because U.S. companies are so inextricably involved in the global technology supply chain. Concerns over Washington’s punitive measures and possible retaliation by the Chinese rattled markets throughout the week, hammering chipmakers and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). It's 5G that embodies most of Washington’s fears -- by powering a wealth of upcoming technologies from self-driving cars to advanced medical procedures, the new wireless standard is set to be the backbone of the modern economy. Until recently, it seemed like Huawei, the world's biggest purveyor of communications networking gear and the second-largest smartphone maker, was leading in supplying that infrastructure.By cutting off the Chinese tech giant, the U.S. will only slow the expansion of 5G. That’s bad news for some of the most important U.S. companies, particularly component makers, that were banking on it for a major surge in orders starting this year.
Without China’s 5G network, consumers there won't buy new phones that contain chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). They won't generate data that need to be crunched by processors made by  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. And there'll be no need for faster networking gear powered by chips from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc. and  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX).“I don’t think it’s good for the U.S. economy,” said Minyuan Zhao, an associate professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. “With its strong institutions, the U.S. has long been an assuring force in the global supply chain. People don’t always trust China, but they consider the U.S. a trustworthy partner, if not guardian, of the global economic system.” If supply chains can be arbitrarily interrupted and that trust disappears, countries will start to develop individual systems and the result will be inferior and more expensive.
Washington’s efforts to contain the world’s second-largest economy accelerated about three years ago when Beijing first codified a broad ambition to take the lead in future technologies through its Made in China 2025 industrial policy. Coupled with a formal plan to dominate artificial intelligence by 2030, the plans showed the country's willingness to funnel billions of dollars into scientific research -- a goal that spooked Washington bureaucrats worried that private U.S. enterprise and the military would be left in the dust.
Still, Chinese tech companies remain well behind their American counterparts in some key industries. The country still imports more semiconductors than oil and no Chinese company has caught up with Google or  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). in software yet. That makes the threat of witholding American technology from Huawei and its peers so disruptive.
In other areas, though, they're gaining headway quickly. Huawei is already the biggest provider of 4G networking and its gear is key to rolling out 5G networks in China, the biggest market for smartphones that will connect to it. U.S. companies are keen to tap into that pool, with its hundreds of millions of subscribers. China’s well-funded firms from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. and startups like SenseTime are closing the gap on AI with an unparalleled trove of user information that privacy-focused Western rivals are afraid they'll never match; even consumer internet concerns like Tencent and Ant Financial Services Group are leading the way in social media innovation and mobile payments.
Companies like  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are worried that export controls being considered by Washington, related to technologies seen as essential to competitiveness, could actually impede them from competing in lucrative markets, while reducing America’s capacity to innovate.
In a written submission to the Department of Commerce, Microsoft warned that the proposed restrictions risked isolating the U.S. from international research collaborations and “could thwart U.S. interests.”
“Artificial intelligence is a very broad concept,” GE cautioned in its own submission. Defined too broadly export controls could sweep up things like medical imaging where algorithms are being used to scan for diseases and in toys, it said.The crackdown on Huawei and other tech companies has spread from the U.S.-China trade war, which has been going on for months. Trump has targeted technology companies due to suspicion that Chinese firms help Beijing spy on foreign governments and steal U.S. intellectual property. It’s a risky move.“The more that we continually conflate economic warfare with national security interests, then we start to look at everything as national security,” said Evanna Hu, CEO of Omelas, a security software firm based in Washington. “When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”So far U.S. chipmakers have probably suffered the most from Washington’s actions. Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx and Broadcom have said they will cut off supplies to Huawei until further notice, according to people familiar with their actions. While their move hamstrings Huawei, it also means the companies will lose revenue. 
China has threatened to retaliate. ``This is wrong behavior, so there will be a necessary response,’’ Zhang Ming, China’s envoy to the EU said in an interview in Brussels. Such a move could be devastating for Apple. Rising nationalistic, pro-Huawei sentiment could make Apple’s already troubled business in China more difficult, hobbling iPhone sales and disrupting the company’s supply chain, according to analysts.Apple could lose nearly a third of its profit if China retaliated by banning its products, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts estimated this week. But so far there isn’t any evidence that China is planning to do so. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said 3% to 5% of iPhone sales in China may disappear over the next 12 to 18 months because of the U.S. ban on Huawei. 
As the global markets have begun to imagine a new Cold War-era between China and the U.S., President Donald Trump said Thursday that Huawei could “be included in some kind of trade deal” with China, without offering any details. The president also added that “Huawei is something that’s very dangerous. You look at what they’ve done from a security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it’s very dangerous.”

1655,By Investing.com,"<span>May 25, 2019 04:26AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"Investing.com - Here’s a look at three things that were under the radar this past week.
1. Growth Stocks Back in Fashion?
The ""smart money"" has spoken. Bets on growth stocks are once again fashionable. But cyclical stocks are out.
Following the first-quarter cyclical rally, hedge funds cut their exposure toward energy, materials and industrials by 250 basis points and scooped up growth favorites like consumer discretionary and communication services, according to a report from Goldman Sachs, citing the latest quarterly fund filings.
The rotation saw consumer discretionaries become the largest net overweight tilt for the first time since 2015, Goldman said. Tech, meanwhile, still reigned supreme, accounting for 18% of hedge fund net exposure, the most of any sector.
Many will be quick to point out that hedge funds are becoming less relevant in the investment community, with returns that continue to undershoot the broader market and fail to justify the traditional 2-and-20 free structure (2% annual fee and 20% fee on profits above a certain level).
But the trillions of dollars they manage means their role in the broader market shouldn’t be underestimated.
The average equity hedge fund has returned 8% in 2019, supported by the outperformance of fund favorites such as FAANG stocks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)), Goldman reported.
But that’s well shy of the S&P 500, which has delivered more than 12.7% year to date.
Among the top names at hedge funds as of the end of the first quarter were the FAANGs, with Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) representing three of the top five largest positions, according to Goldman.
The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLK) is up more than 20% year to date, though the deepening trade war between the U.S. and China has seen the NYSE FANG+ index sliding more than 11% since May 6, when the Trump administration announced it will ratchet up tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Yet Wall Street analysts are wary of declaring that FAANG's ride higher is at risk.
“I don’t think FAANG is dead,” Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global markets strategist, said on Yahoo Finance's “The First Trade.” “But it makes sense that it’s taking a pause.”
“We have to recognize that there’s an economic policy uncertainty story here, which is the longer these trade wars go on, we’re likely to see (capital expenditure) go down.""
2. Faux Meat Could be a $140 Billion Market
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) shares ended the week lower, but it’s still one of the hottest IPOs in recent memory.
And the segment has huge potential, according to a research note Barclays Equity Research issued this week.
“We estimate that the market for alternative meat can reach (about) $140 billion over the next ten years, with alternative meat players capturing (about) 10% of the (approximately) $1.4 trillion global meat industry, based on our analysis,” Barclays said.
It did highlight risk factors “such as alternative meat products being less healthy than claimed as a result of high salt levels or potential regulatory requirements that restrict marketing” and the “inherent barriers” to replacing favorite foods like T-bone steaks.
But there are enough substitution opportunities for the alternative meat sector to grab its fair share of global market.
Barclays even managed to squeeze in a reference to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
“While we see some parallels to electric vehicle companies' disruption of the car industry, we believe that the ultimate market opportunity for plant-based (and perhaps lab-based) protein is potentially even larger given the mainstream appeal of affordable food products relative to the current high-end, niche audience targeted by electric vehicle manufacturers,” it said.
“With that said, we believe taste and price will ultimately dictate whether or not alternative meat gains widespread acceptance,” Barclays added.
3. AI Will Spur Merger Boom and New Markets
As artificial intelligence progresses it will create a boom in corporate deals and also entirely new markets, according to one economist who’s been at the forefront of the tech sector.
In an interview highlighted by the Richmond Fed this week, economist R. Preston McAfee compared AI to innovations like electricity and the automobile, which fundamentally change the way things are done.
McAfee, who after his academic career joined Yahoo as chief economist in 2007, before moving on the Google and then Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), told the Richmond Fed some tech companies will use AI to push into new businesses, while existing companies will fight back and also move into other areas.
“You'll … get the creation of completely new markets,” he said. “Some of those markets are likely to be ones in which a single firm becomes dominant. Digital commerce was an example of this; there was a period when there were lots of companies in digital commerce, but Amazon has clearly stepped out as the leader.”
In addition, merger and acquisition booms, with the exception of the ‘80s one prompted by deregulation, are spurred by disruptive technologies, McAfee said.
“Such merger waves arise as firms struggle to change their business model, due to the changing environment the technological change brought about, and purchase new capabilities via merger,” he added. “I expect to see a large merger wave from AI, lasting a decade or more, that could change competition in many or even most sectors.”
Antitrust concerns should be lessened with Google, Microsoft, Amazon and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) all major vendors in AI, he added."

1657,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 09:36PM ET</span>",Wall Street Weekahead: Trade protection doesn't have to exclude growth stocks,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The escalating U.S.-China trade war has sent dividend-rich sectors like utilities higher, but investors don't need to get all defensive just yet, according to strategists who say there are plenty of growth stocks with some insulation from China. 
Some investors are seeking safety in domestic U.S. growth stocks ranging from software and online advertising to aerospace and recruitment since President Donald Trump's May 5 tweets showed that U.S. talks with China were in trouble. 
While the prospect of a prolonged trade war has shaken the market, investors are also trying to protect themselves from the risk that they could miss out on gains in the event that the United States and China reach a surprise agreement.
Because of the difficulty handicapping the chance of a U.S.-China deal, John Praveen Portfolio Manager at QMA in Newark, New Jersey, said he would not ""completely sell out"" of stocks. But he said: ""if I was 5% overweight stocks, I might reduce it to 3 pct and see if I could reduce exposure to semiconductors and technology.""
""If you're looking to avoid the pure dividend play and avoid the China trade narrative, you have to look at stocks that are a pure play on the U.S. economy,"" said Peter Kenny, founder, Kenny’s Commentary LLC in New York. 
Broadly speaking, investors have been raising their defenses. While the S&P has fallen roughly 4% since Trump announced his plan to raise tariffs on Chinese goods in early May, utilities - a low-growth sector with reliably high dividends - has risen more than 2%.
But growth-hungry investors are seeking more nimble companies with little exposure to overseas sales or Chinese imports even in the beaten down technology sector, where semiconductor stocks have lead the recent declines. 
Online advertising platforms and cloud software are two technology segments that would not be directly affected by China tariffs, according to Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.
In online advertising, Morgan favors Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) over Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which suspended business with China's Huawei this week as a result of the trade battle. 
He also likes software providers such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which derives 70% of its revenue from the Americas and only 10% from Asia-Pacific. However, Salesforce.com has fallen more than 5% since the Trump tweets. 
Another option is Workday Inc, which has risen about 4% since May 5 and derives 75% of its revenue from the United States. 
Steve Lipper, senior investment strategist at Royce & Associates favors U.S.-facing companies offering services such as recruiting and merger advice due to a strong U.S. labor market and solid merger activity.
But while U.S.-facing recruitment firms such as Kforce and ASGN Inc may not be hurt directly by the trade war, Robert W. Baird analyst Mark Marcon notes that they would suffer if tariffs caused the economy to weaken. 
Instead, Marcon favors domestic payroll software companies such as Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) and  Paychex Inc  (NASDAQ:PAYX), which tend to do better than recruiters in a downturn. But even if their fundamentals remain strong, payroll companies like Paycom and Paylocity could be vulnerable in a selloff due to relatively high valuations, Marcon said. 
In industrials - a sector with heavy exposure to China - Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in Dallas likes defense stocks such as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), which could benefit if U.S.-Iran hostilities keep intensifying. 
Since sectors like utilities have risen so much, Royce's Lipper is favoring less obvious safe choices.

""Be wary when the consensus view is already reflected in valuations,"" said Lipper, but he added: ""The U.S. economy is so diverse that there are always areas that are insulated from whatever you have a concern about.""

""With shares down about 20% from their recent highs ... and the risk-reward skewing more favorably, we are comfortable with our ""overweight"" rating and price target of $500.""

If the aircraft is cleared to fly by June, its operators, including Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Continental Holdings Inc, would likely not have to extend costly cancellations that they have already put in place for the peak summer flying season.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 05:55PM ET</span>","For Anderson family, an early bet on SMA gene therapy","By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Malachi Anderson was diagnosed with a rare and often deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as an infant nearly four years ago, his parents Tina and Torence had a decision to make.
In years past, many of the babies born with the most severe form of SMA, like Malachi, died before their second birthday. Those who survived longer would likely not walk, eat or breathe on their own.
By 2015, drugmakers were testing two experimental therapies in clinical trials: a one-time gene therapy treatment that is now owned by Novartis AG and Spinraza, a Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) drug which is given through spinal infusion every four months, indefinitely.
On Friday, U.S. regulators approved the gene therapy, called Zolgensma, for children under age 2 with all types of the disease. The company set the price at $2.125 million, the highest price yet for a new medicine, saying that it was comparable over a five-year period to the cost of Spinraza, already approved in late 2016. 
After Malachi missed development milestones and was diagnosed, the Andersons researched possible treatments online, the couple said in an interview arranged by Novartis. They were connected to a family whose daughter had been treated with the gene therapy and were encouraged by the progress she had made. 
The Spinraza trial was underway in Chicago, several hours from their home in Mansfield, Ohio. Participating would have separated Tina and baby Malachi from his family, including his father and five siblings, to undergo treatments, Tina Anderson said. 
In addition, some patients in the trial were receiving a placebo as a comparison, a risk she didn't want to take.
""I didn't want to have to depart from our family,"" she said. ""Was it worth me going if he didn't get the drug?""
A Biogen spokeswoman said that more than 7,500 people with SMA have been helped by Spinraza, and that it is the only treatment available for a broad age range of patients. It has more than 300 patients who have been followed for up to six years.
An hour from their home, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio had enrolled just over a dozen patients in the first SMA gene therapy trial. ""If this worked, our son would have a chance at a life,"" she recounted.
After passing several screenings, Malachi was chosen as patient number 14, making him one of the last to enter that trial. Within weeks, he received the treatment, an hour-long infusion, cradled in his mother's arms.
Tina said she was confident of the choice they had made that day, despite the many unknowns of an experimental treatment.
""I don’t think we had much fear going into it. We had prayed about it,"" she said. The next day reality hit. Tina described shaking and vomiting, overwhelmed with the idea that ""we just got something really huge"" in a therapy so new. 
Malachi will turn four this summer. He cannot walk or crawl but can propel himself in a wheelchair and has learned other maneuvers, such as climbing down off the couch, Torence Anderson said. He enjoys going to school and sharing meals with his family, including his favorite food: cheeseburgers.
The Andersons say he is gaining strength in regular PT sessions and are hopeful he will be even more mobile. So far they are not looking for treatment beyond Zolgensma, but are paying attention to the new drugs in development for SMA.
""There's not a whole lot of definitive information on this is what we should be doing, this is what needs to happen,"" Torence said. ""We are hoping the decisions that we are making are the right decisions."" 
HIGH COST FOR FAMILIES?
As part of a clinical trial, the Andersons received Zolgensma at no cost. It is unclear how much patients will now pay for the therapy under their insurance plans or if they do not have insurance. 
Ahead of the approval, some payers had told Reuters that they were concerned about being able to afford a new generation of million dollar treatments like Zolgensma. Gene therapies are also being tested to treat hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, another rare disorder.
On Friday, Novartis said it had signed a deal with Cigna (NYSE:CI) Corp's specialty pharmacy and distribution units. The agreement will allow small insurers and employers the ability to pay over five years, Cigna Chief Clinical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview.
They are also working on a payment structure that would enable payers to be compensated if patients receiving the treatment do not meet agreed upon thresholds, Miller said.
Dave Lennon, head of Novartis' AveXis unit which developed Zolgensma, said that the largest health insurers, such as  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Inc, are likely to cover the therapy in one payment. Smaller regional insurers and employers would likely be interested in pay-over-time deals, Lennon said in an interview.
Miller said the employers who hire Cigna to manage prescription drug benefits for their workers are worried about gene therapy costs. On the other hand, he said, the treatment has saved the lives of children.
""I believe there is enough money in the healthcare system to make it work,"" Miller said.

1662,By Investing.com,"<span>May 24, 2019 05:01PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Ends Higher as Trump Attempts to Ease Trade Jitters,"Investing.com - The S&P 500 ended higher Friday, as President Donald Trump offered some hope on a quick resolution to the U.S.-China trade war, but a warning from Beijing that it's not above launching further countermeasures against Washington kept gains in check.
The S&P 500 gained 0.14%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% and Dow added 0.37%. But many have warned against reading too much into the bullish day on Wall Street as markets were thin heading into the Memorial Day weekend.
""If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form or some part of it,"" Trump said, according to Reuters.
But Trump didn't completely shut the door on renewing restrictions on Huawei, saying the Chinese tech giant was ""very dangerous"" from a security standpoint.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Commerce Department rolled back some of the restrictions placed on Huawei for 90 days.
China also served up a mixed message on trade, with China's ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, telling Bloomberg News on Friday that while it continues to favor a trade deal with the U.S., it also stands ready to launch a response against Washington for its ban against Huawei.
""Trade is about mutual benefits, war is about mutual destruction. How can you put these two very different concepts in one term?"" Cui said this morning.
In the ongoing trade war, some analysts are seemingly leaning more toward a China victory.
""There's little doubt left that Beijing will carefully orchestrate its retaliatory actions against the U.S., possibly targeting the agriculture industry, high tech and even Wall Street, causing corresponding hardship on U.S. investors and corporations, to make Washington blink first,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note.
Still, trade-sensitive industrials ended the day higher, with  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), bellwethers of international trade, closing 0.5% and 1.2% higher, respectively.
Boeing was the Dow's biggest percentage gainer and biggest point gainer, contributing 29.5 points to the Dow's 95-point gain. Boeing's good day came even as Bloomberg reported the SEC launched a probe on whether the aircraft maker properly disclosed issues tied to the grounded 737 MAX jetliner, which was involved in two recent fatal crashes.
Beyond trade, energy stocks also boosted the broader market thanks to a 1.2% rise in U.S. oil prices, though that did little to stop WTI posting its biggest weekly slump of the year amid a rise in domestic inventories and sluggish global growth.
The positive turn in risk sentiment boosted the 10-Year Treasury yield to 2.324%, which helped banking stocks rack up gains.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) closed positive for the day.
In economic news, core durable goods orders fell more than expected in April, pointing to underlying weakness in manufacturing demand, raising fears of slowdown in the broader economy.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Total System Services (NYSE:TSS),  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU) and  CenturyLink  (NYSE:CTL) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 04:37PM ET</span>",Wall St. edges higher after Trump sparks U.S.-China trade hopes,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major stock indexes edged higher on Friday after falling in the previous session, as hopeful comments from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding trade relations with China assuaged concerns among some investors.
Trump said late on Thursday that he saw a resolution to the trade war with China ""happening fast."" He added that Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which the White House has blacklisted, could also be included in a trade deal.
Still, he called Huawei ""very dangerous."" 
No high-level talks between the United States and China have been scheduled since the last round of negotiations in Washington two weeks ago.
Yet Trump's comments were enough to give a slight lift to U.S. stocks in muted activity ahead of a long weekend. Friday marked the lowest volume of the year for a full trading session. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
""There are some small positive stories here and there,"" said John Carey, managing director and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""With light trading volume, it doesn't take too much to get things moving.""
Stocks rose broadly, with nine of the S&P 500's major sectors moving higher, though declines in shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc capped gains on the major indexes.
Even so, the S&P 500 ended the week more than 1% lower to notch the third straight week of losses for the benchmark index, which has been weighed down by fears that the U.S.-China trade war would result in a global economic slowdown.
Adding to concerns about a slowing broader economy, data showed that new orders for U.S.-made capital goods fell more than expected in April.
Despite Friday's gains, said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management, ""when you have the world's two biggest economies intending to inflect economic pain on each other, it's not a good environment for equity investors.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 95.22 points, or 0.37%, to 25,585.69, the S&P 500 gained 3.82 points, or 0.14%, to 2,826.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.73 points, or 0.11%, to 7,637.01.
For the week, the Dow declined 0.68%, the S&P 500 fell 1.16% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.29%. The Dow slid for the fifth straight week, its longest such losing streak in eight years, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each registered their first three-week declines of the year.
The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 0.9%, outpacing the major indexes, though it fell 1.4% for the week. In a contrast from their performance last spring, small-cap stocks have dropped largely in line with their large-cap counterparts as U.S.-China trade tensions have ratcheted up.
Financials led percentage gains among the S&P 500's major sectors, adding 0.8% as U.S. Treasury yields rose for the first time in three days.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) Inc shares plunged 16.0%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after the footwear retailer missed quarterly profit and same-store sales estimates.
Total System Services Inc (NYSE:TSS) shares jumped 13.9% on reports that fellow payment technology services company Global Payments Inc is nearing a deal to acquire the company. Global Payments shares rose 3.7%.
 Autodesk Inc  (NASDAQ:ADSK) shares fell 4.9% after the software maker reported quarterly revenue and earnings that were below expectations.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 105 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.48 billion shares, compared to the 6.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 04:30PM ET</span>",United Airlines shakes up Avianca leadership after shareholder default,"By Marcelo Rochabrun and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) - United Airlines launched a management overhaul at Colombia's Avianca Holdings on Friday, removing top shareholder German Efromovich from controlling the cash-strapped airline, according to regulatory filings.
United, which is proposing a three-way joint business agreement with Avianca and Panama's Copa, said the move follows a default by Efromovich's holding company BRW Aviation on a $456 million loan it made six months ago.
The Chicago-based airline, part of United Continental Holdings Inc, is seeking a deeper foothold in Latin America, which is considered ripe for air travel growth. 
United's loan was backed by Efromovich's 51.5% stake in Avianca. However, the U.S. airline's contract with its pilots restricts the company from majority ownership in another carrier. As a result, United is ceding voting rights to Kingsland Holdings, the Colombian carrier’s second-largest shareholder.
Kingsland is controlled by Roberto Kriete, who was embroiled in a long and bitter legal fight with Efromovich over the best strategy for heavily indebted Avianca. 
Another Efromovich carrier, Avianca Brasil, filed for bankruptcy protection in December and its operations were suspended on Friday by Brazil's civil aviation regulator ANAC.

United said it was willing to loan up to $150 million to Avianca Holdings.

1665,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2019 04:10PM ET</span>","U.S. Sends 1,500 Troops to Mideast After Citing Iran for Attacks","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump ordered more troops to the Middle East as the Pentagon blamed Tehran for recent attacks in the region, yet the small scale of the U.S. move signaled a desire to avoid a further escalation of tensions between the two nations.
The U.S. will bolster forces in the region by about 1,500 troops, though Trump and the Pentagon said that the deployment is for defensive purposes with a focus on missile defense, surveillance and keeping open shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf. About 600 of the troops are already in the region, meaning fewer than 1,000 new service members will deploy.
“We’re going to be sending a relatively small number of troops to the Middle East,” Trump said as he departed the White House on Friday for Japan. The troops will serve “mostly in a protective capacity,” Trump said, adding, “We’ll see what happens.”
After tensions between Iran and Washington spiked earlier this month, Trump’s comments and the size of the deployment suggest the administration wants to avoid fueling fears of another Middle East war. At the same time, Pentagon officials said they believe Iran is behind a spate of recent attacks on oil tankers, a Saudi oil pipeline and the “Green Zone” diplomatic compound in Baghdad.

“We believe with a high degree of confidence that this stems back to the leadership of Iran at the highest levels,” U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Michael Gilday, director of the Defense Department’s Joint Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday. All of the attacks “have been attributed to Iran, through their proxies” or other forces, Gilday said. It was the first time the U.S. publicly charged Iran with being behind the attacks, though Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen had claimed responsibility for the pipeline attack.
The moves come after the Trump administration said it had evidence Iran was threatening other attacks on American interests or allies in the region. The administration earlier this month expedited the deployment of a carrier battle group to the Middle East along with a Patriot missile battery and additional bombers.
It wasn’t immediately clear where in the region the new troops would be sent, though the U.S. has military bases in places including Qatar, Bahrain and Iraq. The deployment also includes a new fighter squadron and spy planes, Gilday said.
Deterrence Effect
“All those troops, all of those weapons have been going to Iran the last three weeks not to take military action against Iran, but to deter Iran from taking military action against us,” Republican Senator Tom Cotton said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
While people familiar with the troop decision called the deployment “initial,” it falls far short of Trump’s statement that in the event of hostilities with Iran he would be willing to send many times more than 120,000 troops suggested in a New York Times report last week. The president has also repeatedly signaled in recent weeks that he is open to talks with Iran’s leadership, though he’s suggested officials in Tehran need to reach out to him first.
On Thursday, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the Pentagon was focused on having “the right force protection” in the region.
“Our job is deterrence. This is not about war,” Shanahan told reporters. “We have a mission there in the Middle East: freedom of navigation, you know, counterterrorism in Syria and Iraq, you know, defeating al-Qaeda in Yemen, and then the security of Israel and Jordan.”
Separately, the Trump administration decided to bypass Congress and approve the sale of more than $2 billion in weapons to Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia, invoking a rarely used provision in the Arms Export Control Act despite bipartisan objections by lawmakers.
In a letter explaining the decision to allow sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Iran’s “malign activities” in the region necessitated the decision to sidestep congressional approval. He said he weapons sales “must occur as quickly as possible in order to deter further Iranian adventurism in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East.”
More broadly, the rising tensions are linked to Trump’s decision to ratchet up pressure by ordering punishing new economic sanctions on Iran after withdrawing America last year from the multinational nuclear deal reached with Tehran in 2015. The agreement, which sought to ease sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for an end to Iran’s nuclear program, is still backed by European allies as well as China and Russia.
In a sign of frustration over the effectiveness of the U.S. sanctions, Iran is now threatening to resume enriching uranium beyond levels permitted in the 2015 accord in its effort to push France, Germany, the U.K. and the European Union to find ways to relieve the effects of U.S. sanctions.
‘Who’s Provoking Who?’
As both sides sought to react in recent weeks, questions have been raised about the escalating threats. Senator Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee, asked on CNN this month, “Who’s provoking who?”
“Are they reacting because they are concerned about what we’re doing, or are we reacting because we’re concerned what they’re doing?” asked King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. “And that raises my second concern, which is miscalculation.”
Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, warned on Thursday that there is “significant” potential for an overreaction by Iranian personnel or militia in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan to the U.S.’s new military deployments.
Risk of Miscalculation
“The dangers are extreme in terms of miscalculation,” Reed said in an interview.
The Rhode Island senator declined to discuss the Pentagon threat briefing he’s received on the Iran situation but said he was “absolutely” concerned about miscalculation by Iran in reacting to the U.S. moves.
Asked about the Trump administration’s decision earlier this month to accelerate the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group and other military hardware to the region, Reed said “if it’s a deterrence I think that’s appropriate because we don’t want to see an outbreak of conflict there.”
“We did not want to signal to the Iranians, erroneously, that we were not prepared,” he said.

1666,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",JPMorgan's Kolanovic Sees a ‘Trump Collar’ on U.S. Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The stock market may be bound in a range by U.S. President Donald Trump, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Marko Kolanovic.
There’s a “Trump collar” on markets as the president reassures traders when equities are down, but does things that worry investors when they’re doing well, said JPMorgan’s global head of macro quantitative and derivatives research. Kolanovic’s positive on aspects such as the Federal Reserve’s effects, the U.S. and Chinese economies and investor positioning. His firm has a year-end forecast of 3,000 for the S&P 500, or about 6% above current levels.
Kolanovic last week said that a “Trump put,” with the president trying to soothe investors, would be at a 3%-4% sell-off. On May 24, he and colleague Bram Kaplan said in a note that pension funds could provide a tailwind to stocks at the end of the month as they rebalance after an unusually large underperformance versus bonds so far in May.
“We still think the second half of the year’s fundamentals will be better than the first half,” he said in an interview in New York. “We are still broadly positive because trade-war escalation is irrational and it’s in everyone’s interest for this to get resolved. The trade war is not a positive for the U.S., the world, consumers or markets -- and ultimately for Trump.”
Recent developments in U.S.-China negotiations were negative, but positioning provided some cushioning at least initially in sell-offs, according to Kolanovic. Investors aren’t terribly long stocks, so there wouldn’t be as much to sell, and leverage is not very high, he said.
Potential Fatigue
Yet fatigue may set in at some point, according to Kolanovic.
“Eventually investors may give up because they are not going to be guessing the tweets,” he said. “People cannot really enthusiastically invest” with such uncertainty in the backdrop.
Kolanovic recommends adding to some of the currently “very distressed” segments in semiconductors, energy, metals and mining stocks -- some of which are close to their lows. Even those who aren’t positive on the broader market could go long on the cyclical assets that are well off their peaks, while shorting defensive assets that are way above previous highs for a relative-value view, he said.
A Performance Gap
Kolanovic has also pointed out to the importance of factors such as a big gap between defensive and cyclical factors as well as quality and low-volatility reaching all-time highs. He also highlighted the fact that value and high beta are at all-time lows.
“We think it will snap back very violently, and we see it as an opportunity,” Kolanovic said, though he cautioned it could hurt hedge funds.
Market fragility is also still on the radar for the strategist, who noted that since January 2018, there have been two record highs and two all-time lows in stock correlations.
Read more about Kolanovic’s concerns about fragility in the marketplace.
“The market is behaving irrationally under the hood,” Kolanovic said, and “it’s partially quant flows, partially liquidity, and partially macro developments.”
Swings in correlation and flash crashes are related to market fragility -- namely, the feedback loop between volatility, flows and liquidity. One area for hope on that front: Kolanovic said there’s potential that machine-learning algos might learn to recognize if they’re causing or exacerbating a flash crash, and pull back.
“With reinforced learning you study your actions in real time. If an algo is causing damage to the market, at that moment, it could take a step back,” Kolanovic said. “But if you have to sell a certain amount, there may be no way to avoid the impact.”"
1667,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 02:53PM ET</span>",Trump appeals ruling allowing banks to hand his financial records to Congress,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and the Trump Organization on Friday appealed a court order allowing  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) to hand their financial records over to Democratic lawmakers.
They are asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to overrule U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, who on Wednesday refused to block the banks from responding to subpoenas issued last month by two U.S. House of Representatives committees.
""We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations,"" Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Kerrie McHugh said in an emailed statement. 
A spokesman for the Intelligence Committee declined to comment on the appeal. Capital One and the House Financial Services Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The committees have agreed not to enforce the subpoenas for seven days after Wednesday's ruling.
The Republican president, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January. 
Some parts of the subpoenas have been included in court filings. The subpoena on Deutsche Bank, issued by both committees, seeks extensive records of accounts, transactions and investments linked to Trump, his three oldest children, their immediate family members and several Trump Organization entities, as well as records of ties they might have to foreign entities.
Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump's real estate business and a 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank.
The subpoena on Capital One, issued by the Financial Services Committee, seeks records related to the Trump Organization's hotel business. It followed an informal request to the bank by Democratic lawmakers in March seeking records related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump's Washington hotel and other businesses.
In asking Ramos to block the subpoenas on Wednesday, a lawyer for the Trumps argued that they exceeded the authority of Congress. Ramos, however, found that they were allowed under the broad authority of Congress to conduct investigations.
Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff praised the decision in a joint statement on Wednesday as ""a victory for the role of Congress as a co-equal branch of government.""

Ramos' ruling came two days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that Trump's accounting firm, Mazars LLP, must comply with a congressional subpoena for Trump's financial records.

The question of why painkillers flooded into Oklahoma and the rest of the country will be the a central issue in a trial beginning Tuesday in Norman, Oklahoma, pitting the state against two drugmakers it accuses of fueling the epidemic: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter's $17 billion lawsuit is the first to go to trial of more than 2,000 actions by state and local governments accusing opioid manufacturers of contributing to an epidemic linked to a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The state will seek to convince Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman to find that the companies created a public nuisance by using deceptive marking that downplayed their drugs' addictive risks while overstating their benefits. Balkman will rule following the trial, which will last eight weeks.
The state resolved related claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million.
J&J and Teva deny wrongdoing, arguing the state lacks evidence linking any marketing they did to doctors writing unwarranted opioid prescriptions.
They also argue that even if they falsely marketed their products, the state cannot prove they caused the opioid epidemic given the role doctors, patients, pharmacists and drug dealers played in it.
""The FDA-approved labels for these prescription pain medications provide clear information about their risks and benefits,"" New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J said in a statement. ""The allegations made against our company are baseless and unsubstantiated.""
Israeli drugmaker Teva in a statement said it has in no way contributed to opioid abuse in Oklahoma and will vigorously defend itself.
In the wake of Purdue's March settlement with Oklahoma, the state dropped many of its claims against the other two defendants and shifted its focus primarily to J&J, which it claims ""acted as the kingpin behind this public health emergency.
The state claims J&J and Teva deceptively marketed opioids with Purdue by retaining prominent doctors to give talks advocating use of opioids to treat chronic rather than short-term pain. It also says the companies funded groups that purported to be independent and these groups in turn promoted the misrepresentations.
The state claims J&J even marketed painkillers to children. It says the company, which formerly marketed the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, also grew and imported the raw materials to make the drugs.
MEMORIES OF TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
The Oklahoma case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid cases, particularly some 1,850 mostly municipal and state governments that have sued the same drugmakers in federal court in Ohio. The judge in that litigation is pushing the parties to reach a settlement agreement ahead of a scheduled October trial.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers have compared the opioid cases to litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998. 
Paul Hanly, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in the Ohio litigation, said the Oklahoma trial could have major implications for a nationwide settlement.
""We will have an opportunity to see how these theories play out,"" he said. ""Anyone who cares about public health issues should care about how the industry, or a portion of the industry, fares in this case.""
Box said she believes ""greed"" in the pharmaceutical industry caused the epidemic. Box, whose husband, Craig, will testify, said she hopes any money the state recovers can be used to fund treatment and research to fight opioid addiction.

""Those are the things I'm hoping come out of this,"" she said. ""Because at least myself and other families who lost loved ones, nothing is going bring them back.""

The Seoul Central District Court said in a statement it had granted warrants to arrest the executives due to concerns over possible destruction of evidence.
However, the court rejected the prosecution's request for a warrant to arrest the chief executive of Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd.
Two Samsung Electronics officials were also arrested on suspicion of destroying evidence earlier this month.
South Korea's financial watchdog in November accused the biotech arm of Samsung Group of breaking accounting rules ahead of its 2016 listing, sparking a criminal investigation.
Both Samsung Electronics and Samsung BioLogics were not immediately available for comment. 
The widening probe comes at an awkward time for Samsung Group, South Korea's top family-run conglomerate, as de facto head and heir Jay Y.Lee awaits a Supreme Court ruling on bribery charges and political pressure builds for greater transparency in its governance.
Samsung BioLogics had been touted as a new growth engine for Samsung Group amid a slowdown in the global smartphone market. Samsung Electronics is the second-biggest shareholder of BioLogics with a 31.5 percent stake.

Samsung Electronics had no comment on the case earlier, except that it was cooperating with prosecutors.

1682,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2019 11:20AM ET</span>",Maersk Shares Tank After CEO Talks to Analysts About Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Shares in the world’s biggest shipping company slumped on Friday after its chief executive officer started discussing the fallout of global trade tensions on his industry.
A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S fell almost 5% in Copenhagen trading, as CEO Soren Skou told analysts and reporters that 2019 will be the year of the trade war.
Maersk, which transports about a fifth of the world’s manufactured goods by sea, is struggling to cope with the threat that escalating trade tensions pose to its business. Skou, who arrived in the Danish capital from China on Friday morning to present first-quarter results, says that volumes on trans-Pacific trade between Asia and North America have already shown signs of decline.
Maersk estimates that global container trade grew just 1.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier. That compares with 3.6% for all of 2018.
Skou says that even if Trump reaches a deal with China, there’s no reason to believe that the global economy will be free of serious trade tensions.
Global Tensions
“It won’t be the end of the trade war,” Skou said. “Then we’ll just see the U.S. turning its attention toward Europe, where there is an unresolved issue with German automakers and other things.”
That means that 2019 “will be the year of the trade war, no matter what happens between the U.S. and China,” he said.
At the same time, Skou said it’s important to distinguish between real data and the content of a tweet sent by U.S. President Donald Trump.
“Something may seem very dangerous the first time it’s tweeted but then you find out: perhaps not,’’ Skou said. “We have realized that it’s not just what the president tweets that matters.”
“There are also consumers that purchase goods every day and their world view is more closely linked to how much money they have to spend and if they have a job, and not so much a question of whether the goods cost a tiny bit more or less,’’ Skou said.
“There are many people analyzing what’s going on,” he said. “We now also have three-quarters of a year worth of experience in what happens in such an environment.”
Real Data
The Maersk CEO also provided details of how businesses on the ground are reacting to the tariffs.
“What is happening at the moment is that U.S. importers are touring China and trying to pressure their suppliers to lower prices, so they eat their share of the tariffs,” Skou said. “On top of that, there’s some help from a depreciation in the Chinese currency. And then there are a lot of efforts to find similar products to import from other countries in Asia: like Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia.”
“And then finally, prices will have to go up a bit in the U.S., if this continues,” Skou said. “That may hurt demand. But if the U.S. economy continues to be strong and unemployment stays very low, then the impact will be relatively limited.”
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
""Escalating trade war puts container shippers at greatest risk. Volume growth faces severe slowdown in 2019 as rising trade tension coupled with Asia’s weak exports to the U.S. on top of stuttering European growth drive down demand. Our forecast of 1-2% container demand growth at best, is a result of tepid European volume expansion and rapidly deteriorating U.S. demand, the sole bright spot in 2018.""-- Rahul Kapoor and Chris Muckensturm, transportation analystsClick here to view the research
Maersk said on Friday that it had a good start to the year but warned that “considerable uncertainties” stemming from global trade tensions will probably hurt its business. New tariffs can potentially reduce expected growth in global container volumes by up to 1 percentage point, the company estimates.
Maersk, which also unveiled plans to buy back $1.5 billion in shares over a 15-month period, said it is sticking with its guidance for the full year despite “weaker macro numbers as well as the risk from trade tensions.” The company cited tougher fuel requirements designed to protect the environment as an additional challenge.
Friday’s report was Maersk’s first as a pure transport company, after it ended its conglomerate structure earlier this year. It’s using some of the proceeds from the sale of its oil exploration activities to finance the share buyback program. Maersk also said it will introduce a new dividend policy, with an annual payout ratio of 30%-50% of underlying net profit.
The company’s net interest-bearing debt fell to $12.6 billion at the end of the quarter from $15 billion three months earlier, helped by cash proceeds from the sale of shares in Total that it received in exchange for its oil activities.
Maersk said it may distribute more proceeds to shareholders after the $1.5 billion buyback is completed, but only if doing so doesn’t jeopardize its investment grade rating. It has a BBB grade at S&P and a Baa3 at Moody’s.

""In our opinion, Mrs. May's successor will likely take a harder stance on Brexit and would potentially resurrect the specter of a no-deal exit as a negotiating tool, although it remains to be seen if they would carry through with the threat,"" S&P said in a statement.
""We do not anticipate an easy end to the deadlock before the end of October, when the UK is due to leave the EU,"" the ratings agency added.

Despite a good start in the first quarter, rising external challenges may still destabilize the Chinese economy, the second largest in the world, Li said in a statement on a government website. 
While addressing a tax symposium, Li said although cuts in taxes and fees would reduce fiscal revenue, they would boost companies' investment and confidence, which would in turn create employment and maintain sustainable economic growth.
""Local governments have adequate conditions to overcome difficulties and strike a balance between tax breaks and fiscal balances,"" Li said.
Earlier this year, Li said China would cut taxes and fees for companies by nearly 2 trillion yuan ($290 billion) this year to boost slowing economic growth.
On Friday he said China's economy had been resilient so far and that ample policy tools were available for macroeconomic adjustments.

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - France's Total is seeking to sell part of its stake in Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan oilfield to raise up to $4 billion, four banking sources said.
Total holds a 16.8% stake in Kashagan, one of the world's largest oilfields with production of about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), and is seeking to sell around a third of its stake, according to the sources.
The company's entire stake has an estimated value of up to $9 billion, the sources said. 
The energy group has held talks with a Chinese national oil company about a stake sale in recent months but the sides were unable to agree on price, two sources said.
Total initially declined to comment but subsequently said it is not ""currently"" in talks with a Chinese company to sell a stake in Kashagan. ""Total has no ongoing sale process for its Kashagan stake,"" it added.
Kashagan, the world's biggest oil find in decades and the most expensive standalone oil project, took an estimated $50 billion and 13 years to develop before starting in 2016.
Total is not using any external bankers in the sale process, one of the sources said.
The sale would be a welcome cash boost for Total as it prepares to buy $8.8 billion of oil and gas assets in Africa from Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) should the U.S. group's acquisition of rival Anadarko go through.
Kashagan is operated by the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC) and the other partners in the field are Eni, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), KazMunayGas, Inpex and China National Petroleum Corp.
Kashagan, located in the Caspian sea, where temperatures throughout the year can drop below 30 Celsius and rise above 40 Celsius, is expected to produce 370,000-400,000 bpd early next month after undergoing maintenance.
Under Kazakh law, companies selling stakes in projects like Kashagan have to offer them to the Kazakh government first and can sell to third parties only if the government chooses not to buy.
Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry could not be reached for immediate comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britons could see a 6 billion pound ($7.6 billion) cut in energy bills over five years from 2021, saving the average household 40 pounds per year, under plans to curb what gas and electricity network firms can pay shareholders.
Regulator Ofgem, which introduced a price cap on standard energy bills in January after lawmakers said customers were being overcharged, is now targeting the operators whose network fees make up around a quarter of British household energy bills.
Energy firms are under intense scrutiny, with Britain's opposition Labour party last week announcing a plan to nationalize the sector if it comes into power. 
Ofgem said it plans to cut the amount network firms pay their shareholders, known as the ""cost of equity range"" by almost 50% for the next regulatory period starting in 2021.
The regulator said the package of measures it proposed could result in savings averaging 40 pounds per customer from 2021.
""Our proposals are on track to deliver a tough, fair settlement that strikes a better deal for consumers,"" Ofgem executive director for systems and networks Jonathan Brearley said as the regulator announced its plan on Friday.

Under Ofgem’s framework, energy network operators set out their plans for investment and how much they expect this to cost over the period. Ofgem sets the return the companies can make.
Fixed returns have prompted investors to scoop up network assets. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bought a 16.7 percent stake of the Scotia Gas Networks business from SSE for 621 million pounds in 2016.
Other investors in Britain's energy network include  National Grid  (LON:NG), Iberdrola's Scottish Power, Australian investment bank Macquarie and Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Group.
National Grid and SSE (LON:SSE) both said they were disappointed by the equity proposals.

Persisting concerns over the health of the world economy linked to trade tensions have hit global markets this week, with the MSCI All Country index in line for a more than 1% fall in its third week in the red. That will mark its longest losing streak since a rout in December.

U.S. manufacturing growth sputtered in May, data showed on Thursday, measuring its weakest pace of activity in nearly a decade, while new orders fell for the first time since August 2009.

1695,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",A No-Deal Brexit Is Back on Table: Five Things You Need to Know,"(Bloomberg) -- Theresa May has set out her exit date, firing the starting gun on the leadership race to replace her. Pro-Brexit hardliner Boris Johnson is the favorite and he’s made clear he’d be prepared to rip the U.K. out of the bloc without a deal.
But getting to no-deal isn’t that simple. Here’s what you need to know:
1. The Tories who choose next PM want no-deal
The next prime minister is going to be chosen by the 120,000 members of the Conservative Party. Members of Parliament whittle down the candidates to a final two and that shortlist goes to the activists to choose a winner. Two-thirds of those members want a no-deal Brexit, according to a recent poll by YouGov.
2. Parliament opposes no-deal
There’s a majority in Parliament against no-deal (the split was 160 vs 400 in a vote on March 27). But there’s not a clear mechanism to prevent it happening, according to the Institute for Government. A determined leader could find a way to bring about no-deal, though it might be constitutionally questionable and lawmakers could well find a way to prevent it.
3. No-deal could prompt a general election
One way Parliament could stop a no-deal is with a vote of no-confidence in the government. Remember the Conservatives don’t have a majority and so it wouldn’t take many Conservative MPs to take a stance to bring down the government. A Brexiteer hardliner as prime minister would be a divisive leader of the party -- making rebellions more likely.
4. A run at no-deal could end up with a second referendum
A leader set on a messy exit who didn’t want to run the risk of holding a general election could call a referendum instead. What would the question be? If May’s deal is dead and her successor doesn’t come up with a new one, then the question put to the people could be no-deal or remain.
5. No-deal probably isn’t sustainable
The European Union says that in a no-deal scenario it wouldn’t cut a trade deal with the U.K. until the bits that have proved most controversial -- the Irish border and the divorce bill -- are settled. That suggests that if the U.K. is unwilling to compromise on the contentious issue of the Irish border, the country would have to endure the shock of functioning without a trade deal with its biggest neighbor. Factories would close, jobs would be lost and consumers walloped. The EU expects the U.K. would soon come crawling back to the negotiating table."
1696,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 05:55AM ET</span>",Foreign investors hope India dials back policy shocks after Modi win,"By Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Foreign companies in India have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election victory for the political stability it brings, but now they need to see him soften a protectionist stance adopted in the past year.
Modi's pro-business image and India's youthful population have lured foreign investors, with U.S. firms such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) committing billions of dollars in investments and ramping up hiring.
India is also the biggest market by users for firms such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and its subsidiary, WhatsApp.
But from around 2017, critics say, the Hindu nationalist leader took a harder, protectionist line on sectors such as e-commerce and technology, crafting some policies that appeared to aim at whipping up patriotic fervor ahead of elections.
""I hope he's now back to wooing businesses,"" said Prasanto Roy, a technology policy analyst based in New Delhi, who advises global tech firms.
""Global firms remain deeply concerned about the lack of policy stability or predictability, this has sent a worrying message to global investors.""
India stuck to its policies despite protests and aggressive lobbying by the United States government, U.S.-India trade bodies and companies themselves.
SMALL HURDLES
Modi was set to hold talks on Friday to form a new cabinet after election panel data showed his Bharatiya Janata Party had won 302 of the 542 seats at stake and was leading in one more, up from the 282 it won in 2014.
After Modi's win, about a dozen officials of foreign companies in India and their advisers told Reuters they hoped he would ease his stance and dilute some of the policies. 
Other investors hope the government will avoid sudden policy changes on investment and regulation that catch them off guard and prove very costly, urging instead industry-wide consultation that permits time to prepare.
Protectionism concerns ""are small hurdles you have to go through"", however, said Prem Watsa, the chairman of Canadian diversified investment firm Fairfax Financial, which has investments of $5 billion in India. 
""There will be more business-friendly policies and more private enterprise coming into India,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
TECH, HEALTHCARE AND BEYOND 
Among the firms looking for more friendly steps are global payments companies that had benefited since 2016 from Modi's push for electronic payments instead of cash. 
Last year, however, firms such as Mastercard and Visa (NYSE:V) were asked to store more of their data in India, to allow ""unfettered supervisory access"", a change that prompted WhatsApp to delay plans for a payments service. 
Modi's government has also drafted a law to clamp similar stringent data norms on the entire sector.
But abrupt changes to rules on foreign investment in e-commerce stoked alarm at firms such as Amazon, which saw India operations disrupted briefly in February, and Walmart, just months after it invested $16 billion in India's Flipkart.
Policy changes also hurt foreign players in the $5-billion medical device industry, such as  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), following 2017 price caps on products such as heart stents and knee implants.
Modi's government said the move aimed to help poor patients and curb profiteering, but the U.S. government and lobby groups said it harmed innovation, profits and investment plans.
""If foreign companies see their future in this country on a long-term basis...they will have to look at the interests of the people,"" Ashwani Mahajan, an official of a nationalist group that pushed for some of the measures, told Reuters. 
That view was echoed this week by two policymakers who said government policies will focus on strengthening India's own companies, while providing foreign players with adequate opportunities for growth.

Such comments worry foreign executives who fear Modi is not about to change his protectionist stance in a hurry, with one offical of a U.S. tech firm saying, ""I'd rather be more worried than be optimistic.""

1697,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2019 05:00AM ET</span>",The Increasingly Futile Quest to Lobby Against Trump's Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Maroon came to Washington three times last year to plead for relief from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and he’s planning another trip next month -- even though he doesn’t have much hope.
Maroon doesn’t expect the administration to hold off imposing duties on $300 billion more in Chinese goods, a move that would hit products imported by Maroon’s company, which distributes specialty chemicals from its base in Ohio. With existing tariffs already costing the firm 10% of its business in lost sales, he has no choice but to make his case.
“It’s an effort in futility,” said Maroon, chief technology officer of Maroon Group LLC. “I want to be on the record, and it doesn’t hurt to try.”
U.S. trade associations and companies aren’t giving up the fight against the latest round of duties proposed by the president who calls himself “Tariff Man” as the world’s two-largest economies try to finalize a sweeping trade deal. They’re clinging to the hope -- however slim -- that the administration may spare their products, and eventually heed their warnings that the tariffs will hurt American companies and consumers.
“We’d be abdicating our responsibility if we didn’t participate, even though we do think it’s probably going to be somewhat frustrating,’’ said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. “We certainly want to help build the record that shows that this strategy is going to do a significant amount of harm.”
More Duties
Trump imposed duties on $250 billion Chinese goods last year to punish Beijing for what the U.S. sees as years of unfair trade practices. As talks faltered, he ordered this month a tariff increase to 25% from 10% on $200 billion of those products, causing businesses including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to warn of increased prices for consumers. Trump also threatened duties on an additional $300 billion in goods, including toys, mobile phones and laptops. If the president follows through, U.S. tariffs would cover essentially all imports from Asian nation.
Companies have until June 17 to file written comments on the duties, and public hearings are set to begin that day in Washington.
Before the three previous rounds of U.S. tariffs, almost 500 individuals testified over 11 days, and thousands of comments were filed -- most like Maroon supporting a deal with China but opposing duties as the means to reach one. Firms and trade groups formed coalitions such as Americans for Free Trade, holding events across the U.S. to highlight how companies and suffering from the tariffs and China’s retaliation.
But it’s getting harder to hide from Trump’s tariff assault. Companies that succeeded in getting products removed from the initial lists now face the reality of having those goods hit with duties in the next round.
Trump’s tariffs have already hit $15.4 billion in chemicals and plastics, and the latest round would affect an additional $13.2 billion, according to the American Chemistry Council. U.S. chemical exports to China declined because of retaliatory duties, nearly tripling the American trade deficit for chemicals, the group said.
“This very well could be a negotiating tactic, but it also could be an end in itself -- that tariffs will stay for a long time, so we have to make our case,’’ said Ed Brzytwa, the council’s director of international trade.
Made In China
The administration has promised exemptions if companies can show inputs or products can only be obtained in China, and aren’t “strategically important” to Chinese industrial programs, or the duties would cause “severe economic harm.” Trump has tweeted that companies won’t face a tariff if they make their goods “at home in the USA.”
But of the more than 13,750 requests for exclusions from the first two lists of tariffs filed last year, final decisions have been reported on only about two-thirds, with more than half of them denied, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office.
The USTR said it expects the window for submitting exclusion requests for the $200 billion list will open around June 30 and that it will get 60,000 product-exclusion requests.
Company executives say many of their products are only made in China, or that reshoring production to the U.S. isn’t possible. Maroon Group, which has about 225 employees, has put off a planned expansion of its sales force because it lost customers who can’t pay higher prices from the duties, Maroon said.
More than half of the latest list of products targeted for tariffs by import value are technology goods, and the Consumer Technology Association is urging its members to come out in force with hopes of swaying Republicans in Congress and others close to the president, said Sage Chandler, the group’s vice president of international trade.
“You can’t just give up,’’ Chandler said.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",Light PBOC touch makes once unlikely yuan at 7/$ seem possible,"By Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China's yuan slips to historically weak levels against the dollar, the central bank's atypical light touch is spurring speculation that policymakers want to be more judicious in their intervention and have no specific target for the currency.
The yuan has lost more than 2.5% against the dollar since the festering China-U.S. trade dispute took a turn for the worse with tariff increases early this month. It is now less than 0.1 yuan away from the 7-per-dollar level authorities have in the past indicated as a floor.
A weakening yuan risks sparking outflows, a major concern for policymakers keen to retain investor confidence in a slowing economy and acrimonious trade war with the United States.
But the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has done little to keep the yuan in check, beyond issuing yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong and setting the managed currency's daily mid-point consistently stronger than market expectations.
""My sense is that 7 is no longer so critical as in 2016. Policymakers are more confident,"" said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank in Singapore. ""It also depends on the cost of defending 7."" 
In 2015, a one-off 2% yuan devaluation fueled depreciation expectations, and Beijing burned through about $1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves to fight back.
In 2018, to hold the currency steady, the PBOC raised the cost of shorting the yuan by hiking reserve requirements on forwards. State-owned banks also used swaps and sold dollars to prop up the local unit.
Despite the trade war, it was not until this week that senior central bank officials launched a verbal campaign to remind the market that China can keep the yuan ""basically stable"" and draw on a toolbox of policies to manage fluctuations.
""Nothing has gone wrong, and (we) will not allow anything to go wrong,"" Liu Guoqiang, PBOC vice governor, told the Financial News, a newspaper run by the central bank.
The PBOC did not respond immediately to faxed questions from Reuters about its policy and tactics relating to yuan levels.

SUBTLE MESSAGE
To yuan watchers, the central bank's perfunctory actions and messaging suggest a higher degree of comfort with a weaker yuan, while the currency's stability against a basket of trade-weighted currencies is evidence it is not encouraging excess depreciation.
""The authorities are providing only the support needed to cap yuan weakness, rather than trying to strengthen the currency significantly,"" Lemon Zhang, a strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank wrote in a note.
A weaker yuan would theoretically help exporters, many of whom are feeling the pinch of U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars worth of made-in-China goods.
BofAML analysts Claudio Piron and Ronald Man reckon China will limit the yuan's weakness in the run-up to a G20 summit at the end of June, when U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping might meet.
If that meeting fails to produce a breakthrough easing trade tensions, ""it is clear that China has the capacity and need for yuan depreciation to dollar/yuan 7.13. Fiscal stimulus and monetary easing would be required to support China's economy,"" they said.
But analysts suspect the PBOC's strategy is not just about targeting yuan levels but also involves managing its currency reserves and a growing international role for the yuan. Those explain the central bank's reluctance to reduce its dollar reserves too quickly or drive up interest rates in the offshore yuan market in order to make it expensive to short-sell the currency.
""If the central bank chooses to intervene directly in the market, a decline in the reserves to $2.9 trillion from $3 trillion would trigger greater shock to market confidence,"" said Raymond Yeung, ANZ'S chief Greater China economist in Hong Kong.
Yeung says the PBOC ""is unwilling to see a huge gap between onshore and offshore yuan as that would affect international institutions' judgment of whether the yuan is capable as a reserve currency"".
The offshore yuan this week has been relatively weaker than the onshore one, but the PBOC's sale of its debt in Hong Kong, intended to drain offshore yuan supplies, has been small scale. 

As the central bank juggles multiple objectives, its injections of cash onshore, aimed at spurring lending in a slowing economy, have also been modest, in part to guard the exchange rate.

1699,By Investing.com,"<span>May 24, 2019 04:46AM ET</span>",StockBeat: A Pre-Election Bounce or an Apathetic Shrug?,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- As the world’s largest election in India ends, its second-largest one – to the European parliament - is just getting started. The first has had an enormous impact on local stock markets, but the second has hardly registered.
India’s Nifty 50 has rallied nearly 6% since mid-May, when the scale of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election victory became clear. Preliminary results point to an overall majority for his BJP party, creating a measure of political clarity that investors in Europe can only dream of.
By contrast, the Euro Stoxx 600 has largely ignored the EU elections, except in as much as they provide an insight into the strength and probability of a few individual tail risks to the region’s economy, such as Brexit and Italy’s budget dispute with the EU.
It’s up 0.7% this morning, recouping some of Thursday’s losses, while the U.K. FTSE 100 is up 0.7%% ahead of a three-day weekend, Germany’s Dax is up 0.9% and Italy’s FTSE MIB is leading the way with a 1.3% gain.
The Stoxx 600 has been much more at the mercy of the U.S.-China trade dispute, mainly because the EU lacks a common fiscal policy to react to such threats, and its central bank is perilously low on ammunition, having cut interest rates deep into negative territory. Minutes from the ECB’s last policy meeting, released Thursday, suggested its governing council is still deadlocked as to whether or not to relax policy further in the light of growing headwinds from the trade war.
In fairness, it is already reasonably clear that the parliament that will emerge from this weekend’s elections will be dominated by the same mainstream forces that have held control since direct elections began in the 1970s, albeit that mainstream is now divided into three blocs rather than two.
What is less clear is how much ground they will lose to parties that pose a real threat to conventional politics, and what conclusions can and should be drawn. Exit polls from the Netherlands, which voted on Thursday along with the soon-to-depart U.K., gave a surprising victory to the center-left Labor Party, while the combined populist forces of Thierry Baudet and Geert Wilders failed to add to the four seats won last time around by Wilders’ PVV.
If that pattern were to be replayed across Europe over the weekend – especially in Italy and France - there could be a considerable relief rally on Monday morning at the sight of populists failing to make further gains. However, it’s more likely that Dutch Labor owed its performance to personal factors: Dutch MEP Frans Timmermans is the center-left’s preferred candidate to take over as European Commission president."
